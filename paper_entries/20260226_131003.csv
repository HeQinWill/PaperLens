How cloud processing of organics occur on molecular level remains unclear. We found that compared with cloud free particles, organics in cloud contains more large molecules likely due to accretion reactions and has more nitrogen-containing compounds. We identify some new compounds formed in cloud. Such modifications of the organics in cloud can further change its physicochemical properties, and impact on climate and human health. 
 Aqueous secondary organic aerosol (aqSOA) contributes substantially to organic aerosol (OA), affecting air quality, human health, and climate. However, the molecular composition and processing of aqSOA in clouds remain unclear due to limited online field measurements. We measured molecular composition of OA online (time resolution 20 s) and tracked its processing at a mountain site in southeastern China, using an Extractive ElectroSpray Ionization inlet coupled with a Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (EESI-ToF-MS). We identified 2084 molecular formulas and compared OA composition from three sample types: cloud droplet residuals (CDR), interstitial aerosol particles (INT), and cloud-free aerosol particles (CF) in representative cloud episodes. CHO class was the dominant constituent, followed by CHON class. In most cloud episodes, the fraction of CHO was lower in CDR than that in INT and CF, while the fraction of CHON was higher, which may result from the uptake of organonitrates or nitration in cloud water. Compounds in CDR had more carbon number and higher molecular weight than CF, which is attributed to accretion reactions in cloud water. We identified 39 significantly enriched compounds in CDR compared with CF, which could be potentially used as aqSOA tracers formed via cloud processing. This study also reveals rapid changes in aqSOA composition, which highlight the necessity for high time resolution measurements to capture the processing of aqSOA in clouds. Overall, this study provides clear information on processing of aqSOA in clouds and highlights the importance of accretion reactions, which have implications on the composition and physicochemical properties of SOA."

Grange;Pascal Rubli;Andrea Fischer;Dominik Brunner;Christoph Hueglin;Lukas Emmenegger;Leonie Bernet,"The Zurich Low-cost CO2 sensor network (ZiCOS-L): data processing, performance assessment and analysis of spatial and temporal CO2 dynamics","ZiCOS-L is a network of low-cost sensors in Zurich (Switzerland) to monitor carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. After correcting for drift and checking the sensor performance, we found that local factors like traffic, public events and vegetation affect CO2 levels. Even though the sensors have higher uncertainties than other sensors, the lower cost allows for a denser network with detailed insights into CO2 levels across the city, helping cities track emissions and support climate action plans. 
 As part of the ICOS Cities project, a network of low-cost NDIR (non-dispersive infrared) CO2 sensors was set up across the city of Zurich (Switzerland), known as ZiCOS-L. The network consists of 56 sites with paired low-cost sensors spread out over the urban area of Zurich. This publication focuses on the period from August 2022 to July 2024. The sensors require in-field training for model calibration before deployment and further post-processing steps to account for drift and outliers. After data processing, the hourly mean root mean squared error (RMSE) was 13.6 ± 1.4 ppm and the mean bias 0.75 ± 1.67 ppm when validated against parallel reference measurements from the mid-cost sensor network ZiCOS-M. CO2 concentrations were highly variable with site means in Zurich ranging from 438 to 465 ppm. These differences can largely be explained by the nearby surroundings, with vegetation, traffic density and human activity being dominant factors while altitude and distance from the city centre had a minor effect. Vegetation (mainly grassland) amplified the morning concentration in summer by up to 20 ppm due to ecosystem respiration, while heavy traffic increased the morning rush hour concentration by 15 ppm. Human activity was shown to locally enhance CO2 concentrations during two public events. Despite its lower measurement accuracy, the ZiCOS-L network enables the study of concentration dynamics at a spatial and temporal scale that could only be achieved at much higher cost  with mid-cost or high-precision instrumentation. The observations generated by ZiCOS-L will be further used in ICOS Cities activities to validate CO2 emission inventories with inversion modelling systems."

Kamp;Xiaoyu Chen;Jhao-Hong Chen;Bingru Wang;Jing Li;Miquel A. Gonzalez-Meler;Jian Wang;Lu Xu,Chemical ionization mass spectrometry utilizing benzene cations for measurements of volatile organic compounds and nitric oxide,"We developed a new technique to measure air pollutants. This method can detect many gases, including volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxide released by plants and human activities. We tested it in two locations and found it agreed well with standard instruments, while offering improved performance. Our results show this approach can provide broad and sensitive monitoring of air quality and chemical processes in the atmosphere. 
 We evaluate the capability of chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) using benzene cations as reagent ions (benzene CIMS) for detecting atmospheric trace gases. We characterize the ionization pathways and product ion distributions for 27 analytes spanning diverse chemical classes. To interpret the complex ion chemistry involving two reagent ions (C6H6+ and (C6H6)2+) and multiple ionization pathways (charge transfer, proton transfer, adduct formation, and hydride abstraction), we introduce a thermodynamics-based framework that classifies analytes into three categories based on their ionization energy (IE), relative to those of benzene monomer (9.24 eV) and dimer (8.69 eV). Each class exhibits distinct ionization mechanisms and product ions. Analytes with IE smaller than 8.69 eV (low IE) undergo charge transfer with both reagent ions; analytes with IE between 8.69 and 9.24 eV (mid IE) undergo charge transfer with C6H6+ and potential adduct formation with (C6H6)2+; analytes with IE larger than 9.24 eV (high IE) could undergo adduct formation, proton transfer, or hydride abstraction. Analytes within each class also show similar sensitivity, enabling sensitivity estimation for compounds lacking calibration standards. In addition to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), benzene CIMS detects nitric oxide (NO) with a detection limit of 5 pptv for 1 min integration time, exceeding the performance of most commercial NOx analyzers. Field deployments in Chicago and St. Louis demonstrate good agreement with reference NO measurements. Isoprene measurements show good agreement with a co-located gas chromatography–photoionization detector (GC-PID) in St. Louis, but exhibit substantial positive bias in Chicago, likely due to interferences from anthropogenic VOCs in the polluted urban environment. These results highlight the potential of benzene CIMS for concurrent measurements of NO, VOCs, and their oxidation products using a single instrument, while also underscoring challenges in complex atmospheric conditions."

 As part of the new Fisheries Act, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) has made it a priority to disseminate its data publicly. The project proposed here is to create an open-access data product that includes most of the historical temperature and salinity profiles collected in Northwest Atlantic Ocean and its Arctic gateways. This project does not aim to replace a potential database, but rather provides an easily accessible and quality-controlled product that can inform fisheries management and support DFO priorities such as the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management, Marine Spatial Planning and the Blue Economy. The Canadian Atlantic Shelf Temperature-Salinity (CASTS) data product consists of 853 748 individual casts (as of 22 August 2025) collected in a geographical zone corresponding to [35–80° N] and [42–100° W] since 1873. The data sources used to make this product were gathered from multiple sources, including DFO regional archives at the Maurice-Lamontagne Institute (MLI), the Bedford Institute of Oceanography (BIO), and the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Center (NAFC). Other sources of data include the Fisheries and Marine Institute of Memorial University, data from international ships of opportunity archived by the Marine Environmental Data Services (MEDS), and the Polar Data Catalog. This data product also offers new opportunities to review the changes in the ocean climate of Atlantic Canada, another priority of the Government of Canada. The analysis of these data collected over more than a century also reveals the profound changes undergone by the Northwest (NW) Atlantic Ocean during that period. Climate highlights include large decadal fluctuations of temperature and salinity throughout the entire zone, as well as sustained warming trends on the Scotian Shelf and the Bay of Fundy since the early 1990s, coinciding with an important freshening on the Newfoundland and Labrador Shelf during the same period.

A deep learning model was developed for automatic detection, creating a dataset of over 3,200 signals. The results show that SWOT outperforms other satellites in data availability, accuracy, and spatial coverage, providing valuable data for oceanographic studies and environmental monitoring. 
 Internal waves (IW) play a crucial role in energy transfer and vertical mixing as key dynamical processes. The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite, with its high-resolution sea surface height (SSH) observations, provides new data source for internal wave detecting. This study develops a multi-region automatic internal wave recognition framework named SWOT_IWD and constructs a SWOT internal wave detection dataset (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17666852, Xi et al. (2025)) covering 13 internal wave-prone regions worldwide from 2023 to 2025. A total of 21,682 SWOT passes are downloaded and processed for internal wave detection across different regions, identifying 2,011 passes containing internal wave signals and detecting a total of 3,264 internal wave signals. The dataset consists of SWOT data and IW labels, and includes visualized internal wave detection result images. The validation results confirm that the average accuracy of the SWOT internal wave dataset is 91.21 %. The study analyzes the spatial distribution, activity frequency, and the relationship between internal waves and topographic coupling across 13 regions included in the dataset. We also conducted a quantitative comparison of three data sources: SWOT, Sentinel-1 C-SAR, and Sentinel-3 OLCI. The results indicated that the detection availability of internal waves using SWOT data reached as high as 29.78 %. The study demonstrates that this dataset can provide high-quality sample data to support internal wave detection based on deep learning. Furthermore, two cases were presented to illustrate the potential of this dataset for internal wave tracking using multi-source remote sensing data."

Collected to assess the accuracy of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite, these data will help scientists, decision-makers, and communities better study floods and coastal changes in estuaries, especially as the climate shifts and water levels rise. 
 This manuscript presents a comprehensive and evolving novel in situ dataset of water levels and wave parameters collected from March 2023 onward in the St. Lawrence Estuary and Saguenay Fjord (Quebec, Canada), supporting validation activities for the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission. The dataset integrates water level measurements from 18 barometrically-compensated pressure transducers and, where possible, corrected for water density using collocated salinity and temperature data, supplemented with 13 GNSS-Interferometric Reflectometry (GNSS-IR) sensors. All water level data are referenced to a common vertical datum via real-time kinematic (RTK) GNSS corrections. Three directional wave buoys provided supplementary observations of surface wave conditions, including bulk parameters and directional spectra. Quality-controlled and rigorous processing protocols were implemented across all sensor types, with particular attention to referencing accuracy and correction for environmental influences. The observational network has the densest spatial coverage of water level and wave measurements ever achieved in this region, offering unprecedented opportunities for validation of SWOT’s nadir and wide-swath altimetry products, as well as for hydrodynamic model calibration and spatio-temporal studies of tidal and wave processes in complex estuarine environments. With ongoing data collection, this evolving benchmark dataset is publicly accessible at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18225505 and will be periodically updated with new observations, to facilitate extended SWOT science validation and support a broad range of estuarine research applications."

We combined satellite imagery with advanced artificial intelligence to produce the first 10-meter annual cropland map for the region (2019–2024). Achieving over 92 % accuracy, our dataset reveals three to four times more farming on steep slopes than previously reported, providing a vital baseline for monitoring food security and deforestation risks. 
 Southeast Asia (SEA) contributes substantially to tropical agriculture, but remains underserved by high-precision cropland data due to persistent cloud cover, fragmented farming, prevalent shifting cultivation, and complex phenology. Here, we developed a 10-m annual cropland dataset for SEA (SEA_Cropland10) covering 2019–2024 using a random forest model on Google Earth Engine. The model integrated 88,088 Sentinel-1 SAR scenes, 599,255 Sentinel-2 optical images, and Google AlphaEarth embeddings, and was trained using 37,192 visually interpreted samples. An independent accuracy assessment was performed using 1,200 samples stratified by land-cover change trajectories to validate both temporal dynamics and spatial extent. SEA_Cropland10 achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 92.67 % (±1.47 %) for cropland dynamics, with annual static accuracies consistently exceeding 92.42 % (±1.50 %). The incorporation of AlphaEarth embeddings proved critical, improving model performance by 5.81 %. Compared to existing global products (e.g., GLAD, WorldCereal), SEA_Cropland10 improved OA by 14.56 %–19.97 % and substantially enhanced the detection of sloping cropland (>5°) in mountainous regions of SEA, increasing producer’s accuracy in global baselines from below 29.7 %–32.9 % to 89.0 %–99.1 %. Consequently, we identified three- to fourfold more sloping cropland area than GLAD and WorldCereal reported. Based on SEA_Cropland10, the estimated total cropland area in SEA shifted from 68.7 (±2.8) Mha in 2019 to 67.3 (±3.2) Mha in 2024, showing strong consistency with national statistics (r = 0.90–0.95). This dataset provides an important improvement for regional food security monitoring and carbon cycle modeling.

By developing a novel algorithm that harmonizes disparate observation schedules into a single temporal definition, we unlock a substantially larger fraction of the world's sub-daily reports. GLBD-FED offers a new ""global thermometer"" for the sectors that demand consistent, quality-controlled daily temperature information. 
 Large amounts of sub-daily temperature data are shared globally through the Global Telecommunication System (GTS) in near-real time and through international data exchanges. However, converting these data into a global daily temperature dataset with a uniform definition – especially for daily maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) temperatures – has proven challenging due to the independent observation schedules across the world. To address this issue, we developed a new method that decomposes sub-daily Tmax and Tmin records from the Integrated Surface Database (ISD) into finer intervals, subsequently reaggregating them into daily Tmax and Tmin based on prospective dateline. This new method increased the global daily Tmax and Tmin counts by 64 % and 45 %, respectively, compared to the original method, which relied on either two consecutive Tmax/Tmin records over 12 hours or a single Tmax/Tmin record over 24 hours. The Global Land Base Dataset-First Estimate Daily Data (GLBD-FED) was established for the period from 1981 to 2024, following corrections for misrecorded Tmax and Tmin and quality control. GLBD-FED includes daily maximum (Tmax), average (Tave), and minimum temperature (Tmin) from approximately 17,000 global sites, with daily data amounts reaching about 10,000 entries per day in the current decade. When compared to the Global Summary of the Day (GSOD) dataset, GLBD-FED exhibits more temperate performance over the last 40 years, showing a slightly lower daily Tmax (around -0.3 °C) and a higher daily Tmin (around +0.3 °C), with a nearly identical daily Tave (approximately +0.1 °C). GLBD-FED identifies records that could or almost could represent the highest or lowest temperature in the 24-hour period as daily Tmax or Tmin, while GSOD selects the highest or lowest records within the 24 hours. This variance in definitions, combined with different preferences for meteorological and airport report sources, contributes to these observed biases."

Johnson;Chaolun Li,Copepod Grazing and Prokaryotic Decomposition Amplify the Effect of Diatom-Dinoflagellate Regime Change on Biological Carbon Pump Efficiency,"Copepod fecal pellets (FPs) are an important but highly variable component of the global Biological Carbon Pump (BCP). This study decoupled and quantified how copepod grazing and prokaryotic activities affect BCP efficiency under different phytoplankton dietary regimes. With a diet of diatoms, copepod FP production rates double, FP sinking rates triple, and FP decomposition rates are significantly lower relative to those with dinoflagellate diets. When dinoflagellates are the primary producers, inefficient grazing and enhanced prokaryotic activity synergistically decrease the efficiency of FP exports to the deep ocean. This finding confirms previous observations. Opportunistic particle-attached (PA) prokaryotes are crucial for FP decomposition. Metagenomic analyses revealed that CAZymes and lysosomal enzyme abundances highly correlated with FP decomposition rates, representing important bioindicators of FP decomposition. These functional enzymes targeting phytoplankton- and copepod-intestine-derived macromolecules from the PA prokaryotic communities were key to FP decomposition. Genomic properties of the Planctomycetota revealed that strong motile ability, detoxification systems, and macromolecule degradation enzymes enabled the success of these opportunistic PA prokaryotes. Elevated temperatures amplified FP decomposition rates by enhancing enzyme abundances and especially accelerated the decomposition of FPs composed of dinoflagellates. This reduced BCP efficiency, as rapidly recycled organic materials remain in surface waters. Our findings highlight the synergistic biological activities amplifying the effects of phytoplankton composition changes on BCP efficiency. This underscores the importance of considering grazing regimes in combination with microbial dynamics in assessing ocean carbon cycling."

However, conventional rapid sand filters exhibit slow biological maturation for Mn(II) removal, limiting their performance in engineered Mn(II) removal. This study examined the effectiveness of partially replacing sand with natural manganese ore (NMO) to enhance Mn(II) removal and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that replacing only 1/8 of sand with NMO enabled consistently effective Mn(II) removal (residual <5 μg/L) from start-up through long-term operation, even under stressful conditions; its performance was comparable to columns packed with 100% NMO. In 1/8 NMO columns, early Mn(II) removal driven by MnOx-mediated chemical processes rapidly diminished, after which MnOx-enhanced biological processes promptly took over. Compared with sand columns, 1/8 NMO columns biologically matured nearly 100 days earlier, and biomass on the rough, porous MnOx surface was 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than that on sand. Although NMO partly altered microbial communities, the relative abundance of Mn(II)-oxidizing bacteria did not increase; the larger absolute biofilm biomass primarily drove sustained efficient Mn(II) removal. These findings highlighted the important but previously overlooked role of MnOx in promoting biofilm accumulation and accelerating the maturation of biological Mn(II) removal systems and provided a practical and cost-effective upgrade for conventional sand filtration."

The intricate composition of VOCs, especially the presence of H2O, frequently undermines the catalysts in the treatment systems. In this study, we have explored metastable catalysts that are regulated by different facets, which can activate H2O into active oxygen species required for the reaction. Surprisingly, the sample with the {101} facet exposed demonstrates superior performance compared to the sample with the high-energy {001} facet with H2O. In fact, the metastable structures constructed from diverse atomic arrangements are the key to breaking through this conventional understanding. Although the emergence of 18OCO18 indicates that all samples can achieve the H2O process, the Pt/TiO2-MS {101} sample, with its longer M–O bonds and more Pt–Ometa–Ti, exhibits lower H2O dissociation energy and stronger lattice oxygen mobility. In contrast, the high-energy facets and the increased Pt0 endow the Pt/TiO2-MS {001} sample with a stronger ability to activate O2. The distinct catalytic behaviors displayed by the metastable structures with different facets exposed offer fresh strategies for designing highly efficient catalysts."

Here, we report the first structurally distinct ZnSnGa ternary layered double hydroxide (ZnSnGa LDH), where Ga3+ serves as a framework cation rather than a dopant. This unique lattice configuration weakens Ga−OH bonds and enables light-driven hydroxyl reconstruction. The resulting detach−vacancy−replenishment cycle continuously generates surface hydroxyl vacancies, exposing unsaturated Ga sites that promote p−p orbital hybridization with O2. Consequently, O2 is selectively activated into singlet oxygen (1O2), while dissociative hydroxyls are oxidized into •OH. In situ spectroscopy, radical trapping, and density functional theory (DFT) reveal that 1O2 preferentially attacks benzylic C−H bonds to trigger ring opening, whereas •OH accelerates intermediate oxidation. This complementary ROS synergy enables nearly complete toluene degradation (≈100%) with 99.8% mineralization efficiency, high stability (10 cycles), and, critically for practical application, broad humidity tolerance (0−100% RH). Beyond VOC abatement, this work establishes light-driven hydroxyl reconstruction as an intrinsic property of the ternary LDH lattice, offering a generalizable defect-engineering strategy for selective ROS regulation. These findings broaden the LDH compositional space and provide a framework for next-generation photocatalysts for robust environmental remediation."

The results show that Pb isotopic ratios range from 1.166 to 1.204 for 206Pb/207Pb and from 2.446 to 2.525 for 208Pb/207Pb, with large variability. Moreover, distinct spatial heterogeneity in the isotopic compositions is observed, with a decreasing trend along the longitudinal gradient. Source apportionment demonstrate that Indian coal combustion represents the primary source of Pb in SETP glaciers, accounting for 75.5%, with the strongest influence occurring at glaciers situated at valleys. At the plateau scale, Pb derived from Indian coal combustion exerts the greatest impact on this region, with its contribution decreasing from 75.5% to 21.3% along the south-north transect."

Despite their bioaccumulative potential, their occurrence and possible biological impacts on marine megafauna remain understudied. We investigated LCM occurrence in Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) and finless porpoises (Neophocaena phocaenoides) collected from the South China Sea (2007–2021) and assessed their toxicity through in vitro assays using established dolphin cell lines. By employing robust source-tracing methodologies, we provide the first evidence that LCMs from household electronics and coastal e-waste accumulate in cetacean tissues, including blubber, muscle, and, critically, brain tissues, demonstrating blood–brain barrier penetration, a previously undocumented phenomenon of LCMs in mammalian wildlife. The temporal trend of LCM burden in porpoise blubber is correlated with shifts in global liquid crystal display production. Transcriptomic profiling revealed LCM-induced DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and impaired cell division in cetacean cells. These findings suggest that LCMs may pose potential risks to the nervous system and other organs of marine mammals, warranting further investigation into their toxicological effects and possible implications for human health. By bridging critical gaps among everyday electronics, LCM contamination, and marine conservation, this study highlights the need for urgent regulatory actions and improved e-waste governance to mitigate ecological and public health risks."

The Fenton process was identified in this study to enable Fe loading onto MPs in real textile wastewater, which may influence the geochemical cycling of arsenic (As) when entering the environment. Our results show that Fenton treatment can load Fe species onto various MPs with Fe content of 3318.8–4290.9 μg/g. The surface Fe species, primarily existing as amorphous Fe(OH)3 and FeOOH, are embedded within the surface layer of ∼8 μm and exhibit high stability. The MP-Fe composites exhibited strong adsorption affinity for both As(III) and As(V), with saturated adsorption capacities of 557.2–631.8 μg/g and 304.7–572.8 μg/g, respectively, representing 5.3–26.5-fold enhancement compared to pristine MPs. Synchrotron radiation-based X-ray fluorescence (SRXRF) revealed spatial consistency between Fe and As on the MP-Fe surface (R2 = 0.4938–0.8152), confirming that Fe species are critical for As adsorption. For As(III), the adsorption process is accompanied by oxidation, with the oxidation ratio reaching up to 84.1%. Temperature and pH exert a greater influence on PS-Fe and PA-Fe but have a limited effect on PLA, whereas NOM and P(V) affect all MP-Fe samples, which is mainly related to their interaction mechanisms."

Using a zebrafish model, we discovered that chronic exposure (80 days) to thermally aged bottle-derived PET MPs (retained for 7 days at 60 °C) at realistic concentrations (10 and 100 μg/L) caused substantial hepatic histopathological damage and steatosis, whereas pristine PET MPs stored at 25 °C did not. Integrative analyses suggested that thermal aging induced PET fragmentation, surface roughening, and enhancement of bioadhesion, intensifying gut MP retention (maximally 6.524 μg/g tissues), barrier integrity damage, and microbiota dysbiosis. Biochemical analyses, transcriptomics, and blocking experiments validated that intestinal homeostasis disruption stimulated lipopolysaccharide oversecretion and induced intestinal inflammation through activating the LPS/TLR4/NF-kB pathway, which further contributed to systemic and hepatic inflammations, insulin resistance, and de novo lipogenesis, culminating in steatosis. Intervention with Lactobacillus rhamnosus and sodium butyrate reduced MP-driven hepatic steatosis by restoring gut microbiota and barrier functions. Our findings clarified the mechanisms by which thermally aged PET exacerbated progression to steatosis through the gut-liver axis and proposed the intestine-targeted mitigation strategies against hepatic disorders, advocating concerns on long-term exposure risks of bottle-derived MPs under improper storage conditions."

The field has been marred by claims for unrealistic yields made by startup companies. Nevertheless, nickel agromining has become a viable business proposition for several companies now operating “metal farms” around the world. In this review, we provide a critical perspective on the current direction of the field and potential pitfalls still to overcome. Challenges and risks include the urgency for discovery of suitable metal crop species before extinction from habitat loss, the rapid domestication of wild species to be accommodated in regular cultivation systems, and the potential introduction and escape of non-native plant species. Initiatives to identify new hyperaccumulators using X-ray fluorescence scanning of herbarium collections should target the biodiversity hotspots of the world and should be coupled with ex situ conservation of threatened hyperaccumulator plant species in botanical gardens. With the rapid progress in the science needed to find and develop more effective hyperaccumulators, it is an exciting time for nickel agromining. The next few years are expected to be a make-or-break period in its transformation to a commercial reality."

Thermodenuder–Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (TD-AMS) thermograms revealed higher volatility for CH and CHO fragments (T50 ∼ 390–395 K) and greater thermal stability for nitrogen-containing CHON ions (T50 ∼ 410–415 K). Volatility basis set (VBS) distributions showed that CHON species dominated the composition of 1-day aged SOA (INDOH1) but were largely depleted in 5-day aged SOA (INDOH5), indicating extensive oxidative aging associated with ring-opening reactions and the loss of nitrogen-containing functional groups, as reflected in the degradation of aromatic species (AImod > 0.67) and reduced π-conjugation. Additionally, INDOH1 exhibited stronger light absorption than INDOH5, demonstrating significant photobleaching. The evaporation due to heating affected the complex refractive index (RI); the imaginary part (k) increased from 0.014 to 0.09 in INDOH1, while it remained below 0.06 in INDOH5. The absorption enhancement with heating is attributed to the preferential evaporation of weakly absorbing, nonaromatic compounds, enriching the particle phase in thermally stable, π-conjugated CHON species. These results establish a direct link between the volatility, chemical evolution, and optical properties of indole SOA."

The arithmetic mean concentration of bisphenol A (BPA) decreased approximately by 50% from 2012–13 to 2020–21, while the bisphenol S (BPS) concentration doubled, indicating a gradual substitution of BPA with BPS in production and usage patterns.

In contrast, concentrations of the predominant parabens─methylparaben, ethylparaben, and propylparaben (PrP)─remained relatively stable over the past decade, reflecting their continued uses. TCS and TCC concentrations were generally higher in adults, whereas paraben concentrations were consistently higher in children.

Here, this study integrated 13-month performance monitoring with multiomics analyses to characterize spatial heterogeneity and recovery patterns following a dissolved oxygen (DO) shock in a full-scale plug-flow PN/A system. During stable operation, the system achieved a total nitrogen removal efficiency of 84.5 ± 4.8%, with the upstream zone accounting for 61.3 ± 10.1% of total removal. Along the decreasing nutrient gradient, community composition shifted markedly, and metatranscriptomes indicated spatially differentiated nitrogen-cycling transcription, with anammox-related transcripts enriched upstream. A 3-day DO shock (>0.5 mg/L) reduced the nitrogen removal rate (NRR) from 0.16 ± 0.03 to 0.07 ± 0.04 kg N/(m3·d). Although NRR recovered to baseline within three months, community structure and total bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies did not return to preshock levels, indicating a decoupling between microbiome and functional recovery. Across zones, higher bacterial diversity and nitrogen cycling functional redundancy were positively associated with faster recovery trends, and upstream microbiome stability was most representable of whole-system resilience. These findings provide measurable ecological indicators and an upstream-focused control target to strengthen full-scale PN/A operation under dynamic aeration disturbances."

Due in part to the experimental challenge of in situ characterization, these physicochemical properties remain incompletely understood. Here, an aerosol fluorescent labeling methodology in conjunction with a fluorescence aerosol flow tube (F-AFT) was used for direct, in situ physicochemical characterization of α-pinene and toluene SOA. The wavelength of maximum emission λmax of the fluorescent probe Prodan was shown to depend on the hygroscopicity, degree of oxidation, and relative humidity (RH)-dependent phase transitions of the SOA. At varying RH, λmax was linearly correlated with % water content with an R2 value of 0.95. For fixed RH and varying SOA oxidation degree, λmax was linearly correlated with the oxygen-to-carbon ratio (O:C) with an R2 value of 0.95. Finally, the λmax values measured from mixed organic/inorganic particles indicated that ammonium sulfate seeded toluene SOA exhibited liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) at 80% RH and below while remaining homogeneous at 90% RH. Overall, this study demonstrates the power and versatility of this approach for direct, online analysis of a range of physicochemical properties in SOA."

However, the environmental relevance of additional FTEO homologues and analogues remains rarely investigated. Through a combination of suspect screening and homologue-based nontargeted analysis, we identified a total of 60 FTEO homologues and 30 perfluoroalkyl ether ethoxylate (PFAEE) homologues in commercial antifog products. They included homologue groups of 4:2 FTEOs (n = 16), 6:2 FTEOs (n = 17), 8:2 FTEOs (n = 12), 10:2 FTEOs (n = 8), 12:2 FTEOs (n = 7), perfluorobutyl ether ethoxylates (n = 15), and perfluorohexyl ether ethoxylates (n = 15).

Among each homologue group, the composition profiles of individual homologues with different numbers of repeated ethoxy units resembled between antifog products and house dust. A toxicological priority index (ToxPi) approach revealed the highest risk of 6:2 FTEOs among all of the identified FTEOs and PFAEEs, although the risks from other groups should not be overlooked. Collectively, our work reveals the complexity of diverse FTEO homologues and reports the presence of PFAEEs for the first time in indoor environments, raising the need for further investigating their sources, environmental distribution, and potential human exposure."

Here, we combined a field survey of 43 paired soil-cast samples across three agricultural land-use scenarios with complementary laboratory soil column experiments to elucidate earthworm-driven MP dynamics. The field survey revealed ubiquitous in situ MP occurrence and upward fluxes from bulk soils to casts, with transport efficiency modulated by soil clay and organic carbon contents. Laboratory simulations using epigeic and anecic species validated that different ecotypes actively ingest MPs from source soils and deposit them in surface casts. Crucially, both field and laboratory data demonstrated a significant reduction in particle size in casts compared to soil (6.48% and 19.8%, respectively), supporting the potential earthworm effects on MP mechanical attrition. Polymer compositions in casts mirrored those in soils, exhibiting a nonselective and passive ingestion pathway. Beyond physical transport, the formation of field biogenic polymer aggregates facilitated chemical aging of MPs, as evidenced by elevated oxidation indices. This process was likely accelerated by the enrichment of plastic-degrading microbial taxa (e.g., Flavobacterium) within casts, which exhibited up to a 35.6-fold increase in relative abundance. Collectively, these findings highlight the dual role of soil-engineering invertebrates in driving the vertical redistribution and physicochemical degradation of MPs in agricultural systems."

These changes are mainly driven by human‐caused increases in atmospheric levels of CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ and other well‐mixed greenhouse gases. Key features of this fingerprint are warming of the troposphere, the lowest layer of the atmosphere, and cooling of the stratosphere, the layer above the troposphere. Cooling in the lower stratosphere (from roughly 15–20 km above Earth's surface) also arises from human‐caused depletion of stratospheric ozone. While lower stratospheric cooling diminished in the 21st century, largely due to the emerging “healing” of stratospheric ozone levels after the Montreal Protocol, strong cooling of the mid‐ to upper stratosphere continued unabated. Satellite observations of this distinctive fingerprint are in accord with current state‐of‐the‐art climate model estimates of human‐caused temperature changes.

The diurnal pulse (DP), a daily‐scale expansion of TC upper‐level cold clouds, effectively captures the spatiotemporal evolution of TC convection and is tightly linked to TC intensity changes, particularly rapid intensification (RI). By incorporating the DP as a temporal evolution signal, AI models achieved significantly improved prediction skill for TC intensification rates and RI probabilities, outperforming those using only conventional instantaneous convective indicators. Permutation tests further confirm that the DP predictors contribute more pronouncedly to forecast skill than instantaneous convective proxies.

Prairie and humid forest regions exhibit comparatively muted change. Attribution analysis shows that atmospheric dryness is the dominant control, while antecedent temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture indirectly shape wildfire risk through vegetation and fuel continuity at different lag times.

We examine two reanalyses to assess the extent to which column‐integrated radiative cooling balances convective heating (“bulk RCE”) in the tropics and at higher latitudes. Our analysis shows that bulk RCE is a reasonable approximation of the tropics over ocean, but not land. Surprisingly, bulk RCE is often a reasonable approximation in mid‐latitudes, especially over land. These findings are explained by a simple argument. Over land, the ground heat flux is small, and bulk RCE arises when the top‐of‐atmosphere net radiative flux is small, which occurs in mid‐latitudes. Over ocean, the same mechanism applies but the ocean heat flux can be substantial and causes deviations relative to land. We conclude that bulk RCE is a surprisingly useful approximation of mid‐latitude land climate, which permits the development of simple theory for land climate, more broadly."

Our results show that global desert area exhibited a declining trend during 1985–2024, at a rate of −2.27 × 104 km2 yr−1, largely driven by decreases in Australia, East Asia, Central Asia, and South Africa. Desert area variations reflect the balance among water supply, soil moisture, and atmospheric demand.

However, the timing and associated mechanisms of red clay to loess‐paleosol shift remain debated. Here we present new magnetostratigraphic and environmental magnetic results from the Baode section, northeastern CLP. Magnetostratigraphic result demonstrates that this section spans from the upper Gilbert to lower Matuyama Chrons (3.6–2.0 Ma). Red clay shifted to loess‐paleosol sequence at ∼2.7 Ma, synchronous with the intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation (iNHG). Rock magnetic data indicate dominance of fine pedogenic magnetic grains, with higher concentrations in red clay. The continuous magnetic susceptibility record suggests decreases in pedogenic magnetic population and precipitation at ∼2.7 Ma. We propose that ice‐sheet expansion across the iNHG, coupled with declining CO2, triggered the onset of loess‐paleosol accumulation on the CLP by suppressing Asian summer monsoon while enhancing winter monsoon circulation and inland aridity."

We present the first continent‐scale, sub‐daily analysis of solar resource variability using Himawari‐8/9 satellite data for Australia's renewable energy zones. We apply metrics capturing average irradiance, persistence, and spatial synchrony of cloudy conditions. Southern Australia experiences persistent low irradiance events in the winter but show limited seasonality in cloud cover. Convectively driven short events occur in the north, and inland regions are generally more resilient than coastal zones. Midday is consistently the clearest period, but correlations across southeastern zones increase the risk of simultaneous generation deficits. These results highlight the importance of accounting for both local variability and inter‐regional connectivity, providing a framework to better leverage Australia's solar resources, enhance system reliability, and support solar PV integration into a decarbonized power system."

Meanwhile, rapid Arctic Sea ice loss due to Arctic amplification has emerged as a crucial driver of extreme weather and climate events. However, its specific contribution to Eurasian synchronous heatwaves remains poorly understood. Using climate networks, atmospheric dynamic diagnostics, and numerical experiments, we revealed an interdecadal increase in the interannual relationship between Barents Sea ice and Europe‐East Asian synchronous heatwaves after 2000. During 2000–2022, the persistent sea ice loss in the northern Barents Sea from late spring to summer, combined with strong land‐atmosphere feedback over northwestern Europe, triggers and sustains a northwestern European anticyclone. This anticyclone disturbance, positioned north of the Eurasian subtropical jet, excites a northwest‐southeastward propagating Rossby wave train in summer. Thus, another anticyclone is induced in the north of Tibetan Plateau. Together, these two anticyclones provide favorable atmospheric conditions for the occurrence of Europe‐East Asian synchronous heatwaves. During 1979–1999, however, sea ice anomalies were primarily confined to the southern Barents Sea. The associated feedback processes and atmospheric circulation anomalies are too weak to excite and sustain a northwestern European anticyclone, thereby limiting the occurrence of such synchronous heatwaves in summer. These findings highlight the growing influence of Arctic Sea ice loss on midlatitude summer extremes and offer new insights into the mechanisms behind Europe‐East Asian synchronous heatwaves in a warming climate."

This precipitation event is directly driven by a tropospheric cyclone and a downstream anticyclone, which jointly transport warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico into the eastern U.S. Through a series of WRF experiments, we indicate that a nudged run (NOBS), in which the stratospheric circulation is nudged toward the observed evolution represented by the ERA5 reanalysis data set, successfully captures the evolution of the tropospheric cyclone and anticyclone, whereas a parallel run (NCLM) nudged toward the ERA5 winter climatology fails to capture them. The NOBS run accurately simulates the sub‐vortex over North America, which facilitates the southward invasion of cold air. Moreover, in the NOBS experiment, the well‐captured stratospheric sub‐vortex enhances downward coupling through the phase‐locking mechanism, directly promoting the development of the tropospheric cyclone and indirectly influencing the downstream anticyclone. Our results indicate that the stratospheric anomalies contribute to approximately 37% of the total precipitation during the event. This finding underscores the importance of the sub‐vortex's geometry in the lowermost stratosphere for driving this precipitation event and highlights the need to focus on polar vortex geometry to fully understand regional stratosphere‐troposphere coupling."

We simulate flooding from over 2,800 synthetic TCs impacting five HUC6 watersheds in eastern North and South Carolina under historical and future (SSP5‐8.5) conditions using climatologically consistent data derived from physics‐based numerical models. Projected future TCs in our data set exhibit slower translation speeds and produce higher rainfall rates, driving substantial increases in flood extent and depth despite a slight decrease in average wind speeds and storm surge. The 1% annual flood hazard grows by 36%, with the contribution of compound flooding nearly doubling from 12% to 25%. When sea level rise is included, coastal and compound flooding expand further inland and upriver. Importantly, we show that inundation is underestimated when runoff and coastal flood hazards are modeled in isolation. Additionally, we find that the joint‐probability of the peak or average boundary conditions for a storm does not equal the probability of the overland flood extent at the HUC6 scale. By leveraging a probabilistic framework, our results highlight that using process‐based models to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of flooding is essential for accurate watershed‐scale TC flood hazard assessment. These findings underscore the growing importance of compound flooding under climate change and sea level rise and provide a foundation for improved risk‐informed planning, infrastructure design, and adaptation to future hazards in coastal areas."

 Is it feasible to alter the ground-state properties of a material by engineering its electromagnetic environment? Inspired by theoretical predictions1–12, experimental realizations of such cavity-controlled properties without optical excitation are beginning to emerge13–19. Here we devised and implemented a new platform to realize cavity-altered materials. Single crystals of hyperbolic van der Waals (vdW) compounds provide a resonant electromagnetic environment with enhanced density of photonic states and prominent mode confinement20–24. We interfaced hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with the molecular superconductor κ-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu[N(CN)2]Br (κ-ET). The frequencies of infrared hyperbolic modes (HMs) of hBN (refs. 25,26) match the infrared-active carbon–carbon (C=C) stretching molecular resonance of κ-ET implicated in superconductivity27. Nano-optical data supported by first-principles molecular Langevin dynamics simulations confirm the presence of resonant coupling between the hBN hyperbolic cavity modes and the C=C stretching mode in κ-ET. Meissner-effect measurements using magnetic force microscopy (MFM) demonstrate a strong suppression of superfluid density near the hBN/κ-ET interface. Non-resonant control heterostructures, including RuCl3/κ-ET and hBN/Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x (BSCCO), do not show the pronounced superfluid suppression. These observations suggest that hBN/κ-ET realizes a cavity-altered superconducting ground state.

 A powerful approach to understand the computations carried out by the visual cortex is to build models that predict neural responses to any arbitrary image. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as the leading predictive models1,2, yet their underlying computations remain buried beneath millions of parameters. Here we challenge the need for models at this scale by seeking predictive and parsimonious DNN models of the primate visual cortex. We first built a highly predictive DNN model of neural responses in macaque visual area V4 by alternating data collection and model training in adaptive closed-loop experiments. We then compressed this large, black-box DNN model, which comprised 60 million parameters, to identify compact models with 5,000 times fewer parameters yet comparable accuracy. This dramatic compression enabled us to investigate the inner workings of the compact models. We discovered a salient computational motif: compact models share similar filters in early processing, but individual models then specialize their feature selectivity by ‘consolidating’ this shared high-dimensional representation in distinct ways. We examined this consolidation step in a dot-detecting model neuron, revealing a computational mechanism that leads to a testable circuit hypothesis for dot-selective V4 neurons. Beyond V4, we found strong model compression for macaque visual areas V1 and IT (inferior temporal cortex), revealing a general computational principle of the visual cortex. Overall, our work challenges the notion that large DNNs are necessary to predict individual neurons and establishes a modelling framework that balances prediction and parsimony. Parsimonious deep neural network models can be used for prediction of visual neuron responses."

 Cellular solids ubiquitously exist in natural systems and are crucial for living organisms1,2. Their unique smooth branch and node morphologies are often seen as adaptations for enhanced mechanical performance3,4. Exploring alternative evolutionary functions can enrich the understanding of cellular solids, but it is frequently neglected. Here we show that the biomineralized cellular solids in echinoderm stereom (for example, sea urchin spine) have unexpected mechanoelectrical perception with response potential and response time, both of which are one to three orders of magnitude greater than those of echinoderm vision5. This exceptional perception originates from the gradient cellular solids (with varying void- or solid-phase diameters) along the [001] spine axis, generating a differential charge density across the stereom surface during liquid flow. Inspired by this natural wisdom, we create artificial spine-like structures using three-dimensional printing technology that exhibit three-fold higher voltage output and eight-fold greater amplitude differential than gradient-free samples, as well as a nature-inspired metamaterial mechanoreceptor capable of time-resolved self-monitoring information underwater. Our findings advance the understanding of load-sensitive biomimetic cellular solids (such as wood, sponge and trabecular bone), with the potential to develop functional gradient cellular materials towards underwater spatiotemporal sensing and water resource utilization.

 From mammals to bacteria, the direct recognition and cleavage of viral nucleic acids is a potent defence strategy against viral infection, but it requires mechanisms for distinguishing self from non-self1,2. In bacteria, CRISPR–Cas and restriction-modification systems achieve this discrimination by recognizing specific DNA sequences or DNA modifications, respectively. Alternative mechanisms probably remain to be discovered. Here, we characterize SNIPE, an anti-bacteriophage defence system that constitutively localizes to the bacterial cell membrane in Escherichia coli to block phage λ infection. Using radiolabelled phage DNA and time-lapse microscopy to track phage genomes, we demonstrate that SNIPE directly cleaves phage DNA during genome injection. Based on proximity labelling, we find that SNIPE associates with host proteins essential for λ genome entry and with the λ tape measure protein, which facilitates λ genome injection across the inner membrane. SNIPE also defends against diverse siphoviruses, probably through direct interactions with their tape measure proteins. Our findings establish SNIPE as a widespread bacterial defence system that exploits the spatial organization of phage genome injection to specifically target viral DNA, representing a previously unknown strategy for distinguishing self from non-self in prokaryotic immune systems.

 Vectorization of teaching signals is a key element of almost all modern machine learning algorithms, including backpropagation, target propagation and reinforcement learning. Vectorization allows a scalable and computationally efficient solution to the credit assignment problem by tailoring instructive signals to individual neurons. Recent theoretical models have suggested that neural circuits could implement single-phase vectorized learning at the cellular level by processing feedforward and feedback information streams in separate dendritic compartments1–5. This presents a compelling, but untested, hypothesis for how cortical circuits could solve credit assignment in the brain. Here we used a neurofeedback brain–computer interface task with an experimenter-defined reward function to test for vectorized instructive signals in dendrites. We trained mice to modulate the activity of two spatially intermingled populations (four or five neurons each) of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the retrosplenial cortex to rotate a visual grating towards a target orientation while we recorded GCaMP activity from somas and corresponding distal apical dendrites. We observed that the relative magnitudes of somatic and dendritic signals could be predicted using the activity of the surrounding network and contained information about task-related variables that could serve as instructive signals, including reward and error. The signs of these putative teaching signals depended on the causal role of individual neurons in the task and predicted changes in overall activity over the course of learning. Furthermore, targeted optogenetic perturbation of these signals disrupted learning. These results demonstrate a vectorized instructive signal in the brain, implemented via semi-independent computation in cortical dendrites, unveiling a potential mechanism for solving credit assignment in the brain. Mice learning a neurofeedback brain–computer interface task show neuron-specific teaching signals in cortical dendrites, consistent with a vectorized solution for credit assignment in the brain."

 Atopic diseases associated with allergens, as well as allergic diseases, frequently arise early in life; however, the age-dependent mechanisms governing immune responses to allergens remain poorly understood1. Here we find that in early life, exposure to common allergens triggers a distinct bifurcated immune response, simultaneously triggering type 17 inflammation in the skin and initiating canonical T helper 2 sensitization in the lymph nodes. This early-life γδ type 17-mediated dermatitis primes the exaggerated allergic lung inflammation upon secondary allergen exposure. Mechanistically, we find dendritic cell (DC)-mediated type 17 activation directly in the skin without requiring migration to lymph nodes; we term this state ‘peripheral immune inducer’ (pii) DC. CD301b+ conventional type 2 DCs acquire allergen, adopt the pii-DC state, produce IL-23 and activate local γδ type 17 cells independently of lymph-node engagement. The pii-DC state is enabled by the immature hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and physiologically low systemic glucocorticoids characteristic of early life2,3; DC-specific deletion of the glucocorticoid receptor recapitulates the pii-DC phenotype. These findings define a developmental checkpoint, set by neuroendocrine maturation, that enables in situ DC activation and immune induction, thereby shaping age-dependent responses to allergens.

 Achieving pancreatic-targeted delivery marks a breakthrough in treating pancreatic diseases, yet precise delivery remains challenging1. Here we identify an explicit and universal principle for pancreatic-selective delivery and propose a pancreatic-targeted lipid nanoparticle (AH-LNP) for mRNA delivery. AH-LNP exhibits size enlargement after assembly with proteins, facilitating capsule-filter-mediated pancreas-selective accumulation and receptor-mediated endocytosis, thereby boosting the pancreatic-targeted ability. Benefiting from this, AH-LNP enables precise and efficient genome editing in the pancreas through the delivery of Cas9 mRNA and single guide RNA (sgRNA), exhibiting promising potential in the treatment of autoimmune pancreatic diseases. Furthermore, pancreatic-targeted delivery of mRNA encoding therapeutic cytokines through AH-LNP demonstrates superior antitumour efficacy when combined with a cancer vaccine or chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy in multiple pancreatic cancer models. The safety and pancreatic mRNA delivery of AH-LNP were verified in multiple animal models, including non-human primates, demonstrating great promise for clinical translation. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of this pancreatic-targeted mechanism and the derived LNP platform, opening avenues for developing precision therapeutics against diverse pancreatic diseases.

 Squeaking is a constant companion in various aspects of our daily lives, whether we slide rubber-soled shoes across hardwood floors1, scrape chalk on a blackboard2, engage the brakes on a bicycle3 or walk with a hip replacement4,5. When two rigid bodies slide over each other, squeaking is widely understood to result from self-excited stick–slip oscillations, triggered by a decrease in the friction coefficient with increasing slip velocity6–10. However, sliding of extended interfaces can involve crack or slip-pulse propagation11–21. This distinction is amplified when a soft body slides on a rigid one, in which large deformations and material mismatch can cause detachment by opening slip pulses22–27. Previous studies focused mainly on slow sliding17,26,28–34, in which pulses are slow and squeaking is absent. Although squeaking at soft–rigid interfaces has been linked to stick–slip oscillations35–37, the mechanisms remain unclear. Here we experimentally investigate soft–rigid interfaces sliding at velocities that produce squeaking. High-speed imaging and acoustic analysis show that opening pulses propagate at approximately the shear wave speed of the soft material, mediating local slip across diverse materials. In flat samples, these pulses are irregular and generate broadband acoustic emissions. Introducing thin surface ridges confines pulse propagation, yielding a consistent repetition frequency matching the first shear mode of the sliding block and squeaking at that frequency. These findings show a structure-driven mechanism that stabilizes rupture in bimaterial friction. Geometric confinement suppresses competing modes, transforming irregular two-dimensional dynamics into coherent one-dimensional pulse trains, offering new insights into frictional rupture from engineered surfaces to geological faults. High-speed imaging reveals that the squeak of soft–rigid frictional interfaces, like sneakers sliding on a basketball court, arises from intersonic opening slip pulses—analogous to earthquake ruptures—that thin ridges on the rubber confine to repeat at a musical frequency."

 Biological machines use targeted deformations that can be actuated by Brownian fluctuations.

Furthermore, systems that are able to change their conformation by thermal fluctuations do so uncontrollably4,5 or require external control6.

 Multicellularity evolved independently multiple times in eukaryotes1–4. Two distinct mechanisms underpin multicellularity5: clonality (serial cell division without sister-cell separation) and aggregation (whereby independent cells assemble into a multicellular entity). Clonal and aggregative multicellularity are traditionally considered to be mutually exclusive1,6–8, with rare exceptions9, and evolutionary hypotheses have addressed why multicellularity might diverge towards one or the other extreme3,4. Both animals and their sister group, the choanoflagellates, are currently known to acquire multicellularity only clonally4,10,11. Here we show that the choanoflagellate Choanoeca flexa12 forms motile and contractile cell monolayers (sheets) through multiple mechanisms—C. flexa sheets can form purely clonally, purely aggregatively or through a combination of both processes. We characterize the life history of C. flexa in its natural environment—ephemeral splash pools on the island of Curaçao—and show that C. flexa undergoes reversible transitions between unicellularity and multicellularity during evaporation–refilling cycles. Different splash pools house genetically distinct strains of C. flexa and kin recognition constrains aggregation between them. We show that clonal-aggregative multicellularity is a versatile strategy for the robust establishment of multicellularity in this variable and fast-fluctuating environment. Our findings challenge former generalizations about choanoflagellates and expand the option space of choanozoan multicellularity.

 Antimicrobial drug resistance poses a global health challenge that necessitates the identification of new druggable targets1–3. The essential lipid II flippase MurJ is a promising yet underexplored antimicrobial target in bacterial cell wall biosynthesis4–7. The only known inhibitors of Gram-negative (diderm) MurJ are the single-gene lysis proteins (Sgls) from the lytic single-strand RNA phages M (SglM) and PP7 (SglPP7)8,9. SglM and SglPP7 have distinct evolutionary origins and share no sequence similarity. Here we describe a common mechanism of MurJ inhibition by these phage-encoded Sgls. We determined the structures of MurJ-bound SglM and SglPP7 and discovered a third distinct MurJ-targeting Sgl from the predicted phage Changjiang3 (SglCJ3) that we also characterized structurally. Our findings demonstrate that all three Sgls evolved convergently to trap MurJ in a periplasm-open conformation through a common MurJ interface, revealing a pathway for drug design.

 Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-natural killer (NK) cell therapies hold promise for solid tumours but remain limited because of poor tumour infiltration, persistence and resistance in the tumour microenvironment1–4. Here, to identify gain-of-function targets that enhance CAR-NK cell efficacy, we performed an unbiased in vivo CRISPR activation screen followed by a barcoded targeted in vivo open reading frame screen in primary human CAR-NK cells. We identified and comprehensively validated OR7A10, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), as the top candidate. Engineering CAR-NK cells with OR7A10 cDNA (a CRISPR-independent method with a simple manufacturing strategy) enhanced their proliferation, activation, degranulation, cytokine production, death ligand expression, chemokine receptor expression, cytotoxicity, persistence, metabolic fitness and tumour microenvironment resistance. Moreover, exhaustion in primary human NK cells derived from multiple peripheral blood and cord blood donors was reduced. OR7A10 gain-of-function CAR-NK cells displayed strong in vivo efficacy across multiple solid tumour models. For example, 100% complete response with long-term tumour control and survival benefit in an orthotopic breast cancer mouse model were achieved. These findings establish OR7A10-engineered CAR-NK cells as a highly potent and scalable off-the-shelf therapeutic for solid tumours.

 Oncogenes such as KRAS display marked tissue specificity in their oncogenic potential, genetic interactions and phenotypic effects, but the underlying determinants remain largely unresolved1–5. Here, to address these questions, we developed the Mouse Cancer Cell line Atlas, a broad-utility resource of 590 comprehensively characterized models across a wide range of entities (
              www.mcca.tum.de
              
            ). Comparative and functional studies using this platform, human cohorts and mice identified core principles underlying tissue-specific evolution of KRAS-initiated cancers. First, we show that mutant KRAS dosage gain through allelic imbalance exerts cell-type-specific effects, defining its timing across entities, as exemplified by dosage-sensitive developmental reprogramming during pancreatic cancer initiation. Second, we highlight how tissue- and stage-specific evolutionary requirements, such as block of differentiation in the intestine, select for KRAS-collaborating alterations. Third, we identified context-dependent epistatic KRAS–tumour suppressor interactions and show that reciprocal dosage sensitivities dictate the entity-specific patterns of cancer gene alterations, explaining their frequency, zygosity and acquisition chronology. These findings highlight how intrinsic and acquired determinants instruct cancer evolution in different tissues, with predictable molecular patterns, temporal dynamics and phenotypic outcomes.

 Cold stress restricts plant growth and inorganic phosphate (Pi) uptake, reducing yield and increasing fertilizer demand1–3. Enhancing both cold tolerance and phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) is crucial for sustainable crop productivity. Here we identify the SPX-domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase NITROGEN LIMITATION ADAPTATION (NLA) as a central regulator that links cold signalling to Pi homeostasis in maize (Zea mays L.). Under cold conditions, NLA promotes the degradation of the transcriptional repressor JAZ11, activating jasmonate signalling to enhance cold tolerance; however, NLA also simultaneously represses Pi uptake, through inositol polyphosphate (InsP)-dependent ubiquitination of the Pi transporter PT4. A ubiquitinome-informed genome-wide association study identified a natural PT4(K267A) (lysine-to-alanine substitution) variant that attenuates NLA-mediated degradation and increases Pi uptake in cold conditions. To overcome this nutrient–stress trade-off, we combined artificial-intelligence-guided structural modelling and ligand docking with genome editing to generate the nlaΔ12 allele, which encodes an NLA variant in which binding to InsP is impaired but JAZ11 targeting is retained. The Δ12 modification selectively redirects the activity of NLA towards jasmonate signalling, resulting in improved cold resilience, higher PUE and increased yield in multi-site field trials. These findings reveal a tunable SPX regulatory module that integrates environmental and nutrient signals, and provide a molecular framework for engineering climate-resilient, nutrient-efficient crops. The E3 ubiquitin ligase NLA postively regulates cold tolerance and negatively regulates phosphate uptake in maize, and a genetically engineered variant of this enzyme leads to improved cold tolerance and enhanced phosphate uptake, improving yield in field trials."

 Chiral antiferromagnets1,2 host octupole order3,4 and combine the advantages of antiferromagnets and ferromagnets. Despite the development of numerous switching strategies5–9, the field-free full switching remains unknown, posing an important obstacle to their practical application in memory technology. Here we prepared a homo-junction constituted of Mn3Sn(0001) bottom layer and polycrystalline Mn3Sn top layer. The tilted Kagomé geometry in polycrystalline Mn3Sn divides the out-of-plane spin polarization from Mn3Sn(0001) layer10,11 into the out-of-Kagomé-plane and in-Kagomé-plane components, generating the symmetric (antiferromagnet-type) and asymmetric (ferromagnet-type) driving forces, respectively. The former accelerates octupole rotation, whereas the latter determines switching chirality. Field-free full switching is realized in the unconventional protocol that integrates the advantages of both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic switching. It goes beyond the conventional full-switching framework requiring perpendicular uniaxial anisotropy7,12. An unprecedented switching efficiency is achieved, with both current density and power consumption an order of magnitude lower than in previous configurations, by virtue of the highly efficient driving forces due to spin-torque characteristics of octupole order and the ultralow energy barrier arising from easy-plane anisotropy, overcoming their trade-off in conventional protocols. The zero-field switching also shows the advantages of octupole-programmable chirality and robustness to external magnetic field.

 Electrolyte solvents for electrochemical devices have been dominated by oxygen (O)-based and nitrogen (N)-based ligands over the past decades1–5, for which the dipole–ion (Li+, Na+ and so on) interaction usually lays the foundations of ion dissociation and transport but frustrates the charge transfer process at the electrolyte–electrode interface6–9. Here, by synthesizing alkanes with monofluorinated structures, we show that fluorine (F)-based ligands with designed steric hindrance and Lewis basicity enable salt dissolution of more than 2 mol l−1. Among them, 1,3-difluoro-propane (DFP)-based Li-ion electrolyte is endowed with all merits for energy-dense and low-temperature batteries, including low viscosity (0.95 cp), high oxidation stability (>4.9 V) and ionic conductivity of 0.29 mS cm−1 at −70 °C. By incorporating F atoms in the first solvation shell, the weak F–Li+ coordination facilitates the Li plating/stripping process with Coulombic efficiency (CE) up to 99.7% and exchange current density one magnitude larger than O–Li+ coordination at −50 °C. The electrolytes further enable the operation of lithium-metal pouch cells under an electrolyte amount of less than 0.5 g Ah−1, achieving energy densities greater than 700 Wh kg−1 at room temperature and about 400 Wh kg−1 at −50 °C.

 Alvarezsauroids are an enigmatic clade of predominantly small-bodied theropod dinosaurs that are known mainly from the Jurassic to Cretaceous periods of Asia and South America1–3. Late Cretaceous alvarezsauroids possess specialized forelimbs adapted for digging4,5, minute supernumerary teeth and heightened sensory capacities6, and are interpreted as myrmecophagous. They are hypothesized to exhibit evolutionary miniaturization coupled to their dietary specialization2. Fragmentary South American taxa are traditionally arrayed as a paraphyletic grade with respect to the Late Cretaceous Asian subclade Parvicursorinae2,3, invoking dispersal to explain their disjunct distributions. Here we describe a skeleton of the alvarezsauroid Alnashetri cerropoliciensis7 representing to our knowledge the most complete and smallest South American taxon to date. We also recognize two alvarezsauroids among historic taxa from the Northern Hemisphere. Phylogenetic analysis recovers Alnashetri among basal non-alvarezsaurids, rendering South American taxa polyphyletic. Combined with the new taxa recognized here, our biogeographical analyses infer a Pangaean ancestral distribution for Alvarezsauroidea, with vicariance dominating the early history of the clade. The early branching position of Alnashetri among larger-bodied relatives revises best-fit models of body size evolution in alvarezsauroids—we find no support for evolutionary miniaturization but, rather, find support for repeated evolution within a narrow body size range.

 Coral reefs are marine biodiversity hotspots that provide a wide range of ecosystem services1. They are reservoirs of bioactive metabolites, many produced by microorganisms associated with reef invertebrate hosts2. However, for the keystone species of coral reefs—the reef-building corals—we still lack a systematic assessment of their microbially encoded biosynthetic potential and the molecular resources at stake due to the alarming decline in reef biodiversity. Here we analysed microbial genomes reconstructed from 820 reef-building coral samples of three representative coral genera collected at 99 reefs across 32 islands throughout the Pacific Ocean (Tara Pacific expedition)3. By contextualizing our analyses with the microbiomes of other reef species, we found that only 10% of the 4,224 microbial species and less than 1% of the 645 species exclusively identified in Tara Pacific samples had genomic information available. Furthermore, the biosynthetic potential of reef-building coral microbiomes rivalled or surpassed that of traditional natural product sources such as sponges. Among the biosynthetically rich bacteria in the reef microbiome, we identified new groups of Acidobacteriota that encode previously unknown enzymology, in turn opening promising avenues for functional protein engineering. Together, this study underscores the importance of conserving coral reefs as vital reservoirs of molecular diversity.

 Imbalances in lipid storage and secretion lead to hepatic steatosis, the accumulation of lipid droplets in hepatocytes1,2. Our understanding of the mechanisms that govern the channelling of neutral lipids in hepatocytes towards cytosolic lipid droplets or secreted lipoproteins remains incomplete3,4. Here we performed a series of CRISPR–Cas9 screens under different metabolic states that led to the identification of CLCC1 as a critical regulator of neutral lipid storage and secretion in hepatocytes. Loss of CLCC1 resulted in the buildup of large lipid droplets in hepatoma cells and Clcc1 knockout in mice caused liver steatosis. Lipid droplets were present in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum of the Clcc1-knockout hepatocytes and exhibited properties of lipoproteins, indicating a profound shift in neutral lipid flux. The loss of CLCC1 also led to the accumulation of nuclear membrane herniations accompanied by a reduction in nuclear pores. Remote homology searches identified a domain in CLCC1 that is homologous to yeast Brl1 and Brr6, factors that promote nuclear envelope fusion during nuclear pore complex assembly. Molecular dynamics simulations and mutagenesis studies support a model in which CLCC1 mediates membrane bending and fusion. We propose that CLCC1 mediates membrane fusion to promote hepatic neutral lipid flux and nuclear pore complex assembly.

 Orchestration of lipid production, storage and mobilization is vital for cellular and systemic homeostasis1,2. Dysfunctional plasma lipid control represents the major risk factor for cardiometabolic diseases—the leading cause of human mortality3,4. Within the cellular landscape, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the central hub of lipid synthesis and secretion, particularly in metabolically active hepatocytes in the liver or enterocytes in the gut5,6. Initially assembled in the ER lumen, lipid-ferrying lipoproteins necessitate the cross-membrane transfer of both neutral and phospholipids onto the lumenal apolipoprotein B (APOB), in a poorly defined process7–10. Here we show that the ER protein CLCC1 regulates cellular lipid partition and, consequently, systemic lipid homeostasis by participating in trans-bilayer equilibration of phospholipids. CLCC1 partners with the phospholipid scramblase TMEM41B11,12 to recognize imbalanced bilayers and promote lipid scrambling, thereby supporting lipoprotein biogenesis and the subsequent bulk lipid transport. Loss of CLCC1 or TMEM41B leads to the emergence of giant lumenal lipid droplets enclosed by imbalanced ER bilayers and, consequently, accelerated pathogenesis of metabolic-dysfunction-associated liver steatohepatitis. The results reveal that phospholipid scrambling at the ER is essential for establishing a dynamic equilibrium. Considering the requirement of trans-bilayer phospholipid equilibration in numerous biological processes, ranging from catabolic autophagy to viral infection13–16, we anticipate that future work will elucidate a homeostatic control mechanism intrinsic to ER function in lipid biogenesis and distribution. Phospholipid scrambling at the endoplasmic reticulum is essential for establishing a dynamic equilibrium to maintain cellular homeostasis."

 Identifying the causal variants and mechanisms that drive complex traits and diseases remains a core problem in human genetics1–5. Most of these variants individually have weak effects6 and lie in non-coding gene-regulatory elements7–10, for which we lack a complete understanding of how single-nucleotide alterations modulate transcriptional processes to affect human phenotypes5,11–15. To address this problem, we measured the activity of 221,412 fine-mapped trait-associated variants using a massively parallel reporter assay16–20 in 5 diverse cell types. We show that this assay effectively discriminates between likely causal variants and controls, and identified 13,121 regulatory variants with high precision. Although the effects of these variants largely agree with orthogonal measures of function, only 69% of them can plausibly be explained by the disruption of a known transcription factor binding motif. We investigated the mechanisms of 136 variants using saturation mutagenesis and assigned affected transcription factors for 91% of variants without a clear canonical mechanism. Finally, we detected regulatory epistasis at 11% of tested regulatory variants in close proximity and identified multiple functional variants on the same haplotype at a small, but important, subset of trait-associated loci. Overall, our study provides a systematic functional characterization of likely causal common variants that underlie complex and molecular human traits, enabling new insights into the regulatory grammar underlying disease risk.

 The family of nickelate superconductors have long been explored as analogues of the high-temperature cuprates1–6. Nonetheless, the recent discovery that certain stoichiometric nickelates superconduct up to high critical temperatures (Tc) under pressure came as a surprise7–13. The mechanisms underlying the superconducting state remain experimentally unclear. Apart from the practical challenges posed by working in a high-pressure environment, typical samples exhibit anomalously weak diamagnetic responses, which have been conjectured to reflect inhomogeneous ‘filamentary’ superconducting states7,9,14–17. Here we perform wide-field, high-pressure, optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to image the local diamagnetic responses of as-grown La3Ni2O7 samples in situ, using nitrogen vacancy quantum sensors embedded in the diamond anvil cell18–23. These maps confirm marked inhomogeneity of the functional superconducting responses at the few μm scale. By spatially correlating the diamagnetic Meissner response with both the local tensorial stress environment, also imaged in situ, and stoichiometric composition, we show the dominant mechanisms suppressing and enhancing superconductivity. Our wide-field technique simultaneously provides a broad view of sample behaviour and excellent local sensitivity, enabling the rapid construction of multi-parameter phase diagrams from the local structure–function correlations observed at the sub-μm pixel scale. Wide-field quantum sensing shows μm-scale inhomogeneous superconductivity in high-pressure La3Ni2O7, linking local diamagnetic response to stress and stoichiometry and clarifying mechanisms that suppress or enhance superconductivity."

 The existence of human hippocampal neurogenesis has long been disputed1–12 and its relevance in cognition remains unknown. Recent studies have established the presence of proliferating progenitors and immature neurons and a reduction in the latter in Alzheimer’s disease (AD)11,13. However, their origin and the molecular networks that regulate neurogenesis and function are poorly understood. Here we studied human post-mortem hippocampi obtained from different cohorts: young adults with intact memory, aged adults with no cognitive impairments, aged adults with extraordinary memory capacity (SuperAgers)14,15, adults with preclinical intermediate pathology or adults with AD. Using multiomic single-cell sequencing (single-nucleus RNA sequencing and single-nuclei assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing), we analysed the profiles of 355,997 nuclei isolated from the hippocampus samples and identified neural stem cells, neuroblasts and immature granule neurons. Dysregulated neurogenesis was largely associated with changes in chromatin accessibility. Analyses of transcription factors and target gene signatures that distinguished each of the groups revealed early alterations in chromatin accessibility of neurogenic cells from individuals with preclinical AD, and such changes were even more evident in samples from individuals with AD. We identified a distinct profile of neurogenesis in SuperAgers that may reflect a ‘resilience signature’. Finally, alterations in the profile of astrocytes and CA1 neurons govern cognitive function in the ageing hippocampus. Together, our study points to a multiomic molecular signature of the hippocampus that distinguishes cognitive resilience and deterioration with ageing.

 The sensitivity of non-local optical measurements at low light intensities, such as those involved in long-baseline telescope arrays1,2, is limited by fundamental quantum noise and photon losses3. Distributed quantum entanglement has been proposed as a route towards overcoming these limitations and accessing new regimes of non-local optical sensing4–6. Here we demonstrate the use of entangled quantum memories in a quantum network of silicon–vacancy centres in diamond nanocavities7–9 to experimentally perform such non-local phase measurements. Specifically, we combine the generation of event-ready remote quantum entanglement, photon mode erasure that hides the ‘which-path’ information of temporally and spatially separated incoming optical modes and non-local, non-destructive photon heralding enabled by remote entanglement to perform a proof-of-concept entanglement-assisted differential phase measurement of weak incident light between two spatially separate stations. Demonstrating successful operation of the remote phase sensing protocol with a fibre link baseline up to 1.55 km, our results provide an opportunity for a new class of quantum-enhanced optical imaging methods with potential applications ranging from long-baseline interferometry and astronomy to microscopy10,11.

 The history of the lunar magnetic field is a longstanding controversy. Many palaeomagnetic studies provide evidence for either a persistent, weak magnetic field or the lack of an intrinsic magnetic field between 1.020 and 3.580 billion years ago. However, for the period between 3.580 and 3.854 billion years ago, palaeomagnetic studies have recovered strong intrinsic fields (>40 µT) distributed among weak or null intensity measurements. Crustal magnetic anomalies from this period have also been interpreted as evidence for the presence of both strong and weak magnetic fields. Here we explore potential links between published palaeointensity, rock magnetic and geochemical data for lunar basalts. We find there is a statistically significant relationship only between recovered palaeointensity and the titanium content of lunar basalts. By modelling the heat flux across the core–mantle boundary, we suggest that there is a causal link between lunar dynamo generation and the eruption of high-titanium basalts. Such a link may result from the intermittent melting of ilmenite-bearing cumulates at the core–mantle boundary. The coincidence of these rare events probably reflects sampling bias near high-titanium basaltic terranes.

 Signaling pathways are useful models for interpreting molecular data, but their coverage has long been constrained by classic biochemistry methods. The growing corpus of kinase-substrate interactions, coupled to phosphoproteomics improvements, pave the way to revisit classic signaling pathways. In this study, we explore context-specific signaling pathway inference from phosphoproteomics and kinase-substrate networks. Focusing on epidermal growth factor (EGF), we conduct a meta-analysis and generate three datasets representing the most comprehensive characterization of the EGF response to date. We infer kinase-kinase pathways and compare them to different ground truth sets. Literature-curated networks consistently yield the highest recovery of ground-truth interactions, with modest gains from network propagation methods. Up to 90% of interactions are absent from current ground truth sets, indicating many unexplored interactions supported by data and knowledge. Our results demonstrate the limitations of traditional views on signaling pathways and point to opportunities for generating better mechanistic hypotheses.

Here, authors propose a bistable origami thermal switch that achieves a high switching ratio without requiring external energy or sensory input, validated across various applications. 
 Effective thermal management is critical for power electronics in AI and robotics, highlighting the need for dynamic, reversible thermal switches. Achieving a high switching ratio remains challenging. Here, we present a bistable origami-inspired thermal switch that switch rapidly between distinct thermal conduction states without external energy or sensory input. Fabricated from a thin film through precise cut-and-fold, it achieves thermal switching ratios of 13,984 in vacuum and 1360 in ambient air, significantly higher than existing approaches. Switching is driven by snap-through instability, actuated by a combination of shape-memory alloy and elastic springs. The energy landscape can be tuned through geometric variations to adjust triggering temperature and switching ratio. We demonstrate stable, repeatable thermal regulation across multiple scenarios, offering a pathway toward passive, programmable thermal management.

Here, the authors employ a small-molecule compound screening to identify elesclomol, a potent copper ionophore, to overcome PARPi-resistance in BRCA-proficient ovarian cancer cells by suppressing the activation of the ATR-CHK1 DNA damage response pathway. 
 Although poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) as monotherapy or in combination with other DNA-damaging agents exhibit promising clinical efficacy, the therapeutic responses are usually transient, with subsequent development of acquired resistance posing a significant challenge. Here, through a small-molecule compound screening, we identify elesclomol, a potent copper ionophore, which sensitizes BRCA-proficient ovarian cancer cells to PARPi by inhibiting activation of the ATR-CHK1 pathway. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that copper directly binds to ATRIP, a critical cofactor of ATR activation, disrupting the ATR-ATRIP interaction, further impairing ATR-mediated DNA damage repair signaling and potentiating PARPi sensitivity. Importantly, we reveal a secondary metabolic vulnerability in PARPi-resistant ovarian cancer associated with de novo pyrimidine synthesis, suggesting that targeting this pathway as an effective strategy to eradicate drug-adaptive residual tumors and resistant patient-derived xenograft models following ATR and PARP co-inhibition. These findings propose de novo pyrimidine synthesis as an adaptive metabolic vulnerability that can be therapeutically targeted to overcome PARPi resistance in BRCA-proficient ovarian cancer.

 Enterocytes mediate both nutrient absorption and antimicrobial peptide (AMP) secretion while constantly exposed to osmotic fluctuations. However, the role of volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC), a key osmo-sensitive ion channel, in enterocytes and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains unclear. Here, we show that intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific knockout of LRRC8A, the essential VRAC subunit, exacerbates colitis and inflammation-associated colorectal cancer. VRAC deficiency specifically disrupts enterocyte maturation and zonation, expanding AMP-producing enterocytes while reducing enterocytes responsible for nutrient absorption. Retinoic acid metabolism emerges as the most affected nutrient pathway in VRAC-deficient IECs, with reduced Adh1, Aldh1a2 expression and aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. Supplementation with retinoic acid reversed inflammation caused by VRAC deficiency. Conversely, VRAC deficiency induced gut microbiota dysbiosis, while administration of Lactobacillus species effectively restored microbial balance and alleviated inflammation. This study delineates the role of VRAC in balancing nutrient absorption and antimicrobial defense in enterocytes to safeguard gut homeostasis. Intestinal epithelium is continuously exposed to osmotic changes.

 Axially chiral arylpyrroles are a promising class of compounds with broad applications in catalysis, medicinal chemistry, and materials science. Herein, we report a copper-catalysed dynamic kinetic asymmetric (4 + 1) cyclization for the atroposelective synthesis of arylpyrroles bearing a single stereogenic axis or 1,2-diaxes from 1,3-enynes and amines. This dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation employs a chiral Cu/Pybox complex, with air as the oxidant and DABCO serving as both a base and a proton shuttle. A key feature is the reversibility of the aza-Michael addition, which enables the dynamic formation/cleavage of distal C–N bonds. The 5-endo-dig cyclization serves as both the rate-determining and stereodetermining step, ensuring precise stereocontrol of the proximal stereocenters by the catalyst. This strategy overcomes long-standing challenges in the stereocontrol of distal C–N bond formation and enables the synthesis of atropisomeric DMAP catalysts with two stereogenic axes. DFT calculations provide insights into the mechanism of stereocontrol. Axially chiral arylpyrroles hold significant promise in catalysis, medicinal chemistry and materials science.

 Autoimmunity increases the risk of developing B lymphoma in humans; however, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying this link remain(s) unexplained. Here, we develop a mouse model to dissect the contribution of Id-driven T-B collaboration and show that chronic interaction between B cells and CD4+ T cells first leads to autoimmunity and later to the development of B (and T) cell lymphomas. We find that serum autoantibodies and lymphoma B cell receptor (BCR) are related and have the same specificity for ubiquitous self-antigens (histone and nucleosome) (Signal 1). Self-reactive B lymphoma cells are helped by CD4+ T cells that recognize a lymphoma neoantigen, an MHC class II-presented Idiotypic (Id) peptide (Signal 2). The mechanism, called Id-driven T-B collaboration, results in relentless mutual stimulation of B and T cells with germinal center markers, autoimmunity, and finally, malignant transformation of either B or T cells. Our results thus indicate Id-driven T-B collaboration as a potential mechanism linking autoimmunity and the development of lymphomas.

Here analysis of German television programmes and audience perceptions shows that climate change coverage is concentrated in news formats and engages climate supporters, but misses climate-distant audiences drawn to entertainment. 
 Television is a widely used medium for climate information worldwide, yet its role in public engagement remains underexplored. Here we examine both the representation of climate change on television and the audience engagement with it. We analysed 23,478 hours of programming across 20 German television channels over 61 days in 2022 and further assessed audience engagement with climate content through a representative survey (n = 1,445). In the beginning of the polycrisis context of autumn 2022—including war, inflation and energy insecurity—2.2% of broadcast hours addressed climate topics. Climate coverage was concentrated in news formats, reaching mostly to the climate-engaged majority, but remained largely invisible for climate-distant groups who prefer entertainment programmes. In addition, the results reveal unequal gender representation in television programmes and a perceived over-representation of politicians. Taken together, these findings suggest that strengthening inclusive storytelling, diversifying representation and innovating formats may enhance the reach and inclusivity of televised climate communication. Although widely used, television is underexplored in climate communication.

 The Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) is the dominant mode of tropical stratospheric variability that modulates global circulation and climate. Although a long-term weakening of QBO amplitude has been observed under global warming, the relative roles of different tropical oceans remain unclear. We perform sensitivity experiments forced by sea surface temperature perturbations over the tropical Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, as well as their combined warming, to separate individual and joint effects. Pacific warming produces the strongest weakening and slowest descent of the QBO, whereas Atlantic warming slightly strengthens the amplitude and extends the vertical structure. Indian Ocean warming slightly weakens the amplitude and accelerates the descent. When all three oceans warm simultaneously, the QBO exhibits a weaker amplitude and faster descent, consistent in sign with the combined single-basin responses but with a reduced magnitude owing to diminished zonal and inter-basin SST gradients. Momentum budget analyses further show that basin-dependent competition between equatorial wave forcing and tropical upwelling underlies these contrasting responses."

 Radiative effects of aerosol-cloud interactions constitute the most uncertain climate forcing of the Earth system. To understand how these interactions may change with climate, we conduct 3-day-long large-eddy simulations of a stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition along an airmass-following trajectory over the Northeast Pacific Ocean. By perturbing boundary-layer aerosol concentrations, aerosol-cloud interactions are simulated in present-day and warmed climate with increased CO2. Aerosol-induced cloud changes, including the Twomey effect and adjustments of cloud fraction and liquid water path, are inhibited in a doubled-CO2 climate. Decomposing the aerosol-induced cloud radiative effect change (ΔCRE) reveals that aerosol-induced cloud fraction changes dominate ΔCRE. Doubling CO2 attenuates the aerosol-induced ΔCRE (i.e., cooling) by >30% in our simulations. Our results also show that low cloud feedbacks are sensitive to the background aerosol concentration, highlighting the interplay between climate forcings and feedbacks. These results may aid in predicting the cooling potential of marine cloud brightening in a changing climate."

 Wind patterns are a crucial factor for migratory insect pests. However, the impact of extreme weather events, such as tropical cyclones (TCs), on migratory pest dynamics remains unclear. Here, we combined long-term trapping data with climatic variables and hydrogen stable isotope analysis to investigate how TCs influence the population dynamics of a globally invasive moth pest, fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda), across the Gulf of America, formerly known as the Gulf of Mexico. TCs significantly increased fall armyworm moth abundance, shifting their peak activity across years. Most moths originated from southeastern Florida and the Caribbean, resulting in a 54% increase in migratory moths during the TC season. These findings reveal a previously unquantified link between extreme weather events (TCs) and migratory pest outbreaks. As TCs intensify, fall armyworm migration patterns may become increasingly unpredictable, posing greater challenges for pest management and agricultural sustainability. Tropical cyclones markedly increase fall moth abundance across the Gulf of America, driving a 54% rise in migratory moths, based on long-term trapping data, climatic records, and hydrogen isotope analysis."

 This study examines how different global warming levels associated with near-future carbon neutrality timings influence future tropical cyclone activity over the western North Pacific, using a pseudo-global warming framework. Convection-permitting simulations of multiple landfalling tropical cyclones were performed with the Weather Research and Forecasting model under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways: SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6, corresponding to net-zero emissions in the 2050 s and 2070 s, respectively. Delayed attainment of net-zero emissions leads to more substantial intensification, with the area affected by strong winds expanding by 7% and 9%, and regions of heavy precipitation by 15% and 22%, under SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6, respectively. These differential responses are driven primarily by thermodynamic changes (atmospheric moisture increase) and also contributed by dynamic changes (enhanced vertical motion). The results underscore that the timing of carbon neutrality is a critical determinant of the severity of landfalling tropical cyclone impacts. Delayed attainment of net-zero emissions will lead to substantial intensification of tropical cyclones over the western North Pacific, according to a comparison between scenarios with different future timing of net-zero emissions."

 Reforestation is considered an important nature-based climate solution to help achieve net-zero CO2 emissions. However, strategies using reforestation-based CO2 removal to offset fossil fuel emissions may not lead to the same climate outcome as avoiding the fossil fuel emissions. Here, we use an Earth System model of intermediate complexity to compare the climate outcome of different pathways: a reference pathway, and net-zero pathways where additional fossil fuel CO2 emissions relative to the reference pathway are balanced by reforestation-based CO2 removals (“Reforestation Net-zero pathways”). Results show that model simulations of Reforestation Net-zero pathways yield a higher atmospheric CO2 and warmer climate outcome than the reference simulation. The higher atmospheric CO2 results from carbon cycle feedbacks. The additional global warming from higher atmospheric CO2 is further amplified by biogeophysical effects of reforestation. These findings highlight the need for improved methods to account for the carbon cycle and climate effects of reforestation.

 Moult is a critical period in the life cycle of emperor penguin. Like other stages of their life history they depend upon Antarctic sea-ice as a platform to moult. Our knowledge of where the birds moult is limited to a small number of tracking studies and incidental observations, showing most adult emperor penguins moult in small groups on sea ice between January and March. Sea ice extent and duration has reduced dramatically over the last decade, and understanding how these declining ice conditions are impacting emperor penguins is crucial to model future population trajectories.

 Arctic sea ice is fundamental to the global climate engine, modulating heat exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere and impacting large-scale oceanic and atmospheric movements. While the monitoring of sea ice concentration (SIC) from satellites has long depended on coarse-resolution passive microwave (PMW) sensors, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) missions, such as Copernicus’s Sentinel-1, have emerged as complementary and fine-resolution sources of sea ice information.This study introduces the DMI-ASIP (Danish Meteorological Institute - Automated Sea Ice Products) data record; the first decade-long (2014–2024) and pan-Arctic SIC record derived from Sentinel-1 SAR imagery and provided at a high spatial resolution of 0.5 km. Compared to two well-established PMW-based SIC data records, DMI-ASIP consistently shows higher SIC and sea ice area, particularly in the marginal ice zone and during the melt season. Evaluation against an independent 2020–2022 SIC reference data record derived from optical Landsat-8 imagery indicates strong overall performance for DMI-ASIP, achieving a lower RMSE (8.7%) compared to the two PMW-based records (12.1% and 13.6%). Furthermore, DMI-ASIP exhibits less seasonal variability in its performance than the PMW-based records. While DMI-ASIP is quantitatively closer to the reference data record, the evaluation revealed a consistent tendency for DMI-ASIP to overestimate sea ice concentrations (+2.5% mean bias across the 2020–2022 evaluation period). The decade-long DMI-ASIP data record, extended by a corresponding operational near real-time product, is available through the Copernicus Marine Service."

 Changes in the spectral reflectance of drying soil are slow and rather subtle for much of the drying time, becoming more rapid and dramatic only when readily available pore water has been depleted. Tracking changes in reflectance at frequent intervals as soil dries, and considering the observations as a time series, can provide insight into the relationship between spectral changes and the underlying soil moisture status. This paper describes time series of laboratory measurements of the spectral reflectance of four distinct soils collected at 15-min intervals as the soils progress from oversaturated to air-dry. Continuous changes in reflectance as water evaporates over time are described, and a spectral Fresnel component to the reflectance of oversaturated soil is documented. A rationale for a metric to detect the end of constant evaporation is presented, along with an approach for identifying and distinguishing among bare soils in satellite or aircraft imagery. The observations also provide insight into the challenges of designing spectral metrics intended to gather useful information regarding moisture content and soil characterization."

 Retrieving high-resolution soil moisture (SM) using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is often difficult due to noise caused by surface heterogeneities. Threshold-based masking techniques such as dynamic masking (DM) are commonly applied to mitigate these effects, but they can inadvertently remove valid SM signals or retain pixels that contribute to noise. This study introduces a novel masking approach based on temporal stability analysis (TSA) that identifies and retains pixels that reliably capture SM dynamics. TSA is performed between 10 m-scale SAR backscatter and 1 km synthetic backscatter from the Water Cloud Model (WCM) using Land Surface Model (LSM)-simulated SM and vegetation descriptors as input. The method is evaluated using both in situ observations and LSM simulations across three distinct SM monitoring networks—SMC (South Korea), TxSON (United States), and REMEDHUS (Spain)—and compared with DM. Across all sites, TSA-based masking improved correlations (by up to 0.15) and reduced ubRMSE (by up to 0.014 m3/m3) against both LSM-derived SM and in situ SM, relative to no masking and DM. It also more effectively excluded urban and water pixels while retaining those where backscatter signals are influenced by vegetation but properly compensated through the WCM. In further evaluations with cosmic-ray neutron probe observations, TSA improved the correlation to 0.61 at 480 m resolution. These findings highlight the effectiveness of TSA in refining pixel selection and improving SM retrieval across diverse landscapes and spatial scales."

 The Meteosat Third Generation Lightning Imager (MTG-LI), launched aboard the MTG-Imager-1 satellite, is the first geostationary optical lightning sensor to cover Europe and Africa while also covering parts of South America. It enables continuous monitoring of total lightning (both intra-cloud (IC) and cloud-to-ground (CG)) with high temporal and spatial resolution. This study presents the first validation of LI observations over South America and adjacent regions during October 2024, using data from the ground-based Earth Networks Total Lightning Network (ENTLN). Three objectives are addressed: (i) evaluation of LI’s detection capabilities across varying spatiotemporal thresholds; (ii) assessment of the temporal accuracy of LI; and (iii) investigation of the empirical relationship between ENTLN peak current (A) and LI optical radiance (R). Our results show that in areas with dense ground network coverage, detection efficiency exceeds 0.8 and FAR is below 0.3 using moderate thresholds (±2 s, 1° x 1°). Relatively high FAR values, particularly at night, are in-part due to LI detecting lightning that ENTLN misses in areas where its performance is reduced. In addition, a regression model of the A–R relationship is proposed enabling the peak current to be estimated based solely on satellite data, which is advantageous in areas with insufficient ground-based observations. The results show that this relationship is more suitable in logarithmic transformation, with positive discharges exhibiting twice the regression slope than negative discharges."

 Vehicle counting and localization using high-resolution satellite imagery have recently demonstrated substantial value in urban management and public services. However, satellite images routinely suffer from degradation issues, including blurring, insufficient resolution, noise, uneven illumination, and occlusion, due to sensor limitations, weather conditions, compression artifacts, and other environmental factors. These quality issues severely degrade the stability and accuracy of traditional vehicle counting and localization methods. To address this challenge, we propose Degradation-aware Vehicle Counting and Localization (DeVCL), a novel end-to-end point regression framework explicitly designed for degraded satellite imagery, which adaptively recognizes image degradation conditions and directly predicts vehicle positions. Specifically, DeVCL uses a self-supervised degradation representation jointly with image quality assessment to guide a degradation-aware feature modulation module, enhancing feature representations for low-quality inputs. We also introduce a feature-level adversarial mechanism without paired supervision to strengthen feature robustness. In addition, a density-sensitive feature refinement module is proposed to address matching ambiguities caused by densely packed and arranged vehicles, thus improving localization performance. We evaluated DeVCL using two synthetic degraded datasets built on FAIR1M_V and ITCVD, along with a newly collected dataset named SatPark that features high vehicle density and includes multiple naturally occurring degradations. Experimental results indicate that DeVCL consistently outperforms existing methods, particularly in SatPark, demonstrating strong generalization and practical adaptability."

 Population spatialization serves as a pivotal technique for delineating the geographical distribution patterns of human populations, which is essential for urban planning and the optimal allocation of public resources.

Finally, a random forest model is employed to estimate the grid-scale population distribution. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieved an R2 of 0.92 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 10,059 at a 100 m grid scale, significantly outperforming benchmark products such as WorldPop and GHS-POP. Ablation experiments further confirm that the VSCDA strategy reduces the MAE by over 2% at fine-to-medium scales. This integration of accumulable visual features and data augmentation provides a robust technical paradigm for advancing fine-scale population spatialization research."

 Accurate estimation of chlorophyll content helps understand the physiological health of saplings. Traditional field measurement methods limit large-scale applications, while remote sensing monitoring methods, though improving efficiency, still face challenges in data analysis and processing. A key challenge is extracting the canopy of individual trees and estimating chlorophyll content amid interference from weed vegetation. To overcome this challenge, this study develops a novel coupled deep learning approach. First, an Attention and Pyramid U-Net (APUNet) was proposed to improve the segmentation accuracy of Ginkgo seedlings crown boundaries in multispectral drone images. Second, the hyper-parameter combination of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) model was optimized to improve sapling detection accuracy under complex conditions with high weed coverage. Next, a sliding window method was developed to reduce duplicate detection rates for detecting all saplings in the entire image, and the intersection of APUNet and detection results was used for segmentation of individual saplings. Finally, a PROSAIL-Deep Neural Network (DNN) model for chlorophyll estimation was developed, and the impact of using APUNet YOLO to remove weed pixels on chlorophyll estimation was investigated, along with how over-coverage and under-coverage during the segmentation process affect the accuracy of chlorophyll estimation. The results show that, compared to U-Net, APUNet improved segmentation performance, with the IoU increasing from 0.697 to 0.736. After hyper-parameter optimization through grid search, the YOLOv8l model achieved an mAP50 of 0.968 and when this model was applied to full-image detection using a sliding window approach, its duplicate detection rate (ddr) decreased by 11.2% compared with the general method. In chlorophyll inversion, the chlorophyll estimation accuracy reached its highest after using APUNet-YOLO to reduce the interference from weed pixels, with an R2 of 0.752 and an RMSE of 7.143 μg/cm2. Meanwhile, the sensitivity analysis of the impact of segmentation errors on chlorophyll estimation accuracy shows that, compared to under-coverage segmentation, over-inclusion segmentation leads to a greater decline in chlorophyll estimation accuracy. This novel coupled model can effectively monitor the chlorophyll content of Ginkgo saplings in settings with complex backgrounds, providing a practical possibility for the realization of precision forestry."

 Accurate and efficient object detection in remote sensing imagery is fundamental to applications such as urban monitoring, infrastructure assessment, and disaster management. However, two persistent challenges remain: (1) small objects occupy only a few pixels in ultra-high-resolution images, making them difficult to detect reliably, and (2) the rapid growth of large-scale satellite data demands computationally efficient methods suitable for practical deployment. Existing lightweight convolutional networks provide real-time efficiency but often fail to capture sufficient discriminative information for small targets, while Transformer-based detectors improve representation power at the cost of high computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose MAC-DETR, a CNN-Mambaout-Transformer hybrid detection framework designed for remote sensing imagery. MAC-DETR integrates three complementary modules: (1) Mambaout-RepLK, a Mambaout-style gated convolution block that reduces computational overhead while preserving expressive feature extraction, achieving + 2.5% mAP improvement in fine-grained categories on NWPU VHR-10 while reducing parameters by 23%; (2) CROSS-UP, an adaptive upsampling block that enhances multi-scale fusion and improves the detection of small objects—yielding up to + 2.6% mAP gain on multi-scale categories in NWPU VHR-10—without introducing extra complexity; and (3) ASSAIFI, a sparse attention module that strengthens feature interaction to further refine small-object representations. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that MAC-DETR achieves 74.1% mAP on DOTA-v1.5, 95.4% on NWPU VHR-10, 94.4% on HRSC2016, and 95.4% on the infrared SIRSTv2 dataset, consistently outperforming both CNN– and Transformer-based baselines. Ablation studies show that the design reduces parameters by 23% and computation by 10–15%, offering a practical balance between accuracy and efficiency. These results highlight MAC-DETR’s effectiveness for large-scale, multi-modal Earth observation applications. The source code will be available at: https://github.com/Keykeykeykeykeykey/MAC-DETR."

 For tree-level inversion of leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) from UAV imagery, the adjacency scattering effect of individual trees can affect the reflectance of the specific tree crown, thereby increasing the uncertainty and difficulty of LCC inversion. In this study, a novel visual factor (VF) correction framework for such adjacency scattering effect is proposed, which can efficiently quantify the adjacency effects by geometric probabilities instead of computationally intensive 3D radiative transfer modeling (3D-RTM). This framework is realized by extracting the light intersection probability between the target tree crown and the adjacency scenes (Crown, Ground, and Sky) via ray tracing on LiDAR-derived 3D scenes. We constructed a VF-based adjacency effect correction equation to optimize the extracted vegetation indices (VIs) of tree crowns which were utilized for tree-level LCC inversion. The results indicate that most ratio-based vegetation indices that include near-infrared bands, such as NDVI, RVI, MCARI, CIrededge, and GNDVI, increased the accuracy of LCC after calibration (the mean R2 of univariate prediction was improved to 0.46), while DVI and EVI were insensitive to the adjacency effect and TVI showed a decrease in accuracy. Notably, VIs after adjacency effect correction demonstrated a remarkable improvement under the multivariate regression algorithm, with the R2 increasing by 0.4 compared to that before correction, achieving an accuracy of R2 = 0.67. The method overcame the uncertainty of tree-level signals in UAV imagery by eliminating the influence of the adjacency scattering and provided an efficient solution for the accurate inversion of parameters at the individual-tree scale, which is of great application value for the assessment of precise forestry management."

 Nonuniform particle sizes are adopted in the studies on organophosphate esters (OPEs) in urban surface dust, resulting in difficult comparisons in terms of OPE concentration and composition as well as uncertainties of exposure risk of OPEs. In this study, urban surface dust was fractionated into <63, 63–150, 150–250, and 250–1000 μm fractions for the size composition characteristics of urban surface dust, and 13 OPEs in the four fractions and bulk dust samples were analyzed for the size existence features and exposure risk uncertainties of OPEs. The results showed that urban surface dust was composed mainly of <63 μm (50.0%) and 63–150 μm (34.2%) parts. The total concentration of 13 OPEs in the bulk dust ranged from 130 to 5968 ng/g, with a mean of 1378 ± 1427 ng/g. The means of OPEs exhibited decreasing trends or first increasing and then decreasing patterns with the increasing particle size of dust, with the greatest of most OPEs in <63 or 63–150 μm. Although alkyl and chlorinated OPEs were predominant in the four fractions and bulk dust, individual OPEs were dominated by tri(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCiPP) and tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP) in the four fractions as well as by tris(2-choloroethyl) phosphate, TCiPP, tri(1,3-dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCPP), and TBOEP in the bulk dust. The size fractions of <63 μm (57.5%) and 63–150 μm (34.0%) were the main mass contributor for OPEs in urban surface dust. The health risk of human exposed to most OPEs (e.g., tri-n-butyl phosphate, TBOEP, tri(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate, TCiPP, TDCPP, and tricresyl phosphate) might be underestimated if their concentrations adopt from the bulk dust rather than mainly existing size dust (<150 μm). The current research results suggest that the urban surface dust of <150 μm could be proposed as the uniform size standard in the study on OPEs in urban surface dust."

 Methyl glycolate (MG) is emitted into the atmosphere as a result of its use as an industrial precursor. This study presents the gas-phase reactivity of MG with Cl atoms and HO• radicals for the first time. The rate coefficient for both reactions, kCl = (4.3 ± 0.9) × 10−12 cm3 molecule−1 s−1, and kHO = (4.8 ± 1.4) × 10−13 cm3 molecule−1 s−1, were determined simultaneously by FTIR spectroscopy and/or SPME-GC-FID. Based on these findings, the atmospheric lifetime of MG with HO• radicals was estimated to be 12 days, indicating that its emissions could be transported and have a regional impact. Furthermore, the photooxidation products of MG were identified and quantified by FTIR, both in the presence (CH3OC(O)OONO2, HOC(O)H and CO) and absence of NO2 (CH3OC(O)C(O)H, HOC(O)H, CO2 and CO). Additionally, the formation of HOCH2C(O)OH was identified by GC-FID. Analysis of the sinks of alkoxy radicals formed in the degradation of MG shows significant differences depending on the presence of NOx: in clean atmospheres, these radicals undergo unimolecular decomposition or H abstraction by O2 leading mainly to the formation of CH3OC(O)C(O)H, whereas under polluted conditions their reactions with NO2 become significant, resulting in the formation of CH3OC(O)OONO2 and HC(O)OH. The former can affect health and the biota or be transported to remote locations, where its thermal decomposition can inject CH3OC(O)OO• and NO2• radicals, thereby contributing to the pollution of otherwise pristine environments. On the other hand, HC(O)OH could affect cloud and raindrop acidity, favoring cloud droplet nucleation."

This study focused on airborne 210Pb levels to evaluate the radiological influence of nearby uranium processing and waste storage facilities in North Kazakhstan uranium province. Collection of aerosol particles was conducted in Stepnogorsk city during 2020–2022 with the exception of the winter months. Activity of 210Pb and major ion concentrations in seven size-fractionated aerosol particles were determined by high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector and ion chromatography, respectively. The observed 210Pb activity concentrations in aerosol samples varied between 0.46 ± 0.01 mBq/m3 and 2.60 ± 0.03 mBq/m3, with an arithmetic mean of 0.86 mBq/m3. The radiation dosimetry of daily inhalation of 210Pb through exposure to outdoor air was estimated to be from 0.9 to 2.5 μSv/y. Although this level is low compared to global mean exposures, the long term presence of inhaled 210Pb in the body constitutes a persistent radiation risk. The negative correlation (r = −0.60) was observed between total activity and average temperature indicating an increase in concentration with decreasing temperature. The dominant fraction of atmospheric 210Pb predominantly was found in fine aerosol particles smaller than 2.1 μm, and accounted for 95.3 ± 12.0% of the total. The linear correlation of 210Pb with sulfate, nitrate, and chloride suggests that human activities, including coal combustion, are possible contributors to atmospheric 210Pb in this study area. This highlights the importance of considering local anthropogenic emissions when interpreting the atmospheric 210Pb levels."

 The diurnal cycle of precipitation exhibits considerable regional variability and is generally the result of multiple factors including land-sea temperature differences, topographical features, and atmospheric dynamics. However, the characterization of this phenomenon requires high resolution precipitation data often not available in many parts of the world. In this study, we examine diurnal cycles of rainfall over Madagascar using 23 years (2001−2023) of data from Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (GPM IMERG) Version 07 Final Run (hereafter IMERG), PERSIANN Dynamic Infrared–Rain Rate (PDIR-Now), and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5). Results from harmonic analysis reveal a strong diurnal cycle for precipitation amount and frequency across the entire study area for all seasons derived from the three datasets. The time of maximum for amount and frequency of precipitation are similar across the three datasets, however, ERA5 generally estimates the time of maximum to occur 2–4 h earlier. The diurnal circulation is driven by the persistent easterly winds, e.g. the Southeast Trade Winds. However, the time of maximum rainfall occurs in the early afternoon along the coastlines given sea breeze circulations. The interior of Madagascar reveals an evening maximum while areas off the coast generally have maximum precipitation amount and frequency just after midnight. These patterns are strongest in summer and spring and weakest during the winter season. Our results suggest that high-resolution satellite-derived precipitation data are quite useful for studying precipitation processes in complex terrain where rain gauge data are generally unavailable."

Six meteorological variables are found to be essential for accurately reproducing EP, with integrated water vapor (IWV) playing a dominant role. EP intensity increases significantly under extreme conditions of these variables, reaching up to 2.8 times higher when all six are extreme compared to none. In addition, interactions between extreme IWV and other variables further amplify EP intensity through dynamic pathways. These findings suggest the dominant role of IWV and its interactions with other key variables, offering physically interpretable insights that can improve EP prediction and inform variable selection in data-driven climate models."

 In addition to near-surface photochemical production, Surface ozone (O3) concentrations are strongly influenced by vertical exchange processes in the troposphere. To quantify these impacts, a transformer-based deep learning model was developed and integrated with an interpretable technique (DeepLIFT). The model was trained using observations and meteorological reanalysis data over the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) region between 2019 and 2023. The model demonstrated robust generalization ability and high predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.90). The annual contribution of vertical exchanges in the lower (VEX_L) and upper (VEX_U) troposphere accounts for 14% and 5% of surface O3 concentrations, respectively. Seasonally, VEX_L had the strongest impact in summer, contributing about 18% to the surface O3, while VEX_U showed relatively strong impact in spring and autumn, accounting for 5–7%. Diurnal variation in VEX_L was particularly pronounced in summer, with nightly contributions exceeding daytime values by up to 27.4 μg/m3. High contribution events of VEX_L (>30%) and VEX_U (>15 μg/m3) occurred most frequently in summer, with frequencies 1.5–3 times higher than in other seasons.

 Small island ecosystems are threatened by climate change in several ways. This includes the Galápagos archipelago in the Tropical Eastern Pacific, where limited freshwater makes the islands dependent on atmospheric supply through precipitation. However, precipitation distribution remains highly uncertain due to the lack of operational observation systems, and it is unclear how climate change will affect availability. Given its location, climate impacts are closely tied to changes in El Niño Southern Oscillation extremes during El Niño and La Niña years.Using a new measurement network incorporating a vertical rain radar profiler, we investigated seasonal rainfall changes (hot and cool) by analyzing El Niño/La Niña-like years, serving as surrogate for a locally warmer and locally cooler world. Our analysis demonstrates that in a locally warmer world, precipitation is increasing in both seasons. Rainfall characteristics and satellite-retrievals convective cloud frequency indicate more convective activity, intensifying heavy rainfall, especially during the hot season. In the cool season, drizzle is replaced by light rain throughout the vertical profile.In a locally cooler world, the hot season's typical midday rainfall maximum is replaced by oscillating, short-wavelength patterns and lower totals. Interestingly, the cool season in a La Niña-dominated world exhibits slightly higher rainfall than a neutral year, likely due to better condensation conditions of the advected moist air at lower air temperatures. Overall, results suggest improved total rainfall supply in a locally warmer world, but torrential rain could endanger the islands in the hot season. Furthermore, cool seasons shift from drizzle to light rain, though totals remain low overall."

While IL-4/13 signaling in epithelial cells is required for tuft cell hyperplasia, few signals that support this process have been identified. Here, we show that tuft cells across all tissues express the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT and that IL-4/13 is necessary and sufficient to up-regulate KIT on small intestinal (SI) tuft cells. Although epithelial KIT is dispensable for homeostatic turnover, KIT deletion from tuft cells during helminth infection reduces tuft cell hyperplasia and delays helminth clearance. Mechanistically, KIT signaling supports the generation of new tuft cells in SI crypts. These findings thus identify a unique tuft cell-specific function for KIT in type 2 immunity."

Brabec,Ink-state preaggregation control enables scalable and automated fabrication of highly efficient and stable organic photovoltaics,"Scalability and automation are critical for advancing organic solar cells (OSCs) toward high-throughput production, yet both remain notable challenges. Here, we report a simple yet effective strategy using Tz6T as a multifunctional additive to regulate ink-state preaggregation to address both concerns. Tz6T interacts with both donor and acceptor molecules in ink, enabling improved and more ordered preaggregation. This facilitates uniform film formation and significantly reduces bimolecular recombination, enables 16.4% efficiency large-area green solvent–processed OSC modules (19.3 cm2), ranking it among the best reported values to date. Furthermore, the preagggregated ink mitigates the morphology drift caused by time delays in preprogrammed robotic fabrication, yielding device efficiency exceeding 16%, highlighting strong potential for high-throughput production. Beyond efficiency, Tz6T also enhances long-term stability and exhibits compatibility across diverse material systems, underscoring its broad applicability. This work offers a promising pathway for accelerating the translation toward sustainable, scalable, and automated fabricable high-performance and stable OSCs, paving the way for their industrialization."

However, the mechanisms by which such minute melt fractions migrate through largely solid rocks and generate large-scale geophysical anomalies have remained unclear. Here, our high-pressure experiments demonstrate that, in the presence of H2O and NaCl, carbonate-rich melts act as super-spreaders, completely wetting and coating the surfaces of surrounding mantle minerals. This perfect wetting enables even trace amounts of melt (0.02 to 0.08 vol%) to form fully interconnected networks.

While trans-regulatory mechanisms governingRorcexpression are well characterized, cis-regulatory mechanisms, particularly in innate lymphocytes, remain partially understood. Here, we identify CNS11 as an essential cis-regulatory element ofRorc. In TH17 cells, CNS11 was dispensable for induction but critical for maintaining RORγt expression. In contrast, CNS11 deletion blocked ILC3 progenitor induction, abolishing secondary lymphoid organ formation. CNS11 deletion also abolished the development of RORγt+Treg, RORγt+γδT, and RORγt+antigen-presenting cells. Mechanistically, CNS11 functioned through a RORγt-dependent feed-forward loop with cell type–specific cofactors: cooperating with RORγt and runt-related transcription factor 3 to direct ILC3 development and with RORγt and/or c-MAF to sustain RORγt expression in TH17, RORγt+Treg, and RORγt+γδT cells.

In particular, the nonradiative relaxation paths from the excited triplet states to the ground state, especially those involving a shelving intermediate state (IS), remain largely hypothetical, and the rate constants have yet to be directly measured. In this work, we investigate the relaxation dynamics of the IS in the optical pumping cycle in a broad temperature range. We measure a 24.0(3)-nanosecond relaxation time from IS to the ground state at room temperature, which approximately doubles at low temperatures. Simulations reveal how spin populations and ground-state polarization evolve with varying excitation rates. Accordingly, we optimize optically detected magnetic resonance pulse sequences to account for the effects of IS relaxation. This considerably enhances spin manipulation efficiency, allowing substantial optimization of the quantum sensor’s sensitivity based on boron vacancies."

Identification of the best hapten is an essential step in the development of third-generationHaemophilus influenzaetype b (Hib) conjugate vaccines. A comprehensive understanding of the relationship between Hib oligosaccharide chain length and immunological activities remains elusive. A series of Hib capsular polysaccharide (CPS) oligosaccharide derivatives of different lengths were synthesized to establish carbohydrate structure-function relationships. Glycan microarray screening and immunological evaluation of oligosaccharides revealed that tetramer4, comprising four repeated disaccharide units, is the key immunogenic epitope of CPS. The investigation into the influence of carrier proteins, adjuvants, and vaccination dose on immunogenicity demonstrated that an equivalent dose of glycoconjugate4-TT without adjuvant can induce a similar immune response as a licensed Hib vaccine (MINHAI Hib). Adjuvant-free4-TT glycoconjugates can induce both a humoral and a cellular immune response as efficiently as licensed Hib vaccine. This formulation exhibited protective efficacy in a mouse septic infection model through effective pathogen clearance from the circulation to the liver-resident macrophage Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells in a mouse septic infection model. In conclusion, a well-defined semisynthetic glycoconjugate vaccine candidate4-TT was developed with a more straightforward and adaptable manufacturing process and demonstrated excellent efficacy comparable to licensed Hib vaccine, providing a rationale for further evaluation in clinical trials."

However, its impact on circadian metabolic regulation remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated how chronic IH reshapes 24-hour hepatic and systemic metabolic programs in a mouse model mimicking OSA-associated chronic hypoxia. Through integrated circadian transcriptomic, metabolomic, and physiological 24-hour profiling, we show that 4 weeks of rest phase–restricted IH reprograms hepatic and systemic metabolism in a time-specific manner. This reorganization involves the coordinated circadian regulation of glucose, lipid, and redox pathways, with a shift away from oxidative metabolism toward oxygen-sparing processes such as gluconeogenesis, glycogen turnover, and lipid mobilization. These changes align with the hypoxic phase exposure and coincide with reshaped hepatic metabolite oscillations and systemic autonomic rhythms, supporting a functional adaptation to intermittent oxygen availability. Mechanistically, we identify the cAMP-CREB1 pathway as a driver of circadian transcriptional remodeling in the liver and a central integrator of IH-dependent adrenergic stress. Our findings establish chronic IH as a potent metabolic zeitgeber that rewires hepatic transcriptional and metabolic programs, revealing a circadian dimension to the metabolic consequences of sleep-disordered breathing."

We presented combinations of visual-only features, as found in natural flowers: colors of varying discriminability, paired with shapes or patterns. We found that the bees relied exclusively on colors when these were easy to discriminate, and did not learn pattern or shape features simultaneously. With harder to discriminate colors, the bees learned both color and shape or pattern features. Our results demonstrate that bumblebees flexibly adjust their learning strategies when presented with visual features of varying discriminability, to balance the investment in learning time and accuracy during multicue learning and decision making. A difference in learning dynamics suggests that blocking could serve as a mechanism to implement this strategy switch."

However, it is unknown whether the influence of social responsibility on decision-making acts primarily or directly on risk, loss, and ambiguity attitudes versus more general aspects of cognition. We report a series of experiments on objective magnitude judgments that demonstrate that the influences of responsibility on cognition and behavior extend beyond risk or ambiguity and act at the metacognitive level. Specifically, responsibility for others changes metacognitive biases, leading to a decrease in decision confidence without affecting choice accuracy.

However, the timing of their delivery to terrestrial planets remains unclear. Sulfur, selenium, and tellurium are volatiles, but also siderophile elements. Their abundances in Earth’s mantle can be used to determine whether volatile elements were delivered to Earth during or after the segregation of the core. Here, we experimentally measured their partition coefficients between core-forming metal and mantle silicate under pressure, temperature, and oxygen fugacity conditions relevant to a deep magma ocean. Our results show that these elements exhibit similar partitioning behaviors, indicating that core-mantle equilibrium preserves their chondritic relative abundances. If a volatile-rich late veneer has been delivered to Earth after core segregation, it must have been limited in mass, making up a maximum of 0.1% Earth’s mass. This suggests that volatile elements, including water, were accreted continuously during Earth’s growth rather than being delivered predominantly by a late veneer of volatile-rich material such as carbonaceous chondrites."

Here, we show that metabolic rates across flatfish species are largely invariant from poles to the equator, which points to an explanation for interspecific thermal sensitivity based on ecology and evolution rather than thermodynamic constraints. The explanation proposed here is that warm water provides a thermodynamic opportunity, not a mandate, for metabolic rate escalation when required for predator-prey interactions. Flatfish do not require metabolic escalation because of their reliance on camouflage that mitigates the greater predation intensity in tropical waters. These findings have strong implications for models attempting to diagnose the response of organisms to climate change and for macroecological patterns more generally."

In this study, we reconstructed centennial-scale variability of the SCSTF (1894–2022) using coral oxygen isotope (δ18O) and satellite observations. Besides prominent interannual and decadal variabilities, there exists a marked long-term decreasing trend at −0.14 ± 0.02 Sv (1 Sv = 106m3s−1) per decade for the total SCSTF volume transport. Consequently, the SCSTF transport decreased by 35 ± 5% over the past 129 years in comparison with the mean value of 5.15 Sv. Using the Time-dependent Island Rule theory, we further reveal that the intensified trade wind in the tropical western Pacific drives the SCSTF slowdown. The findings substantially contribute to investigating the physical, ecological, and biogeochemical changes in the SCS and the Indo-Pacific Oceans."

The enteric nervous system (ENS) controls antimicrobial defense reactions within the intestine through neuron-released mediators. Here, we show that subclinical doses of BoNT/A and BoNT/B, which are not sufficient to cause botulism when released in the intestinal lumen, paralyze ENS neurons favoring infection by prototypic bacterial pathogens such asSalmonella entericaandShigella flexneri. The BoNTs reduce the release of mucin, decreasing the protective barrier against bacterial infection. These findings disclose previously unrecognized functions of BoNTs and roles in intestinal infections. Moreover, they indicate that BoNTs are valuable tools for investigating the ENS neuron involvement in the intestinal defense reactions."

They profoundly reshape soil landscapes and influence the carbon cycle, yet the extent and drivers of their impact remain highly uncertain. By integrating field observations from 14 well-drained terrace landforms across a climatic-geochemical gradient with a data synthesis, we show that changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks after terracing are governed by two coupled C turnover-geomorphic processes: replacement of lost topsoil C at eroding positions and stabilization of buried SOC at depositional positions. Climate strongly modulates these processes by shaping soil geochemistry and plant productivity, which in turn control SOC replacement and stabilization within terraces. Thus, terracing effects on SOC stocks shift from consistently positive in humid regions to mixed (positive and negative) outcomes in dry regions. This study establishes a framework for elucidating SOC dynamics in well-drained terrace systems and provides a scientific basis for targeted management strategies to enhance C sequestration in agricultural terraces globally."

Ocean models often neglect the heat exchange needed to melt ice shelves and icebergs. Simulations presented here indicate that this omits the largest ocean heat sink on the Antarctic continental shelf, representing 60% of heat supplied across the shelf break.

Nanotechnology holds promise for improved drug delivery to the brain, yet the efficacy of nanomaterials crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is quite limited, and long-term intracranial retention of nanomaterials may provoke neurotoxicity. Leveraging the anti-inflammatory, BBB-crossing, and biosafe properties of hydrogen (H2), we develop an inflamed vessel–targeted/anchored H2–producing system by modifying ZrSi2nanoparticles with a P-selectin–binding peptide (ZSNP), mimicking P-selectin/P-selectin glycoprotein ligand–mediated innate immune recruitment. Rather than relying on nanoparticle penetration into the brain parenchyma, this design enables ZSNP to anchor at the BBB vasculature, where it locally and continuously generates H2via hydrolysis. The released H2traverses the BBB, exerting cytoprotection through antioxidant and immunomodulatory mechanisms that coordinate multicellular recovery processes. Furthermore, ZSNP promotes microglia-mediated angiogenesis and neurogenesis, guides axonal projections along neovascular trajectories, and facilitates microglia-neuron interaction via the noncanonical Wnt/Ca2+pathway. This reconstruction of the neurovascular network supports the reintegration of functional neural circuits, leading to structural and functional recovery that surpasses the effects of edaravone.

Bottom-up ultrathin plasmonic nanogaps, such as nanoparticle-on-mirror (NPoM) structures, are ideal for ultrasensitive probing due to their extreme light confinement, but their perceived sealed geometry has cast doubt on the existence of accessible transport pathways. Here, counterintuitively, we demonstrate that ubiquitous ligand-capped NPoM-type nanogaps can form a natural quasi–two-dimensional nanochannel, supporting molecular exchange and infiltration over unprecedented length scales (≳5 micrometers) with an extreme aspect ratio (>103). Using wavelength-multiplexed Raman spectroscopy, we resolve the underlying centripetal infiltration pathway with a spatial resolving power of ~20 nanometers. This redefines the NPoM architecture as a sensitive and hotspot-accessible platform, enabling in situ, real-time, reusable monitoring of analyte with ~10−11molar. This work establishes a versatile platform for advancing super-resolved in situ molecular sensing, nanoscale physicochemical studies, and on-chip nanophotofluidics."

Advanced techniques—crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and cryo–electron microscopy—have facilitated the determination of more than 180,000 protein structures, all cataloged in the Protein Data Bank. This comprehensive repository has been pivotal in developing deep learning algorithms for predicting protein structures directly from sequences. In contrast, RNA structure prediction has lagged and suffers from a scarcity of structural data. Here, we present the secondary structure models of 1098 primary microRNAs and 1456 human messenger RNA regions determined through chemical probing. We develop a deep learning architecture inspired from the Evoformer model of Alphafold and traditional architectures for secondary structure prediction. This model, eFold, was trained on our newly generated database and more than 300,000 secondary structures across multiple sources. We benchmark eFold on two challenging test sets of long and diverse RNA structures and show that our dataset and architecture contribute to increasing the prediction performance, compared to similar state-of-the-art methods. Together, our results reveal that merely expanding the database size is insufficient for generalization across families, whereas incorporating a greater diversity and complexity of RNA structures allows for enhanced model performance."

Herein, we introduce interfacial functional ligands that not only optimize the electronic structures of active sites but also regulate the interfacial microenvironment for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Specifically, the pore edge–hosted FeF3O2sites enable a favorable electronic structure to generate*OOH intermediates and simultaneously promote the interfacial transport of hydroxide for enhanced OER kinetics. The F ligands in FeF3O2sites interact with interfacial water strongly via H-bonding to promote H-bond network connectivity, thus encouraging the temporally concerted proton transfer during hydroxide diffusion. Consequently, FeF3O2sites realize the 331.5-fold enhancement in turnover frequency for alkaline OER over the NiOOH and efficient water electrolyzers (1.663 voltage at 1.0 amperes per square centimeter at 60°C, durably operating at 1.0 amperes per square centimeter > 1200 hours)."

Mahon,Causal parametric language mapping with electrical stimulation during awake neurosurgery,"Functional mapping with direct electrical stimulation (DES) is widely used during awake neurosurgery to generate causal evidence about person-specific neuroanatomical organization. According to a long-standing clinical and scientific paradigm, if the application of DES to a given brain region does not result in performance errors, that site is considered to be uninvolved in the task. Here, we show that both error rates and performance speed on correct trials are parametrically modulated by when DES starts and stops relative to the timeline of task-driven processing in stimulated brain areas and networks. We propose a framework, causal parametric mapping, which moves beyond the classic approach of binarizing the effects of DES on behavior into “positive” and “negative” mapping trials. Causal parametric mapping offers a method to functionally dissect separable processing stages in the human brain, in real time, with reversible causal evidence during invasive neurosurgical procedures."

Because some Wnt proteins can induce PCP in vertebrates, it has been proposed that Wnt concentration gradients provide spatial cues for polarization. However, here, we present evidence that Wnt11 can regulate PCP in a gradient-independent manner. In the neural plate ofXenopusembryos, endogenous Wnt11 does not form an obvious gradient in the direction of PCP, but is polarized at cell boundaries together with core PCP components. Wnt11 polarization is dependent on core PCP components, while polarization of core PCP components can also be induced by Wnt11, indicating a mutual amplification loop between Wnt11 and core PCP components in PCP formation. Furthermore, Wnt11 and core PCP components compose an intercellular loop to coordinate the direction of polarity. Thus, we propose that local and reciprocal interactions between Wnt11 and core PCP components can generate PCP."

This means that fluidic manipulation and actuation of passive objects can be enabled and influenced by the individual spin rate of microscale robots, the number of microrobots, and their positions relative to the objects. We explore these parameter spaces and find that the fluidic torque generated by a magnetic microrobot collective can be exploited to apply bidirectional torque to concentric ring structures and demonstrate this through physical experiments and numerical simulations. Additionally, we demonstrate how the fluidic torque of the microrobots can be exploited to actuate gear trains, rotate comparatively large three-dimensional objects, dynamically self-assemble internally driven ring structures, and absorb and expel large numbers of circular objects. Last, we show emergent behaviors where the microrobot collective’s morphology and method of locomotion changes as a function of the spin rate of the microrobots and the size and shape of the surrounding objects."
