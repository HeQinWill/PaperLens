Using high-resolution satellite precipitation data from 1998–2023, this study investigates changes in the spatial inhomogeneity of TC rainfall across China. Results show that TC rainfall inhomogeneity decreases significantly by about 65%, indicating a reduced rainfall in historically high-TC-rainfall areas and an increase in low-TC-rainfall areas. Regionally, this decline is mainly governed by the intra‐regional component in East China, where opposing trends between high- and low-rainfall areas have substantially reduced spatial disparities. In contrast, North China shows a marked increase in TC rainfall, accompanied by increased intra‐regional but decreased inter‐regional inhomogeneity, largely offsetting each other. Other regions exhibit minor or insignificant contributions. These spatial reorganizations of TC rainfall in East and North China are closely linked to the northward migration of TC activity in recent decades, driven by reduced landfalling TCs over Taiwan and Fujian and increased inland penetration of TCs into East and North China. The findings reveal a restructuring of TC rainfall patterns and emphasize the growing regional contrasts in TC‐related hydroclimatic impacts, providing new insights for disaster risk assessments and regional climate adaptation strategies in China."

In the present climate, positive SAM phases enhance Ekman-driven northward nutrient transport, leading to delayed increases in chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations in the mid-latitude South Pacific. However, the extent to which this relationship will persist under future climate change remains uncertain. Here, we investigate future changes in the SAM–Chl-a relationship using Community Earth System Model version 2 Large Ensemble simulations under the shared socioeconomic pathway3−7.0 scenario. A subset of ensemble members that successfully reproduce observed present-day SAM–Chl-a lag correlations was selected for analysis. In the historical period (1970–2014), Chl-a anomalies in the mid-latitude eastern South Pacific show a distinct peak approximately three months after positive SAM events, associated with enhanced northward nutrient transport. In contrast, future projections (2070–2100) reveal a weakened or absent lagged response, coinciding with reduced westerly wind anomalies and diminished Ekman transport. These results suggest that the SAM’s influence to regulate marine productivity in the mid-latitude South Pacific may decline under continued climate change. This has important implications for future biogeochemical dynamics and highlights the need for high-resolution modeling to better represent fine-scale ocean–atmosphere interactions."

While past research has focused on tide-surge or tide-river interactions, the relationships among tidal constituents themselves remain unexplored. Here we present the first global analysis of tidal constituent co-variability using tide gauge records available since mid–20th century. For each gauge, we identify the dominant constituent and evaluate its rank correlation with other major constituents (M2, N2, S2, O1, K1, MK3, MS4) using a moving window approach that ensures representing nonlinear interactions in high temporal resolution. Correlations were first quantified over the full observational record to characterize the multi-decadal co-variability across the observation network. Subsequently, comparisons between an earlier period (1950–1980) and a more recent period (1981–2019) were conducted to evaluate the presence of nonstationarity in these relationships. Finally, correlation structures were examined under distinct El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases to assess the extent to which large-scale climate variability modulates these dependencies. Results show that tidal constituents exhibit significant co-variability at roughly one-fifth of stations analyzed, with significant changes over time. Significantly larger number of locations (almost twice) exhibit co-variability in the recent era when compared to the earlier period (especially in the North Pacific). ENSO further modulates these relationships, with distinct patterns found during El Niño and La Niña years. These findings reveal that tidal constituents do not vary independently, but co-evolve under both interannual climate variability and long-term change. Recognizing this overlooked dimension of tides provides new insight into tidal dynamics and has important implications for assessing future compound coastal flooding in a warming climate."

A typology for moving beyond the public–private binary in conservation and development,"Desert lakes worldwide are being lost to human water diversions and land use change, creating ‘sacrifice zones’ that benefit distant interests. In the American West, scholarly interest has focused on water diversions by both public and private interests as the primary driver of desert lake decline, underscoring how assumptions that public interests support conservation while private interests support development can be misleading. Land use and its underlying motives are also important as they modify surrounding desert basins and impact local social conditions in ways that also defy such assumptions, but are less examined in this context. How can we move beyond the binary of public and private interests to identify distinct patterns of sacrifice zone formation through land use? Here, we propose a typology that goes beyond the public–private binary to systematically measure landowner motives according to a landowner’s publicness, economic objective, and degree of absenteeism, identifying support-, speculation- and sacrifice-motivated landowners. We test three variants of this typology across eight desert basins with differing conservation trajectories. Our results show that (1) the motives related to mixed-use public parcels strongly shape basin-level summaries of motive in terms of area, underscoring their management importance for overall basin land use; (2) although sacrifice- and speculation-motivated private landowners are few, they hold consolidated estates; and (3) their land use activities likely have disproportionate social and ecological impacts. Case summaries of the dynamics for three representative basins further demonstrate the additional insights that could be generated by applying our typology longitudinally and pairing it with qualitative insights. This typology provides a systematic tool for characterizing landowner motives in sacrifice zones. Future research should focus on longitudinal applications and identifying appropriate indicators of social and ecological conditions."

Although numerous studies have quantified deforestation embodied in traded products, much less is known about the underlying economic and institutional factors that explain why some countries export or import more of it than others. This study addresses these questions by examining the determinants of embodied deforestation in international trade flows. Drawing on Factor Endowment Theory, we test whether income levels, land availability, and institutional quality influence the distribution of embodied forest loss between exporting and importing countries. Using a gravity model estimated through Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood, we assess how GDP, distance, trade composition, and governance shape embodied deforestation patterns in agricultural and livestock commodities. Results highlight a prominent role of GDP per capita as a driver of deforestation: a 1% increase in per capita GDP is associated, on average, with a 0.28% decrease in deforestation embodied in exports, but with a 0.88% increase in embodied deforestation imports, reflecting an outsourcing of land-use pressures. While developing countries embody comparatively more deforestation in their exports, higher-income importing countries increasingly shift the environmental burden of their consumption to other regions through imports. Domestic consumption factors, such as higher per capita meat demand, are also positively associated with embodied deforestation inflows: a 1 kg increase in yearly meat consumption per capita is linked to a 1.8% rise in embodied deforestation inflows. Overall, the findings highlight the structural asymmetries of global trade and underscore the responsibility of affluent nations in driving deforestation beyond their borders. They also suggest that both production- and consumption-side policies are needed to mitigate embodied deforestation in high-impact commodity sectors."

Using kernel principal component analysis and Gaussian mixture modeling, we identify five distinct transit system types: Metro Bus–Rail, Mid-Sized Urban, Hybrid Multimodal, Urban Specialized, and Diverse Operations. We also discover a gap in diesel consumption reporting (76% of systems), which are predominantly of the Mid-Sized Urban type. To bridge this critical data gap, we apply extreme gradient boosting to predict the diesel consumption for 1674 underreported systems. We then estimate lifecycle emissions, accounting for regional grid carbon intensity. The result highlights significant variability in diesel consumption and emissions across transit types, with Metro Bus–Rail systems contributing the highest emissions. To evaluate decarbonization potential, we simulate fleet electrification and grid decarbonization. Our scenario analyses indicate that up to 82% of 10.27 MMTCO2e diesel-based transit emissions can be eliminated through fleet electrification, with further grid decarbonization eliminating the remainder. These findings provide actionable insights for policymakers to prioritize electrification, optimize resource allocation, and support sustainable transit strategies in the U.S."

Changes to shallow subsurface hydrological processes can drive extensive ecological and biogeochemical changes in addition to potential surface hydrologic regime shifts. This study uses a pan-Arctic geospatial approach to classify shallow, unconfined Arctic aquifers (supra-permafrost aquifers) as topography-limited (TL) (characterized by low permeability, wet climate, and/or low slopes) or recharge-limited (high permeability, dry climate and/or steep slopes) based on the water table ratio framework. Under current conditions, the continuous and discontinuous permafrost zones were determined to be predominantly (65%) TL, with an average net decrease of 5.6% by the year 2100 under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 conditions. This apparent stability masks local-scale heterogeneity, with change in aquifer function projected at dispersed locations throughout the Arctic, and in clustered hot spots in Siberia and the central Canadian Arctic. Coastal zones around the Arctic are more TL (94%) compared to the overall average, leaving them especially vulnerable to ocean-driven impacts on groundwater such as subsurface seawater intrusion or groundwater flooding. Arctic coasts in Siberia and eastern Canada are also particularly susceptible to water table rise due to high relative sea-level rise which may exceed the active layer thickness and result in substantive changes to saturation. Classification results are sensitive to input values, particularly hydraulic conductivity, which remains a source of uncertainty in the analysis. Despite the sparsity of Arctic data, the available open-source datasets provide valuable insight into broad spatiotemporal trends in aquifer function and highlight particularly vulnerable regions and geographic areas where uncertainty should drive additional data collection and study. These results provide new context for conceptualizing changes to shallow Arctic aquifers as the climate evolves in the 21st century."

Predictive models have been developed to support contamination risk assessment and management strategies, typically relying on meteorological data from local weather stations. While these inputs offer high accuracy, their limited spatial coverage and lack of forecasting capability reduce their application as early warning systems and in-season decision support. This study evaluates the integration of ERA5-Land reanalysis and seasonal climate forecasts into AFLA-maize, a mechanistic model for predicting aflatoxin B1 contamination, to extend its spatial and temporal applicability. Using historical data from the Emilia-Romagna, Italy (2008–2025), we tested bias-adjusted ERA5-Land inputs and developed a hybrid forecasting approach combining reanalysis data for the early-season with adjusted forecasts for the later crop stages. Results show that simulations driven by ERA5-Land reproduced contamination probability in 91% of years compared to station-based results, supporting its use in regions with low quality observations or missing station networks. Hybrid integrations of bias-adjusted forecasts provided contamination risk assessments 3–8 weeks ahead of harvest, showing the trade-off between lead time and accuracy. Forecast initialized later in the season (August) achieved much higher accuracy (up to 91%) but offer less time for action, whereas earlier initializations (June, July) bear larger uncertainty (accuracy of 88%–93%) but extended the decision windows. Furthermore, the availability of ensemble forecasts allows to quantify the uncertainty, providing probability ranges across members that support risk communication and early warning outputs. In summary, the presented approach extends AFLA-maize into a scalable and transferable tool for anticipatory risk management, supporting climate-resilient agriculture and food safety through publicly available meteorological data."

However, the contribution of ARs to rare flood risk, the resultant hazard from extreme precipitation events, remains unquantified. Here, using 2686 largely regulation-free catchments across the world, we find that in some regions ARs are linked to over 70% of the largest precipitation and streamflow events. AR related precipitation significantly shortens the recurrence intervals of large flood events, making them 2–8 times more likely. In parts of Northern America, Europe and Australia, rare flood events are up to 12 times more likely when an AR is present. We conclude that ARs play a crucial role in increasing the frequency of extreme hydrological events on a global scale."

A systematic review,"Livestock underpin livelihoods and food security in Africa, using marginal lands to produce high-quality protein for the household or as a source of income. For mixed farmers, livestock provide draught power, manure for fields, and buffer variations in crop productivity. Livestock also hold cultural significance. However, African livestock farmers are especially vulnerable to climate hazards, and attempt to reduce impacts in different ways, with varied outcomes. A synthesis of the state of knowledge of livestock farmers’ responses to climate variability and change would assist policymakers and practitioners to make informed decisions, and guide researchers towards gaps that need to be filled. To that end, we systematically reviewed articles published between 2014 and 2022—the period between the end of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment and the end of the Sixth, recording study metadata, farmers’ responses, and their drivers, outcomes, barriers and enablers. We included 186 articles from 32 countries (most frequently Kenya or Ethiopia), from which 1089 responses were coded for analysis. Responses by small-scale farmers of cattle, sheep and goats, typically as part of mixed crop-livestock systems, were most common (n = 816), with few documented responses of commercial farmers (121). Most responses pertained to changing herd management (437), followed by feed or pasture management (294). Drought was the most common climate driver of responses (567), while the most commonly mentioned barriers included financial constraints (116), a lack of knowledge or information (98), and government support (67). While there is a sizable body of literature on climate impacts and adaptation of livestock farmers, notable gaps included any work in Central and Northern Africa, and responses of commercial farming systems. In general, future research should focus on these gaps and on improving the depth of information collected, such as on barriers and enablers of adaptation, to better inform future interventions."

These tyhoons also push ozone-rich air from high altitudes down to ground level. When multiple north-moving typhoons occur back-to-back, they cause widespread and long-lasting ozone pollution. Vertical air currents during these events can contribute up to 16 % of boundary layer ozone. 
 Ozone (O3) pollution has emerged as one of the core challenges in atmospheric environmental governance in China, particularly in Guangdong Province. As a crucial weather system during East Asian summers, typhoons exert profound influences on O3 formation, accumulation, and transboundary transport through variations in their tracks and intensities. This study examined 237 historical typhoons approaching or making landfall in China between 2013–2023 classifying them into three distinct trajectory types using k-means clustering: westward-moving typhoons (Type 1), Distant northward-recurving typhoons (Type 2) and Proximal northward-recurving typhoons (Type 3). By integrating ground-based observations, reanalysis data, and WRF-CMAQ model simulations, the mechanisms through which typhoon tracks affect ozone pollution in Guangdong Province were investigated. The results demonstrate that for Guangdong Province, proximal northward-recurving typhoons induce more extreme meteorological conditions compared to westward-moving and distant northward-moving typhoons. The analysis of consecutive northward-moving typhoons' impact on ozone pollution in Guangdong Province reveals that surface photochemical reactions served as the dominant factor, while vertical downward transport of upper-level ozone acted as a secondary contributor. Nevertheless, the long-range vertical transport induced by typhoons cannot be neglected. During this event, vertical transport contributed up to 39.9 ppbv to near-surface (100 m) ozone concentrations, with cross-boundary-layer transport accounting for up to 16 % of boundary layer ozone concentrations, demonstrating that typhoon-induced vertical transport significantly enhances boundary layer ozone levels and consequently worsens surface pollution. Additionally, analysis of the backward trajectories and 3-dimensional ozone concentration fields of 237 typhoons indicates that northward-moving typhoons significantly enhance the downward transport of ozone, consequently increasing the ozone concentration at the central point of Guangdong Province by 2.5–14.0 ppbv (Type 2) and 0.3–14.5 ppbv (Type 3) within the 250–900 hPa layer."

Although their contribution to ozone formation became less abundant, they still significantly contribute to the formation of airborne particles. While this study shows clear improvements in air quality, it also highlights the need for further efforts. 
 Since 1994, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene isomers (BTEX) are monitored in the ambient air at Dübendorf (DUE) in the suburban area of Zurich city in Switzerland. Overall, BTEX concentrations decreased up to 89 % in ambient air in DUE notably due to the introduction of regulations concerning the air quality such as limiting benzene concentrations in car fuel or the introduction of the incentive tax on volatile organic compounds (VOC) in 2000 in Switzerland. While BTEX was one of the major VOCs compound classes in 1994 (33 % of the total non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC)), BTEX contribution to total NMHC significantly decreased to 6.3 % in 2024. Before 2000, traffic exhaust emissions were the dominant source of BTEX to the ambient air with a toluene-to-benzene (T : B) ratio of 2.4 ± 0.1. Since 2000, the contribution of vehicle emissions to toluene concentrations in ambient air in DUE during summer has decreased from 82 % to 65 %, with the remaining proportion emitted from solvent emissions. As BTEX are important ozone and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) precursors, the long-term measurements in Dübendorf was complemented with VOC data from the urban background station at Kaserne Zurich to assess the contribution of BTEX to ambient VOC composition. While the BTEX contribution to ozone formation potential (OFP) has decreased from 25 % in 2005 to 8 % in 2024, their relative contribution to SOA formation potential remains high, contributing to 80 % of the SOA formation potential of the total VOCs measured in Zurich in 2024."

Spuler,Signal processing to denoise and retrieve water vapor from multi-pulse-length lidar data,"A new processing method for lidar data obtained from rapidly changing laser pulse lengths enables measurement of atmospheric water vapor from the ground up to 6 km. The technique blends all captured data to reveal hidden water vapor structures, especially near the surface. This solution offers continuous, high-resolution insights, key for improving weather forecasts. It showcases how flexible laser technology can enhance atmospheric observation. 
 Recent hardware developments for the MicroPulse DIAL enable the transmitter to switch between output pulses that are “longer” (higher pulse energy) and “shorter” (low pulse energy) in duration on a shot-to-shot basis. While the longer laser pulses broadly result in higher signal-to-noise ratio, they have the shortcoming of blanking the detector in the lowest ranges and smearing out the scene in range. Conversely, shorter pulses enable observations closer to the instrument, smear the scene relatively little, but have low signal-to-noise ratio. In this work, we show that leveraging Poisson Total Variation with forward modeling enables merged estimates of backscatter and water vapor. This signal processing technique leverages the advantages of each pulse length configuration, providing better data availability and higher resolution over a broader altitude range than data processed using only one of the pulse lengths. An intercomparison with radiosondes demonstrates that this new hardware configuration and processing approach enable retrievals of absolute humidity starting at 100 m extending up to 6 km, capturing complex water vapor structure throughout this range. The retrievals are also contrasted with ERA5 reanalysis which suggests that there are instances where the model and reanalysis products are unlikely to produce accurate representation of water vapor fields in the atmosphere, thus emphasizing the value of continuous, high-vertical-resolution active thermodynamic profiling observations."

We built the first detailed atlas for China's key Yangtze River Delta using radar and optical satellites, then manually verified every installation over ten years. Our map reveals explosive growth to 145.4 km² and provides a vital tool for sustainable energy planning and environmental monitoring. 
 China hosts approximately 97 % of the world's water-surface photovoltaics (WPV), with nearly two-thirds of its national capacity concentrated in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), a densely populated economic powerhouse facing intense land-energy trade-offs. Despite this dominance, no high-resolution, decade-long inventory has existed to track this rapid expansion. WPV detection using optical RS imagery is severely limited by persistent cloud cover, water surface reflections, and spectral confusion, compromising long-term consistency over aquatic environments. Here, we developed a multi-sensor fusion framework integrating all-weather Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and annual composite Sentinel-2 optical imagery. Key features include six Sentinel-2 bands, spectral indices (NDVI, MNDWI, NDBI, NDPI, and SAVI), texture metrics, and dual-polarization SAR backscatter. We trained a Random Forest classifier on 55,849 verified samples to generate annual WPV maps for 2015–2024. Afterwards, we applied post-processing procedures, including noise removal, patch merging, and area thresholding, and further validated installation years and eliminated errors through manual inspection of Google Earth time-series imagery. The well-constructed dataset of the first 10 m-resolution WPV atlas for the YRD maps 401 validated projects with a cumulative area of 145.4 km2 by 2024. It outperforms existing global PV inventories with an overall accuracy of 97.3 % and a Kappa coefficient of 0.94. The results reveal rapid expansion from 17.4 km2 in 2015 to 145.4 km2 in 2024, with 87 % deployed on natural lakes, with a marked shift in leadership from Jiangsu to Anhui, and clear spatial clustering near grid infrastructure and stable water bodies. This high-fidelity inventory provides a robust foundation for monitoring WPV evolution, assessing environmental impacts, and informing sustainable energy planning in the world's leading floating solar region."

However, its transport in large lakes remains poorly understood due to its instability, scarcity, and heterogeneity, as well as the complex hydrodynamics of lakes. We developed biodegradable synthetic DNA particles (sDNAp) that encapsulate DNA fragments with unique sequences to serve as quantitative tracers for investigating eDNA transport. This sDNAp tracer was deployed in Cayuga Lake (NY, USA; 172 km2 surface area) and its dispersion was monitored for 33 h over ∼11 km2 through depth-integrated water sampling followed by quantitative PCR analysis. Despite gram-scale release quantities, sDNAp were detected over 7 km from the source after more than a day, at concentrations as low as ∼3–5 particles mL–1, demonstrating high sensitivity and durability. A 3D hydrodynamic model incorporating wind-driven circulation and stratification reproduced key dispersion patterns observed in the field. Forward particle-tracking simulations captured both horizontal advection and vertical displacement, while backward simulations revealed that vertical position sensitivity limited the accuracy of source attribution.

However, the key drivers and causal mechanisms remain unclear, hindering the design of biochar strategies for carbon sequestration. This study integrated machine learning (ML) and partial least-squares path modeling (PLS–PM) to establish an interpretable causal framework. Using a global data set, a high-precision random forest model quantified the primary drivers. Soil properties dominated the predictions (60.27%), with phosphorus (P) (optimal level: <0.7 g/kg) and pH emerging as the most critical factors. Nonlinear thresholds showed that the Cd role shifted from positive to insignificant beyond 5.8 mg/kg. PLS–PM quantified the causal pathways: (i) physicochemical interactions (e.g., P competitive adsorption reduced SOC by β = −0.62, p < 0.001); (ii) climate-mediated cascades; and (iii) biochar aging feedback. Validation of the model using independent data sets beyond the training scope demonstrated a reasonable relative ΔSOC prediction error range (±6%–20%). SOC accumulation increased with higher pH, Cd content, and biochar dosage. Site-specific design should prioritize (i) inherent soil properties (pH and P), (ii) Cd gradients, and (iii) tailored biochar parameters. The framework enhances biochar design to optimize SOC sequestration and synergistic Cd management."

By adsorbing hazardous compounds, such as organic pollutants, MPs can alter the transport and fate of these pollutants. To address this, we developed a multimodal Siamese neural network named microplastic-pollutant adsorption prediction (MPAP), trained on 1101 adsorption records covering 403 compounds and six MP types. Unlike previous models that rely on single-feature representations, MPAP leverages a multimodal architecture that integrates molecular fingerprints and graph embeddings to capture chemical structures, along with microplastic morphological features such as the MP type and particle size, as well as water chemistry parameters, enabling a more comprehensive characterization of sorption behavior. The model outperforms baseline models with R2 = 0.869 on the validation set and 0.863 on the test set. Experimental validation using batch adsorption experiments with six previously untested pollutants, quantified via liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry or microwave plasma torch ionization–mass spectrometry in different environments, confirmed a strong predictive performance. To support broad application, we provide an open-access web platform (http://mpap.envwind.site:8004/) for rapid, high-throughput prediction across diverse MP–pollutant–water environment scenarios."

Accurate monitoring of its emissions is thus essential for understanding biosphere–atmosphere feedbacks, particularly under climate extremes. We develop a regression-based inversion framework to estimate global monthly biogenic isoprene emissions (2019–2024), integrating TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) HCHO columns and LMDZ-INCA atmospheric transport model. Our inversion yields a global annual mean emission of 456 ± 249 TgC yr–1, with a minimum in 2022 (437 TgC, 1.4σ below multiyear mean) and a peak in 2024 (477 TgC, 1.5σ above), closely tracking global annual land surface temperature variations (R = 0.95). Emission anomalies are most pronounced in tropical regions contributing over 80% of global total anomalies during the 2020–2023 La Niña (−30 TgC), 2023–2024 El Niño (+11 TgC), and 2024 Northern Hemisphere extreme warming events (+15 TgC). Attribution analysis confirms surface temperature as the dominant driver of biogenic isoprene anomalies, with increasing sensitivity in Northern high-latitude zones under warming conditions. The updated emissions improve spatial agreement and reduce bias in LMDZ-INCA simulations against independent satellite-based isoprene and ground-based HCHO observations. This work delivers the first HCHO-constrained global isoprene emission data set through 2024, supporting air quality, oxidant budget, and climate feedback studies."

Moreover, the accumulation of electrolytic manganese residue (EMR) hinders the growth of the manganese industry and poses a serious environmental threat. However, electrolytic manganese residue contains valuable metal elements, including Fe and Mn, which can be utilized in preparation of low-temperature denitration catalysts. In this work, a series of samples were prepared using electrolytic manganese residue as a raw material via leaching oxalic acid solutions of varying concentrations and precipitation with ammonia. And the EMR-OA-0.10 (leached by 0.10 mol/L oxalic acid solution) demonstrated excellent NH3–SCR activity and good SO2 resistance, exceeding 90% NOx conversion during 100 to 250 °C. The characterization results revealed that EMR-OA-0.10 had more Mn–O–Fe active structures, which were found to possess superior NH3 and NO adsorption properties, more surface active oxygen species, and higher Mn4+ contents, which promoted the adsorption and activation of reaction species. Density functional theory calculations and in situ DRIFTS experiments revealed that the NH3 species adsorbed at Fe sites within Mn–O–Fe active structures exhibited a stronger reactivity. Furthermore, Mn–O–Fe structures have shown to activate the chelated bidentate nitrates formed at Mn sites, thereby increasing the quantities and variety of the active nitrates. Ultimately, both Eley–Rideal and Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanisms were found to coexist on the samples surface, with the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism dominating."

These dual capabilities are vital to manage emissions and supply metals (e.g., nickel) necessary for rapidly upscaling energy and data technologies. To understand subsurface carbonation reaction pathways and assess mineralization potential in the Tamarack Intrusive Complex (TIC), we reacted a suite of Tamarack Bowl intrusion olivine (BIO) samples with aqueous-dissolved and liquid or supercritical CO2 (scCO2) at 90 bar and 21–90 °C. Samples were characterized pre- and postreaction with multiple geochemical and mineralogical techniques, and results indicate mineral dissolution followed by magnesite precipitation. Pseudo in situ Identical Location Transmission Electron Microscopy (IL-TEM) experiments revealed that a carbonation reaction of TIC BIO peridotite with water-saturated scCO2 formed aragonite nanocrystals on an altered plagioclase surface and induced dissolution of nickel-bearing forsteritic olivine. The presence of nanoscale-resolved carbonation products identified by IL-TEM, coupled with carbonate transformation rates quantified in batch reactions, suggests that the TIC BIO resource can conservatively store 320–1,070 million metric tonnes (MMT) of CO2 via mineralization while mobilizing 0.9–3.1 MMT of nickel if only 5% of the TIC rock volume is accessed."

Janiga,Subseasonal Forecasts of TC Activity in the Western North Pacific in Navy's Earth System Prediction Capability,We evaluate the ability of Navy's Earth System Prediction Capability (Navy ESPC) to forecast tropical cyclone (TC) activity in the Western North Pacific basin in the subseasonal timeframe. Navy ESPC forecasts of TCs were added to a logistic regression model that also incorporated the Madden‐Julian Oscillation (MJO) and El Niño Southern Oscillation to forecast basin‐wide TC activity. The skill of the statistical‐dynamical model at 14‐day lead times doubled when forecasted accumulated cyclone energy from Navy ESPC was incorporated into the model. This suggests that Navy ESPC TC tracks contain information that is independent from the MJO. An analysis of forecasted TC positions also suggests that the model has skill in forecasting TC track out to 21 days. These results suggest that combining TC tracks and large‐scale environmental information in a statistical‐dynamical model offers a promising path forward for predictions of basin‐scale or even sub‐basin‐scale subseasonal TC activity.

Using ground‐based instruments (Redline Emission Geospace Observatory and TREx) and satellite measurements (Swarm and DMSP), we characterized the associated ionospheric conditions. The results suggest that a visible STEVE may require density depletion, electron heating, and intense ion drifts. The observed STEVE‐Picket Fence transition indicates that these phenomena may share the same subauroral ion drift channel, yet are modulated by local Ne structure. These findings provide new insights into the physical differences between STEVE and Picket Fence emissions, and offer key observational constraints for understanding magnetosphere‐ionosphere coupling in subauroral regions."

This study investigates the performance and challenges of using TEMPO versus TROPOMI measurements to constrain anthropogenic nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. The accuracy of TEMPO and TROPOMI NO2 tropospheric columns are assessed using Pandora observations, finding a low bias of 9%–12.3% in TEMPO, and TROPOMI data during August 2023, while TEMPO midday and late afternoon observations are less of low bias. Top‐down NOx emissions derived by midday TEMPO and TROPOMI data are generally consistent over urban areas, being 5%–20% lower than bottom‐up emissions provided by the 2021 GReenhouse gas And Air Pollutants Emissions System (GRA2PES), and align with 2023 GRA2PES emissions, demonstrating the reliability of using satellite data for timely updates of bottom‐up inventories. However, assimilating additional morning/late afternoon TEMPO data leads to the poorest top‐down NOx emissions, likely resulting from larger negative measurement biases. NOx emission inversions effectively mitigate NOx overprediction, though the top‐down NOx emissions might be over‐corrected in urban cores. NOx emissions optimization also improves ozone forecasts by reducing the model's positive biases, especially when assimilating midday TEMPO data. Our study suggests that TEMPO midday observations provide better constraints on the magnitude and spatiotemporal variation of anthropogenic NOx emissions than TROPOMI, while morning TEMPO v3 data should be used cautiously due to potential negative impact on NOx emissions inversion."

The analysis identifies 439 SBJ events, with a mean maximum wind speed of 25.6 ms−1 ${\text{ms}}^{-1}$ parallel to the Sierra, an average duration of 14.2 hr, and a typical altitude of maximum wind near 1.05 km. Previous studies show that many extreme cool‐season precipitation events occur when landfalling atmospheric rivers (ARs) and SBJs coincide. During the study period, 220 ARs made landfall at San Francisco with 65% of them containing an SBJ. Alternatively, only 43% of SBJs occurred during a landfalling AR at San Francisco. Stronger SBJs also tended to coincide with higher IVT and stronger ARs, while weaker SBJs aligned with weaker ARs. ARs with higher IVT values also more frequently contained an SBJ. A precipitation analysis revealed that SBJ events accounted for up to 40% of the cool‐season precipitation, with maxima from the coast north of San Francisco through the Central Valley and into the Mt. Shasta–Trinity Alps region. AR events similarly contributed up to 50%, with a similar spatial pattern. When SBJs and ARs occurred together, they produced more than 30% of the seasonal precipitation, with maxima across the coastal ranges and into the northern Central Valley. Zonal and meridional precipitation transects across Oroville (39.5°N, 121.6°W) further illustrates how SBJs and ARs enhanced precipitation over the northern Central Valley, the Sierra, and the Mt.

These contrail‐cirrus contribute significantly to the aviation‐induced radiative forcing. While past modeling studies have examined contrail‐cirrus across various atmospheric and aircraft‐type dependent parameters, they have focused on conventional kerosene combustion. In this study, we investigate how the switch to an alternative propulsion system, such as hydrogen combustion, may alter contrail‐cirrus properties using the large‐eddy simulation (LES) model EULAG coupled with the Lagrangian Cloud Module (LCM), a particle‐based microphysics module. Building on prior work that modeled hydrogen contrails during the vortex phase, we use those results to initialize the subsequent contrail‐cirrus evolution. We explore a wide range of background meteorological conditions, including variations of ambient temperature, relative humidity with respect to ice, vertical wind shear, and updraft velocity, and assess two aircraft types. Key contrail properties, such as total ice crystal number and mass, are found to be most sensitive to the initial number of ice crystals and ambient temperature. We show that reducing the number of initially formed ice crystals substantially decreases contrail radiative impact. This is primarily due to a shorter contrail‐cirrus lifetime, driven by the earlier onset and more efficient sedimentation of the fewer but larger ice crystals. Moreover, the relationship between radiative impact and initial ice crystal number is nonlinear, consistent with previous studies."

We examine how cloud‐surface coupling (or the strength of the marine boundary layer (MBL) stratification that limits vertical turbulent mixing and convection) impacts the vertical transport of aerosols, and how injected aerosols influence cloud properties and associated cloud radiative effects during the SCT. By injecting aerosols at different stages of the SCT, noting that cloud is more decoupled from the surface over time due to entrainment warming, we find that cloud‐surface coupling significantly affects aerosol vertical transport. However, injection timing (before drizzle if any) does not notably affect the SCT and the efficiency of marine cloud brightening, because aerosol number concentrations due to injections at different times rapidly converge before the transition onset. By varying the background aerosol concentration, we find that injected aerosols can significantly extend the persistence of stratocumulus decks by suppressing precipitation in clean environments but have little impact on stratocumulus breakup with higher background aerosol concentrations due to saturated aerosol effects. In clean MBLs, the SCT‐delay‐induced increase in cloud fraction dominates the overall cooling effects in response to aerosols, followed by Twomey effects. These cooling effects are slightly offset by decreased liquid water path (LWP) due to entrainment drying. In polluted MBLs, the Twomey effect is more dominant, followed by cloud fraction adjustments, and these coolings are also partly offset by LWP adjustments. All the simulations are made in relatively small domains in which injected aerosols are homogenized over a short time scale."

Using the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System FluxByCldTyp data set, this study investigates how temporal variations in total top‐of‐the‐atmosphere CREs are influenced by changes in the physical properties and fractional coverages of 42 individual cloud types and their broader categories over a 19‐year period. The analysis spans the tropical belt (25°S–25°N) and several convectively active regions, including the Tropical Western Pacific (TWP) and Africa. Our results show that variability in total CREs is primarily driven by changes in cloud fraction rather than microphysical properties. High clouds—particularly cirrostratus and deep convective clouds—exert strong negative correlations with shortwave CREs and strong positive correlations with longwave CREs, with correlation magnitudes reaching ±0.90 in the TWP. Low clouds, especially shallow cumulus, exhibit opposite correlations, partly due to obscuration by upper‐level clouds. While properties like total cloud water path, optical depth, and particle size influence cloud type‐mean CREs, their correlations with total CRE are relatively weak and largely due to co‐variability with total cloud amount. These correlations are generally more distinct and stronger within regional domains than across the tropical mean. Additionally, strong interrelationships are found among cloud categories, with high and low clouds often varying inversely. These results underscore the importance of cloud type‐specific contributions to radiative budget variability, providing observational benchmarks for climate model evaluation and cloud feedback studies."

Equitable management offers a path to water security, according to a machine learning forecasting model applied to future development scenarios. 
 The global water-scarcity crisis is fundamentally driven by inequality, yet most forecasts overlook equity as a causal factor, leading to misdiagnosed problems and ineffective solutions. Here we develop a machine-learning-based global water-use forecasting model to project future water use and scarcity under distinct Shared Socioeconomic Pathways representing alternative development trajectories. Drawing on decades of historical data on human adaptation and resource use, the model predicts that by 2050, 6.5 billion people—equivalent to 65.5% of the global population—will face severe water scarcity under a high-challenge fragmentation scenario. By 2100, this figure is projected to rise to 8.0 billion, or 63% of the global population, far exceeding most previous estimates. Our analysis shows that a high inequality pathway directly amplifies water-scarcity risk. Critically, a technology-driven pathway improves aggregate water-use efficiency but concurrently deepens social and spatial inequalities. These findings underscore the need to move beyond purely technological fixes towards integrated, equitable water management, demonstrating that greater justice is inseparable from greater water security.

 Extreme coastal flooding often arises when large-scale climate patterns and local ocean–atmosphere variability combine to magnify water levels beyond what communities can withstand. Understanding and anticipating these interactions is essential for protecting vulnerable coastlines. Here we aim to determine how two major modes of climate variability—the El Niño/Southern Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation—individually and jointly influence extreme coastal water levels worldwide. Using global observational and reanalysis datasets spanning 1958–2023, we analyse their separate effects and diagnose potential nonlinear interactions through statistical and process-based methods. We show that specific, seasonally aligned phases of these two climate modes interact nonlinearly, producing coastal water levels far higher than expected from either mode alone. These combinations enhance storm activity and wave conditions from the eastern seaboard of North America to western Europe and the Mediterranean. We further show that incorporating these nonlinear interactions into a conceptual climate model enables skilful seasonal predictions of coastal flooding hazards several months in advance, demonstrating the feasibility of reliable early-warning systems for coastal risk reduction.

 Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have demonstrated predictive validity across a range of cohorts and diseases, but quantifying their clinical utility remains a challenge. As PRS can be derived from a single biological sample and remains stable throughout life, we explore the potential of PRS to optimize existing screening programs. Via an integrated modelling approach, we quantify the potential clinical benefits arising from a knowledge of PRS across seven diseases with existing screening programs (abdominal aortic aneurysm, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, coronary artery disease, hypertension, prostate cancer, and type 2 diabetes). We identify individuals at high genetic risk (PRS OR>2) and very high genetic risk (PRS OR>3) and estimate the optimal screening ages for these genetically high-risk individuals, based on the equivalent risk to population-level risk at recommended screening ages. We then leverage published data on differential mortality and other outcomes, with and without screening-based interventions, to assess the potential benefits of tailoring screening age based on genetic risk. Very high risk individuals reach the risk level associated with usual starting screening age on average 10.8 years earlier, high risk individuals 8.9 years earlier and reduced risk individuals (OR<0.5) 16.8 years later. During this time, case enrichment (the ratio of the percentage of cases in the high PRS risk group and in the total population) in the high risk group is between 1.7 and 3.0, depending on the disease. Across all seven diseases, appropriate interventions following PRS-guided screening could reduce premature deaths in high-risk individuals by 23.3%. Knowledge of genetic risk, measured using PRS, has the potential to deliver substantial public health benefits when aggregated across conditions, and could reduce premature mortality by tailoring existing screening programs.

 Electrochemical hydrogenation of quinoxaline presents a promising alternative to traditional methods, yet is suffering from low current density and Faradaic efficiency due to the hampered hydrogenation process. Herein, we develop a cocatalytic system of Ru single atoms doped Co3O4 nanosheet (RuSA/ns-Co3O4) to optimize the interfacial H2O behavior by tuning the Ru single atoms concentration for accelerating the electrochemical hydrogenation of quinoxaline, which enables remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 82% toward 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxaline at high current density of 200 mA cm-2. Detailed experimental and theoretical studies reveal that Ru single atoms trigger interfacial charge redistribution, inducing an asymmetric local electric field that reconstructs interfacial H2O molecules into an H-down configuration. This reorientation remodels the hydrogen-bonded water network, shortens the distance between hydrogen atoms and the Co3O4 surface, regulates K•H2O availability, and enhances H2O dissociation to supply H*. Consequently, the membrane electrode assembly electrolyser exhibits a long-term stability of >100 h at 200 mA cm-2. Our findings highlight the prospect of interfacial water microenvironment for electrochemical hydrogenation of unsaturated N-heterocyclic compounds, with promising applications for the electrosynthesis of other valuable chemicals.

 Thousands of short open reading frames (sORFs) are translated outside of annotated coding sequences. Recent studies have pioneered searching for sORF-encoded microproteins in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics and peptidomics datasets. Here, we assessed literature-reported MS-based identifications of unannotated human proteins. We find that studies vary by three orders of magnitude in the number of unannotated proteins they report. Of nearly 10,000 reported sORF-encoded peptides, 96% were unique to a single study, and 12% mapped to annotated proteins or proteoforms. Manual curation of a benchmark dataset of 406 manually evaluated spectra from 204 sORF-encoded proteins revealed large variation in peptide-spectrum match (PSM) quality between studies, with immunopeptidomics studies generally reporting higher quality PSMs than conventional enzymatic digests of whole cell lysates. We estimate that 65% of predicted sORF-encoded protein detections in immunopeptidomics studies were supported by high-quality PSMs versus 7.8% in non-immunopeptidomics datasets. Our work stresses the need for standardized protocols and analysis workflows to guide future advancements in microprotein detection by MS towards uncovering how many human microproteins exist.

Here, the authors reveal how TEM-1 β-lactamase acquires cefotaxime resistance through reshaping of dynamic conformational ensembles and localized stability networks, offering insight into the molecular framework of the activity-stability tradeoff. 
 Our ability to understand protein evolution hinges on understanding how evolutionary landscapes are shaped at the fundamental protein level. Using TEM-1 β-lactamase we show that molecular traits related to the statistical ensemble nature of protein structure contribute to broader substrate specificity, active site-scaffold communication, and the selection of stabilizing substitutions. During the evolution of cefotaxime resistance, the initial mutation reorganizes the active site, introducing a new function conformation. Secondary substitutions improve catalytic efficiency by redistributing the ensemble and restoring a significant population of the original conformation, rather than by stabilizing the new conformation. Stability defects associated with initial mutations are not evenly disseminated but are clustered at specific distal scaffold elements. The capacity of mutants to independently modulate the populations of individual active site walls and scaffold regions through narrow residue networks, produces conformational epistasis and a combinatorial set of cefotaximase states, which enables local compensation of scaffold defects. Enzymes adapt by sampling new conformations while balancing destabilizing effects of mutations.

This treatment also enhanced bisphosphonate outcomes, strengthening the skeleton to counter adverse effects of cancer therapy on musculoskeletal tissue. 
 Aromatase inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of hormone-sensitive breast cancer, but their suppression of estrogen production accelerates bone loss, increases fracture risk, and negatively impacts muscle and fat metabolism. Here, we demonstrate that daily low intensity vibration, serving as a non-drug mimetic for exercise, protects musculoskeletal health in skeletally immature, female mice under complete estrogen deprivation. Subsequent improvements in vertebral bone density are paralleled by greater and leaner skeletal muscle mass and function alongside reduced fat accretion and circulating metabolites. In mature, estrogen deprived mice, vibration enhances weekly bisphosphonate treatment, improving bone density, cortical thickness, and mechanical resistance to fracture. These findings support the proposed hypothesis that low intensity vibration reduces musculoskeletal frailty in estrogen deprived mice, with stronger effects observed in younger cohorts, while in skeletally mature mice combination therapy with anti-resorptive treatment is necessary to suppress cancer-treatment induced musculoskeletal degradation. In young, estrogen-deprived female mice, the authors show that daily low-intensity vibration protected bone, muscle and fat metabolism.

Researchers found that endothelin-3 triggers electrical oscillations via T-type calcium channels, enabling these cells to contract like ‘mini muscles’ and colonize organs. 
 Enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs) colonize the gut during embryogenesis and migration defects give rise to Hirschsprung disease (HD). Mutations in GDNF/RET and EDN3/EDNRB are known to be causal in HD. Here, we show that migrating ENCCs in mice exhibit endogenous EDN3/EDNRB-gated calcium activity, mediated by chloride channels, T-type Ca2+ channels and inositol trisphosphate-sensitive intracellular-store release. We find that inhibiting Ca2+ activity results in ENCC migration defects, while exciting it promotes migration by increasing ENCC contractility and traction force to the extracellular matrix. Our study demonstrates that embryonic endothelin-mediated neural crest migration and adult endothelin-mediated vasoconstriction is one and the same phenomenon, taking place in different cell types. Our results suggest a functional link between rare mutations of CACNA1H (the gene encoding CaV3.2) and HD, and pave the way for understanding neurocristopathies in terms of neural crest cell bioelectric activity deficits.

The authors show that the metal can be regenerated electrochemically, supporting a reusable and sustainable cycle for hydrogen. 
 Hydrogen is a clean energy carrier with significant promises for a sustainable future, yet many established production routes operate under undesirable conditions or constraints, motivating the search for alternative production pathways. Here, our approach uses photothermal oxidation of liquid gallium to generate hydrogen from both freshwater and seawater. The exposure to light thermally heats up liquid gallium droplets to a temperature suitable for fast gallium-water interaction, producing gallium oxyhydroxide and hydrogen. The light exposure also boosts the reaction by breaking the oxide layer on the surface of liquid gallium immersed in water, allowing continuous interactions between the water molecules and the surface of liquid gallium droplets. The gallium oxyhydroxide that is produced can be electrochemically reduced, allowing metal regeneration, thereby enabling circular hydrogen production. In this work, we show that photothermal activation of liquid gallium provides a rapid and circular route for generating hydrogen from diverse water sources. Photothermal reactions between liquid gallium and water or seawater enable hydrogen production under light exposure.

 Changes in tropical cyclone (TC) frequency in a warming climate remain highly uncertain, with model simulations often yielding conflicting results. Here, through an analysis of 26 CMIP6 models under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, we project a decline in global TC frequency of 2–10% by the late 21st century. This decline is driven by an El Niño-like warming pattern, marked by amplified warming in the equatorial central-eastern Pacific, equatorial Atlantic, and North Indian Ocean. These non-uniform sea surface temperature (SST) trends weaken zonal SST gradients, suppressing the Walker circulation, and inducing Gill-type atmospheric responses to localized heating, in addition to an equatorward shift in the Intertropical Convergence Zone. These changes reduce upward motion across most basins, suppressing TC genesis. Additionally, radiative forcing reduces interhemispheric temperature contrasts, dampening the cross-equatorial Hadley circulation and further decreasing TC frequency, most notably in the South Indian Ocean. Our findings highlight the critical role of spatially heterogeneous SST warming in modulating TC activity and stress the need to reduce uncertainties in future SST projections. These insights advance the physical understanding of climate-driven TC projections and provide essential guidance for adaptation planning in vulnerable regions."

 One of the most intriguing attributes of Earth’s magnetic field is that it reverses polarity. Previous palaeomagnetic records mainly from the last ~17 million years indicate that the reversal process typically occurs over ten thousand or fewer years. Here we present an exceptionally resolved deep sea sedimentary palaeomagnetic record that captures two polarity transitions that occurred ~40 million years ago. These transitions occur over 18 and 70 thousand years and are much longer than the typical 10 kyr duration for younger reversals. Longer-duration transitions like these are calculated in numerical geodynamo models, suggesting that variable reversal durations are an intrinsic property of the geodynamo. This variability predicts that polarity transition durations can be much longer than 10 kyr. Occasional prolonged intervals of transitional, and weaker, geomagnetic fields would have exposed Earth’s Eocene environments to greater high-energy radiation from the sun for longer intervals of time, with potential impacts on biota.

 Regional climate variability manifests through distinct atmospheric regimes influencing weather, climate, and predictability. Yet, their response to global warming remains unresolved. Using a hundred realisations from the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble, we examine shifts in wintertime North Atlantic atmospheric regimes and the North Atlantic Oscillation before and after 1995, highlighting the detectable influence of anthropogenic warming on atmospheric circulation. The large-ensemble framework isolates internal variability by removing the ensemble mean. Under anthropogenic warming, the number of regime states associated with the forced response remains constant, although their spatial circulation patterns undergo substantial reorganisation. In contrast, internal variability alone exhibits a reduction in the number of regime states. Future projections indicate a shift toward more frequent positive phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation, accompanied by low-amplitude negative phases late in the century, alongside a marked decline in its variability and altered mid-tropospheric westerlies. Anthropogenic warming reorganises North Atlantic atmospheric circulation patterns, producing a shift towards more positive North Atlantic Oscillation phases, according to analysis of climate model simulations."

 The oxidative enrichment and isotopic fractionation of cerium (Ce) in contact with vernadite (δ-MnO2) serve as a proxy for past redox conditions in both terrestrial and marine environments. However, the molecular processes that govern the scavenging of Ce from the dissolved 3+ to the insoluble 4+ oxidation states remain obscure. Adsorption experiments on synthetic δ-MnO2 suggest that aqueous Ce(III) precipitates as ceric hydroxide (Ce(OH)4), an unknown mineral. Here, the atomic-scale structure of Ce in natural vernadite from ferromanganese crusts collected across the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans was examined using advanced high-energy-resolution extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. The findings provide direct evidence for the uptake of Ce as mononuclear Ce(IV) complexes at the layer-edge sites (DES complex) and Mn(IV) vacancy sites of vernadite. Density functional theory-based Gibbs free-energy calculations indicate that hydrolysis of the DES complex promotes the oxidation of Ce(III) to Ce(IV). Quantum mechanical calculations predict that the equilibrium 136Ce/140Ce isotope fractionation factor between Ce(III) dissolved in seawater and the Ce(IV) complexes can reach 1.2-1.3 ‰ at 25 °C, indicating that the 136Ce/140Ce ratio has high potential as a new paleoredox proxy.

 Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing provides an effective means of mapping near-surface air temperature (Ta) at large scales. However, cloud coverage introduces substantial data gaps, posing a considerable challenge for producing all-weather Ta datasets. This study proposed a two-step framework, termed Kernel-based Temporal Filling and Bias Correction (KTF-BC), to reconstruct all-weather remotely sensed Ta. In the first stage, a kernel-based temporal filling method was developed to estimate the theoretical clear-sky Ta for cloud-covered pixels. In the second stage, a bias correction model was constructed to adjust these theoretical estimates toward the actual Ta under cloudy conditions. The proposed framework was applied across China from 2019 to 2023 to generate spatially complete daily mean Ta at 1-km resolution. Validation against meteorological stations under cloudy conditions demonstrated consistently high accuracy, with R2 values up to 0.99, mean absolute errors (MAEs) ranging from 0.91 to 0.95 °C, root mean square errors (RMSEs) ranging from 1.21 to 1.26 °C, and biases close to 0 °C. The method effectively captured fine-scale thermal heterogeneity and demonstrated robust performance across varying cloud conditions and surface environments. This study provides a practical and reliable solution for reconstructing all-weather Ta from satellite observations."

 Detailed information on urban development types, e.g. residential, industrial, or transportation infrastructure, is essential for assessing urban growth rates, population dynamics, and environmental impacts. Earth observation imagery from Landsat and Sentinel-2 provides valuable data for characterizing urban areas and their development over large spatial extents and long temporal scales. However, mapping large areas over multiple decades poses several challenges. Specifically, the coarse resolution of historical Landsat data (30-m) limits the capacity to capture the spatial detail of diverse built-up types. Furthermore, existing mapping techniques—such as pixel-based, scene-based, and semantic segmentation - often face limitations in capturing spatial context, compromise mapping resolution, or rely on hand-crafted training data. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel workflow comprising two key components: (1) enhancing historical Landsat spatial resolution to 10-m using a generative super-resolution model, with a focus on synthetic images derived from spectral-temporal metrics, and (2) a “center-patch classification” method, wherein patch images serve as input for the central pixel classification. We applied the proposed methodologies to produce tri-annual maps of urban built-up classes—including Residential buildings, Industrial buildings, Open spaces, and Non built-up—across the Baltic Sea region for two decades (2000−2021). Evaluation of the baseline performance demonstrated that the 10-m maps derived from super-resolution Landsat data achieved higher accuracy than existing Sentinel-2-based products. Furthermore, when applied to earlier years within the study period, the super-resolution Landsat data consistently exhibited improved classification accuracy across all urban classes compared to native-resolution Landsat data."

 Climate change causes widespread increases in the frequency, magnitude, and extent of flood events, which pose increasing threats to societal and natural systems and highlight the urgency for timely and accurate flood mapping. However, previous flood mapping methods often require prior knowledge (such as the timing and location) of flood events that is usually incomplete or even unavailable when studying historical floods. Here we propose a new amplified deviation flood index (ADFI) using the time-series anomaly statistics from the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for mapping fully flooded areas without relying on prior knowledge of flood events. ADFI is constructed by considering two fundamentals of flood events: a decrease in backscatter intensity when ground objects are fully flooded and an increase in the variance of backscatter intensity owing to infrequently sudden occurrence of flood events, thus enabling a fast non-prior detection of flood events and extents. The performance of ADFI is assessed in four study areas across different climate zones of the globe, and the assessment shows that the overall accuracies of ADFI in all study areas exceed 93%, with precision >95% and recall >94%. Further comparison with two existing flood indices suggests that our proposed ADFI-based mapping method can improve the overall accuracy by 12.11%–3.97%, precision by 12.59%–10.17%, and recall by 54.32%–6.37%. A time-series flood mapping based on ADFI demonstrates that our proposed method enables a non-prior, precise, and fast detection of flood events and allows prompt monitoring of flood disasters. Our proposed approach enhances the efficiency and scalability of flood monitoring, providing a valuable tool for rapid disaster response and the reconstruction of long-term flood histories across diverse environments and climates."

 Mangroves are critical coastal ecosystems known for their carbon storage capacity, biodiversity, and role in shoreline stabilization. In Suriname, mangroves develop within a dynamic coastal setting shaped by migrating mudbanks and high sedimentation rates. This study examines how 30 structural metrics derived from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) vary across gradients of mangrove stand age and seaward distance. Forest stand age and yearly coastline positions were derived from Landsat time series data, enabling the integration of temporal and spatial drivers to uncover patterns of mangrove succession and structural development. Nonlinear growth models, more specifically the Chapman–Richards function, captured early growth and stabilization phases, while Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) provided flexibility to represent more complex structural changes observed in mature and decaying stands. Results show that structural metrics related to forest growth, such as canopy height and aboveground biomass density, increase rapidly during early successional stages but plateau beyond approximately 12 years or 2 km from the coastline. Complexity-oriented metrics, such as Foliage Height Diversity (FHD) and the Waveform Structural Complexity Index (WSCI), continue to evolve, reflecting increased vertical stratification in mature stands. By combining GEDI spaceborne LiDAR with Landsat-derived chronosequences, this study demonstrates how remote sensing can be used to monitor mangrove successional trajectories and structural complexity, including in inaccessible coastal regions. Our findings extend traditional mangrove successional models by quantifying how both temporal (age) and spatial (seaward distance) gradients jointly determine mangrove structure across the Surinamese coastline."

 Multi-source remote sensing data can highlight different types of information based on user needs, resulting in large volumes of data and significant challenges. Hardware and environmental constraints create mutual dependencies between information types, particularly between spatial data and other types, limiting the development of high-precision applications. Traditional methods are task-specific, leading to many algorithms without a unified solution, which greatly increases the computational and deployment costs of image fusion. In this paper, we summarize four remote sensing fusion tasks, including pan-sharpening, hyperspectral-multispectral fusion, spatio-temporal fusion, and polarimetric SAR fusion. By defining the spectral, temporal, and polarimetric information, as X, we propose the concept of generalized spatial-channel fusion, referred to as Spatial-X fusion. Then, we design an end-to-end network SpaXFus, a generalized spatial-channel fusion framework through a model-driven unfolding approach that exploits spatial-X intrinsic interactions to capture internal dependencies and self-interactions. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SpaXFus, e.g., SpaXFus can achieve four remote sensing image fusion tasks with superior performance (across all fusion tasks, spectral distortion decreases by 25.48 %, while spatial details improve by 7.5 %) and shows huge improvements across multiple types of downstream applications, including vegetation index generation, fine-grained image classification, change detection, and SAR vegetation extraction."

 Surface albedo plays a key role in forest–climate interactions by controlling the amount of solar radiation reflected back to the atmosphere. However, the effects of forest management practices, including total and partial disturbances, on these processes remain poorly understood, despite their importance for climate change mitigationThis study analyses how forest characteristics and disturbances influence the spatial and temporal dynamics of albedo during the growing season, through their effect on forest structure and cover. It also aims to highlight the importance of accounting for the influence of forest-related variables when predicting surface albedo. To achieve this objective, the apparent surface albedo was estimated over a 400  km2 humid boreal forest in eastern Canada using 22 snow-free Landsat 8 images from 2015 to 2021. Validation against observations from two flux towers yielded satisfactory results, with root mean square errors (RMSE) (0.013 ± 0.003 and 0.017 ± 0.004), and low biases (0.002 ± 0.005 and 0.004 ± 0.005) where the uncertainties correspond to 95% confidence intervals estimated by bootstrap resampling. Albedo estimates were then integrated into a random forest regression model along with predictors derived from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) and ecoforestry maps, including canopy metrics, forest disturbances, vegetation type and topographic derivatives. The model showed strong performance, with Kling-Gupta efficiencies (KGE) ranging from 0.85 (±0.0015) to 0.95 (±0.0006), RMSE from 0.005 to 0.013 (±0.00015) and mean absolute errors (MAE) ranging from 0.003 to 0.008 (±0.0001), demonstrating its robustness throughout the growing season. The average height of forest cover and the number of years since disturbances occurred were identified as key factors influencing albedo, demonstrating the importance of considering canopy structure and forest disturbance history when predicting surface albedo. This study underscores the critical importance of incorporating surface albedo considerations into forest management strategies aimed at optimizing climate regulation."

 Effective management of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in large, dense industrial complexes remains a critical challenge, as conventional monitoring methods are often too slow, limited in spatial coverage, and insufficiently resolved to pinpoint specific emission sources among thousands of facilities. This study introduces and validates a novel, multi-stage methodological framework which synergistically combines mobile Selected Ion Flow Tube Mass Spectrometry (SIFT-MS) with drone-based systems to enable rapid and precise source identification. The methodology begins with a wide-area mobile SIFT-MS survey, utilizing spatial statistics (Getis-Ord Gi∗) to identify hotspots, followed by targeted drone deployment for high-resolution aerial screening. This multi-stage approach successfully resolved distinct chemical signatures from adjacent sources that were not separable by ground-based monitoring alone. For instance, the framework differentiated a xylene- and ethylbenzene-rich profile near chemical manufacturing facilities, a MEK (methyl ethyl ketone)-rich profile near paint production, and a toluene- and acrolein-rich profile originating from a painting facility. The quantitative reliability of the drone-based sampling was validated through concurrent ground-level measurements, which demonstrated a high consistency in capturing the unique chemical signature at each location. This study demonstrates that the integrated mobile-drone framework provides a scientifically robust and efficient approach for characterizing industrial VOC emissions. By progressing from broad spatial screening to precise, evidence-based source identification, the methodology offers a powerful tool for targeted air quality management and has strong potential for application in highly complex industrial environments worldwide."

 Under global warming, extreme precipitation events (EPEs) have become frequent worldwide, with unclear microphysical differences in convective clouds. The weak and intense convection-induced EPEs (WeEPEs and InEPEs, respectively) over South China are identified with 10-year spaceborne dual-frequency precipitation radar observations. Results suggest that most EPEs occur in morning and nighttime. The distribution of WeEPEs (land-prevalent) and InEPEs (ocean-prevalent) is regulated by ocean thermal gradients, moisture transport, and orographic lifting. Weak sea surface temperature (SST) gradients and southerly moisture transport generate offshore moisture centers. The humid environment in the ocean may help the formation of WeEPEs. Conversely, strong SST gradients, coupled with stronger southerly moisture transport form inland moisture centers, with orographic forcing enhancing upward motion for strong convection. Weak convection generates extreme precipitation through synergistic increase in particle size and concentration below the 0 °C level, with high concentration being more critical. For oceanic events, InEPEs show a slightly larger particle diameter increase (0.11 mm) below the 0 °C level. However, WeEPEs have a much greater concentration increase (4.34 dB), resulting in a larger reflectivity factor increase (7.58 dBZ). For the most extreme precipitation, even if one of the warm-rain process and the ice-phase process dominates, the other still plays a significant role. Across eventsof different regions, continental WeEPEs reach peak rates through ice-particle melting (16.1 mm/h) and warm-rain coalescence to enhance particle size (70.6 mm/h); marine InEPEs (102.02 mm/h) rely on high liquid water path and efficient coalescence for maximum rates (warm-rain contribution: 43.3 mm/h)."

 The Taklimakan Desert is characterized by strong thermal forcing and a heterogeneous underlying surface, where sub-mesoscale motions and turbulence intermittency occur frequently and interfere with the accurate evaluation of land-atmosphere exchange fluxes. Based on a summer observation campaign at Tazhong Station, this study develops a spectra-based automatic classification algorithm that classifies the influence of sub-mesoscale motions and turbulence intermittency into four regimes. Regime 1, no intermittency and no influence of sub-mesoscale motions; Regime 2, large-scale intermittency with influence of sub-mesoscale motions; Regime 3, small-scale intermittency without influence of sub-mesoscale motions; and Regime 4, full-scale intermittency with influence of sub-mesoscale motions. The classification results show that Regimes 2 and 4, corresponding to large-scale and full-scale intermittency, occur most frequently. Large-scale intermittency can occur under almost any wind speed and stability conditions, but is stronger under nocturnal weak-wind stable conditions. Full-scale intermittency occurs predominantly under nocturnal weak winds or under near-neutral conditions with relatively strong winds during the day-night transition. For Regimes 2 and 4, empirical relationships are derived that relate large-scale and small-scale intermittency strengths to wind speed and wind shear, enabling automatic identification of turbulent intermittency. By removing sub-mesoscale motions, turbulent statistics are corrected for each regime and empirical correction schemes are proposed, which effectively improve estimates of turbulence intensity and counter-gradient transport in Regimes 2 and 4. These results deepen understanding of turbulent intermittency over the Taklimakan Desert and improve parameterizations of turbulent transport, with important implications for weather and climate predictions."

 Regional PM2.5 pollution frequently affects the Sichuan Basin in wintertime, posing significant risks to air quality and public health. In this study, six PM2.5 pollution events (2016–2019) were analyzed by utilizing hourly PM2.5 observations and reanalysis data to uncover the meteorological and topographic factors governing the accumulation and dissipation of these pollution events. During the accumulation phase, regional pollution developed in three patterns, with average increases in PM2.5 concentrations of 59.88%, 49.23% and 88.87%, respectively. In the dissipation phase, two patterns were identified, occurring in 25% and 75% of the cases, respectively. Based on weather classification, background circulation characteristics were identified, including pollution-prone types (Type1, Type2), types with dual-effect (Type3, Type6), and clean types (Type5). During the accumulation phase, variations in the upper-level northeastern cold vortex and subtropical high affected mid-level troughs and ridges, while deep basin topography and mountain ranges hindered vertical and horizontal pollutant dispersion, resulting in three distinct accumulation patterns. In the dissipation phase, plateau subsidence and northern cold fronts acted as primary clearing mechanisms, with cold air intrusion most effective for pollutant removal. These results highlight the role of local meteorology in shaping pollution evolution and provide a foundation for improved regional forecasting and tailored control strategies."

 Atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) structure over the Southern Ocean not only determines air-sea interactions but also influences local synoptic processes. However, due to the scarcity of observations, it has been rarely investigated. Here, based on the radiosonde observations conducted during the 37th Chinese Antarctic Scientific Expedition, the characteristics of the ABL structure over the Cosmonaut Sea and Bellinsgauzen Sea in the 2021 summer are revealed. The main findings are as follows: (1) The mean ABL height (ABLH) is lower in the ice-covered region than in the open water region, as enhanced radiative cooling and weakened sea-air heat exchange suppress the development of ABL. (2) The Thorpe method can well describe the vertical distribution of turbulent dissipation rate (ε) in ABL, and suggests that there is a noticeable difference in the vertical profile of ε between convective boundary layer and near-neutral boundary layer. (3) A case study of the most intense cyclone in January shows that the mean ABLH is higher during the cyclone period than during non-cyclone periods. Cold advection brought by the cyclone destabilizes stable stratification aloft, promoting the coupling of cloud and ABL. Concurrently, the cyclone-driven strong winds enhance low-level jets, intensify vertical shear, and thereby foster turbulent mixing. Together, these mechanisms strengthen turbulent activity and deepen the ABLH during the cyclone period."

Martín,Cost-benefit analysis of the nesting approach in HARMONIE-AROME for a supercell outbreak case study,"•The single-domain H500 simulation replicates supercell features while saving 30% in computational cost over nesting. •Simulations closely match OPERA radar, surface, and radiosonde data in reflectivity and convective parameters. •The nested approach offers finer spatial detail, but gains remain marginal versus the efficient single-domain setup. 
 Supercells are among the most hazardous convective systems, frequently producing large hail, destructive winds, and severe socio-economic impacts. The enhancement of weather simulations is identified as a primary strategy to optimise short-term forecasting. The present study investigates the performance of two high-resolution configurations of the HARMONIE-AROME model during a severe supercell outbreak over eastern Iberia on 31st July 2015, when six confirmed supercells caused significant damage. The setups tested include a two-step one-way nested approach (2.5 km outer domain and 500 m inner domain), and a single-domain configuration at 500 m resolution. The model outputs, which include reflectivity, precipitation and temperature, are validated against OPERA radar composites and surface observations. At the same time, key convective parameters, derived from the Murcia sounding, are analyzed to assess the pre-convective environment. Although the simulations demonstrate a similar structure to the observed event, the two-domain nested simulation offers a slightly superior depiction of reflectivity and thermodynamic profiles. Nevertheless, precipitation analysis reveals that while nesting improves moderate rainfall representation, it introduces larger errors for the most extreme amounts, limiting its overall benefit. The obtained gain is not sufficient to offset the 30% higher computational cost when the two-domain nested approach is used. The single-domain non-nested configuration demonstrates a superior level of efficiency, exhibiting equivalent accuracy while exhibiting a diminished resource requirement."

Suresh Babu,Synergy between land-sea breeze dynamics and photochemistry governs the diurnal variability of primary and secondary organic aerosols in a tropical coastal atmosphere,"•Organic molecular markers at a coastal site in tropical India were characterized by GC/MS. •Phthalates and aromatics were predominant classes of OA among the quantified organics. •Land-sea breeze circulations and photochemistry impact the diurnal variability of OA. •Monoterpene-derived SOA is higher compared to isoprene-oxidation. •Plastic emissions through evaporation and/or combustion are major sources of OA. 
 Coastal tropical regions are ideal for studying sources and processes of organic aerosols (OA) due to their high humidity and solar radiation, with land- and sea-breeze circulations influencing OA transport. However, their molecular characteristics in these areas are not well understood. This study analysed PM10 samples from Thumba (8.5°N, 76.9°E, approximately 3 m above sea level, a coastal location in tropical India), collected on day and night basis during the pre-monsoon period, detecting various classes of organic molecular markers including biomass-burning, biological, aromatic compounds, phthalates, and biogenic secondary organic compounds using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Results showed that total quantified organic compounds were twice as abundant during the daytime, indicating that photochemical processes are the primary sources. Phthalates and aromatics were the dominant compounds throughout the sampling period. This suggests that OA production primarily results from plastic evaporation during the day, while municipal solid waste burning occurs mostly at night, as confirmed by higher daytime phthalate emissions and nighttime terephthalic acid emissions (a tracer of plastic combustion). The presence of primary sugars and sugar alcohols during the day implies that plant emissions (pollen, spores) are significant sources of primary OA. In contrast, nighttime hydroxy and polyacids indicate secondary OA formation associated with anthropogenic emissions. Furthermore, monoterpene-derived secondary organic products were more prevalent than those from isoprene, especially during daylight hours. OA particles from biomass burning were minimal, as evidenced by lower levels of anhydrosugars and lignin/resin products. Overall, the present study highlights that the photochemical degradation of phthalates and the burning of municipal solid waste containing plastics are significant sources of OA at Thumba during the pre-monsoon, with land-sea breeze transport and photodegradation/evaporation influencing their diurnal variation. The prominence of phthalates and aromatics highlight the importance of understanding airborne nanoplastics and their climate effects in tropical coastal atmospheres."
