This study presents a comprehensive life cycle assessment of PTFE-associated nonpolymeric PFAS in China, using dynamic material flow analysis to quantify nonpolymeric PFAS flows, stocks, and emissions across all PTFE life stages from 2020 to 2050 and to reveal how regulatory policies drive compositional shifts in China’s relevant substances. Specifically, our results revealed significant growth in total nonpolymeric PFAS flows in 2023, with the average estimate of total nonpolymeric PFAS emissions reaching 1.06 × 105 kg, 95.5% of which originated from PTFE production. Under a high estimate, in-use perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) stocks surged from 21.0 kg in 2000 to 1.22 × 103 kg in 2019, and then reduced by 76.5% by 2050. These results align with China’s PFAS phase-out measures under the Stockholm Convention. Importantly, our results showed a regulatory-induced PFAS compositional transformation. By 2050, emerging PFAS will dominate relative to legacy perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) (3.64 × 104 kg): emerging PFAAs (2.30 × 104 kg), perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids (8.24 × 103 kg), fluorotelomer sulfonic acids (1.11 × 104 kg), and other PFAS. As China’s first life-cycle inventory study of PTFE-associated nonpolymeric PFAS, this research provides critical PFAS management insights and identifies production-phase controls as the most effective intervention point."

Traditional culture-based detection methods require long incubation times (typically 24–48 h) and often underestimate the microbial concentrations. In this study, we present a femtomolar-level sensitivity biosensor leveraging fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) for detecting adenosine triphosphate (ATP) derived from airborne bacteria. This biosensor utilizes a fluorophore-labeled cDNA (DNA) strand, an unlabeled ATP-specific aptamer, and graphene oxide (GO) that preferentially adsorbs single-stranded DNA over double-stranded DNA. An indirect hybridization approach was employed to avoid the structural interference often observed with directly labeled aptamers, thus improving hybridization efficiency and fluorescence contrast. Under optimized conditions, the biosensor achieved a regression-based analytical limit of detection (LOD) of 0.52 fM ATP while experimentally enabling the detection of airborne bacteria down to 2.4 colony-forming units (CFU) per 1 mL. Importantly, the analytical assay time per measurement was approximately 15 min, which is markedly shorter than that of conventional culture-based methods. The effectiveness and sensitivity of the biosensor were validated through indoor field tests, demonstrating the ability to detect airborne bacteria at concentrations below 102 CFU per 1 m3 of air. This culture-independent method provides a rapid and practical approach for airborne bacterial monitoring and is directly applicable to indoor air quality evaluation and infectious disease management."

Auger;P. Spence;A. K. Morrison,The Zonal Wave‐3 Mode Impacts Antarctic Dense Water Formation,"At the Antarctic margins, dense water masses form as sea ice develops, driving the Antarctic branch of the global meridional overturning circulation. Previous studies found that large‐scale climate modes such as the Southern Annular Mode and El Niño Southern do not fully account for the interannual variability of dense water formation. Here, we investigate the influence of the overlooked Zonal Wave‐3 (ZW3) mode, characterized by three alternating cyclone–anticyclone pairs in the Southern Hemisphere mid‐latitudes. Simulations with ZW3 perturbations of different phases show multi‐year impacts on dense water formation and export. The PC1 phase exerts the strongest influence in the Ross Sea, while the PC2 phase can nearly shut down or double dense water formation in the Weddell Sea. A simulation with interannually varying atmospheric forcing confirms ZW3 correlates with dense water formation in both regions. Our results highlight that ZW3 is a key driver of Antarctic dense water dynamics."

Hydrological modeling, essential for water resource management and Earth system knowledge, predominantly relies on traditional calibration paradigms and remains largely unexplored with respect to leveraging recent advancements in LLMs. Five advanced LLMs (GPT‐4o‐mini, DeepSeek‐R1, DeepSeek‐V3, Llama‐4maverick, and llama‐70b) were systematically evaluated and compared against two benchmarks (SCE‐UA and NSGA‐III). Results indicate substantial variability: DeepSeek‐R1 achieved stable near‐optimal convergence within 200 iterations, significantly faster than SCE‐UA (>1,200) or NSGA‐III (>2,200), and delivered slightly improved accuracy, while yielding parameters with enhanced physical interpretability consistent with expert reasoning. Alternatively, the other LLMs performed less favorably than two benchmarks. These findings demonstrate both the promise and limitations of applying LLMs to hydrological parameter calibration, providing an initial step toward exploring the broader potential of LLMs in Earth system modeling."

Today, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is driven by North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) formation and Southern Ocean upwelling. By contrast, during the middle Eocene to early Oligocene (48–28 Ma), a restricted Drake Passage was limiting the northern Ekman transport, while a circum‐equatorial current sustained by trade winds promoted low‐latitude upwelling. Our set of simulations with the IPSL‐CM5A2 model reveals that this paleogeographic setting favored proto‐NADW upwelling at low latitudes, confining the AMOC to the Northern Hemisphere. Consequently, the role of southern westerly winds was limited, and the northward heat transport was weaker than in the modern ocean."

Assuming error‐free in situ data, SWOT ocean products exhibit a standard deviation of difference (STD) of 13 cm within a 3 km radius of tide gauges. Compared to LiDAR, SWOT's PIXC measurements have STD of 37 cm, improving to 14 cm over 100 m grids and 9 cm over 1 km2 areas. This meets the SWOT science requirement of 10 cm STD at 1 km2 scale and extends satellite‐based WSE monitoring into complex coastal environments."

The 2025 Sagaing earthquake generated an exceptionally long rupture (∼535 km), offering a rare opportunity to investigate rupture dynamics along continental transform fault. We integrate complementary high‐resolution imaging geodesy, teleseismic and strong‐motion waveforms, back‐projection, and finite‐fault inversion to investigate rupture extent, process, and slip evolution. Our results reveal a marked bilateral asymmetry in both rupture extent and speed: it propagated ∼85 km northward at sub‐shear speeds and ∼450 km southward predominantly at supershear speeds (∼6 km/s), punctuated by short sub‐shear segments. We propose that structural barrier and stress shadows limited the extent, whereas the SF's bimaterial interface and local stress‐drop heterogeneity jointly may potentially drive the asymmetric, intermittent supershear behavior. These findings provide new insight into mechanisms controlling complex rupture on continental strike‐slip faults."

Taking China's Sichuan Basin (SCB) as an example, we find compound heatwaves persistently intensify surface O3 concentration day and night, with significant positive anomalies of 29.3 μg/m3 and 12.1 μg/m3 during daytime and nighttime, respectively. In details, daytime hot triggers high daytime O3 concentration by enhancing O3‐forming photochemistry, thereby providing a nocturnal residual layer (RL) with O3‐rich air and substantial heat storage. Nighttime, the persistent day‐night hot combined with easterly flow jointly drive a plateau‐basin secondary circulation across RL and stable boundary layer over the SCB, facilitating RL's O3‐rich air mixing to the surface and increasing nighttime O3 concentration. These findings advance understanding of how extreme heat and large‐scale topographic forcing jointly modulate atmospheric environmental changes in plateau‐basin regions."

In many cold regions, frozen ground is common, yet its impact on SWI remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the formation of frozen ground alters salinity distribution in coastal unconfined aquifers, based on laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. Under steady‐state conditions with subzero ground temperature, frozen ground creates a confined flow path between itself and the saltwater wedge. This configuration accelerates terrestrial groundwater flow and induces a pronounced seaward retreat of the saltwater wedge. Moreover, lower ground surface and groundwater temperatures enhance this effect by promoting frozen ground formation. These findings have important implications for understanding salinity dynamics in coastal cold‐region aquifers with varying frozen ground."

An important classification aspect is continentality, for which we present a new metric based on Lagrangian dispersion model calculations. It measures the time it takes for air to travel from the marine boundary layer to the continental boundary layer, mapped onto the continental arrival locations. We find the highest annual mean values of the Lagrangian continentality over arid regions, with an absolute maximum of about 50 days over the Taklamakan desert. We also find strong seasonal variations, with summer values often being higher by about a factor 2 than winter values. Exceptions are summer minima over areas affected by monsoon systems. Generally, we find that the Lagrangian continentality metric demarcates different known climate zones well and also produces meaningful seasonal variations, which previous classifications could not capture."

This study reveals critical problems in error covariance representation and adjoint sensitivity patterns challenging their operational viability. We evaluate tangent linear and adjoint models of GraphCast and NeuralGCM by comparing perturbation responses with MPAS‐A, a well‐established numerical weather prediction model. ML models exhibit unphysical adjoint sensitivities, including persistent localized responses and excessive noise at various atmospheric levels, contrasting sharply with physically consistent MPAS‐A patterns and indicating fundamental error covariance representation issues. Implications extend across DA methodologies. Unrealistic sensitivity patterns would generate distorted error covariances in ensemble systems and unphysical analysis increments in variational approaches like 4DVar. Assimilating single observations could create spurious corrections far from observation locations, degrading forecast skill. Despite forecasting capabilities, current ML weather models require significant improvements in linearization properties before reliable operational DA integration."

The wave‐like horizontal structures, with ∼10 min period and ∼55 km wavelength, indicate the typical features of mesoscale GWs.

Under the incidence of long‐period Alfvén waves carrying downward field‐aligned currents, a parallel potential drop forms in the transition region between magnetospheric hot electrons and ionospheric cold electrons, accelerating cold electrons upward. These accelerated electrons progressively replace hot electrons as the main current carrier. Parametric investigations show that the ratio of potential drop to downward field‐aligned current increases with hot‐electron temperature and decreases with hot electron density, and is several (7–8) times smaller than that for upward currents because less potential drop is required for more abundant cold electrons to reach the same current magnitude.

Here we present molybdenum (Mo) isotopic records from International Ocean Discovery Program Site U1509. Raman spectroscopy shows that Mn and Fe occur mainly as MnO2 and Fe–Mn oxides. The δ98/95Mo values show a sustained negative shift from ∼1‰ to −2‰ between ∼59.5 and 50.5 Ma, and this trend is best explained by strengthened Mo adsorption onto Mn and Fe bearing oxides at the sediment–water interface. This mechanism provides a direct basis for interpreting the Mo isotope depletion, indicating prolonged bottom‐water oxygenation within early Cenozoic greenhouse conditions.

In our analysis, we focus on the quality of the uncertainty estimates and realism of generated sequences, while including a comparison to point‐prediction performance as a sanity check. Our results show that LSTM‐engression is an effective and easy‐to‐use method for generative modeling, outperforming quantile regression in uncertainty quantification.

In contrast to classical theory, β $\beta $ attains steady‐state (βs ${\beta }_{s}$) asymptotically in the dominant inertial regime, marking the validity of Forchheimer law. This highlights a hydrodynamic gap between Darcy and Forchheimer regimes, which is addressed using a physics‐based Eddy‐Growth Dynamics–Inertial Permeability (EG‐DIP) model. The EG‐DIP model contributes to ongoing discussions on inertial permeability by providing a framework to determine β(Re) $\beta (\text{Re})$, integrate it into Forchheimer law, and suggest a physical basis for estimating βs ${\beta }_{s}$.

In the present study, we describe algebraic formulas adapted from the standard SABER Version 2 method for estimating daytime and nighttime O based on the assumption that ozone in the upper mesosphere is in equilibrium. We highlight uncertainties in the calculations that lead to global mean differences ranging up to a factor of two or more in the nighttime O concentration. Important considerations are the choice of which reactions are included in the ozone budget and the values of uncertain parameters used in the model of emissions from vibrationally excited hydroxyl. SABER observations cover almost all local times. Since O is long‐lived in the upper mesosphere, the dominant source of diurnal variation is transport by tidal winds. Even when accounting for this transport, there are appreciable differences between daytime and nighttime O. Daytime O is higher than is consistent with the nighttime O that is estimated from several methods. The estimated daytime O has a strong and nearly linear dependence on ozone while the nighttime O is sensitive to multiple parameters in the model of OH airglow emissions. The day/night discrepancy supports other evidence that the SABER daytime mesospheric ozone has large uncertainties and needs to be updated."

Multiple PRSs, including the 30‐dBZ and 40‐dBZ echo‐tops, the integrated intensities of ZDR ${Z}_{\text{DR}}$ and KDP ${K}_{\text{DP}}$ columns, the maximum graupel and hail height, as well as the changes in ZH ${Z}_{H}$ and ZDR ${Z}_{\text{DR}}$ within the warm‐cloud layer, can to some extent indicate the mean raindrop size, number concentration, and rain rate at the low level (1‐km level). A Multi‐Layer Perceptron model is designed and trained to preliminarily predict these RSD parameters using the PRSs as inputs. These RSD parameters are generally reproduced and the correlations between predicted and observed values are above 0.8. The study clearly demonstrates the quantitative constraints of PRSs on low‐level RSDs in heavy‐rainfall‐producing convection. Such microphysical constraints have potential applications for polarimetric radar in the prediction of RSDs and rainfall intensity."

While several studies have quantified the changing patterns of exposure, the extent of inequality in exposure among population subgroups at the sub‐national scale remains unknown. In this study, we examined the disparity in ambient PM2.5 exposure across various population subgroups in urban and rural India and analyzed its changes in recent years by integrating satellite‐derived PM2.5 concentrations (1‐km × 1‐km) with sociodemographic information from the 4th (2015–2016) and 5th (2019–2021) rounds of the National Family Health Survey. We found a larger absolute disparity (60–90 µgm−3) in high socio‐demographic index (SDI) states compared to middle and lower SDI states. Moreover, we discovered that ambient PM2.5 exposure was higher (indicated by relative disparities in terms of Zscore) among the top and bottom quantiles of wealth index and the other backward caste subgroup (Zscore > ±0.02, p < 0.1) than among their demographic counterparts in middle and high SDI states. From 2015–2016 to 2019–2021, the disparity in ambient PM2.5 exposure across subgroups increased in urban areas, while it either remained static or decreased in rural areas. India's urban‐centric approach to addressing air pollution may further exacerbate disparities among diverse demographics. Therefore, we recommend the formulation of targeted policies aimed at reducing ambient PM2.5 exposure and alleviating disparities by prioritizing actions for the vulnerable subgroups."

 Continuous monitoring of deep-seated slow-moving landslides is a critical measure to mitigate risks posed by catastrophic events, especially under increasing extreme weather conditions. As a non-contact, high-resolution measurement technique, space-borne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has been widely applied in landslide monitoring. However, when used for continuous monitoring, challenges remain, including incomplete monitoring dimensions, slow update efficiency, and insufficient temporal resolution. To address these, this paper proposes a fusion framework of physics-based and data-driven models, built on a Kalman Filter, to rapidly obtain daily 4D (spatial 3D with time) landslide movements based on movement characteristics and dependence on hydrometeorological factors. The method's performance was evaluated using both synthetic and real datasets. On synthetic data, RMSEs in the east, north, and vertical directions were 9.6 mm, 3.8 mm, and 1.4 mm, respectively. For real data, the daily 4D movements were projected onto the Line-of-Sight (LOS) directions of Sentinel-1 Track 11 and ALOS2 PALSAR2 for comparison, achieving sub-centimeter Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs). These results confirm the accuracy of the estimated movements and demonstrate enhanced update efficiency enabled by the Kalman Filter, which allows rapid assimilation of new data without reprocessing the full historical archive. Additionally, by incorporating geophysical and geodynamic methods, we leveraged daily 4D movements to derive various landslide parameters to analyze the kinematics of the Chuwangjing landslide during 2016–2024. The findings indicate that daily 4D movements not only enhance InSAR's performance in continuous landslide monitoring but also provide additional derivative products, deepening the understanding of deep-seated landslide kinematics."

 The ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2) carries a revolutionary photon-counting lidar and diverse studies have demonstrated its great observational capabilities on Earth observations. However, it is still difficult to obtain high quality land surface reflectance in that a single measurement (e.g., the laser signal derived apparent surface reflectance) is characterized by two main unknowns, i.e., the SR (surface reflectance) and atmospheric transmission. As the radiative properties of ICESat-2 laser signal and solar noise are simultaneously obtained, we combine signal and noise information to achieve the co-observations, which show how two measurements help to decouple the reflectivity of atmosphere from surfaces and thus resolve this inherent ill-posed problem. Specifically, we propose the theoretical laser signal and solar noise models for spaceborne lidars that link the two measurements (the signal count and background rate) to the two unknowns. Then, a method and workflow applied for ICESat-2 is designed to retrieve the AOTs (aerosol optical thickness) and SRs. The performance is validated against the MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and AERONET (Aerosol Robotic NETwork) product with the average MAPE (mean absolute percentage errors) of less than 30% for AOTs and the average MAPE of less than 15% for SRs in different land cover types. In addition, the ability of this method to identify snow-covered or cloud-covered areas is explored and validated. This study provides a reference for the active and passive co-observations. In the future, satellites carrying both lidar and multispectral cameras could enable higher quality Earth observations, with the lidar enabling more accurate isolation of atmospheric and surface contributions."

 Mangroves in the Beibu Gulf of the northern south China sea are vital for coastal protection and carbon storage but have undergone pronounced spatial changes over recent decades due to rapid urbanization and climate variability. Existing monitoring efforts, largely constrained to annual temporal resolution, fail to capture seasonal dynamics and fine-scale transformations induced by human activities. In addition, existing change detection methods are either based on statistical machine learning or fully convolutional deep learning, which have limited ability to detect long-term dynamic changes in mangrove forests. To address these challenges, a temporal semantic segmentation change detection with multi-scale dilated convolutions (TSSCD-D) framework was proposed, and the Landsat time series (1987–2022) was used for high-resolution mangrove dynamics monitoring. The proposed approach expands the temporal receptive field, enabling improved representation of long-term changes. Model evaluation demonstrates an overall accuracy of 87.3%, with producer’s and user’s accuracies for mangroves of 97.1% and 96.8%, outperforming other methods (see Table 2). Analysis reveals a sharp decline in mangrove area from 856.1 km2 in 1987 to 532.8 km2 in 1998, primarily driven by reclamation and infrastructure development, followed by gradual recovery to 824.3 km2 by 2022 under conservation policies. Transition mapping shows that conversions with water bodies, marshes, and irrigated croplands account for 80% of total changes, indicating strong hydrological and anthropogenic influences. These findings provide critical insights and fine-scale datasets to support long-term mangrove conservation and management in tropical coastal systems.More details on TSSCD-D can be found at https://github.com/CUG-BEODL/TSSCD-D."

 Forests exhibit complex vertical structures, and understanding the vertical distribution of gross primary production (GPP) is critical for improving carbon cycle assessments. While previous studies have emphasized the contribution of understory, approaches such as eddy-covariance provide only site-level observations and are constrained by sparse spatial coverage and footprint limitations, leaving large-scale assessment and mapping unresolved. This study identified key parameters of GPP vertical heterogeneity and developed a remote sensing framework to quantify and map its distribution in forests. We integrated hyperspectral imagery and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds to retrieve physiological and biochemical parameters as well as the vertical distribution of canopy structure, which were used to drive GPP modeling. Based on the outputs of the SCOPE (Soil Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy Fluxes) model, we visualized the vertical profile of GPP and quantified the overstory and understory. Sensitivity and mechanistic analyses were performed using simulated data to investigate the effects of vegetation biophysical and biochemical parameters on vertical GPP. We further estimated and validated the vertical distribution of GPP across seven National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) forests. The results showed that LAI (leaf area index) was the dominant driver of GPP in canopy layers (correlation coefficients = 0.74), with a stronger influence in the overstory than in the understory, and a trade-off relationship observed between layers. Vertical GPP heterogeneity was well captured, with understory contributions ranging from 5.9% to 35.8%, except in sparse-canopy subarctic forests. Model estimates agreed well with flux tower data (understory contribution: correlation coefficient = 0.941, R2 = 0.885; total GPP: R2 = 0.785). This study offers new insights into the role of understory vegetation in carbon cycling and informs vertical-dimension strategies for forest carbon management."

 The remote detection of shallow, subsurface features can assist archaeological prospecting, environmental risk mitigation and national security. However, few subsurface detection studies have used geophysical methods to statistically validate the detection efficiency of broadband vegetation indices (VIs) in high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery. In this study, we use 37 broadband VIs on eight Maxar (now rebranded to Vantor) multispectral satellite images to remotely detect stressed meadow grass and anomalous soil characteristics over an Iron Age fogou (stone-walled underground passage) in Carn Euny, Cornwall, UK. Using Maxar’s high spatial resolution, the highest performing VIs are identified using a two-tier geophysical approach. First, we correlate the VIs with gravity and then, for a best performing image subset, we perform structural similarity index measurements (SSIMs) and 2D cross-correlations with ground penetrating radar (GPR) data. In doing so, we reprioritise the most suitable VIs for shallow, subsurface detection in temperate, grass covered environments. In summer months, the Iron Oxide index, Soil Salinity Index 7 (SI7) and the Structure Insensitive Pigment Index (SIPI) are most responsive across the fogou; all of which are algebraic manifestations of the Red/Blue reflectance ratio. By analysing their spectral profiles, gradient magnitudes, false colour composites (FCCs) and edge effects, we review the fogou’s effect on soil salinity, iron oxide concentration and chlorophyll production. Demonstrating the broader utility of Red/Blue reflectance ratios, we then present a multispectral image processing workflow which is calibrated to detect, at scale, shallow subsurface features in temperate, vegetated terrain."

 Unstable slopes are highly susceptible to external triggers, representing a critical challenge for disaster risk management. However, few studies have systematically developed approaches for their regional-scale identification, and even fewer have explored their controlling factors in mining-affected regions with strong anthropogenic disturbances. To address this gap, this study investigates the composite factors influencing unstable slopes in the Datong Coalfield, China. Specifically, we used the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique to measure line-of-sight (LOS) surface deformation and subsequently identified unstable slopes as those with significant deformation velocities within a slope-unit framework. To examine the spatiotemporal effects of factors influencing slope instability, we conducted multivariate modeling at both long- and short-term scales. The results reveal that long-term modeling captures broadly consistent contributions of these factors across different periods, whereas short-term modeling highlights distinct seasonal associations with slope instability. Furthermore, cross-wavelet coherence analysis revealed that intermittently unstable slopes exhibit periodic lagged responses to dynamic environmental forcing, underscoring the significant role of environmental forcing in driving deformation of intermittently unstable slopes. Overall, this work provides new insights into the mechanisms of slope instability in mining-affected coalfields and proposes a transferable framework for regional-scale slope monitoring and risk management."

 To investigate the concentration, sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and their impact on the formation of secondary particulate matter under different PM2.5 concentration levels in ambient air, a one-month online observation of ambient VOCs and PM2.5 concentrations was conducted in Chengdu, China during winter. The results showed that the concentrations of most VOC species increased significantly with the rising PM2.5 concentration. The Concentration and proportions of alkenes/alkynes, halocarbons, aromatics, and oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) all increased as PM2.5 concentrations rose, with alkenes and alkynes showing a more prominent increase. However, the proportion of alkanes decreased with increasing PM2.5 concentration, yet they still accounted for over 40 % of total VOCs concentrations. During moderately polluted period (PM2.5>115 μg/m3), the concentrations of isopentane, ethyl acetate, trans-2-butene, o-xylene, and 3-ethyltoluene were 9.5,7.4, 6.4, 6.2 and 6 times those in the excellent air quality period (PM2.5≤35 μg/m3), respectively, much higher than the 1.8-fold increase of CO. In contrast, the concentrations of 1-pentene and cis-2-pentene decreased instead of increasing, dropping by 75 % and 60 %, respectively. The concentrations of typical long-lived species remained essentially stable. Source apportionment results indicated that among the 8 sources of VOCs in ambient air, the concentration contributions and proportions of 4 sources, namely vehicle emissions, gas evaporation, solvent use, and domestic sources, all increased with the elevation of PM2.5 concentrations. During moderate pollution, their concentration contributions were 22.1 ppbv (34.3 %), 13.61 ppbv (21.7 %), 8.1 ppbv (11.5 %), and 7.8 ppbv (10.1 %), respectively. Among these, the concentration contribution of solvent use source during moderate pollution was 12.6 times that in the excellent air quality period, making it the source with the largest relative concentration contribution. The concentration contributions of the other 4 sources hardly changed with PM2.5 concentration. This indicated that industrial emissions, as well as biomass/waste combustion sources were effectively controlled throughout the pollution process, and no secondary formation sources of VOCs were detected during the winter pollution episodes. A comparison of changes in VOC species concentrations and their sources revealed that the increase in concentrations of reactive species with PM2.5 concentration was much lower than the increase in their source contributions, indicating significant chemical depletion. These findings suggested that the main sources driving the synchronous increase of PM2.5 and VOC concentration in ambient air are vehicle emissions, gas evaporation, solvent use, and domestic sources. These sources not only directly emit PM2.5 but also release chemically reactive substances such as alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons, which promote the conversion of PM2.5 into secondary PM2.5, leading to a sharp rise in ambient PM2.5 concentrations."

 Rapid intensification (RI) of tropical cyclones (TCs) near the China coast poses heightened risk because short lead times limit preparedness. Using ERA-Interim reanalysis, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission precipitation, and TC best-track data, we apply an obliquely rotated T-mode principal component analysis to classify synoptic environments for RI events and diagnose controlling factors with composites and a Box Difference Index. Four synoptic flow patterns emerge: (1) MSS: combined monsoon trough, subtropical high, and South Asian high; (2) MS: monsoon trough interacting with the subtropical high; (3) SH: subtropical-high-dominated; and (4) MW: monsoon trough with a southward-penetrating midlatitude westerly trough. Across regimes, RI is preceded by radius-of-maximum-wind contraction, increased TC fullness, and more axisymmetric inner-core precipitation. Further analyses show that MSS/MS feature reduced vertical wind shear and stronger low-level vorticity with enhanced precipitation; SH shows the weakest shear and strongest upper-level divergence as the ridge extends westward; MW favors already compact, intense storms that can withstand shear asymmetry tied to the midlatitude westerly trough. These results clarify how large-scale flow modulates RI onset near the China coast and suggest that combining synoptic-pattern recognition with environmental predictors can improve RI guidance for coastal warnings."
