10.1088/1748-9326/ae0e38,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注气候变化对欧洲小麦种植的影响，特别是干旱和热浪对小麦产量的威胁。论文通过作物模型模拟和气候数据分析，寻找当前欧洲与未来气候条件下相似的环境，以支持小麦育种策略的调整。虽然研究使用了气候数据，但其重点在于农业育种和气候变化对农业的影响，而非大气环境遥感技术本身，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,[],Rogério de S Nóia-Júnior;Loic Manceau;Boris Parent;Pierre Martre,Wheat breeding trials will lose climate relevance in Europe,"Europe is a major wheat producer, but rising frequencies of drought and heatwaves increasingly threaten yields. To support breeding strategies aligned with future climatic challenges, we identified current European environments that are analogous to projected future drought and heat stress conditions in major wheat-growing regions. Using gridded crop model simulations with historical and future climate data from an ensemble of five global circulation models (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios), we characterized stress patterns during key wheat developmental phases. We clustered environments into stress classes and computed a continuous similarity index to map analogue regions. Our results show that by the end of the century, most official value for cultivation and use (VCU) trial sites will face intensified drought and heat stresses, with stress combinations exceeding historical ranges. Current climate analogues for most VCU wheat trial sites in Central Europe are predominantly located in southern Spain, southern Italy, and parts of Greece, yet these analogue environments are projected to decrease substantially under high-emission scenarios. The disappearance of climate analogues threatens breeding based on past conditions. Our results highlight the need to rapidly adapt wheat breeding strategies in Europe to future climate conditions."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae0e3b,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注人工智能（AI）的普及对美国能源消耗和二氧化碳排放的影响。它通过结合经济活动数据和AI在不同行业和职业中的应用估计，量化了AI可能带来的能源使用和碳排放的潜在变化。研究结果表明，AI的应用可能导致美国能源消耗和碳排放量略有增加，并强调需要考虑AI驱动的生产力提升对不同行业能源和环境影响的差异。该论文主要关注能源经济和环境影响，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关联。,"['energy consumption', 'carbon dioxide emissions', 'AI adoption', 'economic activity', 'environmental impact']",Anthony R Harding;Juan Moreno-Cruz,Watts and bots: the energy implications of AI adoption,"Rapid expansion of Artificial Intelligence is expected to drive proportional expansion of economic activity through productivity gains–potentially leading to higher energy consumption and associated environmental impacts, including increased carbon dioxide emissions. We combine data on economic activity with early estimates of likely adoption of AI across occupations and industries to quantify the potential change in energy use and carbon dioxide emissions for the United States. At the industry level, we estimate annual increases in energy use ranging from 0 and 12 petajoules (PJ) and carbon emissions from 0 tonnes to 272 kt (ktCO2). Aggregated across the economy, AI adoption could lead to an additional 28 PJ of energy use and 896 ktCO2 in emissions annually–equivalent to approximately 0.03% of annual national energy use and 0.02% of annual national CO2 emissions. These results highlight the need to account not only for the aggregate energy and environmental implications of AI-driven productivity gains, but also for how these impacts vary across industries based on their specific characteristics."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae114c,True,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文探讨了北方森林如何通过热量放大效应加剧积雪融化、燃料可用性和野火，从而影响亚北极地区的碳排放。论文利用土壤湿度和海洋盐度（SMOS）卫星的L波段微波亮度温度数据，反演了森林冠层温度，并将其作为预测大型野火自然碳排放的指标。研究表明，森林冠层温度能更好地捕捉寒冷森林的热发展转折点，而其他产品（如土壤水分主动被动植被含水量和欧洲中期天气预报中心ERA5陆地表面温度产品）则未能做到这一点。此外，论文还指出，森林与火灾前显热之间的热量放大反馈会加速燃料干燥，增加野火风险，从而可能导致净碳排放增加，与碳封存的预期效益背道而驰。该研究与大气环境遥感技术相关，因为它使用了卫星观测数据来监测森林冠层温度，并将其与碳排放和野火等大气环境问题联系起来。,"['satellite observations', 'forest canopy temperature', 'carbon emissions', 'wildfires', 'SMOS', 'L-band microwave brightness temperature', 'fuel dryness', 'evapotranspiration']",Ju Hyoung Lee;Marta Yebra;Mir Matin;Amir AghaKouchak,"Heat-amplifying boreal forests exacerbate snowmelt, fuel availability and wildfires in sub-Arctic regions","Forests, once the largest terrestrial carbon sink, are increasingly becoming significant sources of carbon emissions worldwide due to large wildfires and the accumulation of fire fuels in warming environments that deplete soil and vegetation moisture. Despite growing needs such as Nature-Based Solutions, there is a lack of operationalized near-real-time satellite observations of forest fuel conditions to assess whether forests are acting as carbon sinks or emitters. Most existing satellite products focus on chlorophyll content or vegetation cover rather than directly measuring hydrological or thermal variations that influence carbon flux. From Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) L-band microwave brightness temperature, we retrieved forest (or canopy) temperatures over the 2023 Canadian and 2021 Sakha Republic wildfires that generated some of the world’s largest carbon emissions. We propose forest canopy temperature as a predictor of natural carbon emissions from mega-wildfires, in comparison with Soil Moisture Active Passive vegetation water content and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA5 land surface temperature products, which fail to capture the tipping points of thermal development in cold forests. The heat-amplifying feedback between forests and pre-fire sensible heat further accelerates fuel dryness through evapotranspiration driven by snow-melt water and forest warming, leading to the large-scale spread of wildfires. Under such dry conditions, forestation policies may inadvertently increase fuel availability and wildfire risk, potentially leading to an increase in net carbon emissions rather than achieving the intended benefits of carbon sequestration."

This study examined the impacts of repeated OWP application on soil properties in two French long-term field experiments: QualiAgro and PROspective (20 and 18 years, respectively). The OWP included dehydrated urban sewage sludge (SLU), green waste and SLU compost, biowaste compost from source-separated municipal organic waste co-composted with green waste, municipal solid waste compost, farmyard manure from a dairy cow farm (FYM), and composted FYM from open-air composting on a concrete platform. The application of OWP led to increased soil nutrient levels and trace element availability, and stimulated microbial biomass and enzyme activities, while the response of nematode varied depending on site and OWP type. Biological properties were less affected than physico-chemical properties, though the OWP application enhanced soil microbial biomass and specific enzyme activities. The impact on soil nematode communities varied depending on OWP type and site. Strong correlations were observed among soil property changes, with exogenous carbon and nutrient inputs from OWP identified as key drivers. Larger changes were noted in QualiAgro, where OWP application rates were higher and initial soil quality lower. These findings highlight that OWP applications, depending on their type, rate, and initial soil conditions, can significantly alter soil properties."

While their presence in the Mediterranean Sea has been documented, studies on MP inputs via local streams remain limited. This study quantified and characterized MP abundances along the Na’aman stream (Israel) and its outlet to the Mediterranean Sea, with samples collected before, during, and after the rainy season from established transects along the streambank and from the nearby beach. The spatial distribution and abundances of MPs were examined in relation to seasonal and hydrological conditions. MPs were sorted by type and counted by dissecting microscope. A representative subset of putative MP particles was examined using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The overall mean (±standard error) MP abundance for the Na’aman stream was 231 ± 67 particles kg−1 sediment dry weight, with significant seasonal and spatial variation. MP accumulation increased during dry months and decreased sharply following flood events—dropping by 43% after a 13 mm rainfall event that triggered stream discharge of 3.25 m3 s−1, highlighting the stream’s role in flushing MPs to the sea. The most common MP types were fragments (61.9%), fibers, and foam, with polypropylene accounting for 56.9% of analyzed particles. MP types and polymer compositions varied by site and season, suggesting diverse sources such as domestic wastewater, agriculture, and marine backflow. These findings confirm that ephemeral stream systems can temporarily trap and subsequently remobilize MPs, acting as critical conduits between land-based sources and the marine environment. Targeted mitigation efforts—such as seasonal cleanup campaigns just before the rainy season—could significantly reduce MP flux to the sea in this location. This is the first documented assessment of MP transport from a freshwater stream into the Mediterranean Sea in Israel and may serve as a baseline for future monitoring in similar Mediterranean-climate regions."

Without understanding these heterogeneous effects, our ability to understand and respond to climate-related armed conflict risk remains incomplete. This paper systematically investigates the heterogeneous causal effects of droughts on both conflict incidence (extensive margin) and conflict intensity (intensive margin) across 8 world regions, 4 temporal and spatial resolutions, and 3 conflict types, reporting only patterns that hold consistently across specifications. Using a causal forest and a calibration test for heterogeneity reveals some evidence that droughts heterogeneously affect conflict incidence. Zero inflated negative binomial models that control for grid cell and yearly effects and include drought interactions with socioeconomic, political, and demographic variables show significant evidence that droughts heterogeneously affect conflict intensity. When examining individual interaction terms, baseline conflict risk-estimated using a random forest with the same socioeconomic, political, and demographic predictors plus conflict history-emerges as the only significant source of heterogeneity that is consistent across specifications. This suggests that other variables primarily influence drought–conflict relationships through their contribution to overall conflict risk, rather than through independent causal channels. The results demonstrate that even when droughts do affect conflict intensity heterogeneously, their overall role in armed conflict dynamics remains limited."

We conducted a laboratory experiment to assess the impacts of brucite inspired alkalinity addition (BIAA) as an OAE approach on the carbonate chemistry, biogeochemistry, and composition of the natural Santa Barbara Channel phytoplankton community sourced from a spring upwelling event. The BIAA treatment used MgCl2 * 6H2O and NaOH to yield a total alkalinity (TA) concentration of ∼3000 µmol kg−1, in contrast with the untreated seawater controls (TA = ∼ 2300 µmol kg−1). Our results suggest that BIAA altered the phytoplankton community composition, including reduced contribution of diatoms and enhanced numbers of Prymnesiophyceae (coccolithophores and Phaeocystis sp.). These results are in agreement with observations that biogenic silica content was lower under BIAA treatment. While the concentration of particulate inorganic carbon was consistently higher compared to controls, these differences were not statistically significant. Results revealed no differences between control and BIAA treatment in particulate organic carbon and particulate organic nitrogen (PON) concentrations. The proxy for cellular photosynthetic health Fv/Fm revealed that cells were photosynthetically healthy for both control and BIAA treatments, but values were lower in the BIAA treatment at the beginning of the exponential phase. While statistical power limitations of laboratory results might restrict applicability to other systems, our overall results suggest that BIAA has a differential impact on phytoplankton functional groups and their biogeochemical performance."

This could lead to higher energy-related emissions by lower-income consumers, potentially creating some conflicts with climate change mitigation objectives. Using an enhanced version of the Global Change Analysis Model, we simulate reductions of within-region income inequality that allow for narrowing differences in energy and food demand across deciles by 2050 in a Paris-compliant world. The energy demand increase by lower-income consumers is greater than the decline in demand by wealthier and more satiated income groups, leading to an overall rise in total demand. Nevertheless, the projected higher energy demand in the proposed more egalitarian societies only slightly increases the regional carbon prices and mitigation costs associated with the emission targets, therefore posing minimal impact on the achievement of the existing portfolio of climate pledges."

Here, we quantify the influence of large-scale atmospheric circulation variability on total winter precipitation for Europe using dynamical adjustment with synoptic-scale weather patterns (WPs). Variability in atmospheric dynamics, through frequency changes in WPs, is shown to be a significant driver of observed wetting and drying trends, linked to observed trends in the North Atlantic jet stream. After removing dynamical variability, trends emerge in non-dynamical winter precipitation which are attributable to anthropogenic forcing: a north-south signal of a drying Mediterranean and increasingly wetter mid-to-high latitudes. Although this spatial pattern is well-represented by CMIP6 models, the magnitude of observed changes is approximately 23 years ahead of the CMIP6 multi-model mean predictions. Our results suggest that current adaptation strategies, based on multi-model means, may underestimate the near-term risk of climate-related hazards, and therefore require critical re-evaluation."

In this study, we compared these new satellite measurements with ground-based radar data and found that, after proper corrections, the CPR gives reliable results, especially in ice clouds. This means scientists can confidently use EarthCARE data to better understand clouds and improve weather and climate predictions. 
 The Earth Cloud, Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) mission was launched on 28 May 2024. One of the most exciting new measurement capabilities of the EarthCARE mission is the CPR Doppler velocity measurement. The availability of Doppler measurements from space will offer a unique opportunity for the collection of a global dataset of vertical motions in clouds and precipitation. An important step in realizing this opportunity is to evaluate the CPR Doppler velocity measurements against those collected by surface-based observatories. Validation with two high-latitude surface-based Doppler radar observatories demonstrates that the CPR Level-2 Doppler velocities exhibit minimal biases (within a few cm s−1), especially in ice clouds. Even in low-level mixed-phase clouds, the CPR's Doppler velocity measurements provide reliable values, although careful consideration is needed for specific limitations such as vertical smoothing effects due to the radar's pulse length. Despite the inherent challenges associated with space-based Doppler measurements, these results suggest strong potential for the EarthCARE mission to provide unprecedented global climatological insights into hydrometeor sedimentation velocities."

In the western and eastern North Pacific, the ENSO‐TC teleconnection has strengthened in recent decades. Periods with a strong ENSO‐TC teleconnection are associated with more favorable environmental conditions for TCs, with higher values of genesis potential indices. Positive phases of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation coincided with periods of strong ENSO‐TC teleconnections in the Atlantic and North Pacific basins. A weaker Atlantic ENSO‐TC relationship was associated with negative phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation.

However, GRB221009A did not yield any observable signatures at the Schumann resonances (∼8, ∼14 Hz), which are also sensitive to the lower ionosphere. We show that the effects of GRB221009A are observable in a decrease in propagation velocity of ELF (3–1,000 Hz) lightning impulses. Analytical and numerical analysis points to an ionospheric perturbation in which the GRB increased the daytime electron density uniformly over a wide altitude range from 50 to 90 km. The GRB perturbation is markedly different from perturbations from solar flares, which significantly increase the vertical gradient of the electron density. ELF propagation velocity is shown to be a technique that can identify the altitude range of ionospheric perturbations."

To investigate this prolific fire season's impacts on US air quality, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s 72‐hr Unified Forecast System Air Quality Model (UFS‐AQM) is run once‐daily from 15 August–30 September 2020. A meteorological and air quality‐based forecast verification is carried out for this period. The 72‐hr forecasts of near‐surface temperature, moisture, and winds perform quite well against observations in terms of correlation and bias. The UFS‐AQM surface ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) often concur with US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) AirNow station data, though the model ozone displays a consistent positive bias ranging from 8.5 to 15.4 ppb. Anomalously poor PM2.5 predictions are identified during extreme wildfire activity in the Pacific Northwest between 13 and 20 September. Here, in addition to periods of widespread cloudiness, smoke is quite thick. As a result, fire activity is obscured from satellite detection. The UFS‐AQM thus underestimates wildfire emissions in the Pacific Northwest. The lack of dynamic aerosol–radiation interactions in UFS‐AQM coupled with uncertainties in fire emissions leads to a large underestimation of surface PM2.5 there, along with high temperature and low humidity biases. Finally, satellite‐based measurements are also employed to evaluate the UFS‐AQM's performance in the deeper troposphere. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite 550‐nm aerosol optical depth provides additional insights into the UFS‐AQM's handling of smoke transport, while the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument suggests UFS‐AQM suffers from overpredictions of NO2 and CO in active fire regions."

Using Shannon entropy, mutual information (MI), and joint mutual information, metrics that capture both linear and nonlinear relationships, we identify the most informative variables and variable combinations governing D‐excess across contrasting marine and continental regimes. Relative humidity with respect to sea surface temperature (RHS) is consistently the strongest individual predictor, explaining up to 27% of D‐excess variability during marine conditions but only 10% in continental air masses. The Relative humidity(RHS) + sea surface temperature (SST) combination demonstrates synergistic effects, where their joint influence (explaining up to 36% of D‐excess variability) exceeds what either variable achieves individually, confirming their coupled influence on deuterium excess. Wind direction complements RHS most effectively during continental conditions. The best three‐variable combination (RHS + SST + Planetary Boundary Layer height) explains 38% of D‐excess variability in marine air, while no combination exceeds 20% explanatory power during continental periods. Information theory shows that heteroscedasticity in D‐excess relationships indicates regime shifts in controlling processes and quantifies fundamental constraints on predictor variables: some environmental factors like surface pressure or water vapor flux contain insufficient information content to explain D‐excess variability regardless of their physical relevance. These results highlight the different predictability limits between marine and continental regimes, challenging the adequacy of linear models and providing a rigorous framework for quantifying the information content of isotope‐climate relationships with implications for both modern and paleoclimate applications."

 Echocardiography is the most widely used cardiac imaging modality, capturing ultrasound video data to assess cardiac structure and function1. Artificial intelligence (AI) in echocardiography has the potential to streamline manual tasks and improve reproducibility and precision2. However, most echocardiography AI models are single-view, single-task systems that do not synthesize complementary information from multiple views captured during a full exam3,4, and thus lead to limited performance and scope of applications. To address this problem, we introduce EchoPrime, a multi-view, view-informed, video-based vision-language foundation model trained on over 12 million video-report pairs. EchoPrime uses contrastive learning to train a unified embedding model for all standard views in a comprehensive echocardiogram study with representation of both rare and common diseases and diagnoses. EchoPrime then utilizes view-classification and a view-informed anatomic attention module to weight video-specific embeddings that accurately map the relationship between echocardiographic views and anatomical structures. With retrieval-augmented interpretation, EchoPrime integrates information from all echocardiogram videos in a comprehensive study and performs holistic clinical interpretation.

 Tandem light-emitting diodes (LEDs), achieved by vertically stacking multiple units in series to combine the luminance of individual light-emitting elements, are effective for improving efficiency and lifespan compared to single-unit devices1–3. In particular, tandem perovskite LEDs benefit from the small Stokes shifts of perovskites4, which in principle can enable significant photon recycling between individual perovskite layers and enhance light extraction from trapped modes. However, a tandem structure that effectively merges the luminance of each perovskite units still remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate efficient and stable tandem LEDs by combining two solution-processed perovskite light-emitting units. This tandem structure effectively combines the original luminance of each light-emitting units; we argue that the emissions are also significantly enhanced through photon recycling between the individual light-emitting units. Consequently, we achieve tandem perovskite LEDs with a low turn-on voltage of 3.2 V, a high peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 45.5% (even 20% higher than the sum of peak EQEs of single-unit devices), an average peak EQE of 40.9%, and a half-lifetime of 64 h at an initial radiance of 70 W Sr−1 m−2.

 Extratropical peatlands in the Southern Hemisphere preserve detailed information on climatic and environmental change going back millennia. They are particularly valuable for understanding the evolution of the mid-latitude southern westerly winds (SWW), which play a major role in driving regional temperature and precipitation patterns, Antarctic sea-ice extent and ocean carbon fluxes. Here we investigate the timing and drivers of peatland initiation across the southern mid-latitudes after the Last Glacial Maximum (21,000 years ago) and test how this might relate to past changes in the SWW. We radiocarbon-date basal peats from the Falkland Islands and collate published basal peat radiocarbon ages from peat-forming regions south of 35° S. Using kernel density estimate models, we find distinct latitudinal phases of post-glacial peat initiation that suggest that peat growth is sensitive to variations in SWW position through their influence on moisture availability, temperature and dust deposition. A peak in peat growth in regions north of 52.5° S during the Antarctic Cold Reversal (14,700–12,800 years ago) suggests an equatorward migration of the SWW, coinciding with a slowdown in atmospheric CO2 increases. In light of recent SWW intensification and poleward migration, our findings highlight the potential for ongoing changes in the Southern Hemisphere climate and carbon fluxes under continued anthropogenic heating.

 The origin of geochemically enriched mantle in the asthenosphere is important to understanding the physical, thermal and chemical evolution of Earth’s interior. While subduction of oceanic sediments and deep mantle plumes have been implicated in this enrichment, they cannot fully explain the observed geochemical trends. Here we use geodynamic models to show that enriched mantle can be liberated from the roots of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle by highly organized convective erosion, a process tied to continental rifting and break-up. We demonstrate that this ‘chain’ of convective instabilities sweeps enriched lithospheric material into the suboceanic asthenosphere, in a predictable and quantifiable manner, over tens of millions of years—potentially faster for denser, removed keels. We test this model using geochemical data from the Indian Ocean Seamount Province, a near-continent site of enriched volcanism with minimal deep mantle plume influence. This region shows a peak in enriched mantle volcanism within 50 million years of break-up followed by a steady decline in enrichment, consistent with model predictions. We propose that persistent and long-distance lateral transport of locally metasomatized, removed keel can explain the billion-year-old enrichments in seamounts and ocean island volcanoes located off fragmented continents. Continental break-up causes a reorganization of shallow mantle dynamics that persists long after rifting, disturbing the geosphere and deep carbon cycle.

 The charge environment of superconducting qubits may be studied through the introduction of controlled, quantified amounts of ionizing radiation. We measure space- and time-correlated charge jumps on a four-qubit device, operating 107 meters below the Earth’s surface in a low-radiation, cryogenic facility designed for the characterization of low-threshold particle detectors. The rock overburden of this facility reduces the cosmic ray muon flux by over 99% compared to laboratories at sea level. Combined with 4π coverage of a movable lead shield, this facility enables quantifiable control over the flux of ionizing radiation on the qubit device. Long-time-series charge tomography measurements on these weakly charge-sensitive qubits capture discontinuous jumps in the induced charge on the qubit islands, corresponding to the interaction of ionizing radiation with the qubit substrate. The rate of these charge jumps scales with the flux of ionizing radiation on the qubit package, as characterized by a series of independent measurements on another energy-resolving detector operating simultaneously in the same cryostat with the qubits.

Here, the authors show that X-linked repeats are differentially silenced during inactivation but do not undergo hyperactivation. 
 In mammals, X-linked dosage compensation involves X-chromosome inactivation to balance X chromosome dosage between males and females, and hyperactivation of the remaining X-chromosome (Xa-hyperactivation) to achieve X-autosome balance in both sexes. Studies of both processes have largely focused on coding genes and have not accounted for transposable elements which comprise 50% of the X-chromosome with numerous epigenetic functions. Here we develop a new bioinformatic pipeline tailored to repetitive elements with capability for allelic discrimination. We then apply the pipeline to our recent So-Smart-Seq analysis of single embryos to comprehensively interrogate whether X-linked transposable elements are subject to either X-chromosome inactivation or Xa-hyperactivation. We observe significant differences in repeat silencing in parentally driven “imprinted” versus zygotically driven “random” X-chromosome inactivation. Chromosomal positioning, genetic background and evolutionary age impact their silencing. In contrast, transposable elements do not undergo Xa-hyperactivation. Evolutionary and functional implications are discussed. X-chromosome dosage compensation involves inactivation and hyperactivation, but the role of transposable elements is unclear.

 Increasing evidence indicates that activation of oncogenic pathways contributes to an unfavourable tumour immune microenvironment (TIME), ultimately resulting in resistance to immunotherapy. Here, we aim to identify a critical oncogenic pathway involved in an antigen-expressing c-MYC-lucOSOE/Tp53KO hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mouse model that simulates immune response against tumour-associated antigens. Using data-independent acquisition proteomics, we reveal the role of wild-type KRAS in immune escaped mouse HCC tumours, with EGF concurrently activating EGFR/MEK/ERK signalling. Single cell RNA sequencing data analysis reveals that KRAS signalling intrinsically inhibits interferon-mediated MHC-I expression and extrinsically impairs CD8+ T cell activity due to the suppression of CXCL9 through the EGFR/MEK/ERK pathway. We observe KRAS activation in HCC patients who received immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatments, where it correlates with poor clinical outcomes. Notably, combination therapy with SOS1 inhibitor MRTX0902, Trametinib, and anti-PD-1 antibody effectively increased intratumoural CD8+ T cell infiltration and improved survival. Our study thus reveals that targeting wild-type KRAS signalling in combination with ICIs may serve as an effective treatment strategy for advanced HCC patients.

 Neural circuits undergo experience-dependent plasticity to form long-lasting memories, but how inhibitory interneurons contribute to this process remains poorly understood. Using miniature microscope calcium imaging, we monitored the activity of large amygdala interneuron populations in freely moving mice during fear learning and extinction. Here we show that interneurons exhibit complex and heterogeneous plasticity at both single-cell and ensemble levels across memory acquisition, expression, and extinction. Analysis of molecular interneuron subpopulations revealed that disinhibitory vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing cells are predominantly activated by salient external stimuli, whereas the activity of projection neuron targeting somatostatin (SST) interneurons additionally aligns with internal behavioural states. Although responses within each interneuron subtype are non-uniform, molecular identity biases their functional role, producing weighted circuit outputs that can flexibly regulate excitatory projection neuron activity and plasticity. These findings demonstrate that inhibitory interneurons actively shape the encoding and stability of emotional memories, underscoring their importance in adaptive learning.

 Polymers that alter their properties and functions in response to carbon dioxide (CO2) exposure offer significant potential for the development of smart technologies and innovative CO2 utilization approaches. Nonetheless, effectively regulating the behavior of solid-state polymers using CO2 remains a considerable challenge, highlighting the need for robust and reliable strategies to address this issue. This study presents elastomers that feature nanophase-separated morphologies composed of CO2-vitrifiable polyethyleneimine and CO2-permeable polydimethylsiloxane components. The elastomers (Young’s modulus (E) of approximately 1 MPa) reversibly transform into hard plastics (E > 2 GPa) in the presence of CO2. In addition to bulk stiffening, their surface adhesion and friction rapidly shift, and the material’s fluorescence is significantly amplified.

 Strong El Niño events drive substantial snowfall in West Antarctica, including the Antarctic Peninsula, by weakening the Amundsen Sea Low (ASL) through atmospheric teleconnections, increasing surface mass balance, and mitigating ice mass loss’s contribution to sea-level rise. However, we find that CMIP6 projections show a diminishing El Niño-driven precipitation effect as global warming intensifies. The El Niño-associated precipitation anomaly is projected to weaken in SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, becoming indistinguishable from zero by the late 21st century in the latter. This transition is caused by a strengthened polar jet, linked to a positive Southern Annular Mode (SAM) trend in a warmer climate, which extends the wavelength of Rossby waves. As a result, the ASL anomaly eventually migrates eastward and equatorward, reducing water vapor transport into West Antarctica’s interior. These findings indicate that El Niño-driven precipitation disappears in a high-emission future, eliminating one of the buffering mechanisms that help counteract sea-level rise."

Our results indicate that the deeper portion of the 2010 coseismic rupture area is velocity-strengthening, and slipped aseismically following the 2007 event. Upward propagation of this afterslip then loaded the shallow velocity-weakening area of the 2010 rupture, which generated a large tsunami in the Pagai Islands. Our approach affords a powerful tool for assessing the future possibility of tsunami(genic) and other triggered earthquakes in seismic gaps near recent large events.

 Earthquakes are among the most destructive natural hazards whose released energy can be quantified by their magnitude. Predicting how much energy will be released before the end of the rupture process represents a challenging question. The way earthquake ruptures grow, propagate and arrest determines the final size: small-to-moderate ruptures evolve in few seconds within few kilometers, while large-to-huge events develop in tens of seconds and several hundred kilometers. If the rupture process starts in the same way for small and large earthquakes, no deterministic prediction of the final size is feasible, until the process has completed. Instead, if the source mechanism starts differently from its beginning, real-time proxies can be measured on early radiated waves to discriminate the final event size. Here we show that the initial ground displacement grows differently for small and large earthquakes, based on the analysis of an unprecedented catalog of seismic waveforms from worldwide earthquakes. The result supports the hypothesis of early predictable magnitude for a wide range of different earthquakes in diverse geological settings. This study confirms that the initial growth of displacement can be used for a fast magnitude estimation, making it potentially feasible for future implementation in early warning systems. An analysis of global earthquake catalogs suggests systematic differences exist in the earliest ground displacements between small and large events, which indicates that earthquake magnitude may be predictable from the initial rupture phase."

 High-altitude hydrothermal systems provide laboratories for understanding microbial adaptation to extreme conditions. Here we investigated thermodynamic controls on metabolic transitions in Lirima hydrothermal system (Chile, 4000 meters above sea level) calculating affinities of competing carbon and sulfur reactions across pools (53–75 °C). Through geochemistry, numerical thermodynamic modeling, and stable isotope analysis, we identify Energetic Convergence Nodes where chemical affinities of competing pathways become equal. Calculations reveal hydrogenotrophic and carboxydotrophic methanogenesis converge with sulfate reduction at 63–64 °C. This corresponds with responses: carbon isotopes shift from −17.2‰ to −27.7‰, sulfur isotopes from −20.5‰ to −9.1‰, and carbon-to-sulfur ratios drop from ~10 to <1, indicating transition from carbon to sulfur-dominated metabolism. Microbial activity collapses at this temperature, while metagenomics validates both pathways. Independent analysis confirms convergence at 63–64 °C, establishing Energetic Convergence Nodes as predictive frameworks for metabolic boundaries with applications for early Earth biogeochemistry and extraterrestrial biosignature detection.

 Climate change and driving mechanisms of the Late Paleozoic Ice Age, an ideal analogue to the present-day global change, remain controversial. Here we propose a volcanic carbon–sulfur radiative forcing mechanism by investigating the Lower Permian Lucaogou Formation in the Junggar Basin, northern Pangea, across the Artinskian warming. Carbon isotope stratigraphy and paleoclimatic proxies record Early Permian carbon cycle fluctuations and second-order cooling amid first-order Artinskian warming. Peaks in mercury concentrations, mercury/total organic carbon, and negative δ13Corg and δ34Sbulk excursions align with Tarim Large Igneous Province eruptions, indicating that Tarim volcanism drove mercury–carbon–sulfur cycling and climate change. Specifically, sulfur cycling induced short-term cooling via elevated atmospheric sulfate, while carbon cycling fueled long-term warming by raising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Globally, volcanism likely modulated carbon–sulfur cycling and glacial–nonglacial alternations across geological eras, with sulfate forcing being a long-overlooked yet crucial mechanism for climate evolution.

 Photosynthetic microbial fuel cells present an integrated strategy for wastewater treatment, greenhouse gas mitigation and bioenergy recovery. Here we elucidate the bioelectrochemical mechanisms by which external resistance and cathodic configuration regulate nitrogen transformation, carbon dynamics and microalgae-bacteria interactions. A microalgae-based cathode achieved net-negative carbon dioxide flux and approximately 37% lower nitrous oxide emissions than open-circuit systems, corresponding to reduced global warming potential relative to mixed-microbial and abiotic cathodes. This reflected enhanced carbon dioxide fixation and suppression of methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Nitrous oxide reduction in the anodic region was attributed to denitrifying bacteria expressing nitrous oxide reductase, supported by electrons from organic matter oxidation. Photosynthesis stimulated nitrification at the cathode, while microalgae assimilated nutrients, improving removal. Lower external resistance enhanced extracellular electron transfer, correlated with elevated pilA and OmcS gene abundance and enrichment of electrogenic genera including Shinella, Geobacter and Pseudomonas. These findings reveal integrated electrochemical–microbial mechanisms facilitating sustainable treatment.

 Climate change is amplifying rainfall-induced mass-wasting risks, while limited detail on failure types and source areas in current inventories hinders mechanistic insight. Here we present a spatial algorithm-based automatic labeling method for enhancing mass-wasting inventories. Events are distinguished into four types based on movement behavior. A visually interpreted inventory was created from the July 2023 extreme precipitation event in Beijing, China, to validate the proposed method. Results show an overall consistency of 82% to 85% between manual and automatic labeling, with lower consistency for debris floods (59%). The method was then applied to a larger inventory to automatically identify failure types and delineate source areas.

 The conversion of natural forests to agricultural land threatens soil biodiversity and ecosystem stability, but its integrated impacts on soil multitrophic communities remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the relationships between forest-to-agriculture conversion, soil multitrophic community diversity, and temporal stability along a 3000 km transect in the Yangtze River Basin. Forest conversion increased the α-diversity of copiotrophic bacteria, but decreased the α-diversity of mycorrhizal fungi, parasitic protists, and most nematode functional groups. Crucially, it consistently decreased β-diversity across all functional groups, homogenizing soil communities. This homogenization destabilized ecosystem productivity by impairing soil nitrogen cycling and weakening plant–soil feedbacks. While the loss of α-diversity was observed in certain groups, it was the decline in β-diversity, or spatial variation, that emerged as the primary driver of reduced ecosystem stability. Our findings challenge conventional conservation paradigms by demonstrating that preserving ecosystem stability requires prioritizing β-diversity through sustainable agriculture and habitat protection.

 Earth’s sedimentary rock record is the primary archive for biotic, environmental, and climatic trends in deep time. Reconstructing these patterns requires a high-resolution geochronologic framework. This remains a significant challenge for many terrestrial ecosystems and an acute problem for some of the world’s most important Mesozoic and Cenozoic fossil records. Overcoming this issue requires frontier approaches, such as directly dating fossils, long considered untenable. Here, we test the reliability of novel LA-ICP-MS U-Pb calcite dating and elemental mapping of non-avian dinosaur eggshells to produce accurate “burial ages.” We directly dated fossilized dinosaur eggs recovered from the Western Interior Basin of North America, producing ages within 5% of high-precision ages from bracketing ash beds. We then directly dated dinosaur eggs from Upper Cretaceous strata within Mongolia’s famous yet poorly age-constrained Gobi Basin, providing the first radioisotopic age for these deposits. Geochemical data coupled with trace elemental mapping indicate early uptake of uranium (U) in non-avian dinosaur eggshells via sediment contact, consistent with findings from Quaternary avian eggs. Calcified eggs, having evolved over 250 million years ago, offers a promising experimental methodology for determining the age of globally distributed fossil assemblages and recovering temporal, environmental, and ecological data from a single fossil.

 Forest aboveground biomass (AGB) density mapping initiatives generally use one of three remote sensing approaches: lidar, radar, or near-nadir multispectral imaging leveraging machine learning methods, or a combination thereof. However, the active instrument record is limited and near-nadir multispectral imaging data are relatively insensitive to canopy physical structure. Multiangle imaging enables annual wall-to-wall mapping with a global record that extends back to 2000 as these data are highly sensitive to forest AGB. This paper describes work to validate estimates in a published annual, wall-to-wall record of forest AGB on a 250 m grid, derived using 672 nm imagery from the NASA, Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Multiangle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR) for 2000–2021, covering the southwestern United States. Estimates in the published MISR-derived annual forest AGB map series for the southwestern United States and the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) L4B Gridded 1 km AGB product were both found to be highly consistent with NASA Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) airborne lidar survey (ALS) AGB data. MISR and GEDI v.2 (v.2.1) estimates yielded similar coefficients of determination (∼0.7) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) (∼60 Mg ha−1) for all ALS data used. For the large CMS Sonoma County Improved AGB dataset, MISR and GEDI v.2 (v.2.1) estimates yielded R2 = 0.88, 0.88 (0.91); RMSE = 58, 40 (37) Mg ha−1. Estimates from MISR thus have an accuracy similar to that of the GEDI L4B gridded AGB product, with some limitations (e.g., topographic shading, tall, dense canopies). However the published MISR maps are on a 250 m grid, wall-to-wall, and cover the period 2000–2021. These results suggest MISR is able to provide a means to investigate trajectories of forest AGB change in the southwestern U.S. from 2000 onwards—over a substantial period of accelerating environmental and human- and climate-driven change– with reasonable precision."

 Faster, better, and more accurate burned area (BA) mapping is crucial for assessing the environmental and socio-economic impacts of wildfires. However, the diverse background disturbance, spectral variability, and extensive distribution of BAs pose significant challenges to their detection using Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery over large areas. Here, we developed a novel Moderate Spatial Resolution Burned Area Change Detection (MSR-BACD) framework, addressing these challenges through dataset development, model innovation, and inference optimization. Specifically: (1) we constructed a globally comprehensive MSR-BACD dataset, incorporating more than one million positive and negative samples (256 × 256 pixels) across diverse land cover backgrounds and cloud conditions to enhance model generalization; (2) we developed a specialized deep learning (DL) foundation model (custom Swin Transformer) leveraging dual-temporal (pre-and-post-fire) imagery to achieve precise BA delineation; and (3) we designed a candidate-based inference mode, collectively using the computational power and petabyte-scale RS data of the Google Earth Engine to generate BA candidates and the DL foundation model deployed on local GPU servers to filter out erroneous detections and delineate the BA extent, to improve detection efficiency significantly. Experimental results demonstrate that the MSR-BACD framework achieved a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 90.50 % in closed-set scenarios and outperformed existing moderate-resolution BA products in open-set evaluations in Portugal, increasing the Dice coefficient by 19.90 % while reducing computational costs by 95.62 % compared to traditional scene-by-scene exhaustive inference.

 Monitoring PM2.5 (mass of particles with diameter less than 2.5 μm) concentrations is challenging due to the limited number of ground-level monitoring stations and the limitations of existing modeling approaches. This study introduces SmartAQ+, a data fusion model that combines a chemical transport model-based system (SmartAQ) with low-cost sensor measurements and machine learning (ML) to enhance high-resolution PM2.5 estimations at the present-time at a 1 × 1 km2 scale. SmartAQ+ integrates real-time data from low-cost PM2.5 sensors, weather stations, and land-use information to improve the accuracy of present-time PM2.5 estimations at all locations in an urban area. SmartAQ+ demonstrated superior performance compared to SmartAQ that does not use real-time measurements in estimating the present-time PM2.5, reducing the corresponding mean error, fractional bias (FBIAS) and fractional error (FERROR) by a factor of two. SmartAQ+ correctly identified 132 out of 190 PM2.5 exceedance events of the daily limit of 25 μg m−3, compared to SmartAQ's 34, while reducing false positives by a factor of 2 and missed events by a factor of 3. The performance gains depended on the availability of nearby sensors. In data sparse zones and during unusual events the model can inherit biases from the chemical transport model and can underestimate extremes. The study highlights the potential of data fusion models to address the limitations of standalone approaches, offering more precise air quality estimations in areas of a city in which there are no measurements."

 Neurological diseases are a major public health concern. While these diseases could be influenced by pollution, the relationship controlling for extreme temperatures remains unexplored.We conducted a retrospective ecological time series study in Spain's 10 most heavily populated provinces, across the period 2013–2018.

We used GLMs with the logit link function (linear regression models of the binomial family) for each province, and based on the probability of admission for each variable, we then calculated hospital admissions attributable to each variable of environmental risk.Across the study period in all the provinces covered, 2077 emergency hospital admissions due to the neurological causes considered were attributed to the environmental variables analysed, and accounted for 13.5 % of the total: the percentage breakdown showed 12.5 % as being attributable to air pollution and 1.0 % to extreme temperatures (0.6 % to cold waves and 0.4 % to heat waves).

Gabov,"Impact of gasification of thermal power plants on the spatial distribution of atmospheric pollution in the arctic urban agglomeration, VORKUTA","•The study demonstrated a decrease of local pollution in the Arctic zone around the Vorkuta urban agglomeration. •The reconstruction of power plants reduced city pollution by 10–100 times. •Switching to natural gas significantly reduced the content of Hg, Cu, V and particulate solids. •The movement of spherical coal pyrolysis particles over long distances is a significant marker of air pollution. 
 The study examined the ionic composition (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, NH4+, NO3−, Cl−, HCO3−, SO42), trace elements (Hg, Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn, V, Ni, Mn, Co, Mo), S, P, total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in the snow cover in Vorkuta (Russia, Komi Republic), both before the reconstruction of the fuel and energy complex in 2017 and after gasification in 2023. In 2017, high levels of aerotechnogenic pollution were revealed in Vorkuta and the surrounding area, with an average concentration of 360 mg/L of suspended particles during fuel oil and coal heating. High concentrations of mercury (up to 0.19 μg/L), vanadium (18 μg/L), nickel (18 μg/L) and petroleum products (0.06 mg/L) were also found, exceeding current Russian sanitary and hygiene standards.The morphology, size and elemental composition of particles formed as a result of coal pyrolysis were determined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The zones of influence of TPP-1, TPP-2, and the Central Boiler House in the urbanised territories of the Vorkuta agglomeration are shown, along with the areas of deposition of various ions, macrocomponents, and heavy metals. The transition to a more environmentally friendly fuel (natural gas) has significantly reduced atmospheric emissions – in 2023, a 40-fold decrease in suspended particles, a 10–20-fold decrease in macrocomponents and a more than 100-fold decrease in mercury, vanadium and aluminium were recorded. Following the shift towards gasification, emissions from fuel and energy facilities became less significant than those from motor vehicles and other urban infrastructure. Vorkuta is no longer a significant 'hot spot' in the Arctic zone."

 This study investigates the impact of forest fires on the spatial distribution of aerosols over the Indian region during the initial phase of the national lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in April and May 2020. Given the significant reduction in anthropogenic emissions during this period, it provides a suitable opportunity to isolate the effect of fire activity on aerosol loading. The present study conducts a spatial correlation analysis to examine the spatial extent of pollution plumes produced by forest fires over India. Statistically significant correlation analysis (p < 0.05) using Satellite-derived fire and aerosol observations indicates that burning in central India modulates the aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the Bay of Bengal on the same day. A lag analysis shows that the impacts of fire pollution emitted from Central India persist over Bay of Bengal up to 4 days after the events, which can affect the air quality and thermodynamics of the marine atmosphere. It is also observed that the fire-AOD correlation is more pronounced over the transported regions than at the source region indicating the influential role of transport in shaping unexpected aerosol patterns over India. Present study provides the spatial footprint and temporal persistence of fire-pollution over India using collocated satellite measurements of fire and aerosols, based on physical linkage and empirical evidence."

 Under global warming, Eastern China faces severe challenges from co-occurrences of heat and ozone (O3) pollution extremes (CHOEs). Utilizing long-term observational data, two dominant modes of interannual variability in the summer frequency of CHOEs over Eastern China during 2000–2022 are identified with empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. The leading two modes account for nearly 50 % of the total variance. The first mode (EOF1) exhibits a positive anomaly center over the North China Plain (NCP). EOF1 is associated with increased springtime snow cover in Eastern Europe. The thermal anomalies due to snowmelt trigger Rossby wave trains that propagate eastward along the mid-latitude westerly jet, modulating local circulation and consequently CHOE anomalies over NCP. The second mode (EOF2) features a dipole pattern with intensified positive anomalies over the southern urban clusters while weaker negative anomalies in the north. For EOF2, a La Niña-like sea surface temperature pattern induces Rossby waves that propagate along the subtropical jet stream. Meanwhile, springtime sea ice loss over the Barents Sea trigger southeastward propagating wave trains. The combined effects of these remote drivers modulate the local atmospheric circulation across southern urban clusters, ultimately regulating the anomalous CHOE frequency. These findings not only deepen our understanding of the large-scale climate drivers shaping the dominant modes of CHOEs over Eastern China, but also highlight the distinctive teleconnection pathways between northern and southern urban clusters, offering a scientific basis for improving early warning and regional mitigation strategies."

 This study investigates the impacts of atmospheric mean state biases on the Indian Ocean teleconnection with Chile, using ERA5 reanalysis and CMIP5/CMIP6 models. During austral early-winter (May–June), Indian Ocean heating anomalies trigger a dipole of increased (reduced) precipitation over central (southern) Chile. The dipole is driven by cyclonic circulation anomalies induced by a zonal wavenumber-3 Rossby wave train originating from South Australia. Models that fail to simulate this rainfall dipole consistently exhibit an equatorward shift of the Southern Hemispheric eddy-driven jet stream. The associated waveguide weakening displaces the refraction location of zonal wavenumber-3 waves westward, thus shifting anticyclonic anomalies from the Amundsen Sea toward Chile. Consequently, the dry signal associated with the Indian Ocean teleconnection moves from southern to central Chile. This waveguide bias likely stems from a reduced meridional gradient of surface temperature, linked to an underestimated Antarctic Sea ice cover. For this reason, accurately simulating Antarctic Sea ice cover is crucial for a better representation of the Indian Ocean teleconnection to Chilean rainfall."
