Chen;Anja H. Tremper;Max Priestman;Anna Font;David C. Green,How COVID-19 related policies reshaped organic aerosol source contributions in Central London,"This study quantified the impact of the COVID lockdown and the Eat Out To Help Out (EOTHO) on the sources/compositions of aerosols. The lockdown significantly reduced the primary emission sources. This study confirmed the important presence of cooking emissions from commercial kitchens in Central London by detecting the enhancement caused by the EOTHO policy after the lockdown. Biomass burning organic aerosol co-emitted with cooking activities from either the fuels or food ingredients used. 
 Organic aerosol (OA), a major component of submicron particulate matter (PM1), has significant impacts on both human health and climate. Quantifying its sources is therefore crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. Positive matrix factorisation (PMF) applied to aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) mass spectral data offers a robust approach for quantifying OA sources. A year-long study of ACSM data from London's Marylebone Road monitoring station during the COVID-19 pandemic provides insights into the impact of lockdown and the Eat Out To Help Out (EOTHO) scheme, which offered support to the hospitality industry during the pandemic, on PM composition and OA sources. Five OA sources were identified including hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA, traffic-related, 11 % to OA), cooking OA (COA, 20 %), biomass burning OA (BBOA, 12 %), more-oxidized oxygenated OA (MO-OOA, 38 %), and less-oxidized oxygenated OA (LO-OOA, 21 %). Lockdown significantly reduced HOA (−52 %), COA (−67 %), and BBOA (−42 %) compared to their pre-COVID levels, while EOTHO doubled COA (+100 %) compared to the post-lockdown period. However, MO-OOA and LO-OOA were less affected, as these primarily originated from long-range transport. This research has demonstrated the importance of commercial cooking as a significant source of OA (20 %) and PM1 (9 %) in urban areas. The co-emission of BBOA with COA observed in Central London showed a similar diurnal cycle and response to the EOTHO policy, indicating that cooking activities might be currently underestimated and contribute to urban BBOA. Therefore, more effort is required to quantify this source and develop targeted abatement policies to mitigate emissions as currently limited regulation is in force."

Burton;Johnathan W. Hair;Chris A. Hostetler;Marta A. Fenn;John A. Smith;Richard A. Ferrare,Aerosol extinction and backscatter Optimal Estimation  retrieval for High Spectral Resolution Lidar,"Advanced lidars can retrieve atmospheric aerosol backscatter, extinction, and linear depolarization ratio. However excessive noise propagation in the traditional inversion method can make extinction unusable when the signal is weak, such as from space. Implementing a weak constraint can reduce the noise propagation while preserving accuracy. Here we also focus on fully characterizing both random and systematic uncertainties and examining the tradeoff between uncertainty and resolution. 
 High Spectral Resolution Lidars (HSRLs) have been successfully deployed from a variety of platforms: ground based, airborne, and now satellite. These lidars are uniquely valuable for characterizing atmospheric aerosol and clouds, benefiting from the ability to characterize vertical variability in more detail than any passive instruments, and, compared to elastic backscatter lidars, provide additional channels of measurements that permit the direct retrieval of particulate extinction. Although analytic solutions exist for deriving particulate backscatter, extinction, and linear depolarization ratio, in the case of extinction, the analytic technique greatly magnifies measurement noise. Low signal-to-noise measurements stress the traditional inversion methods. Accordingly, algorithms for the retrieval of HSRL backscatter and extinction are re-examined and optimized to reduce the noise propagation. Here we explore an Optimal Estimation methodology and compare it with an implementation of the direct differentiation method like that historically used for the processing of airborne HSRL data from NASA Langley Research Center."

Researchers collected data from 40 beech and spruce forest sites in spring and summer 2023, using a standardized method to ensure consistency. The results show that water sources for trees change between seasons and vary by tree species. This large dataset offers valuable information for understanding plant water use, improving ecohydrological models, and mapping water cycles across Europe. 
 The stable isotope ratios of hydrogen (δ2H) and oxygen (δ18O) are useful for studying ecohydrological dynamics in forests. However, most isotope-based eco-hydrological studies are limited to single sites, resulting in a lack of large-scale isotope data for understanding tree water uptake. Here, we provide a first systematic isotope dataset for soil and stem xylem water collected during two pan-European sampling campaigns at 40 beech (Fagus sylvatica), spruce (Picea abies), or mixed beech-spruce forest sites in spring and summer 2023 (https://doi.org/10.16904/envidat.542, Lehmann et al., 2024). The dataset is complemented by additional site-, soil-, and tree-specific metadata. The samples and metadata were collected by different researchers across Europe following a standardized protocol. Soil samples were taken at up to 5 depths (ranging from 0 to 90 cm) and stem xylem samples from the trunks of three beech and/or spruce trees per site. All samples were sent to a single laboratory, where all analytical work was conducted. Water was extracted using cryogenic vacuum distillation and analyzed with an isotope laser spectrometer. Additionally, a subset of the samples was analyzed with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Data quality checks revealed a high mean total extraction efficiency, mean water amount (>1 mL), accuracy, and precision. The isotopic signature of soil and stem xylem water varied as a function of the geographic origin and changed from spring to summer across all sites. While δ2H and δ18O were strongly correlated, the soil water data plotted closer to the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL) than the stem xylem water.  Specifically, the δ2H values of the xylem water were more enriched than those of the soil water, leading to a systematic deviation from the GMWL. Isotopic enrichment of the stem xylem water at mixed forest sites was larger for spruce trees than for beech trees. This dataset is particularly useful for large-scale studies on plant water use, ecohydrological model testing, and isotope mapping across Europe."

The southern Adriatic, an important area for air-sea CO2 exchange, is still poorly characterized. Using high-resolution oceanographic measurements, local physical and biogeochemical changes were investigated, providing a dataset to improve future understanding of the role of the southern Adriatic as a carbon source or sink. 
 The rising CO2 concentration in the atmosphere leads to an increase in CO2 uptake in the ocean and to significant changes in seawater chemistry. These changes, in turn, exert profound effects on marine ecosystems across multiple trophic levels. The Mediterranean Sea is considered a hotspot for climate change. Despite such relevance, observations and studies on its carbonate system remain limited, especially in regions that play a crucial role in regulating air-sea CO2 exchange like intermediate and dense water formation areas. The southern Adriatic Sea, a key site for dense water formation in the eastern Mediterranean, hosts the EMSO ERIC and ICOS ERIC South Adriatic observatory (EMSO-E2M3A), operated by the Italian National Institute of Oceanography and Applied Geophysics (OGS). This facility allows the study of physical and biogeochemical dynamics in the deepest area of the Adriatic Sea. The suite of sensors deployed on the surface buoy allows for the characterization of water mass properties, biogeochemical cycles, dense water formation process, and ocean acidification, particularly in relation to carbon sequestration dynamics. Here, time series of meteorological data (e.g., wind speed, wind direction), sea surface physical parameters (e.g., temperature, salinity), dissolved oxygen and partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2sw) and pH from 2014 to 2024 will be presented (https://doi.org/10.13120/y2hw-1j63, Cardin et al., 2025). In particular, quality check and correction and post-processing methods applied to the data will be discussed. The validated surface dataset provides a consistent pCO2sw time series for the Adriatic Sea, with values and seasonal variability in agreement with previous observations across the Mediterranean. Associated temperature, salinity, oxygen, and wind measurements reproduce expected regional patterns, confirming the robustness and suitability of the presented dataset for further biogeochemical and climate-related analyses."

 The assimilation of satellite spectral sounder data requires fast and accurate radiative transfer models. This study proposes a novel methodology to automatically parameterize atmospheric optical depths within the Radiative Transfer for TOVS (RTTOV) version 13 scheme using statistical thresholds across pressure levels and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to induce sparsity. Numerical experiments with Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) infrared channels demonstrate that this approach significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining accuracy. The sparsity also facilitates the automatic selection of absorbing gases and predictors by channel and pressure level, making it particularly effective for multispectral instruments with numerous atmospheric variables. These findings highlight the potential of sparse regression methods to enhance the efficiency of radiative transfer models for satellite data assimilation."

The results show that including cloud- and precipitation-affected satellite data improves forecasts of moisture, wind, and clouds, especially in the tropics. This work highlights the potential of this new ensemble data assimilation system to enhance global weather forecasts. 
 The Gain-form of Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LGETKF) has been implemented in the Joint Effort for Data assimilation Integration (JEDI) with the Model for Prediction Across Scales – Atmosphere (MPAS-A) (i.e., MPAS-JEDI). LGETKF applies vertical localization in model space and is particularly convenient for assimilating satellite radiances that do not have an explicit vertical height assigned to each channel. Additional efforts are made to optimize the ensemble analysis procedure and improve the computational efficiency of MPAS-JEDI's LGETKF. This is the first application of JEDI-based LGETKF for assimilating radiance data in all-weather situations with a global MPAS configuration. The system is first tuned for covariance inflation and horizontal localization settings. It is found that using a combination of relaxation to prior perturbation (RTPP) and relaxation to prior spread (RTPS) outperforms using RTPP or RTPS alone, and using a smaller horizontal localization scale for all-sky radiances is preferable. With the optimized inflation and localization settings, assimilating all-sky radiances of the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit – A (AMSU-A) window channels with an 80-member LGETKF improved the forecasts of moisture, wind, clouds, and precipitation fields, when compared to the benchmark experiment without assimilation of all-sky AMSU-A radiances. The positive forecast impact of all-sky AMSU-A radiances is the largest over the tropical regions up to 7 d. Some degradation in the temperature forecasts is seen over certain regions, where the model forecast is likely biased, causing deficiencies for assimilating all-sky data. The LGETKF capability is available in the recent public release of MPAS-JEDI and is ready for research and operational explorations."

We also pinpoint specific areas where the model still struggles, providing valuable directions for future model development. This progress means scientists can now use this tool more confidently to understand how Arctic ocean layers work and change. 
 Advancing high-resolution Arctic ocean–sea ice modeling is critical for understanding polar amplification and improving climate projections but faces challenges from computational limits and cross-scale interactions. The simulation capabilities of the ocean–sea ice coupled model (E3SMv2-MPAS) from the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) 2.1 for the Arctic ocean–sea ice system are systematically evaluated using multi-source observational data. The model employs a latitudinally varying mesh, with resolution increasing from 60 km in the Southern Hemisphere to 10 km in the Arctic. This design balances computational efficiency with the accurate integration of low-latitude oceanic influences, while the unstructured mesh also enhances the geometric representation of Arctic straits. Together, these features form a simulation framework capable of resolving processes from seasonal to decadal timescales. Numerical results demonstrate E3SMv2-MPAS's superior Arctic simulation performance: (1) accurate reproduction of spatial heterogeneity in sea ice concentration, thickness, and sea surface temperature, including their 1995–2020 trend patterns; (2) faithful reproduction of both the freshwater content and transports through key Arctic gateways; (3) successful reconstruction of three-dimensional thermohaline structures within the Atlantic Water layer, capturing Atlantic Water's decadal warming trends and accelerated Atlantification processes – specifically mid-layer shoaling, heat content amplification, and reduced heat transfer lag times in the Eurasian Basin. Persistent systematic biases are identified: 0.5–1 m sea ice thickness overestimation in the Canadian Basin; Coordinated sea surface temperature/salinity underestimation and sea ice concentration overestimation in the Greenland and Barents Seas; Atlantic Water core temperature overestimation; Regional asymmetries in decadal thermohaline field evolution."

Using Sweden as a case study, the model's application is demonstrated by constructing and validating a baseline and conducting a scenario analysis. The results highlight CIBUSmod's ability to quantify trade-offs in land use, nutrient flows, and greenhouse gas emissions across different transition pathways. The model is designed to be accessible, utilising Python and Jupyter Notebooks with Excel-based input data management. It is publicly available under the GNU GPLv3 licence.

Emerging research focuses on characterizing multiscale bedform configurations, but their stability remains unknown. Here, we analyzed twelve flume experiments of varying sizes to uncover a sharp transition between two independent multiscale bedform configurations. Bedform groups—quasi‐stable collections of bedforms—that have similar heights and celerities as constituent bedforms are found in flows with suspension number (ratio of shear velocity to sediment settling velocity; u∗/ws ${u}^{\ast }/{w}_{s}$) less than 1. In contrast, large dunes with smaller, faster‐moving superimposed bedforms characterize flows with u∗/ws ${u}^{\ast }/{w}_{s}$ > 1. The transition between these two states abruptly occurs at u∗/ws=1.1±0.12 ${u}^{\ast }/{w}_{s}=1.1\mathit{\pm }0.12$ in low Froude‐number flows, and is further supported by distinct autogenic noise characteristics in bed evolution.

From the analysis of the reflected signals, all the lakes appear to be methane‐dominated and potentially rippled by a few millimeters of aggregate surface roughness. A subsequent observation of the same district by Cassini RADAR in altimetry mode during T126 intersected the bistatic track over one of these lakes, revealing uniform backscattering across several basins. Lakes observed in bistatic configuration exhibit similar characteristics to those observed in altimetry mode, suggesting that all the liquid bodies present at Titan's lake district may have similar composition and roughness."

This study highlights an additional role of land‐atmosphere interactions in modulating North American atmospheric circulation during ENSO‐post early summer. Using reanalysis data and numerical simulations, we identify an ocean‐land‐atmosphere relay mechanism. El Niño‐induced persistent upstream sea surface temperature anomalies enhance moisture transport into North America, which triggers a dipole pattern of land temperature anomalies—cooling in the midlatitudes and warming at higher latitudes—through surface turbulent latent heat flux and shortwave radiation. These land surface anomalies feedback on the atmosphere via modifications in sensible heat flux and longwave radiation, weakening low‐level meridional air temperature gradient and atmospheric baroclinicity. The resulting negative transient eddy vorticity forcing induces an equivalent barotropic geopotential high anomaly and weakens the westerly jet around 50°N. These findings underscore the essential role of land‐atmosphere coupling in extending ENSO's summer influence."

Using Magnetospheric Multiscale mission observations, we report a novel two‐layers bridge‐like arcs structure in ion energy spectrum, formed by simultaneous nonlinear interactions between large‐amplitude electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves and ions (H+ ${\mathrm{H}}^{+}$ and He+ ${\text{He}}^{+}$). Even after incorporating finite wave‐field effects into the resonance condition, only a few instances exist where the minimum correction energy is lower than the observed value, thus confirming the presence of an anomalous heating mechanism. The lower‐layer bridge‐like arcs are formed by the interaction between H+ ${\mathrm{H}}^{+}$ and EMIC waves, while the upper‐layer bridge‐like arcs result from the nonlinear interaction between He+ ${\text{He}}^{+}$ ions and EMIC waves.

This enhancement stems from a mismatch in time scales between vortex evacuation and condensation. Inertial droplets are centrifuged out of vortical regions much faster than condensation can occur. They then grow by condensation, releasing latent heat locally. Our simulations reveal that vortical regions co‐locate with cooler temperatures and higher moisture, leading to sharp density gradients at their boundaries. These gradients drive baroclinic torque, generating small‐scale turbulence. The time scales involved align with our scaling estimates. While our earlier two‐dimensional model anticipated this effect, it underestimated its intensity and limited it to sub‐Kolmogorov scales. The enhancement of turbulence over inertial scales that we find here could drive rapid raindrop growth."

We find a depth‐dependent control on postseismic process: at 0–10 km, both 49% of aftershocks and substantial afterslip are driven by coseismic stress increases. Conversely, at 10–20 km depth, afterslip‐induced stress perturbations dominate, hosting 64% of aftershocks.

Two factors drive this frequency increase. First, a shift toward the Eastern Pacific (EP) El Niño pattern—characterized by higher frequencies and greater amplitudes relative to the Central Pacific (CP) pattern. Second, an overall increase in the frequency of both EP and CP variability. These changes scale with the intensity of anthropogenic forcing. Most models also exhibit ENSO strengthening that begins in the 20th $20\text{th}$ century and continues throughout the 21st $21\text{st}$ century.

 Organ shortage remains a major challenge in transplantation, and gene-edited pig organs offer a promising solution1–3. Despite gene-editing, the immune reactions following xenotransplantation can still cause transplant failure4. To understand the immunological response of a pig-to-human kidney xenotransplantation, we conducted large-scale multi-omics profiling of the xenograft and the host’s blood over a 61-day procedure in a brain-dead human (decedent) recipient. Blood plasmablasts, natural killer (NK) cells, and dendritic cells increased between postoperative day (POD)10 and 28, concordant with expansion of IgG/IgA B-cell clonotypes, and subsequent biopsy-confirmed antibody-mediated rejection (AbMR) at POD33. Human T-cell frequencies increased from POD21 and peaked between POD33-49 in the blood and xenograft, coinciding with T-cell receptor diversification, expansion of a restricted TRBV2/J1 clonotype and histological evidence of a combined AbMR and cell-mediated rejection at POD49. At POD33, the most abundant human immune population in the graft was CXCL9+ macrophages, aligning with IFN-γ-driven inflammation and a Type I immune response. In addition, we see evidence of interactions between activated pig-resident macrophages and infiltrating human immune cells. Xenograft tissue showed pro-fibrotic tubular and interstitial injury, marked by S100A65, SPP16 (Osteopontin), and COLEC117, at POD21–POD33. Proteomics profiling revealed human and pig complement activation, with decreased human component after AbMR therapy with complement inhibition. Collectively, these data delineate the molecular orchestration of human immune responses to a porcine kidney, revealing potential immunomodulatory targets for improving xenograft survival."

Hemodynamic and electrolyte stability and dialysis independence were achieved. Post-operative day (POD) 10 biopsies revealed glomerular IgM and IgA deposition, activation of early complement components and mesangiolysis with stable renal function without proteinuria, a phenotype not seen in allotransplantation. On POD 33, an abrupt increase in serum creatinine was associated with antibody-mediated rejection and increased donor-specific IgG. Plasma exchange, C3/C3b inhibition and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG), completely reversed xenograft rejection. Pre-existing donor-reactive T cell clones expanded progressively in the circulation post-transplant, acquired an effector transcriptional profile and were detected in the POD 33 rejecting xenograft prior to rATG treatment. This study provides the first long-term physiologic, immunologic, and infectious disease monitoring of a pig-to-human kidney xenotransplant and indicates that pre-existing xenoreactive T cells and induced antibodies to unknown epitope(s) present a major challenge, despite significant immunosuppression. It also demonstrates that a minimally gene-edited pig kidney can support long-term life-sustaining physiologic functions in a human."

 Seismic gaps are fault sections that have not hosted a large earthquake for a long time compared to neighbouring segments, making them likely sites for future large events. The 2025 Mw 7.7 Mandalay (Myanmar) earthquake, on the central section of the Sagaing Fault, ruptured through a known seismic gap and ~160 km beyond it, resulting in an exceptionally long rupture of ~460 km. Here we investigate the rupture process of this event and the factors that enabled it to breach the seismic gap by integrating satellite synthetic aperture radar observations, seismic waveform back-projection, Bayesian finite-fault inversion and dynamic rupture simulations. We identify a two-stage earthquake rupture comprising initial bilateral subshear propagation for ~20 s followed by unilateral supershear rupture for ~70 s. Simulation-based sensitivity tests suggest that the seismic gap boundary was not a strong mechanical barrier in terms of frictional strength, and that nucleation of the earthquake far from the gap boundary, rather than its supershear speed, allowed the rupture to outgrow the gap and propagate far beyond it. Hence, we conclude that the dimension of seismic gaps may not reflect the magnitude of future earthquakes. Instead, ruptures may cascade through multiple fault sections to generate larger and potentially more damaging events.

 Mangroves are recognized globally as important blue carbon ecosystems for mitigating climate change due to their remarkable carbon sequestration potential. However, methane emissions from these ecosystems can partially offset their net carbon burial capacity. Although methane oxidation within soils can minimize these emissions, the contribution of methane released directly through mangrove tree stems remains underexplored. Emerging evidence indicates that wetland trees may serve as conduits for soil-derived methane, potentially constituting a poorly quantified component of mangrove carbon cycling. Here we present a global quantification of methane emissions mediated by trees, leveraging field measurements, global datasets and machine learning-driven upscaling. Our analysis reveals that annual stem methane emissions total approximately 730.60 (95% CI: 586.09–876.93) gigagrams per year, offsetting sediment carbon burial by ~16.9%. When combined with soil methane emissions, stem fluxes increase the total methane budget, offsetting approximately 27.5% of blue carbon sequestration. Stem methane emissions were closely related to wood density, soil organic carbon content, salinity and soil methane flux, indicating that emissions originate primarily from mangrove sediments, with higher emissions correlated to lower wood density, lower salinity and greater wood water content. Our findings underscore the need to incorporate stem-mediated fluxes into blue carbon budgets and climate mitigation strategies.

 Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) are considered among the highest threats to global health by WHO. Their detection is difficult and time-consuming. We developed a random-forest machine learning (ML) model, CarbaDetector, to predict carbapenemase production from inhibition zone diameters of eight antibiotics, using 385 isolates for training with whole genome sequencing as reference. Validation on two external datasets (A = 282, B = 518 isolates) shows high performance: sensitivity/specificity are 96.6%/84.4% (training), 96.3%/86.1% (A), and 91.2%/87.0% (B, five antibiotics). In contrast, the algorithms of EUCAST and the Antibiogram Committee of the French Society of Microbiology (CA-SFM) exhibit lower specificity (8.2% and 40.1%, respectively on the training dataset). In this work, we show that CarbaDetector, available as a web-app, reduces unnecessary confirmatory testing and accelerates the time to result. This approach offers high sensitivity and improved specificity compared to standard algorithms and has the potential to improve CPE detection, especially in resource-limited settings.

 Ordered nanostructured magnetic networks offer a versatile platform for studying magnetic frustration, reconfigurable magnonics, and neuromorphic computing. Their fabrication, however, often relies on complicated and expensive nanolithography. Here, we demonstrate an electrochemical strategy for growing large-area magnetic networks composed of self-organized triangular motifs separated by periodic parallel ridges. The ridges arise deterministically from voltage-controlled electrodeposition, while the regions between them undergo self-organization: cobalt nucleates, bifurcates, and assembles into either solid or hollow triangular units depending on the growth conditions. The global network morphology is dictated by the waveform of the applied voltage. These triangular structures host diverse magnetic states, including vortex-like and macro-spin-like configurations, and exhibit nonlinear responses to external magnetic fields. Our approach combines macroscopically controlled, deterministic growth and microscopic self-organization, providing a scalable pathway for fabricating complex nanostructures. The resulting magnetic networks show potential as physical reservoirs for neuromorphic computing.

 Janus fiber membranes enable directional liquid transport (DLT) for oil-water separation and moisture management, yet conventional pore-channel designs offer limited efficiency. Herein, we have developed a groundbreaking Janus nanofiber structure inspired by the structural characteristics of plant leaves, specifically the pore gradient and liquid transport channels within leaves. An innovative intermediate buffer layer composed of a three-dimensional helical nanofiber membrane was introduced to boost porosity and horizontal interconnectivity. A dopamine-controlled regulation mechanism synergistically optimized the pore structure and wettability of this layer.

Here, the authors discover that a preserved, DLD-mediated metabolic suppression by TGFβ undermines anti-TGFβ therapy, promoting gastric cancer growth. 
 Despite the well-known role of the transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) pathway in cancer progression, therapies targeting it have largely failed in the clinic. This suggests our understanding of TGFβ’s function is incomplete. Here we show that this therapeutic failure is rooted in a fundamental paradox: while TGFβ promotes malignant traits in gastric cancer, many cancer cells remain sensitive to its potent tumor-suppressive effects. We uncover that this suppression works by impairing the cell’s energy metabolism through modulating dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD). Therefore, broadly blocking the TGFβ pathway can inadvertently release a natural brake on tumor growth. Based on this insight, we demonstrate that co-targeting this metabolic vulnerability with an inhibitor (devimistat) alongside an anti-TGFβ agent significantly enhances therapeutic efficacy in gastric cancer models. This combination approach presents a promising strategy to overcome the limitations of current therapies. The role of TGFβ in cancer is paradoxical and context-dependent.

 Graphene has received much attention due to its monoatomic, unique two-dimensional structure, which results in remarkable mechanical, physical, and electrical properties. However, synthesizing high-quality graphene-based composites with high conductivity and ionic mobility remains challenging. Here, we report an allotrope to the nanocarbon family, Graphene-P-phenyl-Graphene, synthesized by inserting π-π-conjugated p-phenyls between graphene layers and connecting them via C–C σ bonds. Graphene-P-phenyl-Graphene is thermally and dynamically stable, as verified by density functional theory and molecular dynamics, and can be produced at kilogram scale. The p-phenyl bridges swell the layer spacing from ~0.34 to ~0.56 nm, reducing van der Waals forces and enhancing electron delocalization. Electrons in these separated graphene layers benefit from low mass and efficient 3D screening of charge scattering, resulting in high Hall mobility (10,000–13,000 cm² V⁻¹ s⁻¹) in freestanding films. The expanded spacing also enables decoupling of layer electrons and rapid ion storage and transport—even for large ions. For example, potassium-ion batteries using Graphene-P-phenyl-Graphene exhibit high reversible capacity, long-term stability, and high charge-discharge rates. Graphene-P-phenyl-Graphene holds promise for large-scale, portable, high-performance electronics with energy storage capabilities.

 Soil carbon changes are difficult to measure globally, and global models are poorly constrained. Here, we propose a framework to map annual changes in soil carbon and litter (SOCL) as the difference between the net land CO2 flux from atmospheric inversions and satellite-based maps of biomass changes. We show that SOCL accumulated globally at a rate of about 0.34 ± 0.30 ( ± 1 sigma) billion tonnes of carbon per year (PgC yr−1) during 2011-2020. The largest SOCL sink is found in boreal regions (0.93 ± 0.45 PgC yr−1 in total) particularly in undisturbed peatlands and managed forests. The largest losses occur in the dry tropics (−0.50 ± 0.47 PgC yr−1) and correspond with agricultural expansion from land use change, cropland management and grazing. By contrast, forests in the wet tropics act as a net soil carbon sink (0.32 ± 0.35 PgC yr−1). Our findings highlight the large mitigation opportunities in the dry tropics to restore agricultural soil carbon.

 Most climate change forecasts assume that longer growing seasons increase carbon storage through increased tree growth, but recent findings have challenged this assumption.

Current hypotheses for why longer growing seasons may not always increase tree growth include drought-related effects and internal constraints.

Here the authors assess changes in subsurface soil moisture, finding that these droughts also become more persistent and intense than surface droughts. 
 Anthropogenic climate change has exacerbated soil moisture droughts globally, yet this exacerbation in their spatiotemporal evolution in terms of soil vertical structure remains unclear. Here we propose a Lagrangian four-dimensional tracking framework to identify a type of spatial (horizontal and vertical)–temporal contiguous drought events, that is, deep droughts characterized by bottom-heavy deep-dominated shapes, with more extensive moisture deficits in deep than surface soils. These deep droughts, accounting for a quarter of total events, are ignored in surface-based soil moisture monitoring. Both reanalyses and climate models show significantly increasing duration and intensity of the deep droughts over the past four decades, attributable to anthropogenic climate change. Relative to the past, future deep droughts are projected to become longer-lasting and more intense globally, with larger increases in deeper soil layers under higher-emission scenarios. These deep droughts hidden below the surface pose challenges for satellite-based agricultural drought monitoring and cause an underestimation of adverse impacts of droughts on ecosystems. How the conditions in soil layers below the surface change is not well understood.

A study now evaluates the health impacts of different PM2.5 reduction strategies, providing evidence of their effectiveness across different regions and timeframes. 
 Long-term PM2.5 exposure is a risk factor for cardiovascular and respiratory mortality. Here a global health impact assessment was conducted utilizing seven future scenarios evaluating strategies to reduce PM2.5 exposure. Strategies included reducing fossil fuel use, air pollution control, adopting cleaner cooking methods and combinations thereof. Under current trends, air quality is projected to improve by 2050; nevertheless, the absolute attributable burden of ischaemic heart disease, stroke and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease remains high in many regions. Cleaner cooking fuel use is effective in the short term (by 2030) in South and Central America, Asia, and Africa for reducing PM2.5-related deaths. In the long term (by 2050) for most regions, only strategies that simultaneously target ambient and cooking-related PM2.5 resulted in sustained improvements that expand beyond current trends for reducing disease burden across these three health outcomes. In the Asian region, for example, under current trends, the population-attributable fraction decreases from 35% in 2015 to 18% in 2050. In the scenario combining universal clean cooking and climate policy, it drops further to 15%, and when all strategies are combined, it reaches as low as 11% by 2050. With all strategies combined, the average global population-weighted PM2.5 exposure from both ambient and cooking sources is reduced by nearly two-thirds (66 µg m−3 compared with 26 µg m−3). For North Africa and the Middle East region, the population-attributable fraction remains high across all scenarios. Additional strategies beyond those mentioned here are required to further improve air quality. It is recommended to pursue climate mitigation alongside universal access to cleaner household fuels to maximize cardiopulmonary health benefits. Exposure to air pollution poses a substantial risk to health, contributing to high rates of cardiovascular and respiratory mortality.

 Accurate methane (CH4) emission estimates from Arctic and boreal wetlands are essential for reducing global budget uncertainties but are hindered by poorly constrained wetland distribution and classification. We assessed how land cover map resolution and thematic detail influence these estimates. Using very high spatial resolution land cover maps (≤2.5 m) with five to seven harmonized classes and 4–50% wetland coverage, we estimated CH4 emissions across seven Arctic and boreal sites in North America and Eurasia. Resampling to coarser resolutions (up to 5 km) revealed that CH4 flux estimates remained within 13% error when resolution was ≤25 m pixel size. At resolutions coarser than 1 km, four of seven sites shifted from net CH4 source to sink, due to misrepresentation of wetland extent in heterogeneous landscapes with small, fragmented wetlands. Thematic detail also proved critical, as fens—high CH4 emitters—were disproportionately underrepresented in coarse (>1 km) maps relative to other wetland types. We also show that existing global or circumpolar land cover maps tend to misrepresent wetlands, either overlooking smaller features or overestimating coverage in wetland dominated areas. Our findings indicate that coarse-scale land cover datasets are unsuitable for estimating CH4 budgets in these regions, where high spatial resolution and biogeochemically relevant land cover classes are essential for reliable CH4 emission upscaling.

 In recent efforts to reduce the radiative forcing of aviation, fuel design has gained increased attention. Sustainable Aviation Fuels are seeing wider adoption, and their positive impact on carbon dioxide and non-volatile soot particle emissions is well-established. However, the effects of the reduction in fuel sulfur content on volatile particle emissions and contrails are unknown. This study presents observations from in-flight measurements of emissions and contrails of an Airbus A350-900 burning fuels with different sulfur contents. We find a reduction in volatile particles and contrail ice crystals for low-sulfur fuels. For higher fuel sulfur contents, our findings demonstrate an additional contrail ice particle source through activation of sulfate aerosols. Our data-driven results need to be consolidated by in-flight observations with different fuels and engines. Eventually, climate impact estimates as well as regulations should account for the modulating effect of the fuel sulfur content on contrail ice particle numbers. The number of contrail ice crystals can be tuned by adjusting the fuel’s sulfur content, as shown by in-flight measurements of emissions and contrails from an Airbus A350-900 burning different fuels."

 Ship emissions are a major source of aerosols over oceans, affecting both air quality and energy balance of the climate. However, estimates of their climate forcing diverge between studies relying on visible ship-tracks and those based on models. Here we show that forcing due to visible ship-tracks accounts for just 5% of the total forcing over the southeast Atlantic shipping-lane. Most forcing from ship emissions comes from aerosols that do not form detectable ship-tracks. They are only tips of the iceberg. We make three forcing calculations, one bottom-up based on visible ship-tracks, one top-down based on spatial relationships, and a hybrid approach that combines top-down or model estimated cloud droplet number concentration changes and cloud adjustments. Although the forcing based on machine learning detected ship tracks is an order of magnitude greater than prior results using manually detected ship-tracks, it remains only 5% of that inferred by top-down or cloud adjustment based methods for pre-2020 shipping. The top-down and the combined cloud adjustments methods show similar forcing for the post-2020 reduction in ships’ sulfur emission, although the methods have important regional differences in cloud adjustments that need further investigation. Our results reconcile a long-standing discrepancy in the literature and have important implications for aerosol indirect forcing and marine cloud brightening.

 The eruption of Hunga volcano on 15 January 2022 was an exceptional event in the satellite era. Record-breaking heights of the volcanic plume were reported, a large amount of water was injected into the stratosphere and a broad spectrum of atmospheric waves were detected. Here, we use satellite measurements to show that a transient ring of small ice particles (~2 μm) formed around the plume. We hypothesize that the ice ring was generated by the passage of an atmospheric wave triggered by a pressure pulse at the surface corresponding to a violent explosion that occurred during the 15 January 2022 eruption sequence. The passage of the atmospheric wave produced a transient rarefaction in the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere, which in turn led to oscillations in ambient temperature. Due to the supersaturated state of the atmosphere with respect to ice, ice particles formed in the wake of the radially propagating atmospheric wave, allowing an exceptional opportunity to study ice particle growth via vapour deposition. This atmospheric phenomenon serves as an important natural experiment that reveals the time scale on which ice particles nucleate and grow given an abrupt perturbation in ambient temperature.

 Biodiversity hotspots often coincide with regions along subduction zones where tectonic activity continuously make and break geographic connections promoting biological diversification and speciation. A puzzling biodiversity hotspot is the northern Caribbean islands that contain endemic terrestrial and freshwater biotas mainly evolved from South American colonizers that dispersed during the Cenozoic. However, tectonic reconstructions have always assumed a mostly inactive and coherent eastern Caribbean plate, such that migration routes must either have been overwater, or through an inner-plate land bridge. Nevertheless, recent studies revealed that the northeastern Caribbean region underwent tectonically induced uplift, subsidence and large-scale block rotations questioning the assumed plate coherency. Here we present a plate reconstruction including these novel constraints and reveals how tectonic and volcanic activity along the Lesser Antilles subduction zone have established a transient land corridor connecting South America and the Greater Antilles from ~45 to 25 Ma ago offering a new avenue to explain Caribbean biotic interchanges and diversification.

 Long-term time series of coastal bathymetric data are indispensable for analysing morphological resilience to climate change. Despite the increasing popularity of utilizing high-resolution digital elevation models for coastal management, potential errors in analysing the long-term trend of bed elevation change from historical datasets have attracted little attention. Here, we demonstrate that inconsistency in the spatial resolution of small-scale topographic features characterized by sharp bathymetric gradients could produce errors in the mean elevation that in individual years could exceed the sea level change rate and result in a statistically significant bias in the trend of the mean elevation. Neglecting this inconsistency may lead to a misconception of coastal resilience to sea level rise. We provide an analytical method to identify such inconsistency in bathymetric datasets and a homogenization method to minimise the errors. Our methods are broadly applicable for analysing time series of geospatial data and quantitative assessment of data consistency.

 Reduced and polymerized phosphorus species may have been crucial for the origin and early evolution of life, as they are more reactive and soluble than phosphate. Thermal processes could have produced these phosphorus species; however, the underlying mechanism is poorly constrained, and geological evidence of polymerized species in the Precambrian is so far absent. Here, we investigated contact-metamorphic rocks from the ca. 3.22 Ga Moodies Group (South Africa), where mafic dikes intruded into shallow-marine sediments. We provide evidence of magmatic phosphite (up to 2.85 ppm) and metamorphic polyphosphate (up to 39.3 ppm). Additional laboratory experiments suggest that carbon can facilitate the thermal production of polyphosphates and reduced phosphorus species, including phosphide, from less reactive minerals such as apatite and vivianite. We conclude that magmatic and thermal-metamorphic rocks could have provided soluble and reactive phosphorus species crucial for the origin and early evolution of life.

 Land subsidence (LS) threatens public safety and sustainable socioeconomic development across the United States (US). Wide-area LS mapping plays a crucial role in improving the characterization of LS, thus contributing to a better understanding of its impacts beyond national borders. However, a nationwide LS map for the US is still lacking, and mapping LS at this scale faces challenges such as atmospheric artifacts, computational limitations, and data calibration issues. We develop a strategy for mapping and identifying LS on a nationwide scale. This strategy includes average deformation calculation, mosaicking of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) results, and LS areas extraction using deep learning. Using this strategy and extensive SAR data, we present the first high-resolution, nationwide LS map for the contiguous U. S. (CONUS), derived from 23,391 ascending Sentinel-1 images acquired between 2019 and 2021. Our analysis reveals that LS affects all 48 states and the District of Columbia, covering ∼45,666 km2. Approximately 73 % of LS occurs in cultivated lands, 10 % in wetlands, with groundwater overexploitation being the predominant driver of subsidence. These subsiding areas expose 6.26 million people, 160,071 buildings, and critical infrastructure, including thousands of kilometers of railways and roads. Although some measures have been implemented to mitigate LS, existing cases suggest that long-term groundwater management is essential, and significant challenges remain in addressing severe LS.

 Accurate characterization of the surface radiation budget (SRB) is essential for understanding the Earth's climate. Satellite-based SRB products are typically generated through estimating different components separately using various algorithms, thereby resulting in varying uncertainties and poor conservation. This study developed the SRB conservation constraint multi-task learning densely connected convolutional neural network models to jointly estimate global daily SRB at 1 km spatial resolution from MODIS observations spanning 2000–2023. These observations include reflectance from bands 1–5, 7, and 19; thermal radiance from bands 28–29 and 31–34; and ancillary information such as elevation, solar-viewing geometry, and GLASS-MODIS surface longwave radiation. Validation results against 224 sites over three years showed that the RMSEs of daily estimates for downward, upward, and net shortwave radiation were 29.38, 20.73, and 23.14 Wm−2, respectively; for downward, upward, and net longwave radiation, they were 19.98, 15.69, and 14.70 Wm−2; and for net radiation, it was 24.28 Wm−2. This method improves the underestimations of downward and net shortwave radiation in the MCD18A1, GLASS-MODIS, and BESS products; the accuracy of retrievals for downward and net longwave radiation is better than those from GLASS-MODIS and CERES-SYN. The estimates also reduce the non-conservation by 26.69 % compared to GLASS-MODIS. These improvements lie in the method's ability to enhance retrieval accuracy by utilizing cross-domain features from all components and to address non-conservation issues in SRB retrievals through the constraint of SRB conservation in the training. The SRB estimates exhibit great spatiotemporal consistency with other SRB products, except for regional reflected solar radiation and net radiation. The high accuracy and great conservation facilitate understanding of the coordinated variation of the SRB components, and these new SRB products would benefit a variety of fields, such as climate, ecology, and hydrology.

This population-based retrospective cohort study aimed to assess the long-term impact of PM2.5 exposure on CVD risk using data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database on a total of 1,708,942 individuals aged 65 years and older without a history of CVD. The subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) for the association between PM2.5 exposure and CVD risk were estimated using the Fine–Gray model, treating overall death as a competing risk, with adjustment for demographic, clinical, lifestyle, co-pollutants, and meteorological variables. A significant association was observed between higher concentrations of PM2.5 and an increased risk of CVD (P for trend <0.001). Individuals residing in areas with the highest concentrations of PM2.5 (Q4) had a higher risk of CVD (sHR, 1.06; 95 % CI, 1.05–1.08) compared to those living in areas with the lowest concentrations (Q1). These findings suggest that high concentrations of PM2.5 exposure may contribute to an increased risk of CVD in older adults. Stronger regulations and proactive efforts to reduce air pollution exposure may be promising against the risk of CVD in the older population."

 In this study, a Rapid Multi-Temporal Pollution Assessment System (RMT-PAS) has been developed based on a trend-decomposition explainable machine learning (ML) method, which was used to isolate and quantify the contributions of meteorology (MET) and anthropogenic emissions (EMIS) to the ambient PM2.5/O3 levels at different scales such as inter-annual, seasonal and typical pollution events. The RMT-PAS employed a stacking ensemble technique integrating the XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost models to establish the nonlinear response relationship between PM2.5/O3 pollution levels and multiple meteorological elements as well as emission components, and achieved high predictive accuracy. Inter-annual analysis (2015–2020) showed that reductions in EMIS accounted for 53.1 %–158.9 % of the observed decreases in annual-mean PM2.5, whereas for O3 the MET contribution increased substantially and displayed strong regional heterogeneity (−126.5 % to +48.6 %). Seasonal analyses indicated that MET contributions to PM2.5 exhibited the greatest fluctuation in winter, followed by autumn, spring, and summer (mean standard deviations: 5.13, 3.82, 2.95, and 2.00 μg/m3). In contrast, for O3, the highest fluctuation occurred in summer, followed by autumn, spring, and winter (5.72, 4.70, 3.48, and 2.11 μg/m3). The analysis of typical pollution events further revealed that PM2.5 pollution were mainly driven by boundary layer height (PBLH), relative humidity (RHU) and sea-level pressure (PRS_Sea), whereas O3 pollution were primarily controlled by temperature (TEM) and RHU. The developed RMT-PAS system can support government and environmental regulators in conducting long-term assessments and implementing timely, effective control measures during emergency events."

 Fog water deposition remains a poorly quantified yet important pathway for atmospheric inputs in forested mountain regions. We conducted multi-site observations at seven mountainous locations in Japan, collecting bulk deposition, throughfall, and fog water. Using an improved canopy water balance method, we estimated fog water precipitation on canopies and its associated acid deposition. Fog water precipitation in forests varied substantially across sites, with the highest value at Mt. Oyama (9.25 mm day−1) and the lowest at Mt. Iizuna (0.86 mm day−1). Sites along the Sea of Japan coast showed higher proportions of non-sea salt sulfate (nss-SO₄2−), largely due to continental air masses, whereas Pacific-side sites were more influenced by nitrate from domestic vehicle emissions. Backward trajectory analysis and meteorological observations revealed that fog water deposition is significantly influenced by fog occurrence frequency, wind speed, and characteristics of the canopies and their locations in mountains. These factors together shape the spatial variability of fog water and acid inputs. Our findings highlight the substantial role of fog in the deposition of acidic substances to forest canopies, particularly in high-altitude regions with frequent fog events. This study underscores the need to incorporate fog water deposition into forest ecosystem assessments and long-term monitoring programs, especially in regions where traditional rain-based models may underestimate total atmospheric inputs."

 Summer precipitation over the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River (MLYR) exhibits pronounced quasi-biweekly oscillation (QBWO), yet its dynamical mechanisms remain incompletely understood, limiting the subseasonal rainfall predictability. Based on observed precipitation and ERA5 reanalysis data from 1983 to 2022, this study analyzes the circulation patterns and dynamical mechanisms associated with the wet and dry phases of summer precipitation QBWO over the MLYR. The results reveal a tight coupling between the quasi-biweekly precipitation and low-level (850 hPa) vorticity anomalies. The wet phase features a low-level (850 hPa) quasi-biweekly cyclonic anomaly enhancing convergence, coupled with an upper-level (200 hPa) anticyclonic anomaly promoting divergence, creating favorable dynamic conditions. The dry phase shows opposite anomalies suppressing convection. Vorticity budget analysis clearly demonstrates that quasi-biweekly low-level vorticity development is primarily maintained through the dynamical process of vortex tube stretching, driven both by quasi-biweekly divergence acting on both planetary and background vorticity and by background wind convergence acting on quasi-biweekly vorticity. Multiscale vorticity budget also reveals that synoptic-scale vorticity and synoptic-scale divergence always generate positive vorticity, with particularly enhanced generation during the wet phase that reinforces the QBWO through positive contribution. In contrast, relative vorticity advection generally inhibits vorticity maintenance through the stronger negative contribution of synoptic-scale vorticity advection in the wet phase and the north-south asymmetric advection effect dominated by the monsoon southerly wind. This study clarifies how the monsoon background circulation and synoptic-scale nonlinear processes collectively modulate the QBWO of summer precipitation in the MLYR, advancing understanding of multiscale interactions in monsoon intraseasonal variability."

Venkat Ratnam,Decadal changes in the Tropical Tropopause Inversion Layer and its radiative drivers over Gadanki (2006–2024),"•A warming climate in the future, results in a weaker and narrower TIL. •A strong temperature inversion in the UTLS could result in a stronger TIL in summer. •The formation of TIL can be influenced by other dynamical processes. 
 The upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS), due to their minimum temperature, play an important role in radiation escaping to space and, thus, climate feedback. The tropopause, separating the well-mixed troposphere and the stably stratified stratosphere, is a good indicator of climate change, as it is sensitive to the concentration of radiatively active species. A highly stable layer above the tropopause, the Tropopause Inversion Layer (TIL), was confirmed to exist across all latitudes and seasons. Studying the TIL is essential for understanding the composition of the UTLS. The trends in key TIL parameters, the width and strength, and the radiative effects of water vapor and ozone on TIL formation over the tropical station, Gadanki (13.5oN, 79.2°E), India, based on radiosonde data spanning from 2006 to 2024, are investigated. The tropopause height shows a positive trend of 0.08 ± 0.06 km/decade, suggesting a future climate warming with a weaker and narrower TIL, as indicated by the negative trend in TIL width (−0.2 ± 0.07 km/decade) and TIL strength (−1.35*10−5 ± 1.63*10−5 km/decade). A heating rate analysis in the UTLS region due to ozone and water vapor reveals that, the stronger and narrower TIL in summer is a result of radiative heating due to ozone in LS and cooling due to water vapor in UT, leading to an enhanced temperature inversion, and modulating the UTLS, potentially impacting climate change via tropopause. Present study provides the first time observational evidence of radiative forcing on TIL formation and maintenance over a tropical station for summer."

 The weather radar network in China exhibits an uneven spatial distribution, with dense coverage in the eastern regions and sparse deployment in the west, resulting in substantial detection blind spots in areas with complex terrain. This severely limits the continuity and precision of weather monitoring and early warning in these regions. To address this challenge, a multi-channel deep learning model, MCDA-UNet, is proposed for radar composite reflectivity retrieval, aiming to reconstruct and enhance radar echo patterns in regions lacking radar coverage by leveraging the extensive spatial coverage and continuous observation capabilities of geostationary meteorological satellites. The model employs a multi-channel input architecture to extract features from different spectral bands, while spatial and channel attention models are incorporated to improve the representation of key meteorological information, thereby enhancing retrieval accuracy and regional adaptability. Comparative experiments conducted under varying precipitation intensities demonstrate that MCDA-UNet consistently outperforms existing models across multiple evaluation metrics, particularly in reconstructing weather radar echo structures and edge details. These results validate the model’s capability to adapt to the full dynamic range of weather radar reflectivity and highlight its potential for accurate precipitation retrieval in radar blind-spot regions."
