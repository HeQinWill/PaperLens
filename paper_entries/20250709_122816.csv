10.1088/1748-9326/ade26a,False,Environmental Research Letters,该论文主要探讨了乌干达资源开采中的性别问题，以及这对公正转型的影响。它分析了采矿、甘蔗种植和石油开采等活动对当地社区不同性别的成员造成的不同影响，如性暴力、基本生活必需品获取受阻和土地剥夺。论文旨在强调在乌干达及类似社会经济状况的国家中，实现公正转型时需要认真对待这些性别问题，以避免重蹈覆辙。该论文与大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等，没有直接关系。,[],Tobias Müller,Gendered extractivism in Uganda: implications for Just Transitions,"Critical analyses of extractivism have demonstrated that it frequently involves interconnected gendered impacts on local communities. While gender equality has become an important concern in the literature on sustainability and economic development, more intersectional and decolonial feminist critiques of extractivism are only slowly entering mainstream debates even though they offer important perspectives for thinking about the socio-political challenges Just Transitions are likely to face, especially in African countries with weak governance systems. This paper contributes to the understanding of the potential gendered impact of putative just transition programmes in Africa through the analyses of different gendered impacts in three zones of resource extraction in Uganda, namely mining in Karamoja, a sugar cane plantation in Mabira Forest and oil extraction via the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP). Employing an intersectional and decolonial feminist lens, the paper identifies three gendered dimensions of extractivist impacts, namely sexual violence, barred access to basic necessities and dispossession of land. It is vital to take these challenges seriously in order to avoid reproducing such gendered impact in attempts to achieve a Just Transition in Uganda and countries with similar socio-economic profiles."
10.1088/1748-9326/ade608,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注二氧化碳减排对全球干旱模式的影响，探讨了气候系统对二氧化碳变化的滞后性和不可逆性。研究使用地球系统模型模拟了二氧化碳浓度变化，并分析了干旱的滞后性和不可逆性，以及相关的驱动因素。研究发现，仅靠减少二氧化碳排放不足以有效缓解干旱影响，还需要先进的水资源管理策略。该研究与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）关联性不大，主要侧重于气候变化和水文气象领域。,"['Drought', 'CO2 mitigation', 'Climate modeling', 'Precipitation', 'Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD)', 'Water Management']",Sanjit Kumar Mondal;Soon-Il An;Seung-Ki Min;Tong Jiang;Buda Su;Seungmok Paik;Soong-Ki Kim,Hysteresis and irreversibility of global drought patterns in response to CO2 mitigation efforts,"Drought is expected to intensify with rising CO2, but its behavior under CO2 mitigation, remains uncertain. The response of the climate system to CO2 variation exhibits hysteresis and irreversibility, highlighting the difficulty of recovery and the potential for long-lasting impacts. We investigated the hysteresis and reversibility of global drought and the associated underlying drivers. The Community Earth System Model 2 was used to simulate CO2 changes: linear increases, decreases (i.e. net negative), and restoration to the initial level. This paper incorporates three well-established indices based on atmospheric, meteorological and soil moisture data to reflect drought. Here, we show that drought is dominant during the CO2 decrease phase, leading to strong hysteresis with irreversible behavior over more than half of the global land cover. The robust irreversible changes in drought are concentrated in specific areas, i.e. hotspots, covering over 11% of the global land and are particularly pronounced in Northern Africa, Southwest Russia, and Central America. A decrease in precipitation drives drought during the CO2 increase phase, while an enhanced vapor pressure deficit (VPD) exacerbates it during the CO2 decrease phase. This increased VPD exacerbates drought hysteresis by raising potential evapotranspiration. Our findings suggest that only CO2 reduction is not enough to effectively mitigate drought impacts, rather advanced water management strategies are essential."
10.1088/1748-9326/ade698,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注的是地下水可持续性研究中经济学的重要作用。它探讨了水文学家和经济学家如何合作，以促进更好的地下水政策制定。论文强调了经济学在理解人们的偏好、激励机制以及对法律和其他制度的反应方面的作用，这些因素影响着人们的行为，并最终影响地下水资源的管理和利用。论文还讨论了如何将经济学与水文学相结合，以更好地理解地下水资源的可持续利用，以及如何通过跨学科研究，将自然科学与经济学结合起来，从而促进更好的地下水政策。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析，没有直接关系。,[],William K Jaeger;Ellen M Bruno;Karen Fisher-Vanden;Thomas Harter,The essential but often misunderstood role of economics in groundwater sustainability research,"To promote better groundwater policymaking, hydrologists and economists need to work together. The importance of hydrology is self-evident, but we posit that questions about the causes of and potential solutions for groundwater problems, and pathways to better policymaking, are fundamentally economics questions in that they rely on understanding people’s preferences, incentives, and responses to laws and other institutions that guide people’s actions. Not surprisingly then, most hydrologic research questions implicitly arise in response to economic demands and constraints. Hydrology and economics both rely on positive science involving theory, empirical methods, calibration, and validation. Indeed, their models can be linked to characterize and understand their interdependent dynamics. While other natural and social sciences also have important roles to play, this paper focuses primarily on how economics connects (ground)water to policymaking. Economics is a broad discipline with a primary role in understanding how people live in a landscape. Analogous to hydrology’s primary role in describing how water flows, recedes, seeps, evaporates, or recharges aquifers, economics describes people’s endeavors including their use of water, land, and other resources to produce, consume, trade, invest, conserve, and degrade the systems where they live. Policymaking is normative: it involves value judgments when assessing tradeoffs, setting priorities, or choosing among policy options. Economics is unique among disciplines in that it also comprises ‘normative analysis’ frameworks for measuring people’s values as a guide toward satisfying those preferences to the greatest extent possible (e.g. using benefit-cost analysis). But when natural science research is conducted without recognizing the economic considerations relevant to policymakers and managers, it may overlook critical ways that human system structures, dynamics, and people’s values inform the most promising ways to turn science into policy. By collaborating with economists, interdisciplinary research can bring natural sciences together with positive and normative economics to promote better groundwater policy."

Here, we addressed this evidence gap in India and assessed the association between residential greenspace and the prevalence of low birth weight (LBW) (birth weight ⩽2500 g) among Indian mothers. We analyzed health and demographic data from India’s National Family and Health Survey conducted between 2015–16 and 2019–21. Greenspace exposure was quantified using high-resolution moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer-derived enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data with a 30–days temporal resolution. Multivariable binomial logistic regression models were employed, adjusting for maternal demographics, lifestyle behaviors, socioeconomic status, household characteristics, and exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Among 38 358 participants, 13 677 (35.6%) had LBW. We found a protective association between EVI and the odds of LBW, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.95–1.03) after controlling for covariates. When stratified by PM2.5 exposure levels, the protective effect of EVI was strongest in areas with low PM2.5 concentrations (OR = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.85–1.00), corresponding to an 8% reduction in the odds of LBW. In areas with medium-high exposure, the effect was attenuated (OR = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.90–1.06), while in high exposure areas, the association reversed, with EVI linked to a 23% increase in LBW odds (OR = 1.23; 95% CI: 1.13–1.34). The protective effect was found in urban areas rather than in rural areas and in economically affluent households. Our results suggest that increasing access to greenspace can serve as an adaptive measure to reduce the prevalence of LBW. Further cohort studies are recommended to ascertain the underlying mechanisms."

However, considerable uncertainty remains regarding the estimates of these future carbon losses. Here, we analysed Earth system model (ESM) simulations to assess future changes in tropical vegetation biomass potential due to shifts in the hydrological cycle. We found that tropical ecosystems could experience substantial decreases in vegetation biomass potential, particularly under high-emission scenarios, due to decreasing precipitation, increasing evaporation demand, and higher rainfall seasonality. These declines are principally driven by the transition of Amazon rainforests towards drier ecosystems. However, the difference in tropical vegetation biomass potential between most extreme ESMs reached 73 Pg C at the end of this century for the shared socio-economic pathway (SSP) 2–4.5 and 147 Pg C for SSP5-8.5. Weighting models based on their ability to reproduce the current hydroclimate in the tropics resulted in a reduction of vegetation biomass potential by 2100 in SSP2-4.5 of 12 Pg C (8–16 Pg C) compared with a simple average of all ESMs which gave 20 Pg C (17–24 Pg C). Our findings underscore the urgent need to reduce not only direct anthropogenic disturbances but also the rate of global greenhouse gas emissions to preserve the vegetation biomass potential of tropical ecosystems."
10.1088/1748-9326/ade86f,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注蛋白质转型，探讨其作为一种可持续食物系统路径的潜力，以及不同利益相关者之间存在的叙事冲突。论文旨在综合来自多个学科的科学证据，批判性地反思当前学术界蛋白质转型研究的碎片化现状及其影响。论文通过背景、语境和影响三个部分，提出了68个相关陈述，并分析了这些陈述背后的科学证据，揭示了证据的复杂性、术语使用的不一致性以及由此产生的不确定性。论文强调，蛋白质转型不能简单地归结为饮食结构的转变，而应该采取更全面的方法，并在适当的背景下批判性地考虑现有证据的方法。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,[],O Duluins;R Cardinaals;H Potter Karlsson;S Nájera Espinosa;K Resare Sahlin;J J L Candel;S Hornborg;A Matthews;P V Baret,A restatement of the protein transition,"A protein transition is promoted as a pathway toward a sustainable food system, but its application and progress are potentially hindered by diverse, often conflicting narratives among various stakeholders. These narratives are constituted and underpinned by statements and nurture a growing polarisation by isolation of their underlying scientific evidence. The multidimensional and interdisciplinary nature of a protein transition does not go well with an isolated approach in academia. The latter leads to fragmented and incomplete scientific evidence that fails to fully grasp the complexity of the issue, while being used to form partial statements that feed societal and political debates. Through a Restatement approach, this paper aims to (i) synthesise scientific evidence from multiple academic disciplines related to a protein transition and (ii) critically reflect on the implications of the current fragmented scientific evidence landscape of a protein transition in academia and beyond. The Restatement is structured into three sections: Background, Context, and Impacts, with subsections that each cover 4–17 statements, with a total of 68 statements. We connected each statement to its supporting scientific evidence which revealed the complexity of how evidence is related and interpreted, in addition to the inconsistent use of terminology and resulting ambiguities. The main takeaway from the Restatement is that a protein transition cannot be reduced to a single message of a dietary shift but that it should be approached more holistically, while using the available evidence within the appropriate context and critical consideration of the methodologies used to obtain that evidence. This Restatement can be used by researchers and decision-makers working toward more sustainable food systems in the European Union and beyond, to understand the contexts and methods that are not within their own field of expertise. In addition, we stress that overcoming polarisation in a protein transition largely relies on critical reflections of the assumptions, interests and power dynamics shaping the protein transition debate."
10.1088/1748-9326/ade893,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注消费者对气候政策的态度，特别是当政策影响到他们日常消费品时（例如，对高排放的红肉和奶制品征税）。研究通过调查实验，比较了人们对能源税政策和消费品税政策的看法。结果表明，人们对脱碳政策的支持程度受到其消费偏好的影响。经常消费相关产品的人，当气候政策影响到特定消费品时，会变得不太支持；而不经常消费的人则会变得更支持。这表明消费者对消费品的主观和身份认同感在政策态度中起作用，气候政策可能偏袒某些消费者的利益，从而使消费者群体成为气候政治中一个相关的分配分歧。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,[],Nathan Mariano,Climate policy attitudes in consumers,"Fully decarbonized markets for consumer goods would result in drastic lifestyle changes for many individuals. However, most research on climate policy attitudes focuses on energy policy, rather than policies that affect consumer goods that people use and enjoy. I conduct a survey experiment that compares views on an energy tax policy to views on a policy that taxes a high-emissions consumer good (red meat & dairy products). The results show that the effect of targeting consumer goods on support for decarbonization depends on an individual’s consumption preferences. Frequent consumers become less supportive of climate policy when it affects a particular consumer good, whereas non-consumers become more supportive. We observe the first outcome even though the cost of the two policies to consumers is equivalent, highlighting the role of subjective and identity attachments to consumer goods in policy attitudes. This shows how climate policy can favor the interests of certain consumers over others, making groups of consumers another relevant distributive cleavage in climate politics."

Here, we address this issue using both high-resolution reanalysis data and large ensemble simulations. We find a significant increase in TCGF over the Pacific within two years following TVEs, while a statistically insignificant decrease over the South Indian Ocean, leading to an overall increase in global TCGF driven mainly by Pacific basin responses. Strong TVEs suppress precipitation over the Maritime Continent and lower global mean sea surface temperature (SST), while inducing warming in the equatorial central Pacific, resulting in an El Niño-like SST pattern. These anomalies weaken the Walker Circulation and drive low-level westerly wind and upper-level easterly wind anomalies over the tropical Pacific, creating favorable conditions for enhanced Pacific TCGF. These results offer new insights into how TVEs influence TC activity on both global and regional scales."

Here, we used two models (LANDIS-II and DHSVM) in linked simulations to evaluate the effects of wildfire and forest management scenarios on future snowpack and streamflow dynamics. We characterized the biophysical attributes of the areas with the greatest potential for treatments to improve hydrologic functioning and we examined projected trends in flow regimes over the 21st century. We found that, despite a projected increase in total annual flows, there was a steep decline in snowpack and late-season flows. Wildfire was an important factor influencing streamflow and snowpack dynamics, with increasing burned area partially offsetting climate-driven declines in snowpack and spring flows. Forest thinning treatments contributed modest increases to annual flows, although effects were overshadowed by the influences of climate and wildfire. Warming winter temperatures extinguished snowmelt-driven flows in low- and mid-elevation watersheds, causing a transition from spring snowmelt- to autumn rain-dominated streamflow regimes. Our results complement prior empirical studies showing that forest treatments can improve snowpack retention and annual streamflow, and they emphasize the importance of wildfire as a primary factor governing landscape hydrology. We found that neither land management practices nor wildfire could completely compensate for the top–down controls of future climate on landscape hydrology. Declines in snowpack retention and a regime shift in the timing of peak flows will have dramatic consequences for forest health, human water resources, and Pacific salmon populations."

Although its seasonal impacts are well established, its subseasonal variability and long-term changes remain less understood. This study identifies significant changes in the influence of WP on surface temperature over South Korea since the mid-1990s using observational and reanalysis datasets. Our analysis reveals a significant shift in the WP teleconnection, with its influence strengthening in December but weakening in January and February. This change is attributed to an anomalous displacement of the WP-associated anticyclone and modulated by interactions with the Arctic Oscillation. Furthermore, seasonal forecast models from the Asia–Pacific Economic Cooperation Climate Center multi-model ensemble capture the WP-induced temperature variations in December; however, strong modulation by El Niño–Southern Oscillation inhibits the independent effect of the WP teleconnection. These findings highlight the critical gaps in seasonal forecast models and emphasize the need for improved representations of WP teleconnections in subseasonal forecasts. A refined understanding of winter temperature variability is essential for enhancing climate predictions, supporting climate adaptation strategies, and mitigating societal risks associated with increasing winter temperature variability in South Korea."

Restoration and rewetting can help prevent these emissions, while continuous monitoring is critical for evaluating their success. Using satellite-derived observations of essential climate variables, we conducted the first large-scale assessment of how peatland restoration influences land surface temperature (LST), albedo, and vegetation across 72 sites in North America and Europe. Our findings indicated that before restoration, degraded peatlands had a commonly lower daytime LST and albedo but higher nighttime LST, leaf area index (LAI), and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) compared to intact sites. The largest restoration-induced absolute values of monthly changes reached +3.18 °C (daytime LST), −1.22 °C (nighttime LST), −2.54 (LAI), −0.29 (FPAR), and −0.16 (albedo). While restored peatlands tended to align more closely with intact sites a decade after restoration began, the probability of this alignment varied depending on the climate variables. Restored peatlands became more similar than different to intact sites in nighttime LST and albedo after a post-restoration decade, with high similarity projected within five decades. Peatland restoration modifies local and regional climate and should be included in future climate projections."

In the past few years, recent improvements in satellite data availability and cloud computing have led to rapid growth in satellite-derived global observation of reservoir storage fluctuations, yet little research has directly compared the growing number of published storage datasets. Here we perform a first global intercomparison between five global satellite-derived reservoir storage datasets, namely GLWS, GRS, GloLakes, GRDL-Y and GRDL-L. Overall, we find generally good agreement in relative storage time series (median RMSE between datasets = 8.7% of capacity), with little substantial difference in agreement between datasets. Agreement in absolute storage is much worse (median = 19.4%), and for absolute storage, GloLakes has higher error than the other datasets. We find that agreement is worse in highly variable reservoirs, new reservoirs, and, notably, in developing countries. All datasets agree that, globally, construction of new reservoirs is driving a net increase in reservoir storage over 1999–2018, yet there is disagreement in the magnitude of these trends. Overall, our results lend confidence to the utility of satellite-derived global reservoir storage datasets for water management applications. We suggest that future research should involve reducing errors in water area observations, increasing consistency in which reservoirs are observed, and improving storage algorithm performance especially in developing areas."

However, projecting ocean dynamic processes affecting sea-level change faces two main challenges: (1) the ocean’s thermal inertia and dynamics can lead to substantial nonlinearities both on a global (thermal expansion) and regional scale (dynamic sea level); and (2) simulating ocean dynamic sea-level change over multiple centuries with global climate models is computationally intensive. To address these challenges, we use an energy balance model (EBM) to emulate the thermal responses of models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) and evaluate its optimal layer configuration for reproducing both thermal expansion and dynamic sea-level change. We compare results between a two and a three-layer EBM configuration, as fitting more than three layers can lead to EBM parameter overfitting. We find that both configurations perform similarly when emulating thermal expansion, with performance being highly dependent on accurate EBM forcing. To emulate dynamic sea level, we couple the EBM to a multivariate pattern scaling approach that relates the response of layer temperatures to regional changes in dynamic sea level. The latter demonstrates clear advantages of a three-layer configuration under high-emission scenarios, leading to an 18% reduction in emulator error at 2300 while capturing nonlinearities more effectively. Coupling the regional emulator with a simple climate model to propagate climate uncertainties further highlights the advantage of using a three-layer approach, leading to more stable parameter fitting and reducing uncertainty in probabilistic projection by up to one global mean standard deviation. Our findings suggest that multi-layer EBMs can more accurately mimic long-term (up to 2300) CMIP6 projections of sterodynamic sea-level changes while limiting computational burden and reducing uncertainty in emulators due to statistical fitting."

However, diverse, spatially distributed sources make characterizing urban CH4 emissions challenging. A limited synthesis of existing research has hindered understanding of source characteristics and contributions, implicating research priorities, policies, and mitigation. This review consolidates findings from 106 peer-reviewed articles on CH4 emissions in U.S. and Canadian cities, identifying key insights, gaps, and opportunities. We found that top-down (TD) estimates of city-scale CH4 emissions from 34 studies exceeded, on average, bottom-up (BU) estimates by a factor of 3.9 (±6.7). Urban CH4 footprints were dominated by sources from natural gas distribution and end-use and landfills. Across 11 U.S. studies, the estimated mean CH4 loss rate from delivered natural gas corrected for CH4 content in cities was 2.3% (±0.9%). TD estimates of CH4 emissions from six U.S. landfills were, on average, 2.4 (±1.7) times greater than self-reported BU estimates. Preferred methods for reporting may miss large fugitive point sources, systematically underestimating landfill CH4 emissions. The studies indicated that wastewater systems emit less CH4 than landfills and natural gas sources, but the research remains limited, and many wastewater sources are poorly characterized. Mitigation effectiveness varied by source, with scalability a challenge for small, distributed sources such as sewers, and the confirmation of reductions sensitive to measurement scale. Overall, results highlight challenges in quantifying, attributing, and mitigating CH4 emissions in urban settings. Key research priorities are: (i) expanding CH4 measurements from urban natural gas (distribution and end-use) and wastewater sources, and granular investigations to pinpoint and understand the causes of emissions; (ii) new emissions data to improve BU models and integrate into BU estimates; (iii) improving measurement-model coupling for landfill CH4 quantification; and (iv) evaluating mitigation strategies for urban CH4 sources."

Using satellite data from 2004 to 2023, we find that ship emissions increase the number of cloud droplets while reducing their size and slightly decrease cloud water content. Effects on seasonal and daily patterns vary based on regional factors. The impact of emissions weakened after stricter regulations were implemented in 2020. 
 This study investigates the impact of ship emissions on clouds over a shipping corridor in the southeastern Atlantic, employing geostationary-based observations, which have not been previously used in studies of this kind. Based on CLAAS-3, the 20-year (2004–2023) CLoud property dAtA set using SEVIRI (the geostationary Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager), the diurnal, seasonal and long-term corridor effects on clouds are examined. Results show a significant impact of ship emissions on cloud microphysics, consistent with the Twomey effect: an increase in cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) and a decrease in effective radius (re). Additionally, cloud liquid water path (W) decreases, though changes in cloud fraction are more subtle. No clear impact on cloud optical thickness is found, implying an overall minor radiative effect of the ship emissions, although methodological limitations to detect changes in the corridor cannot be excluded.

Similar coarse particle increases are observed across cities of the North China Plain. Long-term particle acidity evolution in this region requires an integrated assessment of interactions among acidic precursors, ammonia, and crustal components. 
 Particle acidity serves as a key determinant in atmospheric chemical processes. Emerging concerns regarding aerosol acidity trends have been highlighted amid China's sustained initiatives to mitigate emissions of both acidic and alkaline precursors, especially in North China, which is significantly affected by dust aerosol. 12-year observational data in Zhengzhou reveal that the annual average PM2.5 concentration decreased from 162±81µgm-3 in 2011 to 60±41µgm-3 in 2022, with the largest reduction in sulfate (73 %). Correspondingly, the annual particle pH increased by 0.10 units from 2011–2019. In addition, the elevated particle pH in 2015 and 2018 was notably influenced by the increase in TNHx (NH3+NH4+). Note that the crustal material concentrations and their proportions increased significantly during 2019–2022, which might be responsible for the resuspension of surrounding soil dust. Even though the TNHx concentration was decreasing, the annual average growth rate of pH values increased to 0.21 units from 2019–2022. This phenomenon is not unique to Zhengzhou, as major cities in the North China Plain have also experienced a pronounced upward trend in coarse particles after 2019. Therefore, the long-term evolution of particle acidity in North China will require comprehensive consideration of synergistic effects involving acidic precursors, ammonia, and crustal materials."

 Air pollution adversely affects health, ecosystems, and infrastructure. In the Western Balkans (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo1, Montenegro, the Republic of North Macedonia, and Serbia), the air pollution situation is more adverse than in the European Union in general. Understanding the air quality situation requires high-quality emission data with a high-resolution spatial distribution, especially for enabling remediation efforts, which is lacking in the Western Balkan region.In this work, we have calculated air pollution emissions from the heating of individual housing units in the Western Balkan region. The basis for the dataset is a geographical dataset of buildings detected from satellite imagery by artificial intelligence (AI) methods. The building data have been combined with geospatial land-use datasets and statistical data for heating needs for residential buildings in the countries included and finally with emission factors to calculate the heating emissions.Using this novel approach, the resulting datasets provide high-resolution heating emission data for common pollutants and are published as open data (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13906810, Asker, 2024).

 Accurately simulating historical surface temperature variations is essential for evaluating climate models, yet many struggle to reproduce the mid-20th-century temperature trends associated with significant volcanic eruptions. This study examines the impact of volcanic sulfate aerosol representation on these biases using the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM). The standard CMIP6 protocol prescribes volcanic forcing through radiative perturbations, omitting volcanic aerosol–cloud interactions (VACIs). Here, we implement an emission-based approach with an updated volcanic eruption inventory that directly incorporates volcanic sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, enabling a more process-based representation of volcanic forcing. This approach leads to improved surface temperature variability and a modest reduction in cold biases between 1940 and 1980 compared to the CMIP6 setup. Additionally, we assess cloud property responses to a more realistic volcanic sulfate aerosol representation, which weakens cloud-induced cooling during periods of lower volcanic activity. However, despite these refinements, a significant temperature cold bias remains, indicating that further improvements in atmospheric chemistry, aerosol microphysics, cloud processes, and model parameterizations are needed to fully resolve this issue in E3SM."

 Phytoplankton is a diverse group of photosynthetic organisms and accounts for almost half of global primary production.

Here we present an individual-based phytoplankton model that captures three dimensions of phytoplankton traits (size, temperature, and light affinities) and allows phytoplankton cells to mutate in a one-dimensional (1D) water column. Other ecosystem components include dissolved inorganic nitrogen, 20 zooplankton size classes, and detritus, all modeled as Eulerian fields. This hybrid plankton model can not only reproduce the general seasonal patterns of nutrients, chlorophyll, and primary production in the subtropical ocean, but also simulate variations in phytoplankton traits and functional diversity.

We found that this topology with the Intel MPI (message-passing interface) library is more efficient. Additionally, using this topology can greatly improve the performance of the wave model and could help improve the performance of other Earth models. 
 High-resolution models are essential for simulating small-scale processes and topographical features, which play a crucial role in understanding meteorological and oceanic events, as well as climatic patterns. High-resolution modeling requires substantial improvement to the parallel scalability of the model to reduce runtime, while massive parallelism is associated with intensive communications. Point-to-point communication is extensively utilized for neighborhood communication in Earth models due to its flexibility. The distributed graph topology, first introduced in the message-passing interface (MPI) version 2.2, provides a scalable and informative communication method. It has demonstrated significant speedups over the point-to-point communication method based on a variety of synthetic and real-world communication graph datasets. But its application to Earth models for neighborhood communication is rarely studied. In this study, we implemented neighborhood communication using both the traditional point-to-point communication method and the distributed graph communication topology. We then compare their performance in a case study using the finite-volume wave modeling (FVWAM), including both small-scale regional and large-scale global experiments. Based on the Intel MPI library, the distributed graph topology outperforms the point-to-point communication method for inter-node communication with 32 to 32 768 processes.

To empirically test whether exposure to imidacloprid (1, 10 μg/L) and two different climate change scenarios (i) elevated temperatures (+4 °C vs. ambient temperatures) and (ii) reoccurring heatwaves (+0 to 8 °C) may cause a decline in insect emergence, we conducted an outdoor mesocosm study. Aquatic insect communities were exposed to single and combined stressors, while emergence was monitored during a 3-month period. We report significant losses in insect biomass and abundance under single and combined treatments. The high imidacloprid treatment and elevated temperatures combined caused a significant 47% decline in total insect biomass across the insect orders Diptera, Ephemeroptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, Odonata, and Trichoptera. Community structure and population dynamics were significantly affected, with Diptera and Ephemeroptera being most sensitive to the high and both imidacloprid treatments, respectively.

We hypothesized that neonicotinoids reduce body mass principally by acting as an appetite suppressant rather than increasing energy consumption. Red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) were exposed to an oral dose of one of three neonicotinoids at concentrations that could realistically be consumed by seed-eating birds (0, 10, 20, or 30 mg/kg bw of imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, or clothianidin) or were given a moderate or high food-restricted diet (n = 9 or 10 birds per treatment) and were then monitored for 3 days. Imidacloprid caused neurotoxic symptoms and rapid reductions in food consumption and body mass that persisted for >48 h. Food restriction had similar effects on body mass and biochemical indicators of energetic state (plasma triglycerides, uric acid, and β-hydroxybutyrate), which suggests appetite suppression was the main driver of mass loss in imidacloprid-exposed birds. Single doses of clothianidin and thiamethoxam altered food consumption and biochemical markers, but effects were less severe than for imidacloprid, and neither compound caused overt neurotoxicity.

Monitoring campaigns using a continuous flow centrifuge (sampling of suspended matter in a particle size range of 1 mm–1 μm) revealed a strong dependence of PVC concentrations of up to 3.3 μg/L on the discharge.

Here, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations were performed to elucidate the surface reaction of CO2 using three basaltic minerals. To mimic natural conditions, the mineral surfaces were first hydrolyzed by water exposure. The simulation provides molecular-scale evidence that naturally occurring basaltic mineral surfaces are CO2-active. Three previously unrecognized pathways were revealed, distinct from the conventional dissolution–precipitation paradigm. These pathways involve CO2 directly reacting with hydrolyzed mineral surfaces, at nonbridging oxygens (NBOs) and metal-coordinated hydroxyl groups, forming stable carbonate (CO32–), bicarbonate (HCO3–), and hydrogen pyrocarbonate (HC2O5–) species. The surface reaction capacity exhibits a first-order dependence on the density of NBOs. The presence of interfacial water plays a dual role in modulating the CO2 chemisorption. We find that the surface reaction induces coordination distortion at metal sites, potentially lowering the dissolution energy barrier of carbonated metal ions and facilitating a self-sustaining cycle of surface reactivity renewal. These findings establish the existence of CO2 surface reactions as a critical yet overlooked driver of enhanced carbon mineralization in basaltic systems."

The compaction of pores reduces solvent permeability and significantly impacts separation performance. Despite the importance of membrane compaction, its fundamental mechanisms have not been well studied. In this study, we combine well-controlled experiments and theory to analyze the relationship between pressure and porosity profiles within membranes. Specifically, we stack six porous films in a customized dead-end cell and measure the solvent content of each film immediately after pressure-driven solvent permeation tests. We show that, when a viscous solvent permeates through the stacked membranes, membrane porosity continuously decreases from the feed side to the permeate side. Compaction results in ∼25% reduction in solvent content (or porosity) at the membrane permeate side under 10 bar applied pressure and up to ∼50% reduction under 40 bar. We further analyze the stress–strain behavior of solvent-swollen films under mechanical compression and compare it to the compacted porosity in the solvent permeation tests. Our analysis reveals that the compression pressure in the permeation tests corresponds to the reduction in hydrostatic pressure within the membrane. In addition, we investigate the compaction behavior when membranes with varying pore sizes are stacked. Our results show that solvent permeating from tight-to-loose films induces significantly greater compaction than flow in the loose-to-tight direction. The compaction in tight-to-loose membrane stacking causes a 27% greater loss in membrane solvent content compared to the reverse arrangement. Notably, this study demonstrates that porosity gradients resulting from compaction cannot be interpreted as concentration gradients that drive diffusive solvent transport. Overall, our findings can inform the design of membranes with improved resistance to compaction by guiding material selection, processing techniques, and structural optimization."

In both cases, high RH (>90%) promotes dimer formation in the particle phase, while they appear at the beginning of the experiment when (NH4)2SO4 seeds are present. The prompt increase in dimers in high RH seed containing experiments (60–65% dimers), which are absent at low RH (10%), suggests that intraparticle reactions are responsible for the dimer formation."

Due to the important role of the hippocampus for learning and memory, in this study, we systematically investigated the neural circuit, neuron structure, and function of the hippocampus after BPA exposure. First, by employing a virus tracing technique, we observed a decrease in the neural projection ratio of excitatory neural neurons from the “Entorhinal Cortex-Dentate Gyrus-CA3-CA1” and “Entorhinal Cortex-CA1” circuits. Furthermore, BPA exposure led to impairments of the branching complexity and electrophysiological properties of hippocampal neurons. Additionally, fiber photometry experiments revealed that BPA exposure reduces the level of real-time activity in hippocampal excitatory neurons (CA1, CA3, and DG) during the MWM task. To verify the role of hippocampal excitatory neurons in learning and memory impairment caused by BPA, the dorsal hippocampus CA1 neurons were chemogenetically activated, and the spatial memory deficits were rescued. Collectively, our results suggest that BPA exposure impairs the hippocampal neural circuits and neuronal real-time response, leading to the dysfunction of spatial memory in mice. This study expands our understanding of the neurotoxic mechanisms of BPA at the mesoscopic neural level and provides a potential strategy for rescuing BPA-induced learning and memory impairments."

Cinnabar (α-HgS) used in traditional Chinese medicine shows protective effects against inflammation, but low anti-inflammatory efficacies ascribed to poor solubility and bioavailability have hindered extensive applications of cinnabar. Nanoscale chirality provides chances to improve efficacies through enantiomer-dependent interactions between cells and chiral cinnabar nanoparticles (HgSNPs). Herein HgSNPs with intrinsically wavelike chirality were prepared through a one-pot seedless method, exhibiting efficacious alleviation of inflammation in vitro and in vivo by HgSNPs with laevorotatory chirality (l-HgSNPs) rather than those with dextrorotatory chirality (d-HgSNPs). The mitogen-activated protein kinase as a crucial pathway involved in inflammation and immunity was directly blocked by l-HgSNPs through inhibition of p38 phosphorylation, so the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were reduced significantly. This study showed an enantiomer-dependent immunological response to chiral HgSNPs, providing a novel protocol to efficaciously modulate health risks from infectious inflammation."

Although basinwide ACE is positively correlated with ENSO, it significantly decreases in La Niña but only slightly changes in El Niño. This is mainly due to a significant reduction (weak change) in basinwide TC genesis but also a southeastward (northwestward) shift in El Niño (La Niña). This leads to longer‐tracked (shorter‐tracked) storms in El Niño (La Niña). Furthermore, in El Niño years, ENSO‐related signals migrate farther eastward, leading to the regions suppressing TC genesis being much larger than those favoring TC genesis. By comparison, in La Niña years, ENSO‐related signals extend more westward, while the TC‐favoring regions are of a similar size to the TC‐suppressing regions.

We identify trenchward transient motions near the Miyako Islands, with cumulative displacements of ∼10 mm between 2009 and 2011, indicating shallow SSEs that released a geodetic moment equivalent to Mw 6.8. These SSEs likely occurred updip of a Mw 6.1 interplate earthquake, whose associated positive Coulomb stress changes may have encouraged slow slip.

We present and release a conjugate‐gradient inversion code that searches for the three‐dimensional distribution of the volumetric strain that predicts simultaneously any observed InSAR, leveling and GPS surface displacement. By applying our algorithm on to leveling and InSAR data of the Cerro Prieto Geothermal area in Mexico for the 2012–2015 period, we find that the volume loss matches the extent and depth of the known geothermal reservoir or recharging aquifer and corresponds to 13% of the reported geothermal fluid extraction volume.

Each pattern exhibits unique characteristics, allowing us to construct a statistical picture of precipitation based on CALET and MAXI data.

We use data from the HARMONIE‐Climate (HCLIM) model applied at 12 and 3 km resolutions and examine the extreme precipitation response by the middle and end of the century in the RCP8.5 emission scenario. Our results show that: (a) precipitation intensity is projected to increase across almost all regions, except for daily extremes from HCLIM models driven by EC‐EARTH global climate model (GCM) in the southern and south‐western regions. HCLIM simulations driven by GFDL‐CM3 GCM project a larger increase in extremes compared with those driven by EC‐EARTH, which is likely associated with the stronger warming and moistening seen in GFDL‐CM3 over northern Europe in this scenario. (b) Frequency of both hourly and daily extremes is projected to increase in the future. However, the seasonality of extremes does not exhibit a shift, except for hourly extremes in the western region shifting from autumn‐winter to spring‐summer, and southern region shifting from spring‐summer to autumn‐winter. (c) Convection‐permitting simulations (∼3 km grid spacing) show a larger increase in extreme precipitation at both daily and hourly timescales across most seasons except winter while also projecting a comparable increase in the frequency of extreme events to convection‐parameterized models (∼12 km) in most regions.

The thermodynamic equilibrium between the ammonia in the gas phase and the ammonium ion in the condensed phase complicates the understanding of its ambient concentrations. In this study, long‐term historical data of ammonia concentrations and particle composition at 10 sites from Canada's National Air Pollution Surveillance program was used to show that the simultaneous analysis of both measurements is crucial for properly understanding ammonia's atmospheric budget. Over the multiyear observation period, the ammonia concentration displayed a positive slope or no trend in all sites, while the NHx (sum of ammonia and ammonium) concentration remained almost constant in most sites, and the fraction of NHx in the gas phase increased; that is, the apparent trend in ammonia depends not only on source and sink processes but on the atmospheric conditions that control the gas‐particle equilibrium. Under these circumstances, generalizations about the trends may be incorrect if either the ammonia or ammonium is analyzed in isolation due to their different deposition rates. The comparison of measurements with the output from the GEOS‐Chem High Performance model shows that the seasonality of the ammonia emission inventories and, consequently, the ammonia budget in the model needs to be revised. This work underscores the need for more sites monitoring ammonia concentrations simultaneously with particle composition to understand the temporal and spatial variability and effects of ammonia."

 Tropical forest degradation results in severe biomass loss and biodiversity decline. However, fine-scale natural and logging-related forest disturbances remain difficult to trace, both from the ground as well as remotely. Comprehensive, landscape scale characterization of anthropogenic forest degradation requires accurate accounting of baseline canopy disturbance rates and patterns. This paper has evaluated the feasibility of radar data for detecting canopy gaps created by natural and anthropogenic mechanisms at large spatial scale by assessing the extent to which the Sentinel-1 C-band radar signal can be used to map fine-scale disturbances in both naturally disturbed and logged landscapes. Our physical-based method detects disturbances based on changes in backscatter resulting from radar shadow and/or layover. We apply various detection thresholds to explore the trade-off between detection and false detection and validate our method in study areas for which spatially exhaustive drone-based canopy gap maps are available for validation, namely Barro Colorado Island nature reserve (median gap area: 39 m2) and five logging concessions in the Congo Basin (median gap area: 237 m2). With a moderate threshold (2.5 dB backscatter reduction), we reach detection rates above 65 percent for disturbances above 200 m2 in both naturally disturbed and logged areas. Detection rates were primarily driven by gap area; gap depth had a smaller, yet significant, influence. These results significantly improve on operational forest disturbance products and previous studies on fine-scale disturbance detection using Sentinel-1 radar. Moreover, the improved insight in detection accuracies of anthropogenic disturbances fosters a move towards monitoring forest dynamics across large scales at which we cannot be certain whether the disturbance driver is anthropogenic or natural."

 The effective scattering albedo (ω) is a key parameter in the zero-order radiative transfer equation (known as the τ-ω model) for passive microwave retrieval of soil moisture (SM) and vegetation optical depth (VOD), quantifying the scattering energy loss as microwave radiation passes through the vegetation canopy. The scattering effects of vegetation are influenced by time-dependent factors such as plant geometry, vegetation water content, and canopy structure, suggesting that ω may vary over time. However, in the current τ-ω model-based retrieval algorithms used by orbiting L-band sensors, namely the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), ω is generally assumed to be time-invariant and assigned a fixed value according to land cover types. In this study, we aim to analyze and understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of ω, its relationship with vegetation water stress and the driving factors behind microwave scattering characteristics over tropical forests. By assuming a vegetation transmittance of zero for rigorously selected dense forest areas in the tropics, we calculated ω from the SMAP L-band radiometer observations during 2018–2023. Regarding the spatial distribution of ω, we observed distinct spatial dynamics within the same land cover type. The lowest ω values were typically found in the northeastern Amazon. Additionally, ω exhibited clear temporal dynamics, displaying a unimodal pattern in the Amazon and a bimodal pattern in the Congo. Clear polarization dependence of ω was observed, with values consistently higher at Horizontal (H-) polarization compared to Vertical (V-) polarization. Despite this, the seasonal patterns of ω are similar at both H- and V-polarizations. The seasonal variation of ω was found to be asynchronous with soil water availability indicated by root zone soil moisture (RZSM) across different regions. The shortest time lags (0–30 days) between ω and RZSM were observed in the densely vegetated northeastern Amazon, while the longest occurred in the northeastern Congo. A machine-learning based interpretation of the spatial variability of ω and time lag indicates that the values of ω are strongly and inversely related to canopy height, while the time lag is mainly associated with precipitation and soil water content. Our results deepen the understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics of ω and could contribute to the improvement of SM and VOD retrieval algorithms, thereby enhancing the utility of these variables as indicators for monitoring vegetation carbon dynamics and phenology in dense tropical forests."

 High-precision topographic LiDAR point clouds provide a concrete elevation basis for many environmental and ecological applications, but they suffer from distinctly uneven density with voids of varying sizes. Interpolation tools most commonly serve to resample the density and fill the voids under the designated scale of the application. However, the target spaces in which the topographic point clouds reside are essentially non-Euclidean surfaces; the true distances between sample points are curved geodesic distances, which differ significantly from the conventionally used Euclidean distances, so classical interpolation models should be investigated for potential systematic biases.First, we introduce geodesic distance to topographic point clouds as a dimensionality reduction constraint to project the point cloud. This ensures the positive definiteness of the autocorrelation matrix and the revision of conventional interpolation algorithms. Then, we carried out a benchmark interpolation with deterministic and geostatistical models on a relatively “regular” topographic point cloud. Product point cloud resampling was subsequently examined with the optimal method. In response to the computational challenge, we devise a feature-points embedded domain decomposition calculation and propose a cross-validation-based point-to-point distance for better evaluation of the interpolation accuracy.The experimental results with different scenarios show substantial improvement in interpolation accuracy with the introduction of geodesic distance, which is of universal significance in prompting the precise utilization of topographic models.The related data and code will be open-sourced in the community."

 The new Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) altimeter mission, launched on December 16, 2022, marked a significant leap in ocean topography measurement by transitioning from traditional nadir-looking altimetry to wide-swath interferometric radar altimetry. During its 3-month fast-sampling phase from March 29 to July 9, 2023, SWOT operated on a 1-day repeat orbit focused on calibration and validation. Currently, SWOT is operating in its science phase on a 21-day repeat orbit. This study uses the Version C Level 2 Ka-band Radar Interferometer data in the South China Sea, collected during the SWOT fast-sampling phase, to validate SWOT’s performance in recovering marine gravity fields. The 95 cycles of fast-sampling phase data are equivalent to about 5.5 years of data from the science phase, offering sufficient repeat data to evaluate the potential of SWOT for deriving long-term, stacked marine gravity fields. We outline optimal processing strategies for refining SWOT sea surface heights (SSHs) to derive marine gravity anomalies. These strategies include rejecting outliers, mitigating ocean variability by removing sea level anomaly, correcting tilts across the entire SWOT swath segment using a three-dimensional plane, and averaging geoid gradients to reduce random errors. This study introduces a new method, the least-squares adjustment (LSA), for estimating the north and east components of the geoid gradient from SWOT SSH data. The gravity anomalies derived from the gradient components determined using the LSA method show comparable accuracy to those using least-squares collocation (LSC), with values of 2.32 mgal versus 2.28 mgal, respectively. Moreover, the LSA method is more computationally efficient than LSC. SWOT demonstrates the capability to derive north and east gradient components and marine gravity fields at finer scales compared to conventional altimeters, particularly over rough seafloor areas where SWOT can observe high-wavenumber SSHs. SWOT reveals continental shelf margins more clearly than conventional altimeters. Marine gravity anomalies from 3 months of SWOT data have an accuracy of 2.28 mGal, which is 12% better than the accuracy achieved with 14 years of data from conventional nadir altimeters. The gravity recovery procedures developed using SWOT fast-sampling phase data can be extended to derive optimal local and global marine gravity fields during the mission’s science phase."

 Satellite hyperspectral imagery (SHSI) provides detailed biochemical and physical characteristics of forest canopies, making it crucial for mapping large-scale tree species. However, two main challenges limit its effectiveness: (1) the spatial resolution of SHSI restricts its applicability in subtropical regions, where tree species diversity is high, and (2) the complexity of spectral data and structural variability complicates seasonal feature extraction. Most existing methods are focused on drone data and struggle to effectively integrate the multiscale temporal, spatial, and spectral information inherent in satellite-based hyperspectral data. To address these challenges, we enhance ZY1-02E hyperspectral data via a superresolution technique that incorporates Sentinel-2 data. We then propose TS2GNet, a novel hyperspectral classification network that integrates temporal-, spatial-, and spectral-domain guidance. TS2GNet employs a dual-stream architecture that focus on dynamic interactions between spatial and spectral domains, while also incorporating temporal modeling and SHSI feature-domain guidance. We evaluate our method on eight dominant tree species in the Ta-pieh Mountains and compare its performance with six state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning-based hyperspectral classification methods. The results demonstrate that (1) the enhanced ZY1-02E data lead to 1.93 %-to-3.47 % seasonal overall accuracy (OA) improvements; (2) TS2GNet consistently outperforms the other methods, achieving OA improvements ranging from 6.02 % to 6.36 % across different seasons; and (3) by incorporating multiseasonal SHSI features, TS2GNet increases OA from 86.81 ± 0.46 % to 90.72 ± 0.60 %, surpassing the other models by 2.77 % to 6.29 %. Additionally, TS2GNet demonstrates strong generalizability when applied to Sentinel-2 data. These findings advance satellite-based hyperspectral remote sensing methodologies and offer new insights into tree species distribution mapping in complex forest ecosystems.The codes associated with this paper are publicly available at https://github.com/FRS-HFUT/TS2GNet."

 Co-occurrence can improve the perception and prediction of traffic entities by predicting another traffic entity in automated driving based on a known entity. Existing traffic entity co-occurrence relationship construction methods use a bottom-up approach that relies on labeled datasets. However, the limited nature of datasets constrains the capture of long-tail scenarios. High-definition (HD) maps define the concept of traffic elements and their classifications, and can be used for scene simulation and real-time updating of digital twins. Based on this, this paper proposes a knowledge graph construction method for traffic entity prediction, employing a top-down approach and introducing HD maps. This method establishes a co-occurring semantic network between entities, utilizing prior knowledge. The objective is to reconcile the finiteness of datasets with the infinity of long-tailed scenarios, thereby providing a theoretical basis for the safety calibration of autonomous driving. The experimental results show that the knowledge graph constructed by the top-down method has a complete ontology type in the schema and takes into account the co-occurrence relations of the long-tailed scenarios, which provides a basis for the standardization of the co-occurrence relationships of the long-tailed scenarios, and also provides semantic support for the dynamic simulation of the digital twins in traffic scenes."

 This study presents an innovative solution for detecting complex geological formations, particularly in areas where field surveys are difficult or impossible. Even when feasible, conventional surveys often fail to delineate subtle lithological transitions without extensive laboratory analysis, which alone cannot define spatial distribution. We interpreted the geology of an inaccessible limestone quarry using an integrated approach combining petrographic, chemical, and spectral analyses with close-range hyperspectral remote sensing. Petrographic and chemical analyses revealed that the outcrop was significantly altered by igneous intrusion, resulting in distinct mineralogical and lithological transitions within both igneous and carbonate bodies. Late-stage magmatic and hydrothermal activity produced four discrete igneous phases and widespread metasomatism. Hydrothermal alteration caused extensive dolomitization, transforming the original limestone units. These transitions are characterized by calcite and sericite formations in igneous rocks and quartz in carbonate rocks. Spectrally, dyke displayed Al-OH absorption indicative of plagioclase and sericite, while metasomatic interactions introduced secondary calcite with additional CO32– absorption. Dolomitization is further distinguished by Mg-OH absorption features. A 3D-CNNs model combined with spectral normalization effectively mapped these transition lithologies, clearly revealing the geological processes imprinted in the outcrop. Most dykes show intensive metasomatic, with only core portions retain pure igneous signatures. Limestones are concentrated near dyke contacts, suggesting marble formation via contact metamorphism, while dolostone dominated the outcrop due to regional dolomitization. The mapping results provide a preliminary resource assessment indicating that igneous intrusion has reduced the economic value by approximately 80% compared to pure limestone. This integrated approach accurately represents gradational lithological boundaries, addressing the limitations of conventional survey methods."

 We performed the estimation at two boreal forest areas in Finland, Valtimo and Pello, using two methods: post-classification and logistic regression estimation. In post-classification, dominant height and canopy cover were estimated first, and areas where dominant height was (≥ 5 m) and canopy cover (≥ 10%) were considered forested. In the second method, logistic regression was used to determine the areas with tree cover using ICESat-2 variables as predictors. The reference values were obtained using airborne laser scanning data and locally measured field plots. The transferability of the ICESat-2 models was also assessed.Our results indicated that ICESat-2 data are suitable for the estimation of tree cover extent over large areas. The overall accuracy ranged from 92% to 95% both for post-classification and logistic regression, depending on the study area. Although the performance of the two classification methods was similar, the classification accuracies were generally lower in Pello.

 Global coastal suspended sediment concentration (SSC) plays a crucial role in regulating erosion, accretion, and geomorphological evolution. Although traditional remote sensing offers broad spatiotemporal coverage, high-resolution SSC retrieval remains challenging due to the lack of in situ calibration data. We propose a transfer-based human–machine collaborative learning approach that embeds expert knowledge to significantly reduce reliance on field data. The approach follows the Human-in-the-Loop paradigm and begins by integrating limited in situ samples with expert-labeled SSC regions from Sentinel-MODIS (2017–2024) imagery to construct an initial training set, where SMOTE is applied to address class imbalance. Expert feedback is then used to identify and correct misclassified areas, and the resulting high-confidence samples are incrementally incorporated to reconstruct local training subsets. Finally, expert-informed feature adjustment and geometric priors are integrated through hierarchical transfer learning, enabling the model to iteratively adapt with small-sample updates. Applied to China’s eastern coastal waters, the proposed approach demonstrates high predictive accuracy, explaining 95.1% of the variance in limited field observations. It identifies a 1.50% overall decline in SSC since 2017, primarily driven by reduced fluvial sediment input, while paradoxically revealing a 4.26% increase in the Yangtze Estuary due to anthropogenic shoreline modifications that enhance nearshore sediment retention. The model also captures climate-induced ocean stratification effects, which suppress vertical energy exchange, limiting sediment resuspension and lateral redistribution and thereby altering SSC distribution patterns. Overall, the approach enables accurate SSC retrieval under severe observational data scarcity, providing a scalable and transferable solution for sediment monitoring in optically complex coastal environments."

 Accurate classification of urban green spaces from high-resolution remotely sensed images is critical for ecological environment planning, construction, and utilization. However, existing deep learning networks for large-scale high-resolution remote sensing images often face limited receptive fields and insufficient extraction of global information, making it challenging to achieve satisfactory performance on urban green space classification tasks. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel dual-encoder network, termed GreenNet, specifically designed for urban green space classification from high-resolution remotely sensed images. GreenNet features a unique dual-encoder structure. i.e., an inside encoder for efficiently extracting interior intra-image (i.e., local and global) features of urban green spaces from the small-sized images cropped from raw input remote sensing images, and an outside encoder for modeling long dependencies (i.e., external inter-image features) from the large-sized images cropped from raw input images. Additionally, a transformer-based outside-global–local attention block (OGLAB) is developed to fuse the intra-image and inter-image features from the dual-encoder to effectively capture inherent semantic representations of urban green spaces. Finally, to ensure classification consistency along class boundaries, a boundary loss is computed using edge-defined images, which are generated by a pre-trained Segmenting Anything Model (SAM) from the raw input image. The proposed GreenNet was evaluated on a self-built urban green space dataset, covering the whole area of Nanshan District, Shenzhen City, China, achieving an overall accuracy (OA) of 88.88 %, a mean F1-score (mF1) of 74.06 %, and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 60.77 %, respectively, demonstrating its superior performance to state-of-the-art networks on green space classification tasks."

 Industrial agglomeration areas have emerged as an important form of intensive production; however, the environmental pollution or odor complaint caused by volatile organic compounds has elicited widespread concerned due to the agglomeration of chemical companies. In order to trace source of disturbing odor pollutants or higher reactive pollutants for ozone formation, many industrial areas have conducted study and application of pollution tracing at different levels within and around the boundaries of enterprises and industrial areas, but many problems remain unaddressed. Given the demonstrated capability of artificial intelligence to classify problems, based on Bayesian optimization, a multimodel algorithm was developed to accurately identify and classify the sources of volatile organic compounds. Comparing the models of different algorithms, the convolutional neural network-long short-term memory model demonstrated the best predictive performance (accuracy of 0.886). Furthermore, comparison of two feature importance analysis tools (Out-Of-Bag and SHapley Additive exPlanations) indicated that benzene, toluene, and isobutane have the greatest impacts on tracing results, reflecting the interaction mechanisms among them. This paper demonstrates that the application of machine learning and neural networks can achieve efficient and accurate source identification of volatile organic compounds. The intelligent approach developed here serves as a successful precursor for establishing advanced identification and classification systems and holds broad application prospects in pollutant tracing for chemical industrial park to improve the scientific and accurate management."

 Wood pellets have become a popular alternative to fossil fuels and are widely applied in many countries. On the EU market, the prices of high-quality wood pellets have increased dramatically due to the energy crisis resulting from the Russian-Ukrainian War. Cheaper alternatives include pelletized agro-biomass (e.g. cereal straw, miscanthus or sunflower husk). The aim of this study was to compare the chemical and mineralogical composition of three different solid combustion products—bottom ash, coarse dust, and fine dust fractions—generated during combustion of various biomass pellet types in standard domestic heating systems. The combustion of different biomass pellets was carried out in a low-power heating boiler. Distinct differences in inorganic elemental composition and mineralogy were observed between wood and non-wood biomass pellets. Significant differences were also noted between the fine dust fraction collected in the exhaust gas duct and the coarser combustion products. The latter ones were characterized by a predominance of Ca, primarily in the form of carbonates and sulfates. In contrast, the solid combustion products of straw, sunflower husks, and miscanthus contained potassium as the main component, accounting for 30–50 % of the composition. The fine dust from coniferous wood pellets was significantly enriched in potentially toxic metals such as Zn, Cu, Pb, and Cd, which could pose a serious threat to air quality in residential areas. The most promising combustion product was the fine dust obtained from sunflower husks, since it contained the highest amounts of K and P, while maintaining relatively low concentrations of heavy metals."

 Much effort is spent by the air pollution and atmospheric science communities on quantifying pollutant emissions as they are used as inputs in air quality models and assist in the interpretation of atmospheric measurements at field sites. Nitrogen oxides (“NOx”, defined as the sum of nitric oxide NO and nitrogen dioxide NO2), nitrous acid (HONO), and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) are all byproducts of combustion processes. While NOx emissions from on-road vehicles have been extensively studied, vehicle emissions of HONO and especially HCN are not as well quantified. Enhancing our knowledge of direct HCN and HONO emissions is essential because HONO is an important precursor to the hydroxyl radical (OH), thereby playing a critical role in atmospheric oxidation, and HCN is toxic, long-lived in the atmosphere, and used as a tracer for biomass burning. In this manuscript, we present measurements of HCN and HONO made using an iodide-adduct chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) during August of 2019 near a highway in Meridian, Idaho. Vehicle emission ratios of HCN and HONO with respect to NOx (i.e., ΔHCN/ΔNOx and ΔHONO/ΔNOx) are reported as well as emission ratios of HCN and NOx with respect to carbon monoxide (CO) (i.e., ΔHCN/ΔCO and ΔNOx/ΔCO). Observed emission ratios were quite variable and determined for select highway influenced periods during the nighttime and early morning (prior to sunrise) located typically 200–500 s downwind of the major interstate highway. We report average values of 5.3 and 1.13 ppbv ppmv−1 for ΔHCN/ΔNOx and ΔHCN/ΔCO, respectively. The average ΔHONO/ΔNOx value - 9.8 ppbv ppmv−1 - falls within the range of reported literature values though it is somewhat higher than the commonly used value of 8 ppbv ppmv−1."

 Heatwaves are documented to exert significant impacts on both ecosystems and human societies. Ground-based observation of temperature could provide fundamental data to acquire heatwave characteristics like intensity, frequency and duration, but are challenging to get information about event-based spatial area. Meanwhile, Spatial and temporal gaps in observational heatwave records also receive increasing attention, but quantitative approaches remain lacking. Here we use the high-resolution air temperatures from the ERA5-Land reanalysis dataset (0.1° × 0.1) from 1950 to 2024, to acquire spatial scale of heatwave events using a spatiotemporally contiguous events tracking method. We compare spatial scale of heatwaves and the average distance of weather station network, which depicts the density, to address whether the station network is sufficient to capture heatwaves. The representativeness ratio was introduced as a metric describing how well the network density at a station captures nearby heatwave events in a given summer. We find the heatwaves at smaller scale (< 100 km) exhibit significant increase from 1950 to 2024, especially at nighttime. Meanwhile, there has been a continuously increase in the spatial density of worldwide weather stations. The coupling of these two trends drives spatially heterogeneous temporal evolutions of representativeness ratios in regional networks. The contiguous United States and Europe have consistently maintained high representativeness ratio (> 80 %), while some regions in South America and Africa exhibited poor representativeness ratio in the 1850s (< 20 %) but show significant improvement in recent periods (> 60 %). In these regions, the temporal changes in representativeness ratio may lead to overestimation of observed trends of heatwaves."

 Based on CN05.1 dataset and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) model outputs under different forcing experiments, this study systematically evaluates model performance, analyzes sources of simulation biases, and performs detection and attribution analyses of summer precipitation across northern China from 1961 to 2014. Results indicate that most CMIP6 models can reasonably reproduce the dipole pattern of precipitation, with 28 models achieving a comprehensive Taylor skill score above 0.6. However, notable discrepancies exist between simulated and observed precipitation trends. While the models effectively replicate the increasing trend observed in the western part of northern China (WNC), they fail to simulate the decreasing trend observed in the eastern part of northern China (ENC), instead exhibiting an opposite increasing trend. Analysis of these discrepancies reveals significant model deviations in simulating key atmospheric circulation systems and their associated moisture and dynamic conditions influencing precipitation. Additionally, the models inadequately reproduce the predominant roles of evaporation and horizontal thermodynamic processes on precipitation highlighted by observation, contributing to the divergence in simulated versus observed precipitation trends. Further detection and attribution analyses demonstrate that the signal of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing is detectable in the increasing precipitation in WNC and can be distinguished from other external forcings. However, model deficiencies in reproducing precipitation trends in ENC prevent the detection of any external forcing signals in this region."

 The accuracy of short-range weather forecasts generated by high-resolution numerical weather prediction (NWP) models can be impacted by factors such as surface heterogeneity, assimilation techniques, and uncertainties in the model physics. To address these limitations, this study proposes a hybrid model that combines an NWP model with machine learning (ML) techniques designed for short-range weather prediction over Bihar, India. In this approach, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model generates high-resolution short-range weather predictions for surface parameters, while the ML-based techniques are employed to correct the forecast trajectory. Several ML algorithms have been explored and trained to learn temperature and humidity gradients effectively, and the most effective one has been selected for hybrid model development based on its performance. The hybrid model significantly improves forecast accuracy compared to the WRF model, reducing forecast biases and root-mean-square errors. During June 2022 to August 2023, short-range temperature and relative humidity forecasts show a 10–20 % positive impact in different regions based on varying land types or topography. These analyses are also extended for independent verification using randomly selected ground stations. The results suggest that the RMSD (BIAS) in surface temperature and relative humidity are reduced from 3.78 (2.64) °C and 29.24 (−25.79) % to 2.11 (−0.22) °C and 10.02 (0.61) %, respectively.

 This study analyzes the aerosol and precipitable water vapor (PWV) properties at six sites in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), a densely populated and highly polluted region. The main objective is to explore how the columnar PWV is related to the attenuation of shortwave solar radiation (SWR), as well as the combined role of aerosol properties and PWV on radiative forcing based on AERONET data and model (SBDART) simulations. The analysis revealed high aerosol optical depth (AOD) values (0.4–0.6) throughout the year in all the sites, associated with increased PWV (4–5 cm) during the summer monsoon. Comprehensive investigation shows that changes in PWV levels also affect aerosols' size distribution, optical properties and radiation balance in a similar way - but in different magnitudes - between the examined sites. The water vapor radiative effect (WVRE) is highly dependent on aerosol presence, with its magnitude for both surface (−130 to −140 Wm−2) and atmospheric forcing becoming higher under clean atmospheres (without aerosols). Aerosol presence is also considered in the computations of the WVRE. In that case, the WVRE becomes more pronounced at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) (30 to 35 Wm−2) but exhibits a lower forcing impact on the surface (about −45 Wm−2) and within the atmosphere (70–80 Wm−2), suggesting important aerosol-PWV interrelations. The atmospheric heating rate due to PWV is more than double (3.5–4.5 K Day−1) that of aerosols (1–1.9 K Day−1), highlighting its essential role in radiative effects and climate implications over the IGP region. The radiative impacts of PWV and aerosols are further examined as a function of the single scattering albedo, solar zenith angle, and absorbing AOD at the different sites, revealing dependence on both astronomical and atmospheric variables related to aerosol absorption, thus unravelling the combined role of aerosols and PWV in climate implications."

 This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the interannual variability of the South American Low-Level Jet (SALLJ) and its impact on precipitation over Southeastern South America (SESA). The research focuses on two core locations of the SALLJ and spans the four conventional seasons (spring, summer, autumn, and winter) from 1979 to 2020. Trend analysis revealed significant increases in the annual, winter, and summer Frequency of occurrence of SALLJ Days (FSD), indicating an upward trend in SALLJ activity. This trend may be a dynamical factor responsible for the increase in SESA precipitation observed in previous studies. Significant relationships were found between the FSD and precipitation anomalies over SESA in all seasons. In the summer, autumn, and winter seasons, a direct relationship between FSD and precipitation anomalies in SESA was found through teleconnections via quasi-stationary Rossby waves of tropical origin associated with El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This means that El Niño-like conditions are associated with high FSD and positive precipitation anomalies, and La Niña-like conditions with low FSD and negative precipitation anomalies in SESA. While in spring, the relationship between FSD and ENSO is non-linear, with both high and low FSD seasons during El Niño-like conditions, no direct relationships between FSD and precipitation anomalies were found."
