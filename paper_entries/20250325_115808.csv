Although efforts to decarbonize the global economy have significantly shifted global anthropogenic emissions away from the most extreme emission scenarios, intermediate emission scenarios are still plausible. Significant warming in these scenarios cannot be ruled out as uncertainties in equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) remain very large. Until now, long-term climate change projections and their uncertainties for such scenarios have not been investigated using Earth system models (ESMs) that account for all major carbon cycle feedbacks. Using the fast ESM CLIMBER-X with interactive CO2 and CH4 (the latter typically not included in most models), we performed simulations for the next millennium under extended SSP1-2.6, SSP4-3.4 and SSP2-4.5 scenarios. These scenarios are usually associated with peak global warming levels of 1.5 ∘C, 2 ∘C and 3 ∘C, respectively, for an ECS of ∼3 ∘C, considered the best estimate in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. As ECS values lower or higher than this estimate cannot be ruled out, we emulate a wide range of ECS from 2 ∘C to 5 ∘C, defined as the ‘very likely’ range by the IPCC. Our results show that achieving the Paris Agreement goal of a 2 ∘C temperature increase is only feasible for low emission scenarios and if ECS is lower than 3.5 ∘C. With an ECS of 5 ∘C, peak warming in all considered scenarios more than doubles compared to an ECS of 3 ∘C. Approximately 50% of this additional warming is attributed to positive climate–carbon cycle feedbacks with comparable contributions from CO2 and CH4. The interplay between potentially high ECS and carbon cycle feedbacks could drastically enhance future warming, demonstrating the importance of properly accounting for all major climate feedbacks and associated uncertainties in projecting future climate change."

Large amounts of organic matter and nitrogen from river discharge may stimulate production and emission of greenhouse gases including N2O, thus reducing the blue carbon storage capacity of mangrove wetlands. However, it is unclear how the input of organic matter and nitrogen affect the emission fluxes of these greenhouse gases in mangrove wetlands. In this study, we compared the effluxes of N2O between the estuarine and non-estuarine mangrove wetlands near the seven major rivers on Hainan Island of China. The averaged N2O emission flux in the estuarine mangrove wetlands was 6.9 times than the non-estuarine mangrove wetlands. In the non-estuarine mangrove wetlands N2O emission flux increased significantly with total nitrogen content in the sediments. In contrast, organic carbon (OC)/organic nitrogen (ON) ratios were associated with N2O emissions in the estuarine mangrove wetlands. As rivers bring in more organic matter with high ON content, more N2O emissions occur in estuarine areas. OC in sediments are from different sources between estuary (fresh water dissolved OC (DOC)) and non-estuary (marine DOC) area. A higher OC/ON ratio leads to higher nitrification and lower N2O consumption enzyme activities in estuary areas compared with non-estuaries, which contributes extra N2O fluxes. Our study provides a direct process assessment of the response of natural N2O emissions to sediment chemistry changes caused by river inputs."

A novel approach of the self-consistent scattering model for cirrus clouds is presented to determine their optical scattering properties at different wavelengths, and their direct radiative effects are calculated with the discrete ordinates method embedded in the ARTDECO package. 
 Cloud–radiation interaction still drives large uncertainties in climate models, and its estimation is key to make more accurate predictions. In this context, high-altitude cirrus clouds play a fundamental role because (1) they have a high occurrence frequency globally and (2) they are the only cloud that can readily cool or warm the atmosphere during daytime, depending on their properties. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of optical scattering properties and direct radiative effect of cirrus clouds based on 4 years of continuous ground-based lidar measurements with the Barcelona (Spain) Micro Pulse Lidar. First, we introduce a novel approach of a self-consistent scattering model for cirrus clouds to determine their optical scattering properties at different wavelengths using only the extinction coefficient and cloud temperature. Second, we calculate the direct radiative effects of cirrus clouds with the discrete ordinates method, and we validate our results with SolRad-Net pyranometers and NOAA-20 measurements. Third, we present a case study analysing the direct radiative effect of a cirrus cloud along its back-trajectory using data from the Chemical LAgrangian Model of the Stratosphere with microphysics scheme for Ice clouds formation (CLaMS-Ice). The results show that the cirrus clouds with an average ice water content of 4.97 ± 5.53 mg m−3, in the nighttime, have a positive direct radiative effect at the top of the atmosphere (TOA; +40.4 W m−2) almost twice than at the bottom of the atmosphere (BOA; +22.1 W m−2); in the daytime, they have generally a negative direct radiative effect at BOA (−11.5 W m−2, 82 % of the cases) and always a positive effect at TOA (+14.2 W m−2). In these simulations, the influence of the lower layer aerosols is negligible in the cirrus direct radiative effects, with a bias (denoted BIAS) of −1.2 %. For the case study, the net direct radiative effects produced by the cirrus cloud, are from 0 to +40 W m−2 at TOA and from −51 to +20 W m−2 at BOA. This study reveals that the complexity of the cirrus cloud direct radiative effect calculation lies in the fact that it is highly sensitive to the cirrus scene properties."

Wu;Joseph A. Santanello;Jie Gong;Chi Ao;Panagiotis Vergados;Kevin J. Nelson,Exploring commercial Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) products for planetary boundary layer studies in the Arctic,"This study explores the potential of two newly launched commercial Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) satellite missions for advancing Arctic lower-atmospheric studies. The products have a good sampling of the lower Arctic atmosphere and are useful to derive the planetary boundary layer (PBL) height during winter months. This research is a step towards closing the observation gap in polar regions due to the decomissioning of Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC-1) GNSS RO mission and the lack of high-latitude coverage by its successor (COSMIC-2). 
 Commercial radio occultation (RO) satellites that utilize the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are emerging as key tools for observing the polar regions, which are not covered by the second-generation Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC-2) mission. This study evaluates the value of commercial RO measurements, specifically Spire and GeoOptics, for planetary boundary layer (PBL) investigations in the Arctic, a region where favorable lower-atmospheric penetration of GNSS RO is vital for observing the persistently shallow PBL. The lower tropospheric penetration capability of both Spire and GeoOptics over the Arctic Ocean, with nearly 80 % observations reaching an altitude of 500 m above mean sea level, is comparable to other RO missions such as the current Meteorological Operational satellite programme (MetOp) and the discontinued COSMIC-1 missions. A seasonal cycle in RO penetration probability, with the minimum occurring during the Arctic warm season, was observed in most RO datasets, except NASA-purchased Spire data. Monthly mean Arctic PBL height (PBLH) derived from Spire and GeoOptics compares well with MetOp observations and the reanalysis from Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2). A minimum penetration threshold of 500 m generally suffices for determining Arctic PBLH, although a 300 m threshold improves performance of NASA-purchased Spire data. Arctic PBLH representation is influenced less by the number of observations or instrument type and more by the algorithms used for bending angle and refractivity retrievals. These findings underscore the importance of processing algorithms in achieving accurate lower-atmospheric soundings and Arctic PBLH representation."

The model provides AOD at a 3 km × 3 km spatial and 15 min temporal resolution over Europe. It accurately captured multi-layer AOD dynamics during Saharan dust transport and the Mount Etna eruption, demonstrating consistent physical accuracy. 
 Multi-layer aerosol optical depth (AOD) estimation with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution is crucial for effective aerosol monitoring, given the significant variations over time and space. While ground-based observations provide detailed vertical profiles, satellite data are essential for addressing the spatial and temporal gaps. This study utilizes profiles from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) and data from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) to estimate vertical AOD values at 1.5, 3, 5, and 10 km layers. These estimations are achieved with spatial and temporal resolutions of 3 km × 3 km and 15 min, respectively, over the European troposphere. We employed machine learning models – XGBoost (XGB) and random forest (RF) – trained on SEVIRI data from 2017 to 2018 for the estimations. Validation using CALIOP AOD retrievals in 2019 confirmed the reliability of our findings, emphasizing the importance of wind speed (Ws) and wind direction (Wd) in improving AOD estimation accuracy. A comparison between seasonal and annual models revealed slight variations in accuracy, leading to the selection of annual models as the preferred approach for estimating SEVIRI multi-layer AOD values. Among the annual models, the XGB model demonstrated superior performance over the RF model at all four layers, yielding more reliable AOD estimations with R2 values of 0.99, 0.97, 0.98, and 0.98 for the four layers from low- to high-altitude layers. Further validation using data from European Aerosol Research Lidar Network (EARLINET) stations across Europe in 2020 indicated that the XGB model still achieved better agreement with EARLINET AOD profiles, with R2 values of 0.86, 0.80, 0.75, and 0.59 and RMSE values of 0.022, 0.012, 0.015, and 0.005. We performed a qualitative validation of multi-layer AOD estimations by comparing spatial trends with CALIOP AOD retrievals for SEVIRI pixels on four dates in 2019, showing strong agreement across varying AOD levels. Additionally, the model successfully estimated AOD at 15 min intervals for two real events – a Saharan dust plume and the Mount Etna eruption – revealing consistent physical characteristics, including long-range transport in the upper layers and a gradual increase in AOD from lower to higher tropospheric layers during volcanic events. The results demonstrate that the proposed method facilitates comprehensive monitoring of AOD behavior throughout the four vertical layers of the troposphere, offering important insights into the dynamics of aerosol occurrence."

Temperature profiles from the near surface to 60 km are derived by pure rotational Raman and Rayleigh scattering techniques using a single integrated lidar system. The results prove the system can make fine measurements of the atmospheric temperature profiles from the near surface to 60 km. 
 Accurate measurement of atmospheric temperature profiles from the surface to the stratosphere is crucial for understanding atmospheric dynamics and climate processes. Traditional methods, such as the use of radiosondes, are limited in spatial and temporal coverage. To address this challenge, a dual-field, integrated lidar system was developed based on the principles of pure rotational Raman scattering and Rayleigh scattering principles to precisely detect atmospheric temperatures in both the troposphere and stratosphere from the near surface to 60 km altitude. The system utilized a 532 nm pulsed laser with 200 mJ and 50 Hz, utilizing a dual-field-of-view (DFOV) setup to receive atmospheric backscatter signals. Pure rotational Raman signals from 5–30 km and Rayleigh signals from 30–60 km are collected using a 800 mm aperture telescope, while a smaller 200 mm aperture telescope receives pure rotational Raman signals below 5 km. By combining these signals, the system derives continuous temperature profiles from the surface to 60 km using a single lidar system. The observed temperature data were compared with simultaneous radiosonde and atmospheric model data. Below 16 km, the lidar-derived temperatures exhibited strong agreement with radiosonde data, with a correlation coefficient of 0.95 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.2 K. Between 30 and 60 km, lidar-derived temperatures were also in strong agreement with model data, achieving a correlation coefficient of 0.88. These continuous temperature profiles will support the study of fluctuation phenomena in the middle and upper atmosphere, particularly when integrated with high-altitude observations from sodium fluorescence Doppler lidar operating at 80–105 km in future studies. This integrated lidar system serves as a critical tool for achieving continuous atmospheric measurement across multiple layers, contributing significantly to atmospheric science and remote sensing applications."

 The rapid development of remote sensing technology has led to an exponential growth in satellite images, yet their inherent complexity often makes them difficult for non-expert users to understand. Natural language, as a carrier of human knowledge, can bridge the gap between common users and complicated satellite imagery. Additionally, when paired with visual data, natural language can be utilized to train large vision–language foundation models, significantly improving performance in various tasks.

However, conventional systems predominantly depend on costly ion exchange membranes, which are often plagued by fouling and scaling challenges. Here, we introduce an ingenious electrochemically assisted calcium silicate (EACS) system capable of achieving a rapid pH swing from 8.5 to 10 within 1 h through the in situ utilization of H+ and OH– ions, eliminating the need for membranes. The EACS system incorporates a novel 3D-printed porous basket holder designed to house calcium silicate particles and a rod-shaped Ru–Ir anode. Under closed-circuit conditions, the packed calcium silicate reacts with H+ generated at the anode, releasing Ca2+ into bulk solution, while OH– produced at the cathode accumulates, resulting in an elevated bulk pH. This mechanism enables the EACS system to achieve exceptional phosphorus recovery efficiency (88.4%–96.6%) from various waste streams, with energy consumption as low as 24.4 kWh kg P–1. Long-term continuous flow experiments demonstrate that periodic replacement of depleted silicate minerals sustains system efficiency and stability. Furthermore, comparative analysis reveals that while carbonate and silicate minerals are functionally viable, silicate minerals exhibit superior performance in removal kinetics, product purity, and reduced carbon emissions. Notably, the effluent from the EACS system, enriched with Ca2+ and characterized by a high pH, exhibits potential for direct air carbon capture. The proposed EACS system offers a transformative approach to environmental remediation and industrial applications, leveraging the fundamental principle of pH-swing to open new avenues for sustainable solutions."

Herein, dynamic Mn–VO associates were crafted onto the Mn-incorporated CeO2 mesocrystal (Mn/meso-CeO2) surface with Mn substituting a Ce atom through an easy-to-handle precipitation strategy. Experiments and theoretical calculation demonstrated that the asymmetric surface Mn–O–Ce configuration induced electron delivery from the low-valent Mn to adjacent Ce, destabilizing the circumambient O atoms and facilitating the formation of dynamic Mn–VO associates. Compared to pristine meso-CeO2, the Mn/meso-CeO2 with dynamic Mn–VO associates could efficiently activate O2 into a superoxide radical and a peroxanion (O2•– and O22–) at higher reaction temperature (over 200 °C). Meanwhile, the O atom adjacent to Mn featuring substantially elevated Lewis acidity promoted the adsorption and activation of benzene. Consequently, the Mn/meso-CeO2 catalyst exhibited a superior catalytic oxidation reactivity (T90 = 215 °C) toward C6H6 combustion via a Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism.

We curated data on biomarker identification in urine or blood for 526 chemicals from 4797 biomonitoring entities, sourced from 89 distinct cohorts across 43 countries, and developed a machine learning model named Biomarker Matrix Identifier (BMI) to predict the most suitable biological fluid for biomarker identification. Our model achieves over 94% accuracy using circular fingerprints as the input. Applying this method to the Human Exposomic Metabolome Database (HExPMetDB) containing over 20,000 chemicals revealed that approximately 67% of compounds are predicted to be more effectively monitored using urine as the optimal biomonitoring matrix. This predictive model enhances the accuracy of the exposure assessment in human exposomic analysis, facilitating more efficient biomarker identification strategies. In sum, we have established an effective prediction model in facilitating the prediction of whether the identified chemicals in the biological fluids can represent exposure for human exposomic analysis."

However, the effects of eddies on the ocean flows are represented in a highly idealized way in the CESM and it is unknown how these affect AMOC stability. Here, we show results of the first quasi‐equilibrium hosing simulation with a strongly eddying ocean‐only model in which the AMOC collapses.

Understanding the relationship between effective stress and shear‐layer thickness helps characterize basal resistance to ice motion and inform subglacial landform formation. While experiments agree increasing effective stresses beget decreasing shear‐layer thicknesses at high effective stresses, a trend is unclear at low effective stresses. Continuum models predict that increased effective stresses yield increasing shear‐layer thicknesses, inconsistent with experiments. Here, we identify how properties of a medium's persistent contact network lead to non‐monotonic shear‐layer thicknesses in effective stress through Discrete Element Method simulations.

For example, if a 1‐in‐20‐year heatwave event requires 400 samples to estimate return value to ± $\pm $1% uncertainty, one would need 20 different 20‐year simulations. Achieving such quantities will require extensive climate downscaling simulations, potentially aided by ML‐based downscaling methods to increase the ensemble size."

We investigated anomalies of remote sensing vegetation indexes under droughts across the upper Yangtze River (UYR) basin, characterized as humid but having experienced frequent seasonal droughts from 2000. Then we compared global big river basins by focusing on the Nile and Congo basins, which have similar characteristics to the UYR. The vegetation across the UYR was affected by water stress in recent years but shows reduced sensitivity to drought. The compound effect of drought timing and phenology largely drives the response. Results show that late‐season droughts generally have a greater impact on vegetation growth compared to early season droughts, with alpine grasslands showing particularly pronounced responses due to their ecological features such as shallow root depth and aggressive hydrological behavior. The Nile basin, similar to the UYR basin, exhibits pronounced late‐season vegetation vulnerability, highlighting shared patterns of drought impact across heterogeneous landscapes. In contrast, the tropical rainforests in the Congo basin demonstrate greater resilience, supported by complex root systems, dense canopies, and low cloud cover that reduces evaporation. This study underscores the importance of considering regional ecological characteristics, drought timing, and phenological stages in assessing vegetation responses to drought.

Even though it is among the largest physio‐climatic regions of the northern circumpolar, these knowledge gaps are acute in the Taiga Shield. This research aimed to determine if hydrology and biogeochemistry regimes of the Taiga Shield have been resilient to recent climate warming. We apply a recently developed framework of hydrological resilience that shows the first 20 years of the 21st century were the warmest and wettest of the previous 300 years. These conditions altered the catchment such that >50% of the water year streamflow now occurs during winter, shifting the catchment from a nival to a cold season pluvial hydrological regime. This regime shift has significantly changed the fraction of inorganic nitrogen export, but insufficiently to shift the biogeochemical regime. Sustained multi‐year physical process synchronization was the cause of these changes. This behavior is not well simulated by existing Earth system models. The tipping point in local mean annual air temperatures was crossed near the turn of the century well below the warming threshold of the Paris Accord. A one‐size‐fits‐all approach to mitigation targets is not effective at preventing all shifts in Earth systems. This is important to consider as regime changes in small hydrological systems have the potential to trigger cascading effects in the larger catchments to which they contribute."

Most operational air quality forecast (AQF) models estimate smoke emissions based on the latest available satellite fire products, which may not represent real‐time fire behaviors without considering fire spread. Hence, a novel machine learning (ML) based fire spread forecast model, the Fire Intensity and spRead forecAst (FIRA), is developed for AQF model applications. FIRA aims to improve the performance of AQF models by providing realistic, dynamic fire characteristics including the spatial distribution and intensity of fire radiative power (FRP). In this study, data sets in 2020 over the continental United States (CONUS) and a historical California fire in 2024 are used for model training and evaluation. For application assessment, FIRA FRP predictions are applied to the Unified Forecast System coupled with smoke (UFS‐Smoke) model as inputs, focusing on a California fire case in September 2020. Results show that FIRA captures fire spread with R‐squared (R2) near 0.7 and good spatial similarity (∼95%). The comparison between UFS‐Smoke simulations using near‐real‐time fire products and FIRA FRP predictions show good agreements, indicating that FIRA can accurately represent future fire activities. Although FIRA generally underestimates fire intensity, the uncertainties can be mitigated by applying scaling factors to FRP values. Use of the scaled FIRA largely outperforms the experimental UFS‐Smoke model in predicting aerosol optical depth and the three‐dimensional smoke contents, while also demonstrating the ability to improve surface fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations affected by fires."

 The efficient and modular diversification of molecular scaffolds, particularly for the synthesis of diverse molecular libraries, remains a significant challenge in drug optimization campaigns.1–3 The late-stage introduction of alkyl fragments is especially desirable due to the high sp³-character and structural versatility of these motifs.4 Given their prevalence in molecular frameworks, C(sp²)−H bonds serve as attractive targets for diversification, though this process often requires difficult pre-functionalization or lengthy de novo syntheses. Traditionally, direct alkylations of arenes are achieved by employing Friedel–Crafts reaction conditions using strong Brønsted or Lewis acids.5,6 However, these methods suffer from poor functional group tolerance and low selectivity, limiting their broad implementation in late-stage functionalization and drug optimization campaigns. Herein, we report the application of a novel strategy for the selective coupling of differently hybridized radical species, which we term dynamic orbital selection. This mechanistic paradigm overcomes common limitations of Friedel-Crafts alkylations via the in situ formation of two distinct radical species, which are subsequently differentiated by a copper-based catalyst based on their respective binding properties. As a result, we demonstrate herein a general and highly modular reaction for the direct alkylation of native arene C−H bonds using abundant and benign alcohols and carboxylic acids as the alkylating agents. Ultimately, this solution overcomes the synthetic challenges associated with the introduction of complex alkyl scaffolds into highly sophisticated drug scaffolds in a late-stage fashion, thereby granting access to vast new chemical space. Based on the generality of the underlying coupling mechanism, dynamic orbital selection is expected to be a broadly applicable coupling platform for further challenging transformations involving two distinct radical species."

Here, the authors show that addition of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid at ~80 µM leads to the improved power generation in Shewenella oneidensis MR-1. 
 Electron shuttle plays a decisive role in extracellular electron transfer (EET) of exoelectrogens. However, neither identifying the most efficient electron shuttle molecule nor programming its optimal synthesis level that boosts EET has been established. Here, the phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA) biosynthesis pathway is first constructed to synthesize PCA at an optimal level for EET in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. To facilitate PCA transport, the porin OprF is expressed to improve cell membrane permeability, the cytotoxicity of which, however, impaired cell growth. To mitigate cytotoxicity, PCA biosensor is designed to dynamically decouple PCA biosynthesis and transport, resulting in the maximum output power density reaching 2.85 ± 0.10 W m−2, 33.75-fold higher than wild-type strain. Moreover, extensive analyses of cellular electrophysiology, metabolism, and behaviors reveal PCA shuttles electrons from cell to electrode, which is the dominant mechanism underlying PCA-boosted EET.

Here, by combining graphene with Fe3GeTe2, Huang et al find a strongly enhanced magnetoresistance that is temperature insensitive. 
 Information technology has a great demand for magnetoresistance (MR) sensors with high sensitivity and wide-temperature-range operation. It is well known that space charge inhomogeneity in graphene (Gr) leads to finite MR in its pristine form, and can be enhanced by increasing the degree of spatial disorder. However, the enhanced MR usually diminishes drastically as the temperature decreases. Here, by stacking a van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) on top of graphene to form an FGT/Gr heterostructure, we demonstrate a positive MR of up to ~9400% under a magnetic field of 9 T at room temperature (RT), an order of magnitude larger MR compared to pure graphene. More strikingly, the giant MR of the FGT/Gr heterostructure sustains over a wide temperature range from RT down to 4 K. Both control experiments and DFT calculations show that the enhanced MR originates from spin-dependent orbital coupling between FGT and graphene, which is temperature insensitive. Our results open a new route for realizing high-sensitivity and wide-temperature-range MR sensors.

 Protein nanocages are multimeric structures that can be engineered to mimic the molecular conformation of microorganisms. Based on previous findings showing that a mucosal FlaB-tPspA fusion (flagellin fused with truncated PspA antigen of Streptococcus pneumoniae) vaccine-induced protective immune response against S. pneumoniae, we develop a ferritin nanocage vaccine displaying multivalent presentation of both antigen and adjuvant on a nanocarrier using the SpyTag/SpyCatcher strategy. The 1:1 antigen/adjuvant nanocage is further used as a mucosal vaccine, which can translocate to draining lymph nodes with higher efficiency than fusion vaccine. Moreover, intranasal immunization with the nanocage vaccine significantly enhances mucosal immune responses with more efficient B-cell memory generation and antibody maturation, as well as more balanced (Th1/Th2) immune responses with increased IFN-γ and IL-17 production, comparing with fusion vaccine. Mice immunized with the nanocage vaccine exhibited enhanced protection against lethal infection compare to the FlaB-tPspA fusion group.

 Inorganic phosphate (Pi) is essential for life, and its intracellular levels must be tightly regulated to avoid toxicity. XPR1, the sole known phosphate exporter, is critical for maintaining this balance. Here we report cryo-EM structures of the human XPR1-KIDINS220 complex in substrate-free closed and substrate-bound outward-open states, as well as an XPR1 mutant in a substrate-bound inward-facing state. In the presence of inositol hexaphosphate (InsP6) and phosphate, the complex adopts an outward-open conformation, with InsP6 binding the SPX domain and juxtamembrane regions, indicating active phosphate export. Without phosphate or InsP6, the complex closes, with transmembrane helix 9 blocking the outward cavity and a C-terminal loop obstructing the intracellular cavity. XPR1 alone remains closed even with phosphate and InsP6. Functional mutagenesis shows that InsP6, whose levels vary with Pi availability, works with KIDINS220 to regulate XPR1 activity.

 Agriculture is one of the leading causes of detrimental environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss and depletion of freshwater resources. Such impacts can be assessed by environmental sustainability indices; however, limitations in current indicators necessitate the development of more robust and standardized crop-specific environmental sustainability indices. Here we developed the crop environmental sustainability index (PLANTdex), a spatially explicit index (5 arcmin resolution) quantifying crop production’s environmental impacts. PLANTdex includes globally standardized indicators of environmental impacts assessing water stress and biodiversity loss via five emissions pathways: greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, land occupation, and nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer application. We applied PLANTdex to 16 crops, revealing high variability across production system efficiencies, crop types and local context environmental sensitivities. Globally and nationally, no clear correlation emerged between PLANTdex scores and crop production, but stronger correlations were evident at finer spatial scales and for individual crops. Sugar cane showed the strongest negative correlation (low impacts in high-production areas), while oil palm had the strongest positive correlation (high impacts in high-production areas), highlighting the importance of sub-national, crop-specific assessments.

 Multi-year La Niña (ML) has occurred more frequently since the 1960s, but whether and to what extent it is due to external forcing remains unknown. Here, using 15 large ensemble (LENS) experiments under the same external forcing with ~500 realizations, we find that external forcings contribute only 18% of the post-1960 ML increase. The observed ML increase is mainly attributed to the higher transition rate of strong El Niño (SE) into ML because of increased SE amplitude, with a relatively small contribution from its increased frequency. However, the SE amplitude remains unchanged in the experiments under external forcing. It suggests that internal variability plays a dominant role in the increased SE amplitude in observations, hence increases its transition and the ML frequency. Associated with stronger SE, some factors outside the tropical Pacific become more active, also favoring ML development. The essential role of internal variability is confirmed by comparing the SE amplitude and ML frequency changes in members with the highest increased transition rate across LENS with observations."

 Attainment of corporate net-zero goals will depend on sufficient mitigation of scope 3 emissions, but implementation is challenged by measurement and management complexities. Here, we investigate the multi-tier greenhouse gas emissions structures of supply chains to assess mitigation potential using environmentally extended input-output models. We find that 56–70% of scope 3 emissions included in current science-based coverage guidance occur within the operational emissions of the first two tiers of supply. To meet net-zero objectives, companies will typically need to reach deep into tiers 4 or 5 of supply, where traceability has proven impractical.

Using this integrated approach, we evaluated the impact of the emissions trading system on the levelized cost of ammonia across 30 provinces in China from 2018 to 2060. Our results indicated that without the emissions trading system or with it covering the electricity industry, renewable ammonia cannot achieve cost parity with conventional ammonia for almost all provinces until 2040.

 Extreme Indian Ocean dipole events (EXIODs) exert pronounced climate impacts both regionally and globally, which are closely associated with their sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs). Here we find an evident asymmetry in SSTA patterns between the positive (EXpIOD) and negative (EXnIOD) phases of the EXIOD. Specifically, the warm SSTA center of the EXnIOD eastern pole is confined south of Java, whereas the cold pole during EXpIODs is primarily located off Sumatra. Diagnoses with model experiments further reveal that the pattern asymmetry is attributed to the non-uniformly distributed nonlinear vertical heat advection and latent heat flux anomalies along the Sumatra–Java coasts. Due to pattern asymmetry, more frequent and intense marine heatwaves and extreme sea level rise events induced by EXnIODs occur along the Java coast. However, current climate models systematically underestimate the degree of pattern asymmetry and its influences on local marine disasters, thereby challenging accurate predictions of coastal extremes.

 Climate warming in northern and Arctic regions drives vegetation growth and shifts species distribution. In northern Quebec's Boreal-Arctic transition (forest-tundra ecotone), this is seen in the replacement of lichen by shrubs, primarily dwarf birch. These changes impact surface albedo, contributing to climate forcings with broad consequences. This study measures vegetation changes in Tasiapik valley near Umiujaq, Quebec, using a combination of (1) hyperspectral data (347–2400 nm) collected from 62 vegetation assemblages, including lichen, dwarf birch, willow, and spruce, to calculate broadband albedo, and (2) remote sensing data from Landsat satellites over 1984–2023. By combining these data, the proportion of vegetation type for each pixel was determined at the beginning and end of the 40-year period. The areal coverage of six main vegetation types was quantified over the 9.25 km2 valley. The most significant change was lichen replacement by dwarf birch with lichen understory, leading to an albedo reduction from 0.233 to 0.168 and a summer shortwave forcing of 11.17 W m−2. At the valley scale, the spatially-averaged summer forcing was 2.16 W m−2 when considering all observed vegetation changes. These values, lower than those in previous Norwegian studies, highlight the spatial variability of shortwave forcing due to lichen replacement. We observed that the vegetation change producing the greatest positive radiative forcing also caused the strongest greening. This suggests that Landsat-based greening may be used as a proxy for surface albedo change on an Arctic scale.

10.1016/j.jag.2025.104472,False,International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,该论文主要关注的是利用遥感数据生成的气候和生态系统变量高分辨率地图，以及这些地图在区域、国家或全球尺度上的汇总产品的不确定性评估问题。论文指出，由于忽略了地图误差的空间相关性，目前对汇总产品不确定性的评估常常不准确。虽然使用了遥感数据，但其重点在于陆地生态系统和气候变量的制图和不确定性分析，而非大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['climate variables', 'ecosystem variables', 'remote sensing data', 'carbon stocks', 'climate change mitigation', 'ecosystem degradation', 'spatial averages', 'spatial totals']",Alexandre M.J.-C.

Heuvelink,Scientists yet to consider spatial correlation in assessing uncertainty of spatial averages and totals,"•Uncertainty of spatially aggregated products is frequently inaccurately quantified. •Spatial correlation in map errors affects the calculation of uncertainty of spatial averages or totals. •Methods exist to account for spatial dependence of map errors. 
 High-resolution maps of climate and ecosystem variables are essential for supporting terrestrial carbon stocks and fluxes estimation, climate change mitigation, and ecosystem degradation assessment. These maps are usually created using remotely sensed data obtained from various types of imagery and sensors. The remote sensing data typically serve as covariates to deliver spatially explicit information using machine learning algorithms. Often the uncertainty associated with the maps is also quantified, for instance by prediction error variance maps or by maps of the lower and upper limits of a prediction interval. In addition, these products are often aggregated to regional, national, or global scales relevant to climate policy, natural resource inventory, and measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) frameworks. Quantifying uncertainty in aggregated products is crucial as it is necessary to assess their value and evaluate whether changes and trends in aggregated estimates are statistically significant. However, we argue that such uncertainty is frequently inaccurately assessed due to the neglect of spatial correlation in map errors. This critical methodological issue has been overlooked in most large-scale mapping studies."

10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108070,False,Atmospheric Research,该论文主要研究基于甚低频闪电定位网络（VLF-LLN）的闪电临近预报技术。它通过分析闪电高密度区域的时空演变，利用时空数据外推模型（ME-RNN）预测雷暴区域内闪电活动的强度和演变模式。该研究侧重于雷电灾害预警，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）关联性不强。,"['lightning', 'thunderstorm', 'lightning location network', 'nowcasting', 'VLF-LLN']",Yi Liu;Jialei Wang;Yang Song;Shi Liang;Min Xia;Qilin Zhang,Lightning nowcasting based on high-density area and extrapolation utilizing long-range lightning location data,"•A high-density region generation method based on physical phenomenon statistics was proposed. •A lightning nowcasting model was proposed to capture thunderstorm evolution and migration processes. •The GAN architecture was used to optimize and enhance long time series nowcasting. 
 Lightning poses varying degrees of threat to human production, life and personal safety because of its huge destructive power. Lightning prediction with intensity estimation is an important reference for disaster warning, determining lightning protection level and real-time and dynamic lightning risk assessment. Real-time observation of total lightning can compensate for the problem of limited range or shielding of radar observation and is of great significance for thunderstorm tracking and lightning nowcasting. In this paper, the VLF Lightning Location Network (VLF-LLN) is used to obtain real-time long-range lightning location data. Through density estimation based on the Gaussian mixture model and weighted according to time proximity, the spatio-temporal range and frequency information of lightning high-density area are obtained. Then, a spatio-temporal data extrapolation model ME-RNN is proposed to predict the intensity of lightning activity and its evolution pattern in the thunderstorm region, so as to realize the nowcasting of lightning activity. Based on the PredRNN architecture, the model integrates the MotionGRU operator optimized for the characteristics of lightning data, and integrates the generative adversative network (GAN) to capture the transient changes of lightning phenomena and predict its movement trend. At 6 min, 18 min and 36 min before the thunderstorm reached the area of concentration (AOC), the prediction accuracy of the model was 94.1 %, 79.4 % and 65.8 %, respectively. Furthermore, the ME-RNN model can track the active thunderstorm cells associated with lightning activity, and realize the prediction of the separation and merging of lightning high-density area, as well as the prediction of moving trend."

Gutierrez-Villarreal;Clémentine Junquas;Jhan-Carlo Espinoza;Patrice Baby;Elisa Armijos,Influence of local topographic structures on the atmospheric mechanisms related to the Andean-Amazon rainiest zone,"•Regional and local reliefs are key to simulate Andean rainfall hotspots. •50 % of the Andes height explains 60 % of the Andes-Amazon rainfall hotspot intensity. •This is mediated by the control of the regional scale moisture flux intensity. •Numerical local topography removal reduces precipitation in an Andean hotspot by 40 %. •The local relief controls the hotspot location by channeling the moisture flux. 
 The Andes-Amazon transition region features critically important ecological services on the local, regional and global scales. This region is among the rainiest zones in the world, with rainfall rates of up to 7000 mm/year. However, the physical mechanisms leading to the existence of these “precipitation hotspots” remain poorly known. Here, we attempt to disentangle the controlling atmospheric mechanisms exerted by local topographic structures that started to uplift about 5–10 million years ago in response to the Nazca Ridge subduction, in the vicinity of the Quincemil hotspot, the most intense of them. We first use the Weather Research and Forecasting model to conduct sensitivity tests to planetary boundary layer parameterizations at 5 km horizontal grid spacing during the austral summer of 2012–13. After finding the most suitable configuration in terms of the diurnal cycle of rainfall intensity and extent, we further perform topographic sensitivity tests by reducing the Fitzcarrald Arch lowlands and, on top of it, by removing the Camisea mountain. The Fitzcarrald Arch deflects moisture flux towards Quincemil, while the Camisea mountain induces local vortical circulations that increase moisture transport, convergence and rainfall over Quincemil, ultimately controlling its location and intensity by up to 40 %. When reducing the height of the Andes in half, we find that it sustains the development of precipitation hotspots, accounting for up to 60 % of rainfall, by providing a mechanical forcing to increase regional-scale moisture fluxes. Such mechanisms dominate during nighttime, when rainfall peaks in the region, and might explain the existence of the rainiest zone in the Andes-Amazon transition."
