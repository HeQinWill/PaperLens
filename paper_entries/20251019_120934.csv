10.5194/acp-25-12893-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注中欧地区冬季的空气质量问题，特别是家庭供暖产生的排放物对有机气溶胶形成的影响。论文使用化学传输模型来模拟颗粒物的来源，并将模型结果与德国和捷克共和国的测量数据进行比较。研究发现，模型低估了有机气溶胶的浓度，这主要是由于对家庭供暖排放的挥发性有机化合物（VOCs）的低估。通过调整模型中的排放量和气溶胶生成参数，可以提高模型的准确性。虽然研究涉及空气质量监测，但它侧重于模型模拟和排放清单的改进，而不是大气环境遥感技术（如卫星观测或大气成分分析）。,"['air quality', 'particulate matter', 'organic aerosol', 'chemical transport model', 'emission inventory']",Hanna Wiedenhaus;Roland Schrödner;Ralf Wolke;Marie L.

Using a chemical transport model and measurements, it was found that the model underestimated organic particle concentrations. This was due to an underestimation of gases from domestic heating that form secondary organic particles. Improving the model by increasing these emissions and the particle formation led to better results, demonstrating the important role of heating emissions in winter. 
 Anthropogenic aerosol particles remain a significant air quality concern in central Europe, particularly during winter months. This study employs the chemistry transport model COSMO–MUSCAT (COnsortium for Small scale MOdelling coupled with the MUltiScale Chemistry Aerosol Transport) to investigate particulate matter sources, with a focus on emissions from residential heating. The model results are compared with winter measurements from one site in Germany and two sites in the Czech Republic, where solid fuels are commonly used for heating. A non-reactive tagging method tracking primary organic matter (OM) reveals a high contribution from residential heating. Although the magnitude and temporal changes of the model results mostly agree with total OM values at two measuring stations, it appears to underestimate measurements at a site in the central Czech Republic. This underestimation is partly attributed to the inadequate representation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) emitted from wood combustion. The study highlights the impact of anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (AVOCs) on SOA formation, which are currently underrepresented in air quality models. Sensitivity tests adjusting SOA yields and AVOC emissions increase OM concentrations by up to 40 % at the measurement sites. These findings emphasise the need for accurate parameterisation of AVOC-derived SOA formation and residential heating emissions to better tackle wintertime air quality challenges in central Europe."

Measurements from five nadir-viewing satellite sensors are first harmonized and then merged into a coherent record. The long-term stability of the data record is further improved through scaling the profiles using the GOME-type Total Ozone Essential Climate Variable (GTO-ECV) data record as a reference. 
 We present the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME)-type Ozone Profile Essential Climate Variable (GOP-ECV) data record covering the 26-year period from July 1995 until October 2021. It is derived from a series of five nadir-viewing ultraviolet–visible(–near-infrared) GOME-type satellite instruments, including GOME/the second European Remote Sensing satellite (ERS-2), the Scanning Imaging Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY)/the Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT), the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)/Aura, GOME-2/Meteorological Operational satellite A (MetOp-A), and GOME-2/Meteorological Operational satellite B (MetOp-B), which are merged into a single coherent long-term time series. It provides monthly mean ozone profiles at a spatial resolution of 5° × 5° latitude by longitude. The profiles are given as partial columns for 19 atmospheric layers ranging from the surface up to 80 km. The underlying profile retrieval algorithm is the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory scheme, which is sensitive to both tropospheric and stratospheric amounts of ozone. The merged profile record has been developed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in the framework of the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative+ (ESA-CCI+) ozone project (Ozone_CCI+). Profiles from the individual instruments are first harmonized through careful inspection and elimination of inter-sensor deviations and drifts and then merged into a combined record. In a further step, the merged time series is harmonized with the GOME-type Total Ozone Essential Climate Variable (GTO-ECV) data record, which is based on nearly the same satellite sensors. GTO-ECV possesses  excellent long-term stability, and, with the homogenization presented in this paper, an improvement in the robustness and stability of the merged profiles can be achieved. For this purpose, an altitude-dependent scaling is applied that utilizes ozone profile Jacobians obtained from a machine learning approach. We found that climatological ozone distributions derived for selected layers from the final GOP-ECV data record exhibit expected spatiotemporal patterns."

A novel deep learning approach is developed to classify rain, snow, and graupel, achieving 93 % accuracy in real-world observations. The model remains robust to camera parameter variations and maintains reliable performance at wind speeds below 5 m s−1, demonstrating strong potential for large-scale practical applications. 
 Urban surveillance cameras offer a valuable resource for high spatiotemporal resolution observations of near surface precipitation type (SPT), with significant implications for sectors such as transportation, agriculture, and meteorology. However, distinguishing between common SPT – rain, snow, and graupel – present considerable challenges due to their visual similarities in surveillance videos. This study addresses these challenges by analyzing both daytime and nighttime videos, leveraging meteorological, optical, and imaging principles to identify distinguishing features for each SPT. Considering both computational accuracy and efficiency, a new deep learning framework is proposed. It leverages transfer learning with a pre-trained MobileNet V2 for spatial feature extraction and incorporates a Gated Recurrent Unit network to model temporal dependencies between video frames. Using the newly developed 94 h SPT Surveillance Video (SPTV) dataset, the proposed model is trained and evaluated alongside 24 comparative algorithms. Results show that our proposed method achieves an accuracy of 0.9677 on the SPTV dataset, outperforming all other relevant algorithms. Furthermore, in real-world experiments, the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 0.9301, as validated against manually corrected Two-Dimensional Video Disdrometer measurements. It remains robust against variations in camera parameters, maintaining consistent performance in both daytime and nighttime conditions, and demonstrates wind resistance with satisfactory results when wind speeds are below 5 m s−1. These findings highlight the model's suitability for large-scale, practical deployment in urban environments. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using low-cost surveillance cameras to build an efficient SPT monitoring network, potentially enhancing urban precipitation observation capabilities in a cost-effective manner."

10.5194/essd-2025-428,True,Earth System Science Data Discussions,该研究论文主要关注欧洲道路交通排放，特别是氮氧化物（NOx）的排放情况。它通过结合道路信息和排放因子，创建了更详细的欧洲道路排放数据集，并与城市清单进行了比较。研究强调了现有CAMS-REG清单在城市中心低估排放的问题，并提出了改进方法，提高了空间分辨率和准确性。虽然没有直接提及遥感技术或卫星观测，但该研究产生的高分辨率排放数据对于空气质量监测和大气成分分析具有重要意义，可以作为模型输入或验证数据。,"['air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'NOx emissions', 'emission inventory', 'spatial distribution', 'urban emissions']",Tilman Leo Hohenberger;Marya el Malki;Antoon Visschedijk;Marc Guevara;Paul Ramacher;Alessandro Marongiu;Guido Giuseppe Lanzani;Giuseppe Fossati;Anu Kousa;Eleni Athanasopoulou;Anastasia Kakouri;Jeroen Kuenen,Link-based European road transport emissions for CAMS-REG v8.1 and a comparison to city inventories,"Spatial road transport emission data is fundamental for challenges of air pollution and climate change. In the existing European CAMS-REG inventory, several improvement opportunities exist, especially an underestimation in urban centers of ~35 %. We calculate emissions by combining gap-filled road information and emission factors, for the first time giving detailed emissions for most roads in Europe. With this, our dataset is much closer in line with independently combined city inventories. 
 Spatially resolved estimates of road transport emissions are fundamental for tackling challenges of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Emission estimates at 0.05° x 0.1° resolution are provided in the widely used CAMS-REG regional European emissions inventory. For the road transport sector, several improvement opportunities were identified: Firstly (1) an underestimation of ca. 35 % of NOx emissions in comparison to 8 independent urban inventories; secondly (2), artefacts in the spatial distribution in Eastern European non-EU countries; thirdly (3), the necessity of labour-intense downscaling methodologies to create high-resolution urban inventories from the fixed resolution dataset. To overcome these, emissions for all road links in the domain (n=59,710,490) were estimated using gap-filled activity data (AADT) from OpenStreetMap and OpenTransportMap. Gap filling was performed with random forest models trained on land-use and road information data. Model performance was R2: 0.63–0.74 and MAE(AADT): 1570–2028, with better performance for larger roads. Up-to-date emission factors were applied on road links using a novel maximum-speed–based classification. To generate the CAMS-REG v8.1 inventory, the resulting spatial distribution was used as a proxy map, together with national totals. The new dataset lowered the difference-to-city inventories to 19 % for absolute NOx emissions, and can be flexibly gridded to high resolutions. Median increase in urban emission share is 24 % compared to national totals, and non-EU cities see large increases (e.g. Istanbul, +197 %; St. Petersburg, +288 %) in attributed emissions due to the updated spatial distribution. Two case studies (London and Milan) show an increased spatial correlation, from R2 ≈ 0.3 using CAMS-REG v4.2 to R2 ≈ 0.6, with CAMS-REG v8.1 against the local inventory. Vector and gridded versions of the emission dataset and spatial distribution are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15688723 (Hohenberger et al. (2025))."

 As part of the new Fisheries Act, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) has made it a priority to disseminate its data publicly. The project proposed here is to create an open-access data product that includes most of the historical temperature and salinity profiles collected in Atlantic Canada and the Eastern Arctic. This project does not aim to replace a potential database, but rather provides an easily accessible and quality-controlled product that can inform fisheries management and support DFO priorities such as the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management, Marine Spatial Planning and the Blue Economy. The Canadian Atlantic Shelf Temperature-Salinity (CASTS) data product consists of 853,748 individual casts [as of 2025-08-22] collected in a geographical zone corresponding to [35–80° N] and [42–100° W] since 1873. The data sources used to make this product were gathered from multiple sources, including DFO regional archives at the Maurice-Lamontagne Institute (MLI), the Bedford Institute of Oceanography (BIO), and the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Center (NAFC). Other sources of data include the Marine Institute of Memorial University of Newfoundland, data from international ships of opportunity archived by the Marine Environmental Data Services (MEDS), and the Polar Data Catalog. This data product also offers new opportunities to review the changes in the ocean climate of Atlantic Canada, another priority of the Government of Canada. The analysis of these data collected over more than a century also reveals the profound changes undergone by the Northwest (NW) Atlantic Ocean during that period. Climate highlights include large decadal fluctuations of temperature and salinity throughout the entire zone, as well as sustained warming trends on the Scotian Shelf and the Bay of Fundy since the early 1990s, coinciding with an important freshening on the Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) Shelf during the same period.

Here we present the information‐theoretic causal analysis, the Liang‐Kleeman information flow, for quantifying the strength of soil moisture (SM) influence on surface air temperature (SAT). We revealed that SM exerts significant influence on SAT across monsoon regions, intricately linked to the seasonal monsoon cycle. Notably, prominent influence of SM on SAT was found, even under typical wet conditions in the tropics when intense solar radiation is present. Furthermore, this study highlights a strong connection between land desiccation and the occurrence of hot days in pre‐monsoon periods. The proposed measure of SM influence strength enhances our understanding of land–atmosphere interactions and provides new insights into seasonally evolving predictability arising from SM variability across monsoon systems."

In this study, we use remotely sensed data sets of ice surface velocity, ice surface elevation, ice discharge, and terminus position, in combination with modeled estimates of surface runoff and ocean thermal forcing, to explore variations in its ice dynamics between 2016 and 2024. Our results indicate that KBC functions as a self‐organizing system, whereby an underlying bedrock ridge serves as a critical pinning point around which it oscillates. Terminus retreat occurs when the glacier reaches a super‐critical state, with strong evidence for buoyancy‐driven calving observed. Whilst KBC is currently stabilized by the bedrock ridge, sustained thinning will eventually remove this critical control on ice flow, likely initiating a fundamental shift in ice dynamics and rendering KBC more susceptible to future climatic change."

This study delves into the seasonal distribution of stratocumulus clouds over the Norwegian Sea‐Barents Sea region and presents a conceptual model for the underlying mechanisms. In spring, autumn, and winter, increased surface water vapor flux provides water vapor from the sea surface. Concurrently, warm air enters the area through the southwest wind of the Norwegian Strait. Under conditions of unstable stratification, the water vapor is lifted to the condensation level, promoting the formation of stratocumulus clouds. Conversely, in summer, evaporation is suppressed due to stable stratification, which hinders vertical vapor transport. Enhanced dry advection reduces the transport of water vapor, leading to a decrease in the amount of stratocumulus clouds during summer.

We find that without the nonlinear atmospheric wind‐stress response to SST anomalies, ENSO exhibits stronger La Niñas than El Niños and negative skewness, contrary to observations, which is caused by oceanic nonlinearities. Only by incorporating the observed wind‐stress nonlinearities can the model reproduce the observed ENSO asymmetry, highlighting the atmosphere's critical role within this framework."

 Airborne mineral dust significantly influences Earth's climate through perturbing Earth's radiation budget, modulating cloud formation and microphysical properties, and fertilizing the biosphere. Recent field campaigns have revealed substantially more coarse-mode dust particles in the atmosphere than previously recognized, yet current satellite retrievals and climate models inadequately represent these particles. This study presents a novel retrieval algorithm for dust aerosol optical depth at 10 μm (AOD10μm) and effective diameter (Deff) using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) thermal infrared (TIR) observations over global land and ocean. Building upon the previous synergistic approach for MODIS and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), we improve the retrieval from CALIOP-track-limited coverage to full-swath MODIS observations at 10-km resolution over both ocean and land surfaces. The retrieval improvements include: (1) application of climatological CALIOP dust vertical profiles (2007–2017) to constrain dust vertical distribution for off-CALIOP-track pixels; (2) the improved optimization method to effectively handle non-monotonic cost functions arising from temperature inversions within the Saharan Air Layer; and (3) extension to land surfaces through incorporation of MODIS-retrieved surface emissivity and ERA5 reanalysis data. Validation against coarse-mode AOD from global AERONET (N = 4703) and MAN (N = 1673) observations yields R = 0.82 and 0.85 for AOD10μm, with retrieval uncertainty characterized as ε = 15 % × AOD + 0.04. The retrieved Deff demonstrates excellent agreement with in-situ measurements collected from 24 field campaigns around the globe (R = 0.84, MBE = 0.23 μm, RMSE = 0.73 μm), capturing the particle size variation from near-source regions (Deff = 7–8 μm) to long-range transport (Deff = 3–5 μm). Case studies of dust events over the Namibian coast and trans-Atlantic corridor demonstrate the retrieval's capability to resolve episodic dust properties and size-dependent deposition during transport. This improved retrieval addresses the critical observational gap for coarse and super-coarse dust particles (D > 5 μm), providing essential constraints for dust life cycle studies and climate model evaluation."

 Reliable tidal wetland maps are crucial for coastal monitoring. However, the inherent spatiotemporal variability and dynamic flooding patterns of tidal wetlands pose substantial challenges to conventional remote sensing classification approaches. While deep learning approaches show promise for accurate mapping when sufficient training data exist, large-scale applications face sample scarcity issues. In this paper, given the challenges posed by the complexity of tidal wetland formation and succession on sample quantity and quality, we propose a point-sample-driven tidal wetland mapping method based on debiased sampling and noise-resistant learning. Historical point samples are first converted into pixel-wise pseudo-labels to train a deep learning classifier. To alleviate sample selection bias, covariate statistical features are explicitly modeled, ensuring that the generated pseudo-labels better reflect the true spatial distribution of tidal wetlands. To mitigate semantic errors in pseudo-labels, confusion probabilities between tidal wetland categories are incorporated as prior knowledge, enabling the identification and suppression of label noise. The effectiveness of the proposed method was tested across the tidal regions of Asia, covering a coastline of approximately 3,800,000 km2 and achieving an extraction accuracy of 85 %. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms existing approaches, yielding substantial improvements in classification accuracy.

 Sea ice indices such as sea ice concentration (SIC) play a key role in monitoring climate change. However, it does not fully capture the vulnerability of sea ice to melting, especially under conditions of floe fragmentation. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel metric—the floe fragmentation index (FFI)—designed to quantify the degree of fragmentation of sea ice. We constructed the FFI reference map using high-resolution Sentinel-2 imagery based on k-means clustering and manual editing. This reference was then paired with AMSR2 passive microwave data to train three machine learning models—gradient boosting (GB), random forest (RF), and support vector regression (SVR)—enabling consistent, daily mapping of FFI across the Arctic. FFI increases as sea ice becomes more fragmented. Even under identical SIC conditions (e.g., 50%), the reference FFI captured distinct differences in floe structure, demonstrating its ability to represent fragmentation more explicitly than SIC. In comparison with the reference FFI derived from Sentinel-2, the gradient boosting model demonstrated the best performance, with an R2 exceeding 0.94 and a root mean square error (RMSE) below 0.22. Since RMSE was computed against the reference FFI, it is expressed in the same unit as FFI, which is dimensionless. To examine differences between SIC and FFI under relatively stable sea ice conditions, we focused on the Laptev Sea—a region where import and export of sea ice are minimal in summer. At the point of sea ice disappearance within this area, no early signs were observed in SIC, whereas FFI did reveal such signals. In particular, under conditions where the sea ice was highly fragmented and thus more likely to drift away or melt, SIC remained close to 100%, while FFI captured the relatively severe fragmentation of the sea ice. The time-series comparison between the FFI and SIC revealed that a rapid increase in FFI, highly exceeding its seasonal tendency, was followed by or occurred simultaneously with a rapid decrease in SIC, which also exceeded twice the magnitude of its seasonal tendency. Ultimately, the FFI complemented SIC by capturing fragmentation changes, potentially allowing earlier detection of SIC change in the melting seasons."

Pre-disaster community response variations were significantly associated with early warnings, typhoon track proximity, localized rainfall and wind intensity and historical typhoon experience, while recovery dynamic disparities were significantly predicted by rainfall, economic capacity (GDP) and road density. The results further revealed a significant spatial clustering pattern of community resilience that correlated with geographical location, disaster progression, and economic levels. Inland communities’ heightened sensitivity to disturbances, urban communities and towns that endured heavy rainfall demonstrated enhanced recovery capacity, and communities with lower economic status showed both higher sensitivity and lower recovery capacity. These findings provide valuable references for improving community resilience and optimizing disaster management strategies."

 Traditional manual inspections for urban water supply network leak detection face challenges such as high costs, low efficiency, and limited coverage. Microwave remote sensing technology, offering a wide detection range and high operational efficiency, has emerged as a promising approach for large-scale leakage detection. However, in complex urban environments, existing microwave-based methods often struggle to effectively extract distinctive features of leakage-induced anomalies, thereby limiting detection accuracy. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Multi-feature Deep Fusion Leakage Detection Network (MDFLD-Net) that integrates backscatter intensity, polarimetric decomposition, and closure phase features—complementary observables that mitigate surface disturbances and enhance sensitivity to leakage-related soil moisture anomalies. The network employs multi-scale feature extraction modules (MSFE) to hierarchically capture both local details and global semantic patterns, abnormal frequency extraction modules (AFE) to capture the key frequency-domain characteristics of leakage, and deformable convolution modules (DC) in the fusion stage to refine spatial adaptability. Experimental results show that MDFLD-Net achieves a leakage identification accuracy of 86.3%, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in leakage detection."

 Drought remains the most widespread and debilitating climate hazard in Africa, which threatens food safety and socio-ecological stability across the continent. Traditional drought monitoring systems, however, typically never register the dynamic evolution of drought episodes, which can extend between areas and amplify effects downstream. This study proposes a new Multivariate Drought Index Fusion (MDIF) that, apart from merging different drought indicators, mainly tracks the spatiotemporal trajectory of mobile drought fronts across Africa from 2000 to 2024. Avoiding the shortcomings of static drought maps, this approach offers a dynamic presentation of drought propagation patterns required for timely warning and management. Through the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), MDIF integrates multiple drought indicators, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Surface Temperature (LST), precipitation, Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), and Vegetation Health Index (VHI), into a fused, highly reliable, meteorological-ecological sensitivity drought index. The MDIF exhibited significant correlations with SPI-3 (r = 0.72–0.84), particularly across arid and semi-arid regions, and with VHI (r = 0.76–0.87), further underscoring its robustness in capturing both meteorological and ecological drought conditions. The findings indicate the Horn of Africa as a long-term drought hotbed, with severe events during 2006, 2011, 2017–2019, and 2022–2023, while Southern Africa experienced severe multi-year droughts from 2014 to 2017.

 Fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases) are widely used in refrigeration, air-conditioning, semiconductor, and other industries, contributing a total direct radiative forcing only surpassed by carbon dioxide and methane. Current modeling efforts of F-gases use simplified chemical schemes and ignore three-dimensional dynamics, which limits the quantification of their chemical impacts, and a full suite of F-gases is not currently included in atmospheric chemical transport models. Here, we develop and implement a chemistry module in the GEOS-Chem model with 27 additional F-gases (including minor CFCs, minor HCFCs, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3, and SO2F2) with constrained emissions. The updated simulations capture most of the surface mole fraction baseline trends and some pollution events for F-gases in 2020–2021, with a normalized mean bias between −14 % and 5 % at the Mace Head station and −17 % and 3 % at the ShangDianZi station. The impact of emission spatial distributions decreases with lifetime, suggesting that accurate global modeling of the background of long-lived species (>10 years) is less dependent on the spatial distribution of the emission than on the total magnitude. The impact of the updated simulation on key reactive species, including ozone, HOx, ClOx, and NOx, is <1 %. For species with 10-year lifetimes, F-gas chemical losses drive 20–40 % changes in their mixing ratios. Our work provides a comprehensive F-gases chemistry module complementing the major CFCs and HCFCs in the GEOS-Chem model, and this suite of F-gases provides potential applications for understanding their climate impacts and atmospheric processes."

 Atmospheric black carbon (BC) substantially influences on both regional environments and human health. Yet, research on BC in Central Asia remains scarce. Here, we report on a 3-year-long online BC monitoring campaign conducted in Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan. Our analysis delves into the seasonal and diurnal variations of BC, and its associated health risks. The results reveal an average atmospheric BC concentration of 3462 ± 3458 ng m−3 in Dushanbe, with a distinct seasonal pattern—concentrations peak in winter and are comparatively lower in spring and summer. BC displays a consistent diurnal variation at different season, marked by a pronounced double-peak phenomenon. Local emissions primarily drive the BC levels and variations in Dushanbe's atmosphere. Our health risk assessment indicates that BC exposure poses differential carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks to adults and children, with winter presenting significantly higher health risks than other seasons. Additionally, BC exposure can elevate mortality rates via multiple pathways. These findings underscore the severity of atmospheric BC pollution in Dushanbe and its heightened health risks to local inhabitants, particularly during winter.

 Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans (PCDD/Fs) are a very high-priority air pollutant group as they pose serious threats to human and environmental health. Most of the PCDD/F research studies have been carried out in urban and industrial areas where these pollutants are expected to be in high concentrations. There are few studies conducted in suburban areas worldwide, especially in Türkiye. In this study, a sampling campaign covering 12 months (June 2022–June 2023) was conducted in a suburban area in Bursa, Türkiye, to address this gap. The total average concentration was found to be 22.6 ± 3.21 fg I-TEQ/m3. This value was found to be comparable to the results reported for suburban and rural areas worldwide. The influence of the seasonal effect on concentrations was seen as a strong negative correlation (r = −0.84, p < 0.001) was observed between total concentration values and temperature. A negative correlation was found between low chlorinated congener gas phase concentrations and inverse ambient temperature using Clausius-Clapeyron.

 In the polar regions, sea ice and snowpack are strong natural emitters of halogen compounds, especially bromine. In those regions, tropospheric reactive bromine (BrOx = Br + BrO) is associated to ozone and mercury depletion events, playing a key role on the oxidizing capacity and radiative balance of the polar atmosphere. Despite the isolation of those regions, polar BrOx can be transported to lower latitudes, having the potential to also impact global chemistry. This study investigates tropospheric BrO at two research sites: Marambio (MAR; 64° 13′ S, 56° 37′ W) and Belgrano II (BEL; 77° 52′ S, 34° 7’ W). These stations sit in the surroundings of the Weddell Sea, a known hot-spot for bromine emissions in Antarctica.

 Accurate monitoring of atmospheric CO2 concentration and fluxes is essential for understanding carbon cycles and carbon budget assessments. This study utilized a coherent differential absorption lidar (CDIAL) system to conduct continuous, high-resolution vertical CO2 profiling in the coastal area of Shenzhen to elucidate its spatiotemporal distribution, the emission sources, and most importantly the dynamic interactions between CO2 and the planetary boundary layer (PBL). The results revealed anomalous CO2 accumulation within the 500–1200 m altitude and a stratified vertical gradient decreasing from planetary boundary layer (PBL) to the bottom, driven by temperature inversions and near-stagnant vertical mixing. This accumulation near the PBL enhances atmospheric heating, reduces surface heat flux, and suppresses PBL development, forming positive feedback that further inhibits pollutants diffusion. The results of the concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) analysis based on the hybrid single-particle Lagrangian integrated trajectory (HYSPLIT) model indicated that industrial, vehicular, and marine emissions were the primary sources of CO2. External contributions included long-range transport from northern inland regions (72 %) and short-range coastal transport (27 %), particularly in Dapeng Peninsula, Huishen Coastal Expressway, southern Huizhou, and Daya Bay.

 Surface air temperature and precipitation in glacial regions directly affect glacial physical processes and mass balance. Significant efforts have been made to explain the response of glaciers to climate change, but their impact on regional climate has been overlooked. In this study, temperature and precipitation trends between glacial and nonglacial regions of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 1979 to 2022 were compared using measured and reanalysis data, and the effects of glaciers on regional climate change were examined. The results are as follows: (1) The overall warming trend across the TP is 0.33 °C/decade, with glacial regions (0.30 °C/decade) exhibiting a slightly lower rate than nonglacial regions at similar elevations (0.32 °C/decade), particularly in summer. (2) The precipitation trend over the entire TP is 14.40 mm/decade, with values for glacial regions (11.75 mm/decade) exceeding those for nonglacial regions (10.90 mm/decade) at similar elevations. (3) The upward latent heat flux in glacial regions (9.82 W/m2) significantly exceeds that in nonglacial regions (9.12 W/m2), whereas the sensible heat flux in glacial regions (11.30 W/m2) is markedly lower than that in nonglacial regions (13.40 W/m2). Therefore, more energy is consumed in glacier ablation and the increase in ice temperature, further leading to a slower air temperature trend. (4) The glacier effect leads to stronger water vapour convergence in glacial regions, resulting in a greater precipitation trend in glacial regions than in nonglacial regions. However, enhanced glacier winds during summer lead to anomalous precipitation change characteristics in glacial regions. This study highlights the importance of considering glacier effects in regional climate studies."

 Rainfall is a vital component of the hydrological cycle, characterized by its variability. Research shows that factors such as wind influence the raindrop fall speed (vf), forcing deviations from theoretical estimates (vt). This study examines rainfall measurements collected using PWS100 disdrometers from 2015 to 2019 at two locations in Mexico (one near the Pacific coast and another in Central Mexico), focusing on how horizontal wind intensity (w, measured with a WindSonic4 anemometer) affects vf for raindrops with diameters (D) between 0.8 and 6 mm. Coastal data includes measurements collected during the passage of tropical cyclones over the sampling area. The data comparison between PWS100 and rain gauges when w > 10 m s−1 exhibits significant biases, underscoring instrumental limitations by wind distortion. Findings indicate that average vf decreases compared to vt as wind intensity increases, but these differences are not statistically significant. The statistical and post-hoc outcomes for the vf standard deviation, used as a proxy of vf dispersion, demonstrate that w significantly affects vf, with the effect growing stronger as w intensity increases. Further, the w effect also varies with raindrop size. Small raindrops (D < 1 mm) show both super-terminal and sub-terminal behavior, whereas mid-sized and large drops (D > 1 mm) predominantly exhibit sub-terminal behavior. At coastal sites, the wind impact is more pronounced due to the higher air density and the greater wind energy pushing over the raindrops. These outcomes support the need for further research to incorporate wind effects into numerical modeling and remote sensing instrumentation."

A key innovation of BRain-D compared to existing gridded datasets is its foundation on a strict automatic quality control procedure (A-QCP) designed to filter out Low-Quality (LQ) data based on the annual classification of records as either High-Quality (HQ) or Low-Quality (LQ). A confusion matrix was used to evaluate the method based on an independently assessed reference dataset in which 98.0 % of HQ series were identified. For application to Brain-D, approximately 14 % of LQ data records have been removed from the original dataset, with the remaining data interpolated to a regular grid. Cross-validation statistics revealed that BRain-D adequately represented daily rainfall, exhibiting Pearson's correlation coefficient (R) of 0.629, bias of 0.002 mm, root mean square error (RMSE) of 8.559 mm, and a critical success index (CSI) of 0.517. An analysis based on climatological normals from a Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology (INMET) dataset for two reference periods (1961–1990 and 1991–2020) confirmed that BRain-D spatially represented long-term precipitation well. This was evidenced by R values higher than 0.972, absolute bias smaller than 6.3 mm, and RMSE lower than 22.3 mm when monthly-averaged values were compared. The methodological improvements implemented in BRain-D minimise the propagation of systematic errors found in previous gridded datasets, thereby contributing to a more robust and representative spatialisation of rainfall in Brazil with many potential applications."

Analysis of space charge structures highlights the predominant acquisition of positive charges by graupel particles in the mixed-phase layer, driven by elevated cloud liquid water. By synthesizing observational data and model simulations, this study provides a detailed characterization of the event, emphasizing the dual roles of synoptic-scale disturbances and microphysical processes in driving the unseasonal extreme lightning event. The findings highlight the critical influence of Western Disturbances in modulating convective anomalies and highlight the need for advancements in forecasting capabilities and understanding of unseasonal weather phenomena to mitigate future risks."
