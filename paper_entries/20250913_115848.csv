10.5194/acp-25-10421-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究通过分析中国不同城市功能区（如居住区、商业区、工业区、交通区等）的空气质量数据，揭示了不同功能区对污染物空间分布的影响。研究发现，居住区和商业区的空气质量改善较为显著，而交通区的改善最小。工业区的空气质量季节性变化最大。此外，研究还关注了PM2.5、PM10和臭氧等主要污染物的浓度变化趋势，以及城市规模对空气质量的影响。这项研究强调了城市化与空气质量之间的密切关系，并建议制定针对不同功能区的空气质量策略。,"['air quality monitoring', 'pollutant concentration', 'PM2.5', 'PM10', 'ozone', 'spatial distribution of pollutants', 'seasonal variation', 'urban functional zones']",Lulu Yuan;Wenchao Han;Jiachen Meng;Yang Wang;Haojie Yu;Wenze Li,Uncovering the impact of urban functional zones on air quality in China,"This study utilizes multi-source data to reveal the impact of various urban functional zones in China on the spatial distribution of pollutants. The findings indicate that the residential and commercial zones see notable air quality gains, but the improvement of air quality in the transportation zone is the least considerable. Moreover, the industrial zone has the most seasonal air quality variation. Therefore, air pollution prevention policies should consider differences in functional zones. 
 This study presents a comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of air quality across various urban functional zones in China from 2017 to 2022, uncovering distinct impacts on air quality due to the unique characteristics of each zone. A general decrease in various pollutant concentrations is observed, a result of stringent pollution control policies. Specifically, the concentration of PM2.5 decreased from 46.1–30.6 µg m−3. Residential, commercial, and industrial zones show significant declines, whereas the transportation zone experiences the least decrease. However, ozone levels rebound significantly in densely populated residential and commercial zones and exhibit distinct weekend effects. The research highlights U-shaped seasonal patterns for five key pollutants and inverse seasonal patterns for ozone, which gradually decrease. Furthermore, the daily and seasonal variations of pollutant concentrations in the industrial zone are the largest, while those in the public management and service zone are the smallest. For example, the seasonal fluctuation of PM2.5 and PM10 in the industrial zone was 50.5 and 66.1 µg m−3, respectively. Urban scale has the most significant impact on public management and service zone. Notably, spatial heterogeneity is evident, with regional pollutant distributions linked to local emissions, control measures, urban morphology, and climate variability. This study emphasizes the critical link between urbanization and air quality, advocating for continuous monitoring and the development of zone-specific air quality strategies to ensure sustainable urban environments."
10.5194/acp-25-10403-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注二次冰晶生成（SIP）对强降水事件中云和降水性质的影响。它使用三维精细微物理模型，通过对比开启和关闭SIP机制，来评估SIP对云和降水特性的影响。研究结果表明，包含SIP能更好地与飞机观测数据吻合，生成小冰晶，并将凝结水质量重新分配到更小的粒子尺寸。虽然该研究与大气过程有关，但它更侧重于云微物理过程和降水机制，而不是直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['ice crystal number concentration', 'supercooled drop number fraction', 'secondary ice production', 'precipitation', 'cloud microphysics']",Pierre Grzegorczyk;Wolfram Wobrock;Aymeric Dziduch;Céline Planche,Influence of secondary ice production on cloud and rain properties: analysis of the HYMEX IOP7a heavy-precipitation event,"The impact of secondary ice production (SIP) on an intense-precipitation event is investigated using 3D bin microphysics. Including SIP improves agreement with in situ aircraft observations (ice crystal number concentration and supercooled drop number fraction), generates small ice crystals, and redistributes condensed water mass toward smaller particle sizes. As these crystals melt, the liquid precipitation flux decreases, reducing total precipitation by 8 % and heavy rainfall by 20 %. 
 A significant part of precipitation originates from ice crystals; however, the representation of mixed-phase clouds by atmospheric models remains a challenging task. One well-known problem is the discrepancy between the concentration of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) and the ice crystal number concentration. This study explores the effect of secondary ice production (SIP) on the properties of the Intensive Observation Period 7a (IOP7a), an intense-precipitation event observed during the  HYdrological Cycle in the Mediterranean EXperiment (HYMEX) campaign. The effect of SIP on cloud and rain properties is assessed by turning  SIP mechanisms in the DEtailed SCAvenging and Microphysics (DESCAM)  3D bin microphysics scheme on or off. Our results indicate that including SIP gives better agreement with in situ aircraft observations in terms of ice crystal number concentration and supercooled drop number fraction. During the mature cloud stage and for temperatures warmer than −30 °C, 59 % of ice crystals are produced by fragmentation due to ice–ice collisions, 38 % by the Hallett–Mossop process, 2 % by fragmentation of freezing drops, and only 1 % by heterogeneous ice nucleation. Furthermore, our results show that the production of small ice crystals by SIP induces a redistribution of the condensed water mass toward particles smaller than 3 mm rather than toward larger ones. As ice crystals melt, this effect is also visible in the precipitating liquid phase. The shift toward smaller particles results in a reduced precipitation flux of both ice crystals and drops. Consequently, SIP induces a decrease in accumulated precipitation at the surface by 8 % and reduces heavy rainfall exceeding 40 mm by 20 %."

The satellite data have good accuracy and precision for estimating emissions. A computer model showed that changes in methane levels are influenced more by background levels than by local sources. 
 Satellite observations of column-averaged carbon dioxide (XCO2) and methane (XCH4) mixing ratios provide essential data for monitoring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the accuracy of emission estimates depends on the precision and bias of satellite retrievals, which require validation against ground-based reference measurements. This study presents a systematic validation of XCO2 and XCH4 data from GOSAT (Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite) and OCO-2 (Oribiting Carbon Observatory-2) satellites over South India using ground-based Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) observations at Gadanki (13.5° N, 79.2° E) collected from October 2015 to July 2016. Satellite products from National Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan (NIES), NASA's Atmospheric CO2 Observations from Space (ACOS) project, USA (ACOS), and the University of Leicester, UK (UoL) were evaluated using a three-step spatial-temporal pairing method. Results show that the UoL's proxy XCH4 product meets the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) bias requirement (<10 ppb) across all spatial windows, while the NIES XCH4 product meets the requirement only for intermediate spatial scales. For XCO2, NASA ACOS and OCO-2 products meet the CCI bias requirement (<0.5 ppm), while NIES XCO2 exceeds this threshold. All products satisfy the precision requirement (<8 ppm for XCO2 and <34 ppb for XCH4) with substantial margins. In addition, FLEXPART model simulations using regional emission inventories revealed that agricultural activities dominate seasonal methane enhancements, contributing approximately 55 %, followed by waste and wetland emissions. The model captured seasonal trends but underestimated the amplitude of observed variations, highlighting the influence of changing background methane levels. These findings demonstrate the suitability of recent satellite products for regional GHG monitoring and emphasise the need for expanding ground-based FTS networks across South Asia to support improved emission assessments."

Millán;Matthew D. Lebsock;Marcin J. Kurowski,Retrieval simulations of a spaceborne differential absorption radar near  the 380 GHz water vapor line,"This study explores the potential of a hypothetical spaceborne radar to observe water vapor within clouds. 
 Differential Absorption Radar (DAR) is an emerging technique for high-resolution humidity profiling inside clouds and precipitation. This study evaluates the potential of using a spaceborne DAR operating near the 380 GHz water vapor absorption line to profile water vapor in the mid and upper troposphere, particularly inside deep convective systems. To quantify the expected precision and accuracy of DAR and to define optimal channel selection, we modeled radar reflectivities from large-eddy simulation fields  and then implemented retrievals using the simulated observations.End-to-end retrieval simulations across the 350–380 GHz range were used to identify optimal radar frequency triplets, minimizing precision and biases, at each altitude. While dual-frequency DAR systems can be susceptible to biases caused by range-dependent hydrometeor scattering, incorporating a third frequency allows for partial separation of water vapor extinction from the scattering and absorption effects of hydrometeors. Each optimum triplet included the most transparent frequency available, with the other two radar tones varying with altitude. At higher altitudes, the optimization identifies frequencies close to the line center, and the optimum frequencies move progressively away from the line  at lower altitudes.  Results show that single-pixel (horizontal resolution ≃ 400 m and vertical resolution =200 m) precision generally exceeds 100 %, with biases typically below 10 %.  Precision can be enhanced by averaging along the track. For instance, by optimizing the triplet selection, a precision of 0.01 gm−3 can be achieved by averaging over 50 km in anvil outflows with extensive cloud coverage. We note that the improvement may be less than expected in scenarios where cloud coverage is limited since the DAR technique only works in cloudy volumes.Lastly, we use real-world clouds observed by CloudSat to quantify global yield. Most radar tones examined here achieve a global sampling yield of over 95 % at their target altitude. When developing a DAR instrument, selecting the appropriate triplet is essential, taking into account the target altitude and cloud types intended for observation."

CLEAR utilizes a multiplicative random cascade generator to control the splitting of link segments. The evaluation performed both on virtual and real CML data shows that CLEAR outperforms a commonly used benchmark algorithm. Moreover, the stochastic nature of CLEAR allows it to represent uncertainty as an ensemble of rain rate distributions along CML paths. 
 A novel disaggregation algorithm for commercial microwave links (CMLs), named CLEAR (CML Segments with Equal Amounts of Rain), is proposed. CLEAR utilizes a multiplicative random cascade generator to control the splitting of link segments, with the generator's standard deviation dependent on the rain rate and segment length. Spatial consistency during the splitting process is maintained using rain rate information from neighboring CMLs. CLEAR is evaluated on a network of 77 CMLs in Prague. The performance is assessed first using simulated rainfall fields and second through a case study with real attenuation data from the network to demonstrate its applicability in real-world scenarios. Results from the virtual rainfall fields indicate good overall performance, including the generation of realistic spatial patterns and effective estimation of maximal and minimal rain rates along CML paths. The stochastic nature of CLEAR allows it to represent uncertainty as an ensemble of rain rate distributions along CML paths. However, the generated ensembles significantly underestimate overall variability along the paths. Additionally, the case study on real data highlights challenges associated with uncertainties in CML quantitative precipitation estimates, which are common across all methods. In conclusion, CLEAR contributes to generating more representative rainfall distributions along CMLs, which is critical for spatial reconstruction of rainfall fields from path-integrated CML data. It also has the potential to reduce errors in CML quantitative precipitation estimates caused by assuming uniform rain rates along CML paths."

The LHR employs balanced detection to measure tropospheric CO2 column concentrations. Simulations are validated against previously validated instruments. This work enhances greenhouse gas monitoring and supports campaigns for emissions studies and satellite validation. 
 In this study, heterodyne detection enables high spectral resolution, which in turn enhances the vertical sensitivity of ground-based CO2 measurements. The system's compact and portable design makes it particularly well-suited for deployment in field campaigns. An all-fiber coupled laser heterodyne radiometer (LHR), using a wideband tunable external cavity diode laser (1520–1580 nm) as local oscillator laser was developed for CO2 measurements. Optimal absorption lines and transmission spectra of the LHR was achieved by using a balanced photodetector to suppress the relative intensity noise of the local oscillator laser. This work aims to quantify how the LHR contributes to measuring tropospheric CO2 abundances in the atmospheric column from the ground. Here, we demonstrate the LHR's ability to measure CO2 vertical profiles through an extensive analysis of information content, channel selection, and error budget estimation. This comprehensive analysis relies on the radiative transfer model ARAHMIS, developed at the Laboratoire d'Optique Atmosphérique (LOA). Additionally, we present a comparison of the LHR with other ground-based instruments, such as the EM27/SUN and the IFS125HR from the TCCON network. Furthermore, this work supports ongoing MAGIC (Monitoring of Atmospheric composition and Greenhouse gases through multi-Instruments Campaigns) campaigns focused on greenhouse gas monitoring and the validation of current and future space missions such as MicroCarb and CO2M."

Bowler;Edmund K. Stone,Retrieving tropospheric refractivity structure using interferometry of aircraft radio transmissions,"Humidity observations are crucial for an accurate weather forecast. We propose a new way to measure humidity by measuring how radio signals from commercial aircraft are refracted by the atmosphere. Humidity affects the refractive index of air, allowing its presence to be detected. With thousands of flights in the airspace over the United Kingdom every day, there is the potential for a large increase in the number of humidity measurements for use in weather forecasting models. 
 Detailed measurements of atmospheric humidity in the lower atmosphere are currently difficult and expensive to obtain. For this reason, there is interest in the development of low-cost, high-volume opportunistic technologies to acquire measurements of tropospheric humidity. We demonstrate the use of interferometry to measure the atmospheric refraction of the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) radio transmission routinely broadcast by commercial aircraft. Atmospheric refraction is strongly influenced by changes in humidity, and refractivity observations have proved to be an effective source of humidity information for numerical weather prediction models. A prototype ADS-B interferometer has been developed that can simultaneously perform angle-of-arrival (AoA) interferometry and decode ADS-B signals. Combining the measured AoA of the ADS-B signal with the known position of the aircraft (information contained within the ADS-B signal) allows the bending of the signal due to refraction to be determined. Combining the measured bending of numerous ADS-B signals allows for information concerning the refractivity structure to be extracted. An adjoint model is derived and used to retrieve synthetic one-dimensional refractivity profiles in a variety of atmospheric conditions. The results from an experiment using a prototype ADS-B interferometer are shown, and initial refractivity profiles are retrieved. Sources of uncertainty in the observations and the retrieved refractivity profiles are explored, and future work is suggested."

A SeaExplorer glider has been deployed to supplement the data obtained during a series of oceanographic surveys. The glider performed a continuous monitoring over 30 months of the water column from the sea surface to 1250 m water depth, with the objective of acquiring the hydrological properties, water currents and dissolved gas concentrations. 
 In May 2018, an unprecedented long and intense seismo-volcanic crisis broke out off the island of Mayotte (Indian Ocean) and was associated with the birth of an underwater volcano (Fani Maoré). Since then, an integrated observation network has been created (REVOSIMA), with the objective of monitoring and better understanding underwater volcanic phenomena. Recently, an autonomous ocean glider (ALSEAMAR's SeaExplorer) was deployed to supplement the data obtained during a series of oceanographic surveys (MAYOBS) carried out on an annual basis. Operated by ALSEAMAR in collaboration with IFREMER, the glider performed a continuous monitoring of the water column, from the sea surface to 1250 m water depth, over 30 months between September 2021 and April 2024 with the objective of acquiring hydrological properties, water currents and dissolved gas concentrations. This monitoring showed the feasibility and value of measuring autonomously, continuously and at a high spatio-temporal scale the physical (temperature, salinity, ocean current) and biogeochemical parameters (O2, CH4, CO2, bubbles/droplets, vertical speed anomalies related to droplets) over several months using a glider. In particular, innovating sensing capabilities (e.g. MINICO2, acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP)) have shown great potential in the context of the Mayotte seismo-volcanic crisis despite technical challenges (complex algorithms, sensor capabilities, etc.).

It is derived from the geostrophic linear vorticity balance, combining in situ and satellite, meridional velocities and wind stress. Comparisons with reanalysis and observation-based products show that OLIV3 captures the large-scale vertical flow, its climatology, and temporal variability, providing a better description of the ocean interior than Ekman pumping. 
 Vertical velocities at large scales are crucial for understanding ocean dynamics, influencing large-scale circulation and associated biochemical processes, yet their rationale is poorly understood, and their three-dimensional distribution is almost unknown. This paper introduces OLIV3 (Observation-based LInear Vorticity Vertical Velocities), a novel observation-based estimation product of vertical velocities over the global thermocline. This product relies on the geostrophic linear vorticity balance (LVB) applied to ARMOR3D observation-based meridional velocities with ERA5 Ekman pumping vertical velocity as surface boundary condition. It covers the entire water column, with 1/4° horizontal resolution at annual frequency during the 1993 – 2019 period, available on both depth and isopycnal levels. Since the geostrophic LVB-derived vertical velocities only capture the geostrophic component of the vertical velocity, their performance is tested using an OGCM numerical model data against the total vertical flow. In the upper ocean, the LVB accurately reproduces the annual variability and captures the climatology of the large-scale total vertical flow (for scales larger than 5° horizontal resolution) with errors below 50 % across the major ocean gyres. OLIV3 capability to estimate vertical velocities in different ocean circulation regimes is assessed against three reference datasets: two reanalysis-based and one observation-based product. A strong spatial and temporal correlation is evidenced between OLIV3 and reanalysis datasets, in contrast to the observation-based product, demonstrating even higher correlation than within themselves and proving that while the geostrophic components of the reanalyses are highly correlated, the ageostrophic part is not. OLIV3 also reconstructs a baroclinic vertical velocity field, consistent with the basin oceanographic concept of Sverdrup balance theory. Regarding one of the most common applications of vertical velocities, the transfers between the surface and thermocline, results from an OGCM simulation show that the baroclinic geostrophic vertical velocity is a better estimator of the temporal variability of the vertical flow in the ocean interior than Ekman pumping, and it is essential to consider the variability of the horizontal transport. The OLIV3 dataset developed in this study is available on 50 vertical levels (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16981061; Cortés-Morales and Lazar, 2025a) and 71 isopycnal levels (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16962780; Cortés-Morales and Lazar, 2025b)."

Data quality is significantly improved through integration. The integrated dataset is now publicly available for easy access and use by the academic community and the public. These datasets are of great significance for optimizing historical geomagnetic field models and investigating changing magnetic fields, the main geomagnetic field. 
 Decades to centuries of continuous geomagnetic observation data have extensive scientific research and practical application value, especially in revealing the long-term variation of the geomagnetic field, which is irreplaceable. During the International Geophysical Year (1957–1958), China established geomagnetic observatories in Beijing, Lhasa, Lanzhou, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Changchun, and Ürümqi, forming the initial structure of China's geomagnetic observation network together with the Shanghai Observatory. These observatories have continuously been in operation despite facing many challenges since their establishment, accumulating a large amount of valuable observational data, making significant contributions to the progress of geomagnetic scientific research and development. However, the scattered storage state of these historical data and the potential risk of damage pose a threat to the integrity and reliability of the data. This study conducted a rescue integration of the historical observational data from eight pioneering geomagnetic observatories in China, significantly improving data quality and facilitating long-term preservation and use of the data. This article introduces the basic conditions of eight observatories, including their locations, changes in location, observation environments, magnetic rooms, the magnetism of building materials, the layout of building facilities, measuring instruments, etc. These are the main prerequisites and foundations for ensuring the quality of observation data. Then, it introduces the integration and processing of historical data, including data collection, digitization, unification of formats, anomaly detection, and processing. Subsequently, the processed data were validated, including assessments of daily variations accuracy and long-term stability. The results show that the quality of the integrated historical data has been significantly improved. These datasets are of great value for improving historical geomagnetic field models, studying variable fields, main geomagnetic fields, and their long-term variations. Finally, we applied the data to the analysis and research of Sq and geomagnetic jerks, exploring the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of Sq and jerk in the China. Sq is mainly a daytime phenomenon, and its variation pattern in the middle- and low-latitude regions is mainly characterized by its dependence on latitude and local time. The geomagnetic jerk phenomenon exhibits significant regional differences and asynchronous occurrence times of jerks. Jerk events in 1969, 1979, 1991, 2003, and 2019 were observed at all observatories and had distinct jerk variation characteristics. Other jerks were only observed at some observatories or individual observatories. The maximum time difference for the occurrence of the same jerk event at different observatories was 2 years. This study aims to provide these precious datasets to the scientific community and the public so that these data can be integrated with data from other sources, thereby further exploring the spatiotemporal evolution and physical mechanisms of the geomagnetic field. The historical datasets of the eight geomagnetic observatories that have been integrated and quality-controlled are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15481895 (Zhang et al., 2025)."

Such measurements are key inputs for models that estimate how much ice is stored on the whole mountain range scale and for models that predict how this ice reserve will change in future, and what impact this will have on water supply for the large populations living downstream. 
 Mountain glaciers provide an important service in sustaining river flows for large populations downstream of High Mountain Asia (HMA) but these glaciers are retreating and the future of this water resource is highly uncertain. Glacier thickness measurements are vital for accurate mapping of the remaining ice reserve and for predicting where and how fast it will decline under climate change, but such measurements are severely lacking in this region due to the difficulties of surveying in remote, high-altitude settings. We report on a uniquely extensive new thickness dataset for eleven glaciers in the Khumbu Himal around Mount Everest that we collected in late 2019 using a novel, low-frequency helicopter-borne radar. To aid in interpreting the survey radargrams we developed a terrain clutter model, and we succeeded in mapping ice thickness with a precision of around ±7 % and horizontal spacing of around 40 m, for thicknesses of up to 445 m and spanning a total of 119 line-km, approximately doubling the length of previous thickness surveys in HMA. To demonstrate the utility of our new measurements, we compare them to existing modelled thickness products and find that the models struggle to reproduce the distribution of ice in these complex, steep, rapidly slowing, thinning and stagnating glaciers, with widespread systematic thin and thick biases equivalent to around half of the measured ice thickness or more. This new dataset (https://doi.org/10.5285/e39647f5-fb72-4d16-acbd-9784ed2167b8) permits for the first time a detailed analysis of model performance on Himalayan glaciers, a key step in improving model skill and hence the accuracy of modelled thickness distributions and future ice loss on the mountain-range scale."

By assimilating satellite data into a chemistry–climate model, it provides hourly to three-hourly fields of meteorology, air quality, and snow-related variables. Evaluations show good agreement with observations, and source attribution of black carbon is also provided to quantify pollution pathways to Asia’s glaciers, major freshwater source for over a billion people. 
 We present MATCHA (Model for Atmospheric Transport and Chemistry in Asia), a 17-year (2003–2019) regional hydroclimate-chemical reanalysis for Asia (58° – 140° E, 4° – 40° N) at 12 km resolution that is based on the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem), Community Land Model (CLM), and SNow, ICe and Aerosol Radiative (SNICAR) model as well as satellite data assimilation to explicitly represent interactions between key atmospheric composition and regional hydroclimate (including aerosol-snowpack interactions) across High Mountain Asia (HMA). Approximately two decades of satellite observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and carbon monoxide (CO) profiles from the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) were assimilated every three hours into WRF-Chem to further constrain the representation of aerosols and chemistry. MATCHA provides comprehensive outputs across different light-absorbing aerosol species, e.g., black carbon (BC), dust, and brown carbon (BrC), trace gases, and a range of meteorological, hydrological, and land-surface variables over the region. This paper describes the MATCHA coupled modeling and data assimilation framework and evaluates 12 key variables across aerosols (fine particulate matter (PM2.5/PM10), AOD, single scattering albedo (SSA), and surface BC concentration), trace gases (surface CO), meteorology (precipitation, planetary boundary layer height (PBLH), temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed), and hydrology (snow cover fraction) against available in-situ and satellite observations across Asia. Meteorological fields (surface and vertical profiles) are consistently well-reproduced with Kling-Gupta efficiencies (KGEs) ranging from 0.65 to 1. Notable issues include persistent cold and dry bias over high-elevation regions in winter, with stronger-than-observed surface winds. Snow cover fraction seasonality is well captured with slight underestimation during snowmelt seasons across major glacier regions. Daily accumulated precipitation estimates agree with satellite observations, particularly with the best KGE (0.6) during the monsoon season, albeit underestimated over high-elevation regions. The diurnal and seasonal evolution of PBLH is well-represented, with biases reflecting shallower heights in the morning and deeper heights in the afternoon in summer, likely due to model parameterizations and resolution limitations. MATCHA also captures the spatial and seasonal variability of AOD and SSA at 550 nm, yet overestimates summer AOD over India and southeast Asia with a strong negative bias in SSA. Biases in PM2.5/PM10 are also higher, which appears to be particularly related to high biases in wind speeds, causing overestimation of natural emissions of aerosols and overestimation of anthropogenic emissions. Comparisons with site-specific aerosol chemical composition derived from air samples at Kanpur confirm the positive bias in sea salt concentrations and lower carbonaceous aerosols during high pollution events. MATCHA captures the seasonal cycle of surface CO, but underestimates the observations, which can be attributed to the assimilation of CO profiles from MOPITT. A unique feature of MATCHA is its tagged-tracers of BC for sectoral and regional source attribution analysis. These tracers show anthropogenic BC peaking in winter, primarily from Chinese sources in the eastern and northern part of HMA, and Indian sources in western and central HMA. Biomass burning BC dominates during March–April along with substantial trans-boundary inflow throughout the year. BC emissions from Pakistan and Nepal also contribute significantly to the anthropogenic column burden of BC in parts of HMA. MATCHA is the first-of-its-kind high-resolution reanalysis to fully couple aerosols, radiation, and snow processes over HMA, offering a valuable dataset for investigating aerosol–cryosphere feedbacks and informing emission mitigation strategies in Asia. The dataset consists of hourly surface and column-integrated products and 3-hourly three-dimensional fields, and is publicly available at DOI: 10.5067/CG4OT8DJX2Z7."

 We introduce FACA – Fully Automated Co-Alignment, an open-source software program designed to fully automate the workflow for co-aligning point clouds derived from unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) images using photogrammetry. We developed FACA to efficiently evaluate fieldwork with UAVs on landslides and coastal dynamics. The software applies to any research requiring comparative, precise, and rapid multi-temporal point cloud generation from UAV imagery. Unoccupied aerial vehicles are an essential element in most contemporary applied geosciences research toolkits. Typical products of UAV flights are point clouds created with photogrammetry, which are used to measure objects and their change if multi-temporal data exists. Ground control points (GCPs) are considered the best method to increase the precision and accuracy of point clouds, but placing and measuring them is not always feasible during fieldwork. Co-alignment leads to the local precise alignment of multiple point clouds without GCPs. Fully Automated Co-Alignment uses Agisoft Metashape Pro and the Python standard library. The GPLv3 licensed FACA source code focuses on extendability, modifiability, and readability. Our software works interchangeably from the command line or a custom graphical user interface. We distribute the software with both usage and installation instructions. Three multi-temporal test datasets are available.

 We present the second generation of ROCKE-3D (Resolving Orbital and Climate Keys of Earth and Extraterrestrial Environments with Dynamics), a generalized three-dimensional general circulation model (GCM) for use in Solar System and exoplanetary simulations of rocky planet climates. ROCKE-3D version 2.0 is a descendant of ModelE2.1, the flagship Earth system model of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) used in the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments. ROCKE-3D is a continuous effort to expand the capabilities of GISS ModelE to handle a broader range of planetary conditions, including different atmospheric planet sizes, gravities, pressures, and rotation rates; more diverse chemistry schemes and atmospheric compositions; diverse ocean and land distributions and topographies; and potential basic biosphere functions. In this release we present updated physics and many more supported configurations which can serve as starting points to simulate the atmospheres of rocky terrestrial planets of interest. Two different radiation schemes are supported, the GISS radiation, valid only for atmospheres similar to that of modern Earth, and SOCRATES, which is more generalized but more computationally expensive. While ROCKE-3D can simulate a very wide range of planetary and atmospheric configurations, we describe here a small subset of them, with the goal of demonstrating the structural capabilities, rather than the scientific breadth, of the model. Three different atmospheric composition options (preindustrial Earth, the aerosol-free and ozone-free atmosphere used in ROCKE-3D 1.0, and an anoxic atmosphere with no aerosols), three ocean configurations (prescribed, Q-flux, and dynamic), and two resolutions are described: the medium resolution (4×5° in latitude and longitude, previously used in ROCKE-3D 1.0) and the fine resolution, which has double the resolution in the atmosphere and 4 times the horizontal and 3 times the vertical resolution in the ocean. Finally, for the land surface hydrology, we have introduced generalized physics for arbitrary topography in the pooling and evaporation of water and river transport of water between grid cells, as well as for the vertical stratification of temperature in dynamic lakes. We quantify how the different component choices affect model results and discuss the strengths and limitations of using each component, together with how one can select which component to use.

However, this strategy often results in the aggregation of OV clusters, a phenomenon that has been largely overlooked in previous studies, despite its pronounced impact on catalytic performance. Herein, we demonstrate that the size of OV clusters governs the volcano-shaped dependence of catalytic activity for toluene oxidation under humid conditions. Experimental results and DFT calculations reveal that variations in OV cluster size significantly modulate H2O activation. In particular, dimer OV clusters promote rapid electron transfer and exhibit the lowest energy barrier for H2O dissociation, facilitating the formation of OH species. These OH species not only enhance the adsorption of toluene and intermediates but also act as reactive oxygen species that directly participate in the oxidation pathway, thereby improving toluene combustion under humid conditions. Consequently, MnO2-M with dimer OV clusters exhibits the highest activity (T90 = 222 °C) in the presence of 5 vol % H2O. This work provides new insights into the size-dependent effects of OV clusters and contributes to the rational design of high-performance catalysts based on OV engineering."

Although the energy efficiency for water evaporation is approaching 100%, the yield of clean liquid water still remains at a relatively low level, primarily due to inefficient condensation driving force and unstable light absorbance caused by uncondensed fog droplets. Here, we present a wavelength-anisotropic conductive interface solar distillation system (WADS) that fundamentally redefines energy flow management. By spectrally decoupling solar absorption (0.2–2.5 μm) from thermal radiation (8–13 μm), WADS achieves the simultaneous enhancement of photothermal conversion and passive radiative cooling. This dual-mode operation enables directional energy transport─sunlight influx through transparent channels and heat dissipation via high-emissivity nanostructures─establishing a self-sustaining thermal gradient that amplifies condensation kinetics while suppressing light scattering. Based on the above design, the clean liquid water production with 3D photothermal component reached 4.03 kg·m–2·h–1 under 1 sun, representing a 10-fold improvement over conventional SID, with nighttime production (0.75 kg·m–2·h–1) through continuous radiative cooling. Beyond desalination, WADS demonstrates a synergistic resource recovery from brines, enabling efficient mineral preconcentration.

The development of sorbents with both high capacity and stability, particularly under ambient conditions, remains a critical challenge. Herein, we report a novel multivariate (MTV) metal–organic framework (MOF), MUV-102(Cu–Ti), engineered through precise integration of heterometallic Cu(2-δ)+-Ti4+ clusters, which demonstrates exceptional NH3 adsorption performance and reversible stability under both low and high concentrations. Under static exposure to 100 ppm of NH3, MUV-102(Cu–Ti) achieves 3.9 mmol g–1 uptake, while at dynamic equilibrium (1 bar), it reaches 22.4 mmol g–1, surpassing monometallic and other heterobimetallic titanium-based analogs (Co, Ni, Zn, Mn), ranking among the top in current record of MOFs. The framework retains its integrity and adsorption capacity after nine adsorption–desorption cycles. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the heterometallic Cu(2-δ)+-Ti4+ unit enhances thermodynamic stability by strengthening metal–ligand (M–L) bonds and dynamically modulating Lewis acidic sites to generate abundant open metal sites (OMS) for NH3 molecules.

We show that the uncatalyzed sulfite oxidation is size-dependent across varying O2 concentrations and temperatures. Reaction rates scale with the surface-area to volume ratio (1/radius) of the microdroplet. We use a resistor-based approach to model multiphase mass transfer and reactions in the experimental system, confirming that the observed size-dependent kinetics reflect slow bulk kinetics coupled with an efficient reaction at the interface─k2 = 9.43 × 10–3 (+2.26 × 10–3/–2.38 × 10–3) M–1 s–1, γs,0 = 9.27 × 10–10 (+9.30 × 10–11/–1.70 × 10–10) at 298 K and 21% O2.

While geothermal brines are a rich source of lithium ions (Li+), they also have high concentrations of coexisting constituents, including Fe(II), Mn(II), and silica, which can form scaling layers on the electrode surface, thus presenting substantial challenges for Li+ extraction. This study systematically investigates the effects of Fe(II), Mn(II), and silica on Li+ extraction by lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4, LFP) electrodes and the mechanisms underlying performance degradation. Through cycling experiments in impurity-laden solutions, we demonstrate that Fe(II) severely compromises LFP electrode performance, reducing capacity, Faradaic efficiency, and Li+/Na+ selectivity. This performance degradation is attributed to the formation of an iron (hydr)oxide scaling layer and the bonding of Fe2+ ions with oxygen atoms in the LFP lattice, leading to accelerated reconstruction of the crystal structure. In contrast, Mn(II) and silica cause minimal performance loss despite contributing to scaling. Finally, we propose a cost-effective pretreatment method to remove Fe(II) from geothermal brines, extending the LFP electrode lifespan while maintaining high Li+/Na+ selectivity.

Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis in the Pearl River Estuary, a globally representative urbanized estuary, by integrating multidimensional data sets including environmental DNA (eDNA) and traditional plankton monitoring, species functional traits, biomass and water quality. Our findings reveal pronounced community reassembly under hypoxic conditions, characterized by increases in pollution-tolerant and invasive taxa, and concurrent declines of sensitive taxa. While α-diversity increased significantly across all taxonomic groups (median increased 35%–65%), β-diversity declined, indicating community homogenization to some extent under hypoxia stress. The complexity of organismal networks declined under hypoxia, with decreases of 12%–30% in node number, average degree, and clustering coefficient, and a >70% loss of fish nodes; microbial taxa increasingly occupied central network positions. Structural equation modeling identified that hypoxia disrupted internal regulatory pathways, shifting the system from biodiversity-driven top-down control to bottom-up dominance, effectively decoupling biodiversity from ecosystem functions.

We applied a machine learning (ML) model to a multi-year PNC data set collected near Boston Logan International Airport, incorporating meteorology, road traffic, and runway-specific aircraft activity. We used SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), a game-theoretic method that attributes feature contributions to model predictions, to interpret the black box ensemble ML model. SHAP enabled hourly source attribution, revealing feature interactions and nonlinear effects often missed by traditional tools (e.g., linear regression). The model performed well (R2 = 0.66), exceeding typical hourly PNC models. SHAP results revealed that aircraft arrivals, particularly those on runways oriented perpendicular to the monitor–airport axis, were more influential than departures or on-ground airport activity. This suggests that aircraft not flying directly overhead can substantially impact ground-level air quality due to crosswinds. SHAP analysis further indicated that aircraft impacts depended on planetary boundary layer height, with intermediate heights associated with elevated PNC. This approach provides a novel and transferable framework for retrospective source-specific exposure assessment and improved characterization of aviation-related UFP in near-airport communities."

Accurate DBP analysis requires quenching of residual disinfectants and pH adjustment. Ascorbic acid (AA) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) are commonly used for these purposes, particularly for organic DBPs, yet no standardized guidance exists on their use. This study evaluated the impact of AA and H2SO4 premixing on the quenching of DBP samples under both controlled laboratory and field sampling conditions. Results showed premixing of these reagents prior to sampling substantially increased the formation of haloacetaldehydes (HALs), particularly dichloroacetaldehyde (DCAL) and trichloroacetaldehyde (TCAL) under chlorination, due to acid-catalyzed degradation of AA and subsequent formation of reactive aldehydic intermediates. This effect is magnified in the presence of elevated bromide, leading to higher levels of brominated HALs that are among the most cytotoxic DBPs. Field data from four treatment plants confirmed the laboratory findings and demonstrated that premixing introduced substantial bias into HAL measurements. To prevent overestimation of DBP levels, premixing of AA and H2SO4 should be avoided; AA should be added at the time of sampling, followed immediately by pH adjustment with H2SO4."

This study found that dust backflow increased PM’s OP and EPFRs concentrations to 9.7- and 4.2-fold of original dust levels. Dust backflow PM was strongly associated with nonaccidental hospitalizations (0.85%, 95% CIs: 0.50%, 1.21%) with each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10. During the original dust stage, OP and EPFRs, primarily dominated by PM10, mainly originate from the physical migration of natural mineral components (e.g., metal oxides) in the dust, with their oxidative activity linked to coarse PM’s transport. However, during dust backflow, PM2.5 becomes the main carrier of OP and EPFRs, and their concentration surge is attributed to the mixing of dust with anthropogenic pollutants (such as sulfates and nitrates) during long-distance transport. Meteorological factors such as rising temperatures and weak winds enhance oxidation reactions, leading to redox-active substance accumulation. This study is the first to reveal the characteristics and health risks of dust backflow PM through natural-anthropogenic synergy, providing a scientific basis for health risk warnings about dust pollution and the coordinated control of fine PM during dust backflow."

We performed combustion experiments using fuel beds representative of three ecoregions in the Southeastern U.S. and varied the fuel-bed moisture content to simulate either prescribed fires (Rx) or drought-induced wildfires (Wild). We used fire radiative energy normalized by fuel-bed mass (FREnorm) as a proxy for combustion conditions. For fuel beds that contained surface fuels only, the higher moisture content in Rx led to lower FREnorm compared to Wild and consequently led to lower EC emissions, but higher OC emissions and SOC formation. For fuel beds that contained duff in addition to surface fuels, duff did not ignite in Rx because of the high moisture content. However, duff ignited in Wild, leading to prolonged smoldering and substantially lower FREnorm in Wild compared to Rx. Consequently, OC emissions and SOC formation were an order of magnitude higher in Wild compared to Rx for the duff-containing fuel beds. These findings indicate that characterizing fuel availability and variability in combustion conditions, which emerges from variability in fuel-bed composition and environmental conditions, is crucial for determining carbonaceous aerosol formation in wildland fires."

A source apportionment study was performed to investigate the impacts of high temperatures on atmospheric ozone and oxidative capacity formation from changing VOC emissions utilizing hourly VOC data from June to October 2023 in Qingdao, China. The results suggested that the biogenic emission contributions to the consumed VOCs increased with increasing temperature, especially for temperatures above 30 °C. Their contributions to the consumed VOCs increased substantially. The contribution concentration and proportion of the consumed VOCs increased by 73% and 77%, respectively, for every 5 °C increase in temperatures. The consumed biogenic VOCs’ ozone formation potential value and proportion increased by 82% and 83%, respectively. A mixed gasoline vehicle emission and gasoline evaporation sources showed a small increase. Most other source contributions to the consumed VOCs did not change substantially with the temperature. However, the contributions of solvent usage to the consumed VOCs decreased with rising temperatures. Its contributions decreased substantially when temperature was above 25 °C, likely due to the substantial reduction in human activities such as motor-vehicle spray painting at high ambient temperatures."

Fu;Li Li,"Amplification of Surface Ozone by the Aerosol Direct Effect under COVID-19 Lockdown in Shanghai, China","Elevated surface ozone (O3) concentrations present substantial risks to public health, ecosystem productivity, and global climate change. Shanghai implemented a citywide lockdown to control the spread of COVID-19 during April to May of 2022, leading to substantial reduction in air pollutant emissions. The surface O3 concentrations, however, increased by 3–10 ppb compared to 2021 in most areas of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region. This phenomenon presented a unique real-world experiment on air pollution management. Here, we integrate observational data and two-way online meteorology–air quality modeling to investigate the causes of this unexpected O3 increase, with a focus on elaborating the interaction between the aerosol direct effect (ADE) and O3 formation. Results showed that aerosol loading suppressed early morning vertical mixing, enhancing photochemical reactivity below the boundary layer and delaying upward O3 transport. This ADE contributed an average 10.8 ppb increase in O3 concentrations during pollution episodes (O3 concentration >100 ppb), with emission-reduction-induced ADE raising O3 by 6.2 ppb in Shanghai and 3.5 ppb in Jiangsu. In addition, vertical transport contributed to −4 ± 1 ppb changes in O3, although the surface meteorological conditions in Shanghai were favorable for O3 photochemical formation. In contrast, meteorology dominated the O3 increase (5 ± 3 ppb) in northwestern YRD. The lockdown caused a 10% higher reduction in nitrogen oxides than volatile organic compounds, leading to O3 increases of 9 ± 1 ppb in Shanghai and 5 ± 2 ppb in southern Jiangsu. These findings highlight the risk of O3 increases resulting from imbalanced changes in the precursors, aerosols, and meteorology. We suggest taking into consideration the effect of aggregation of O3 by ADE when designing air quality management strategies."

Real-time measurements of NPs are still limited, preventing an in-depth understanding of the dynamics of their emission and formation. In this study, we used a Vocus proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS) to quantify gaseous NPs and related aromatic compounds. Calibrations using a permeation-tube method showed that NPs, phenols, and nitroaromatics had protonated ions as the dominating ion, except for 3-methyl-2-nitrophenol. The combined effect of the methyl, nitro, and phenolic functional groups in this compound may lead to its steady fragmentation (dehydration) in the PTR-ToF-MS. The 5-s limits of detection (LODs) of these nitrated and/or oxygenated aromatic species ranged from 0.0001 to 0.0015 ppbv, demonstrating the capability of PTR-ToF-MS in the quantification of these compounds. In a campaign conducted in a coastal urban area in South China (Macau), NPs had average concentrations of 0.005 to 0.016 ppbv, lower than most reported concentrations in other urban areas. In addition to possible primary sources such as burning of coal or biomass in some periods, secondary formation of NPs was revealed to be limited by the availability of NO2 and could outweigh photolysis loss.

While they are generally not classified as persistent organic pollutants due to their relatively rapid metabolism and urinary excretion, a fraction can accumulate in tissues, including the adipose. This bioaccumulation raises concerns about the potential for prolonged endocrine disruption and chronic toxicity. This study investigated the distribution and accumulation of nine BPs in human blood, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). By comparing the detection rates and concentrations of BPs in paired blood and adipose samples, we found that certain BPs (particularly BPF, BPE, and BPA-G) exhibit preferential accumulation in adipose tissues. The accumulation propensity was slightly higher in SAT than in VAT. Correlation analysis revealed that the sources of the same BP in VAT and SAT were highly consistent, whereas most BPs in adipose tissues had significantly different sources compared with those in blood. Further analysis suggested that age and obesity might be key factors influencing the differential accumulation of BPs in adipose tissues. Since accumulated BPs can be slowly or substantially released during lipolysis, our findings highlight that the adipose tissue reservoir of BPs may play an important role in their long-term toxic effects."

By analyzing marine temperature records spanning the past 10 million years with a regression‐based technique that removes temporal dimensions, we extract long‐term ocean warming patterns and quantify relative sea surface temperature changes across the global ocean. This analysis revealed a distinct pattern of amplified warming that aligns with equilibrated model simulations under high CO2 conditions, yet differs from the transient warming pattern observed over the past 160 years. This paleodata‐model comparison allows us to identify models that better capture fundamental aspects of Earth's warming response, while suggesting how ocean heat uptake and circulation changes modify the development of warming patterns over time.

An increasing number of flood insurance programs have been using observable proxies—or indices—to activate payouts. However, convincing evaluation of important design features, including choice of index data, are lacking. This study investigates five potential flood data sets at national and regional scales in a simulated index‐based insurance program in Bangladesh: gridded precipitation, river‐height and modeled inundation from the national flood agency, and two satellite data sets of surface‐water‐extent (one state‐of‐practice, the other state‐of‐the‐art). We demonstrate that data choice determines the accuracy and timeliness of indexed payouts, as well as the uncertainty associated with their likelihood, which influences program costs. For example, while river‐height and satellite water‐extent indices activated payouts during the two worst floods in the 20‐year study period (2004 and 2007), the precipitation‐index activated for just one of them. Furthermore, our state‐of‐the‐art satellite index activated on average 1 week earlier and with 21% lower uncertainty than the satellite‐index used in practice. We propose that practitioners leverage the divergence‐of‐evidence among multiple data sets to identify regions where there is lower confidence in making accurate and timely payouts, which can help inform additional programming such as back‐up payout mechanisms. Beyond insights for practitioners leveraging insurance to protect Bangladeshi communities threatened by extreme monsoon floods, this work offers techniques to assess the sensitivity of indexed programs to different data and scales in other flood‐prone regions."

 Earth’s lowermost mantle harbours two large low-velocity provinces with patches of ultralow-velocity zones. These seismic anomalies may retain geochemical signatures distinct from the surrounding mantle. Yet, their origin remains enigmatic. One proposed explanation is the differentiation of an early-formed basal magma ocean. However, the presence of an excessively thick layer of iron-rich ferropericlase in the crystallized basal magma ocean conflicts with seismic tomography models. Here we use combined thermodynamic and geodynamic modelling to investigate the crystallization of a basal magma ocean continuously contaminated by oxide exsolved from the core, termed the basal exsolution contaminated magma ocean. We find suppression of ferropericlase crystallization. Geodynamic modelling demonstrates that the solidified contaminated magma ocean mantle can lead to the formation of deep mantle structures consistent with large low-velocity provinces and ultralow-velocity zones. In addition, diapirs of core exsolution entrained into the solid mantle may cause small-scale scattering. The basal exsolution contaminated magma ocean inherits the silicon, tungsten and helium isotope compositions from the core and exhibits trace element enrichments, suggesting its possible role as a source material for ocean island basalts that may sample the large low-velocity provinces, pointing to a unified mechanism for forming deep mantle heterogeneities.

Here, the authors report that asymmetric Pt coordination enables a strong synergy between single-atom sites and nanoparticles, delivering efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production. 
 Integrating distinct functional reaction sites within a single photocatalyst offers a promising approach for enhancing the photocatalytic H2 evolution by water splitting. However, the synergy between the dual active sites is hindered by suboptimal electronic states arising from the uniform coordination environments. Here we demonstrate a strategy for enhancing the synergy between Pt single atoms and nanoparticles by modulating the coordination environment. The optimal boron doped catalyst with B-Pt-O asymmetric coordination achieves a H2 evolution rate of 627.6 mmol g-1h-1, with an apparent quantum efficiency of 98.4%. Experimental and theoretical analysis reveal that the asymmetric coordination structure redistributes the electron density of Pt cocatalysts, promoting charge carrier separation, optimizing the dissociation and adsorption-desorption of the intermediate H2O* and H* on the dual sites. The findings highlight the importance of asymmetric coordination facilitates the photogenerated carrier transfer and surface reactions for efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution.

 The current view of neurodevelopment after preterm birth presents a strong paradox: diverse neurocognitive outcomes suggest heterogeneous neurodevelopment, yet numerous brain imaging studies focusing on average dysmaturation imply largely uniform aberrations across individuals. Here we show both, spatially heterogeneous individual brain abnormality patterns but with consistent underlying biological mechanisms of injury and plasticity. Using cross-sectional structural magnetic resonance imaging data from preterm neonates and longitudinal data from preterm children and adults in a normative reference framework, we demonstrate that brain development after preterm birth is highly heterogeneous in both severity and patterns of deviations. Individual brain abnormality patterns are also consistent for their extent and location along the life course, associated with glial cell underpinnings, and plastic for influences of the early social environment. Our findings extend conventional views of preterm neurodevelopment, revealing a nuanced landscape of individual variation, with consistent commonalities between subjects. This integrated perspective implies more targeted theranostic intervention strategies, specifically integrating brain charts and imaging at birth, as well as social interventions during early development. This study reveals that brain aberrations after preterm birth are highly individual yet shaped by early injury and social environment, influencing long-term cognitive outcomes."

Here, Richards et al. develop a high-throughput bioprinted trophoblast organoid model to recapitulate the microenvironment of the early placenta, enabling investigation of placenta development and evaluation of therapeutics for placenta dysfunction disorders. 
 Trophoblast organoids can provide crucial insights into mechanisms of placentation, however their potential is limited by highly variable extracellular matrices unable to reflect in vivo tissues. Here, we present a bioprinted placental organoid model, generated using the first trimester trophoblast cell line, ACH-3P, and a synthetic polyethylene glycol (PEG) matrix. Bioprinted or Matrigel-embedded organoids differentiate spontaneously from cytotrophoblasts into two major subtypes: extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) and syncytiotrophoblasts (STBs). Bioprinted organoids are driven towards EVT differentiation and show close similarity with early human placenta or primary trophoblast organoids. Inflammation inhibits proliferation and STBs within bioprinted organoids, which aspirin or metformin (0.5 mM) cannot rescue. We reverse the inside-out architecture of ACH-3P organoids by suspension culture with STBs forming on the outer layer of organoids, reflecting placental tissue. Our bioprinted methodology is applicable to trophoblast stem cells. We present a high-throughput, automated, and tuneable trophoblast organoid model that reproducibly mimics the placental microenvironment in health and disease.

This study uses drone imagery to show that small streams and ponds, often missed by satellites, considerably increase the energy available for melt. 
 Ponding of meltwater on the surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet has the potential to reduce ice sheet albedo and amplify mass loss. However, this process remains poorly constrained and is absent from models that project ice sheet mass balance. Here we demonstrate that meltwater ponding considerably increases the amount of energy available for melting the Greenland Ice Sheet. We first use satellite-derived products to show that meltwater ponding has a significant impact on spatial albedo patterns, particularly in the lower percolation zone. We then use drone imagery to demonstrate that, in the upper ablation zone, there are thousands of narrow streams and small pools (<100 m²) that collectively account for >50% of the total meltwater area. These small meltwater features are not resolved by surface water maps derived from medium-resolution satellite imagery, signifying that the radiative effect of meltwater ponding is three to four times stronger than predicted by satellite-based approaches. Our findings therefore place lower bounds on the radiative effect of meltwater ponding that could be used to advocate for the inclusion of this process into models that forecast Greenland Ice Sheet’s contribution to sea-level rise. Meltwater ponding reduces Greenland Ice Sheet albedo, but this process is not included in models.

 Recent technological advances have facilitated the assembly of telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genomes. The current T2T CHM13 showcases the complete architecture of the human genome, yet its use in functional experiments is limited by discrepancies with the actual genome of the specific biological system under study. Access to reference assemblies for experimentally relevant cell lines is therefore essential in advancing sequencing-based analyses and precise manipulation, particularly in highly variable regions such as centromeres. Here, we present RPE1v1.1, the near-complete diploid genome assembly of the hTERT RPE-1 cell line, a non-cancerous human retinal epithelial model with a stable karyotype. Using high-coverage Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read sequencing, we generate a high-quality de novo assembly, validate it through multiple methods, and phase it by integrating high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data. Our assembly includes chromosome-level scaffolds that span centromeres for all chromosomes. Comparing both haplotypes with the CHM13 genome, we detect haplotype-specific genomic variations, including the translocation between chromosome 10 and chromosome X t(X;10)(Xq28;10q21.2) characteristic of RPE-1 cells, and divergence peaking at centromeres. Altogether, the RPE1v1.1 genome provides a reference-quality diploid assembly of a widely used cell line, supporting high-precision genetic and epigenetic studies in this model system.

Here, the authors combine rapid protein depletion, clinical CDK4/6 inhibitors, and genome-wide EdU sequencing to reveal that the CDK4/6-RB axis ensures timely loading of DNA replication factors in G1 phase in human cells. 
 Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) coordinate DNA replication and cell division, and play key roles in tissue homeostasis, genome stability and cancer development. The first step in replication is origin licensing, when minichromosome maintenance (MCM) helicases are loaded onto DNA by CDC6, CDT1 and the origin recognition complex (ORC). In yeast, origin licensing starts when CDK activity plummets in G1 phase, reinforcing the view that CDKs inhibit licensing. Here we show that, in human cells, CDK4/6 activity promotes origin licensing. By combining rapid protein degradation and time-resolved EdU-sequencing, we find that CDK4/6 activity acts epistatically to CDC6 and CDT1 in G1 phase and counteracts RB pocket proteins to promote origin licensing. Therapeutic CDK4/6 inhibitors block MCM and ORC6 loading, which we exploit to trigger mitosis with unreplicated DNA in p53-deficient cells. The CDK4/6-RB axis thus links replication licensing to proliferation, which has implications for human cell fate control and cancer therapy design. Cells must coordinate cell division with genome replication.

This study shows that aromas induce taste-like patterns in the insular cortex. These results explain the illusion and the prominent role of odours in food reward. 
 During food consumption, tastes combine with retronasal odours to form flavour, which leads to a link so robust that retronasal odours can elicit taste sensations without concurrent taste stimulation. However, the cortical integration of these parallel sensory signals remains unclear. Here, we combine a flavour-binding paradigm and functional neuroimaging to test whether retronasal odorants evoke encoding patterns in the insula similar to those of their paired tastants. Healthy participants attend a familiarisation session with congruent sweet and savoury flavours followed by two functional MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) sessions where they separately receive the constituent tastants and odorants. Multivariate pattern analysis reveal classification of retronasal odours within the insula, exhibiting overlapping representations with their associated tastes, particularly in the ventral anterior insula. Additionally, we observe temporal drift in insular taste representations, paralleling findings in rodent gustatory cortex. These findings underscore the robust crossmodal influences of gustatory and retronasal olfactory processing that underpin the flavour percept. Food aromas stimulate smell receptors in the nose but are often mistaken for tastes. This study shows that aromas induce taste-like patterns in the insular cortex.

 The Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum ca. 55.93 Ma is considered one of the best geological analogues for worst-case, near-future climate states. During this warming interval, calcareous nannoplankton—critical marine primary producers and important components of the biological pump—experienced significant turnover in community composition, which likely had a major impact on ecosystem function. However, determining the extent of this relationship is complicated by recognized geographic variability in the pattern and magnitude of palaeoecological change, as well as a sampling bias towards lower latitude oceanic sites. In this study, we present new calcareous nannofossil assemblage data from the climatically-sensitive, high latitude south-west Pacific Ocean. Critically, our record shows that major changes in nannoplankton community composition—coincident with a 0.5 ‰ decrease in bulk sediment δ13C—preceded the onset of the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum by 200 kyr. We suggest this precursor event led to the establishment of a new palaeoecological baseline that caused a relatively muted response of nannofossil assemblages to the main warming event, especially when compared to other high latitude sites. Therefore, our results highlight the importance of examining the influence of local and regional processes on palaeoecological background states when considering geographically heterogenous responses to major global palaeoclimatic events.

 Indigenous Territories are crucial for preserving biodiversity, particularly in tropical regions, yet their contribution to human health is poorly understood. Using 20 years of data on fire-related and zoonotic/vector-borne diseases, we evaluated how Indigenous Territories, their legal recognition status, and landscape parameters affected disease incidence in the Amazon biome. Overall, we found that Indigenous Territories extent had complex and non-linear effects, with a potential to reduce fire-related disease incidence and to increase zoonotic/vector-borne diseases, depending on the local landscape structure. For instance, Indigenous Territories within municipalities with high forest cover outside their boundaries can mitigate the impacts of particulate matter with less than 2.5 micrometer on human health and reduce the incidence of fire-related diseases. For zoonotic/vector-borne diseases, both forests inside and outside Indigenous Territories, when covering over 40% of a municipality, can contribute to reducing the negative effects from edge density on disease incidence. Our findings emphasize the complex relationships between conservation and human health, which vary based on the local context and Indigenous Territories legal recognition, and underscores the importance of Indigenous Territories and their legal acknowledgment for supporting ecosystem and human health, particularly in landscapes with high forest integrity and low fragmentation.

 The world is facing increasing land scarcity due to growing demand for agricultural products and urban expansion. At the same time, farmland abandonment is emerging as a widespread global land-use change phenomenon. Remote sensing plays a critical role in identifying abandonment across diverse farming systems. Here, we synthesized current knowledge through a systematic literature review of 131 publications to assess progress in remote-sensing-based monitoring of farmland abandonment. Our review highlights the growing use of remote sensing techniques and the increasing utility of multisource satellite data. However, research remains primarily skewed toward publicly available optical Landsat and Sentinel-2 data, with limited integration of other sources and a lack of global-scale assessments. We propose research directions to guide future studies, focusing on underrepresented land-use types, such as grasslands, terraces, and plantations, as well as regions like Africa, Central and Southeast Asia, and South America. We emphasize the importance of diversifying data sources and integrating ancillary information, including cadastral data and historical land-use records, to better understand abandonment processes and associated vegetation changes. We advocate for multi-scale, temporally explicit analyses to improve scalability and enable the development of regional and continental products. As most studies focus on biophysical changes, future work should also consider socio-economic contexts and integrate remote-sensing-based proxies of land-use change.

 Although clouds and their properties are critical to radiation budget and weather change, the cloud products derived from passive radiometers remain significant uncertainties due to the complex variations of clouds and the limited spectral characterization of existing algorithms. In this study, a general algorithm is proposed to retrieve cloud top height (CTH), cloud top temperature (CTT) and cloud top pressure (CTP) simultaneously by establishing a look-up table (LUT) between lidar measurements and the cloud-sensitive spectral characteristics. Validated by an independent year, the algorithm has achieved accurate retrievals under both daytime and nighttime conditions, with an averaged Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.70 km, 9.0 K and 118 hPa for CTH, CTT and CTP, respectively. The above RMSEs are much lower than those reported for other algorithms proposed in recent years, and have decreased by about 40 % compared to the corresponding Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products, which indicates the better performance of the proposed algorithm.

The main findings are as follows: (1) the number of stations with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.6 between ground-based measured NO2 (GBM-NO2) and corrected column concentration of NO2 (CC-NO2) increased from 54 to 1200, indicating substantial quality improvement; (2) cross-validation results yielded an R2 of 0.91 and an RMSE of 4.05 μg/m3 for the estimated NSC-NO2, demonstrating strong spatiotemporal consistency with GBM-NO2; and (3) using the estimated NSC-NO2, China's NO2 concentrations showed a marked decrease attributable to both the “holiday effect” and the COVID-19 lockdown.

 The Southeastern Tibetan Plateau (SETP), known as a crucial precipitation center within the Tibetan Plateau, has experienced frequent extreme precipitation events that have caused severe disasters. Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) have been recognized as significant contributors to extreme hydrological events, yet their characteristics and relationships with extreme precipitation in the SETP are not yet fully understood. In this study, we identified ARs using ERA5 reanalysis data from 1979 to 2023, quantified the variations in extreme precipitation associated with these ARs, and explored the underlying mechanisms driving these changes. The results demonstrated a critical role of ARs in modulating extreme precipitation over the SETP, Over the study period, a significant shift occurred in 1999 regarding ARs-related extreme precipitation. While this value increased prior to 1999, it experienced a sharp decline that year. Although a slight recovery was observed between 2000 and 2023, average levels remained below pre-1999 records. Fluctuations in ARs-related extreme precipitation are driven primarily by variations in ARs frequency, and the weakening of dynamic conditions associated with ARs may partly offset the enhancement effect of increased moisture availability, thereby limiting the intensification of extreme precipitation. Additionally, changes in atmospheric circulation further influence extreme precipitation by altering ARs pathways. This study enhances our understanding of the influence of ARs on extreme precipitation, providing critical insights into water resource management within the SETP."

AAGAB uses its C-terminal domain (CTD) to bind the α subunit and its GTPase-like domain (GD) to bind the σ2 subunit of the AP2 adaptor complex, a central player in membrane trafficking. AAGAB first recruits α via its CTD; σ2 then joins through interaction with α, forming a conformationally immature α:σ2 hemicomplex at the CTD.

While microglia/myeloid cells drive RP progression, their phenotype-regulating determinants remain unclear. Using rd10 mice, we reveal TREM2 as a biphasic RP regulator via STAT2–mediated microglial reprogramming. Early TREM2 loss amplifies neuroinflammation through STAT2 hyperactivation, while late deficiency triggers NF-κB/STAT2–driven microglial apoptosis, impairing phagocytosis yet preserving photoreceptors. We uncover a photoreceptor-microglia metabolic axis where apoptotic photoreceptors release arachidonic acid, salicylic acid, and creatinine to induce STAT2-dependent apoptosis in TREM2-deficient cells. Crucially, we identify intermicroglia PSAP/GPR37 signaling as a self-propagating apoptotic mechanism—the first evidence of apoptotic transmission in retinal degeneration.

Here, we used a CRISPR-Cas9 screen in an orthotopic xenograft model to explore PDAC dynamics. The RNA binding protein DEAD-box helicase 3X-linked (DDX3X) was identified as a pivotal oncogene and biomechanical checkpoint. Specifically, DDX3X up-regulation in PDAC promoted tumorigenesis and metastasis, primarily through the transcriptional repressor TLE family member 2 (TLE2). Dysregulation of DDX3X in the tumor destabilized TLE2 messenger RNA and therefore disrupted the interaction with KLF4 (KLF transcription factor 4), leading to increased expression of myosin light chain 9 (MYL9). This change remodeled F-actin, enhancing tumor cell traction forces and consequently facilitating tumor metastasis. Targeting the DDX3X-TLE2-MYL9 pathway considerably reduces PDAC progression.

Traditional lubrication models rely on semiempirical constitutive relations, which become unreliable under extreme conditions. Here, we present a simulation framework that seamlessly couples molecular and continuum models for boundary lubrication without fixed-form constitutive laws. We train Gaussian process regression models as surrogates for predicting interfacial shear and normal stress in molecular dynamics simulations. An active learning algorithm ensures that our model adapts in scenarios where common constitutive laws fail, such as at layering transitions. We demonstrate our approach for nanoscale fluid flow over rough and heterogeneous surfaces, paving the way for accurate boundary lubrication simulations at experimental length and timescales."

However, the design method and localized perception of phase transitions remain challenging. Inspired by the passive coupling mechanisms in ostrich locomotion, this work proposes nonreciprocal metamaterials that can perceive real-time phase transition. These architectures enable the topological solitons to propagate unidirectionally and overcome dispersive and dissipative effects through bistable-to-monostable state switching between adjacent units. The integration of electromagnetic resonators within the metamaterial units enables real-time detection of dynamic phase transitions, as soliton propagation or external loads induce resonance frequency shifts between distinct stable states. By arraying these mechanoreceptive units and the combination of the machine learning, it can encode information and compute programmatically. Furthermore, the mechanoreceptors hold promising applications in robotics. This work provides an approach for integrating phase transition perception and nonlinear wave manipulation and offers insights into dynamic material intelligence and energy management systems."

We previously reported that mutations in the viral nucleocapsid (NC) are selected in the presence of the INSTI dolutegravir (DTG).

Notably, the selected NC and IN mutations act in concert to reduce the susceptibility of the virus to INSTIs.

Such agents are highly desirable for metabolic imaging with hyperpolarized tracers such as15N-pyridine, 1,4-13C2-succinate, and 1-15N-nicotinamide, where valuable polarization decays rapidly, especially at low fields during transfer between polarizer and scanner.

The impact on longitudinal relaxation is particularly pronounced at low magnetic fields and near the tracer’s pKawhereT1can be tripled. This mitigates polarization loss during transfer, so hitherto unsuitable, fast-relaxing molecules can be used now. This way, we achieved the15N hyperpolarization of nearly 30% for 1-15N-nicotinamide.
