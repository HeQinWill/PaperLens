Shephard;Mark Zondlo;Daniel Moore,Ammonia emissions and depositions over the contiguous United States derived from IASI and CrIS using the directional derivative approach,"We estimate ammonia fluxes over the contiguous U.S. from 2008 to 2022 using a directional derivative approach applied to satellite observations from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) and Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS). The resulting flux estimates reveal pronounced seasonal and spatial patterns driven by agricultural activities and indicate substantial local deposition to surrounding vegetation, underscoring the need for improved monitoring and management strategies. 
 Atmospheric ammonia (NH3), primarily emitted from agriculture, poses significant threats to ecosystems, climate, and human health through nitrogen deposition and secondary aerosol formation. NH3 flux estimates remain highly uncertain due to limited direct observations and complex emission–deposition processes. Here, we estimated NH3 fluxes over the contiguous United States using satellite observations from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI, 2008–2022) and Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS, 2012–2022) by applying a directional derivative approach. Our results highlight major agricultural emission hotspots, including the San Joaquin Valley in California, the Snake River Valley in Idaho, the Texas panhandle, the Great Plains, Southeastern Pennsylvania, and Eastern North Carolina. NH3 removal is predominantly driven by deposition near source areas rather than chemical transformation, with strong sinks in vegetation-dense regions such as forests, grasslands, shrublands, and wetlands. Seasonal flux variations show peaks in warm months and lower values in winter, driven by temperature-dependent volatilization from livestock production and fertilizer application. Compared with bottom-up inventory, satellite-based estimates capture general spatial and seasonal patterns, while also revealing additional insights into key flux hotspots and peak periods. CrIS consistently reports higher fluxes than IASI, especially in spring, reflecting differences in their overpass times.  Combining IASI (morning overpass) and CrIS (midday overpass) observations enables a better understanding of diurnal NH3 flux dynamics. These findings provide critical insights into NH3 spatiotemporal variabilities, complementing inventory-based approaches and informing nitrogen management and environmental policy, particularly in regions with limited ground-based monitoring."
10.5194/acp-26-665-2026,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该论文研究了二氧化碳浓度增加对平流层中 migrating diurnal tide 的影响，涉及大气成分分析和气候变化，与大气环境遥感技术中的卫星观测和大气组成分析密切相关。,"['CO2', 'diurnal tide', 'lower thermosphere']",Masaru Kogure;In-Sun Song;Huixin Liu;Han-Li Liu,Impacts of increasing CO2 on diurnal migrating  tide in the equatorial lower thermosphere,"We investigate how rising CO₂ changes the migrating diurnal tide driven by solar heating and latent heat. Using a state-of-the-art model under the most extreme scenario in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, we find that the tide strengthens between 20–70 km but weakens between 90–110 km. The increase likely reflects lower density and stronger tropical convection, whereas the decrease is consistent with enhanced diffusion. 
 We investigate the impacts of increased CO2 concentration on migrating diurnal tide (DW1). A future climate simulation is conducted using a WACCM-X model, with surface CO2 levels increasing according to the RCP8.5 scenario. The DW1 (1,1) mode, a propagating tide peaking near the equator, exhibits a statistically significant positive trend in a range of 20–70 km, and a significant negative trend in a range of 90–110 km. The positive trend is likely driven by a reduction in atmospheric density in the mesosphere and enhanced equatorial convective activity, while the negative trend appears in the mesosphere, which overwhelms the positive trend. Two potential mechanisms may explain the negative trend. First, increasing CO2 enhances mesospheric stability, reducing tidal vertical wavelengths. In our simulation, equatorial temperatures around ∼50–70 km become cooler than those in ∼70–90 km. This strong cooling could be linked to CO2 mixing and transport, as well as the contraction of the mesospheric ozone layer due to atmospheric descent induced by CO2-driven cooling. Second, stronger convective activity intensifies gravity wave generation, increasing gravity wave diffusion in the mesosphere. This strong convective activity also likely intensifies the tide below ∼70 km. While our positive DW1 trend is consistent with McLandress and Fomichev (2006), the negative trend in the lower thermosphere contrasts with their results. This discrepancy might arise because their model used a time-independent diffusion coefficient, whereas WACCM-X accounts for CO2-driven changes in gravity wave diffusion. The negative trend is confirmed in SABER observation for the last two decades, while the positive trend is not verified."

This improves fog monitoring by distinguishing fog from low clouds, which satellites alone cannot reliably do. Our results reveal diurnal patterns and linkages to coastal proximity in the vertical dynamics of fog and low clouds, highlighting key atmospheric processes with potential importance for future research. 
 In the hyper-arid Namib Desert, fog serves as the only regular source of moisture, vital for sustaining local ecosystems. While fog occurrence in the region is typically associated with the advection of marine stratus clouds and their interaction with topography, its spatial distribution is strongly influenced by cloud base height, which remains poorly understood. To address this gap, this study utilizes ground-based remote sensing and in-situ observations to analyze systematic spatial and temporal patterns of cloud base height. Our results reveal clear seasonality and a diurnal cycle, with cloud base lowering moderately (10–50 m h−1) during the evening and early night, and lifting rapidly (30–150 m h−1) after sunrise, especially inland. Additionally, the findings indicate that these rates are influenced by horizontal gradients in cloud thickness. Quantile regression highlights the tight relationship between cloud base height and near-surface relative humidity (r≈-0.76) that is expected in well-mixed boundary layer, which can therefore be employed to estimate cloud base height across FogNet sites. In a case study, the potential value of the estimated cloud base height for separating fog from low clouds in satellite-based products is shown. In the future, a full integration of the estimated cloud base height with a  satellite-based fog and low-cloud product can enable a spatially continuous mapping of fog in the region for the first time, which would facilitate fog ecological impact studies."
10.5194/acp-26-733-2026,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该论文使用卫星观测数据（TROPOMI）反演大气中的甲醛和乙二醛，以量化挥发性有机化合物（VOC）的排放，这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，涉及空气质量和大气成分分析。,"['TROPOMI', 'formaldehyde', 'glyoxal', 'VOC emissions', 'satellite observations']",Yasmine Sfendla;Trissevgeni Stavrakou;Jean-François Müller;Glenn-Michael Oomen;Beata Opacka;Thomas Danckaert;Isabelle De Smedt;Christophe Lerot,Global VOC emissions quantified from inversion of TROPOMI spaceborne formaldehyde and glyoxal data,"Volatile organic compounds (VOC) emitted from industry, wildfires, fuel use and vegetation impact the climate and are detrimental to human health. To guide regulation aimed at mitigating their impacts, it is important to know their emissions. We used satellite observations of formaldehyde and glyoxal, combined with a chemical transport model, and demonstrate that VOC emissions are about 20 % larger than expected; furthermore, unknown chemical pathways must be invoked to explain the observations. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are key precursors of tropospheric ozone and secondary organic aerosols, a major component of PM2.5, and several aromatic VOCs are toxic. Glyoxal is a short-lived oxidation product of many VOCs, yet global models consistently underestimate its abundance, indicating a substantial missing source. Here, we derive improved estimates of global biogenic, pyrogenic, and anthropogenic VOC emissions and new constraints on the atmospheric glyoxal budget, based on the first joint inversion of TROPOMI formaldehyde and glyoxal columns using the adjoint of the MAGRITTEv1.2 chemical transport model. For 2021, the global NMVOC flux is estimated at 1070 Tg yr−1, 19 % above bottom-up estimates, partitioned into 749 Tg from vegetation, 102 Tg from biomass burning, and 219 Tg from anthropogenic activity. Emissions of anthropogenic glyoxal precursors are 43 % higher globally when constrained by satellite data compared with inventory-based simulations, with large underestimations in India, China, and Africa. The total glyoxal source is estimated at 100 Tg yr−1, of which 41 % originates from unidentified VOCs, predominantly biogenic and concentrated in the Tropics. Likely contributors include poorly represented formation pathway in isoprene oxidation under low-NOx conditions and an underestimated contribution of monoterpenes. Validation against Pandonia Global Network, in situ, and MAX-DOAS datasets confirms improved agreement of the satellite-constrained model relative to the model based on inventory data alone."

Our results reveal that elevated NOₓ levels enhanced the daytime SOA volatility by modifying gas-particle partitioning, particularly through suppressing the production of low-volatility organic vapors. In contrast, photochemical aging was associated with reduced SOA volatility. 
 Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is an important component of organic aerosol (OA), yet its atmospheric evolution and impacts on volatility remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the volatility of different types of SOA at a downwind site of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region in the fall of 2019, using a time-of-flight chemical ionization mass spectrometer coupled with a Filter Inlet for Gases and Aerosol (FIGAERO-CIMS). Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis was performed on the thermogram data of organic compounds (referred as FIGAERO-OA) measured by the FIGAERO-CIMS.  Eight factors were resolved, including six daytime chemistry related factors, a biomass burning related factor (BB-LVOA, 10 % of the FIGAERO-OA), and a nighttime chemistry related factor (Night-LVOA, 15 %) along with their corresponding volatility. Day-HNOx-LVOA (12 %) and Day-LNOx-LVOA (11 %) were mainly formed through gas-particle partitioning. Increasing NOx levels mainly affected SOA formation through gas-particle partitioning, suppressing the formation of low-volatile organic vapors, and thus promoting the formation of relatively high volatile OA with a higher N : C ratio. Two aged OA factors, Day-aged-LVOA (16 %) and Day-aged-ELVOA (11 %), were attributed to daytime photochemical aging of pre-existing OA. In addition, the daytime formation of Day-urban-LVOA (16 %) and Day-urban-ELVOA (7 %) could only observed in the urban plume.  Results show that both gas-particle partitioning (36 %) and photochemical aging (30 %) accounted for a major fraction in FIGAERO-OA in the afternoon during the urban air masses period, especially for high-NOx-like pathway (∼ 21 %). In general, the six daytime OA factors collectively explain the majority (82 %) of daytime SOA identified by an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS). While BB-LVOA and Night-LVOA accounted for 13 % of biomass burning OA and 48 % of nighttime chemistry OA observed by AMS, respectively. Our PMF analysis also demonstrated that the highly oxygenated OA and hydrocarbon-like OA cannot be identified with FIGAERO-CIMS in this study. In summary, our results show that the volatility of OA is strongly governed by its formation pathways and subsequent atmospheric aging processes."

However, is more depleted in heavy isotopes than the oil-associated gas emitted in the Southern Romanian Plain, and gas leakages in the city of Bucharest. 
 Isotope measurements are increasingly used to constrain the methane (CH4) budget on various scales, from global to regional. The success of isotope-based source attribution depends to a large degree on the knowledge of the isotope signatures of the various source categories at the point of emission, but this information is in many cases lacking. Here we report the isotopic composition of CH4 emitted from 48 installations in the gas production region of Transylvania, Romania. The isotopic source signatures are quite homogeneous across the basin with average values of δ13C = (−65.6 ± 0.5 ‰) and δD = (−184 ± 1 ‰) confirming the predominantly biogenic origin of the Transylvanian gas, produced by hydrogenotrophic CO2 reduction. This is similar to values reported previously from natural seeps in Transylvania, to the natural gas exploited in the Dolj region in Southwestern Romania, and to the natural gas in the distribution grid in Cluj-Napoca. However, is more depleted in heavy isotopes than the oil-associated gas emitted in the Southern Romanian Plain, and gas leakages in the city of Bucharest. In addition, we present a step-by-step derivation of the underlying “Keeling plot” mass balance approach that is used to derive isotope source signatures."

They may be measured by applying algorithms to satellite images of the Earth. We attempt to apply data from the new Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) satellite to the existing XBAER algorithm, which was previously applied to data from the Ocean Land and Colour Instrument (OLCI) satellite. This paper compares the satellite inputs and aerosol outputs of the XBAER algorithm and finds good results. 
 New high-resolution hyper and multispectral satellite instruments enable the retrieval of aerosol optical depth (AOD) at spatial resolutions of tens of meters. The eXtensible Bremen AErosol Retrieval (XBAER) AOD retrieval algorithm has previously been developed for use with Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) radiance data. With the intention of later modifying XBAER to use the full 30 m spatial resolution data from the Hyper-Spectral Imager (HSI) on board the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) satellite, the present study investigates how HSI data compare to OLCI data. For the bands of interest, top of atmosphere reflectances generally compare well (R>0.9), the intercept of the best fit line is less than 0.05 from the origin, and the slope is less than 0.1 from 1. However exceptions exist and these are explained as the result of differences in the spectral response functions of the instruments in the region of the spectrum around the O2 A-Band absorption feature, or as a result of differences in the viewing geometry of the satellites which produces differing bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) effects. XBAER is then used to retrieve OLCI and HSI surface reflectance (SRF) and AOD. For SRF the comparison between OLCI and HSI yields R=0.953, best fit intercept =0.003 and best fit slope =1.082. The respective comparison for AOD yields R=0.809, best fit intercept =0.153 and best fit slope =0.785. These comparisons are then separated by surface type and insights are gained into the performance of the algorithm. Finally, the unmodified XBAER algorithm is run using the full spatial resolution HSI data. Plumes from biomass-burning are identified in a single scene, and a comparison with AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) AOD is performed for multiple scenes, achieving R=0.631."

This is an important parametrization of Cλ specifically geared towards BB aerosol from African fuels under different aging states, and is of particular importance for future field work in that continent which is at present least studied. 
 Africa is a critical source of biomass burning (BB) aerosols, and its importance is increasing. The African Combustion Aerosol Collaborative Intercomparison Analysis (ACACIA) Pilot Project set to optically characterize BB aerosol generated from sub-Saharan African fuels. We used a photoacoustic spectrometer as a reference instrument to determine the multiple-scattering correction factor Cλ for an AE33 aethalometer at three wavelengths, which produced weighted mean values of C370=3.69, C470=5.65, and C520=6.39. Cλ increased with wavelength and C370 was statistically independent of the others, suggesting a single Cλ is insufficient, especially in BB scenarios. While a dependence of Cλ on burning state was not found, Cλ was shown to strongly relate to particle single scattering albedo (SSA, ω). When Cλ was plotted against SSA, values slowly rose at low SSA values, followed by a sharp rise around an SSA of ∼ 0.9; indicating a larger correction needed for less absorbing aerosol. A number of functions operating on either SSA or Cλ were explored and the best function was -Cλ/(1-Cλ)=Aω+B. This is an important parametrization of Cλ specifically geared towards BB aerosol from African fuels under different aging states, and is of particular importance for future field work in that continent. An Ångström matrix plot shows that African BB aerosol can have values more akin to dust, which demonstrates that these fuels are distinct in their wavelength dependence from more typical BB aerosol. Lastly, we examined the mass extinction and absorbance cross sections for BB aerosol generated for the same fuels with two different tube furnace setups. Not only is this combustion method flexible, it was found to be reproducible between labs."

Trepte,CALIPSO 1064 nm calibration biases inferred from wavelength-dependent signal attenuation by stratospheric aerosols,"This paper assesses biases in the 1064 nm calibration of the Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) due to signal attenuation differences at 1064 and 532 nm caused by stratospheric aerosols. Multi-channel measurements from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment suggest the bias ranges from 1 %–2 % for background conditions to over 5 % for high aerosol loads. Implications for CALIOP 1064 nm extinction retrievals and cascading errors in multi-layer scenes are discussed. 
 Calibration of lidar signals at 1064 nm from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) onboard Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite depends on the prior calibration of the primary 532 nm channel. However, the 1064 nm calibration procedure also requires knowledge of the ratio of stratospheric signal attenuations at 1064 and 532 nm, which is not available a priori and thus is assumed to be 1. This assumption introduces a potential bias in the computed 1064 nm calibration coefficients. In this work we assess this bias by using independent multi-channel occultation retrievals of stratospheric aerosol extinction from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE III) on the International Space Station (ISS) for the period 2017 onwards. We also use the GLObal Space based Stratospheric Aerosol Climatology (GloSSAC) to provide a historical background during the SAGE II era (1984 through 2005). The results show that the magnitude of the CALIOP 1064 nm calibration bias is less than 1 %–2 % within the tropics under stratospheric background conditions. However, recent biases can be as high as 5 % when volcanic perturbations and/or pyro-cumulonimbus (pyroCb) injections dominate the stratospheric aerosol loading. We explore the effects of this bias on CALIOP's level 2 science retrievals by estimating the anticipated perturbations in cloud-aerosol discrimination (CAD) performance and by quantifying the non-linear propagation of errors in CALIOP's 1064 nm extinction coefficients. This global characterization of the spectral attenuation differences should provide useful information for future spaceborne elastic lidars operating at 1064 nm."

GeCGO and GeoNEXTools could help scientists use geostationary satellite data at ground observational sites of interest. 
 The latest generation of geostationary satellites provide Earth observations similar to widely used polar-orbiting sensors but at intervals as frequently as every 5–10 min, making them ideal for studying the diurnal dynamics of land–atmosphere interactions. The NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) group created the GeoNEX datasets by collating data from several geostationary platforms, including GOES-16/17/18, Himawari-8/9, and GK-2A, and placing them on a common grid to facilitate use by the Earth science community. Here, we document the GeoNEX Coincident Ground Observations (GeCGO) dataset for terrestrial ecosystem studies and provide examples for its use. Currently, GeCGO provides GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) data over a 10 km × 10 km area surrounding 1586 network sites across the Americas. GeCGO makes it easy to compare the time series of geostationary data with the diurnal ground observations, including carbon/water fluxes and aerosol optical depth, and is extensible to other regions. We also develop GeoNEXTools to facilitate analyses that require both GeoNEX data and other NASA satellite data. The objectives of this paper are to introduce GeCGO and GeoNEXTools and demonstrate their applications. First, we describe the details of GeCGO and GeoNEXTools. Second, we explain how GeCGO can be integrated with other satellite data. Finally, we showcase comparisons between GeCGO and observations from three ground-based networks.

Over two decades, these restored lands captured 21.77 million metric tons of carbon, Grasslands contributed over 80 % of this carbon storage, highlighting their critical role in climate mitigation. 
 The soil organic carbon pool is a crucial component of carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems, playing a key role in regulating the carbon cycle and mitigating atmospheric CO2 concentration increases. To combat soil degradation and enhance soil organic carbon on the Loess Plateau, the Grain-for-Green Program (GFGP) has been implemented. Accurately quantifying change in soil organic carbon stock (ΔSOC) resulting from farmland retirement is essential for informing land use management. In this study, the spatial and temporal distribution of retired farmlands on the Loess Plateau was analyzed using Landsat imagery from 1999–2021. To assess the effects of the years since retirement, climate, soil properties, elevation, and other factors on ΔSOC, climate-zone-specific multivariable linear regression models were developed based on field-sampled soil data. These models were then used to map ΔSOC across the retired farmlands. Results indicated that a total of 39 065 km2 of farmland was retired over the past two decades, with 45.61 % converted to grasslands, 29.75 % to shrublands, and 24.64 % to forestlands. The years since retirement showed a significant positive correlation with ΔSOC, and distinct models were developed for different climatic zones to achieve high-resolution (30 m) ΔSOC mapping. The total ΔSOC from retired farmland on the Loess Plateau was estimated at 21.77 Tg in carbon equivalent, with grasslands contributing 81.10 %, followed by forestlands (11.16 %) and shrublands (7.74 %).

This helps track how the ice sheet is changing as the climate warms. By carefully combining satellite data and checking results by hand, we created one of the most accurate maps of the ice sheet to date. This map supports research on ice loss and improves predictions of future changes in Greenland’s ice and its effect on the planet. 
 The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is losing mass at an accelerating rate in response to climate change. Its geometry responds to these changes over annual to decadal timescales, therefore making accurate and up-to-date mapping of its extent essential for monitoring ice loss, assessing mass balance, and improving climate and glaciological models. Ice margin outlines serve as critical boundary conditions for different types of modelling exercises, hydrological studies, and assessments of ice sheet dynamics. Here, we present the PROMICE-2022 Ice Mask, a high-resolution outline of the contiguous ice masses of the GrIS and the nunataks in its interior as of late August 2022. The dataset was derived from a true-colour Sentinel-2 mosaic at 10 m spatial resolution, generated using the Sentinel Hub Cloud Processing API to select the most recent valid pixels from August 2022. The mapping process was performed manually and supplemented with high-resolution mosaics from Sentinel-2 and SPOT 6/7 provided by the Danish Agency for Climate Data (KDS), along with recent topographic vector data. We mapped the geodesic perimeter length of the GrIS to 53 060 km and its glacierized area, including floating ice, to 1 725 648 km2 with 19 130 nunataks in its interior. The PROMICE-2022 ice mask captures the GrIS margin with an absolute horizontal accuracy better than 20 m.

By gathering and checking thousands of measurements from around the globe and linking them with flow and rainfall data, the database provides a comprehensive view of water movement, allows scientists to compare regions, understand groundwater processes, and support sustainable water management worldwide. 
 For analysing karst hydrogeological systems, observations of karst springs and cave drips are considered indispensable. In addition to hydrometric observations, knowing the oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope ratios has improved the understanding of vadose zone and aquifer dynamics, likewise supporting system characterisation and modelling. However, limited accessibility and high costs of the analysis of stable isotopes in karst aquifers have hindered progress in karst research and impeded the accurate understanding of karst processes especially when it comes to comparative or large-scale studies. In this study, we present our workflow to compile the WoKaS-Iso database, the first extensive collection of time series data for Oxygen-18 and Deuterium isotopes in karst springs and cave drip water from diverse sources, encompassing publications, theses, reports, online archives, and collaborative initiatives worldwide. The database incorporates data sourced from 236 springs and 74 caves, comprising in total 997 time series (379 time series for the springs and 618 time series for the cave drip water). These datasets provide coverage across significant karst regions globally, spanning China, the USA, Europe, the Middle East, and Australia. Within datasets, 79% for springs and 68% for cave drip water exhibit resolutions finer than monthly intervals. In addition, by integrating isotopic records with ancillary environmental variables including spring discharge, cave drip rate, precipitation, and rainwater isotopes, the database offers a more comprehensive perspective on hydrological behaviours in karst aquifers, hence advancing hydrogeological characterisation and modelling. The WoKaS-Iso database not only deepens the understanding of the complex systems but also promotes sustainable water resource management as well as the potential to foster collaborative research.

Dawson,"A new, high-resolution global reef island database (GRID) with implications for coastal vulnerability","Low-lying coral reef islands support millions of people throughout the world's oceans but face increasing threats from rising sea levels, storms and coastal change. This study created the first global map of more than thirty-four thousand reef islands using publicly accessible global spatial and environmental data. The results reveal where islands are most vulnerable and where they remain more resilient, helping communities and governments plan for future climate impacts. 
 Low-lying reef islands (LRIs) are among the most climate-vulnerable landforms on Earth, yet no globally consistent and spatially comprehensive inventory of these islands has previously existed. This is especially important to underpin assessments of future risk and resilience. To address the absence of a unified global dataset, this study develops the first Global Reef Island Database (GRID), a detailed spatial product that identifies the global distribution of LRIs and collates their key geomorphological, environmental and exposure characteristics. Using the UNEP-WCMC Global Island Database (GID2.1), global coral reef distribution layers and the AW3D30 digital elevation model, all landmasses < 30 km² located within 1 km of coral reef and below a conservative mean elevation threshold of 16 m were identified. A total of 34,404 LRIs were mapped accounting for nearly 11,000 km2 of land area and over 60,000 km of shoreline. The vast majority (77 %) are very small (< 0.1 km2) highlighting their geomorphological sensitivity. GRID demonstrates strong agreement with observed island counts (R2 = 0.939; ICC = 0.984) and outperforms commonly used shoreline datasets in identifying small islands while preserving accurate geospatial alignment. LRIs are concentrated in Asia and Oceania, with Indonesia (14 %), Japan (12 %) and French Polynesia (10 %) containing the largest numbers. For each island, eight intrinsic variables (including land area, elevation, shape, population and isolation) and ten extrinsic variables (including wave and tidal climate, bathymetry, tropical storm exposure and projected sea-level rise) were compiled to build a globally standardised dataset suited for vulnerability analysis. The GRID demonstrates clear spatial clustering in external forcing variables: wave exposure is highest across mid-ocean atolls, tropical storm density peaks in the northwest Pacific and Caribbean, and projected sea-level rise rates are greatest around the northern Philippines, Japan and Central America. Finally, this study develops an island vulnerability index using the GRID. Approximately 16 % of LRIs are classified as very highly vulnerable, particularly throughout the northwest Pacific and northern South China Sea. National-scale assessments reveal that countries such as China, Japan and the Northern Mariana Islands are at highest risk. It is anticipated that thus far the most comprehensive yet unified database can support a variety of reef island research including climate adaptation planning, conservation and hazard mitigation efforts and coastal erosion studies. The final dataset has been made publicly available at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.986811 (Dawson 2025)."

Using high-resolution environmental data, the scheme defines parameterized flow units, enabling water and energy flux simulations. Compared against a benchmark simulation, the multiscale scheme demonstrates strong agreement in spatial mean, standard deviation, and temporal variability, showcasing its potential for large-scale hydrological simulation. 
 Groundwater is critical in the hydrological cycle, impacting water supply, agriculture, and climate regulation. However, current Land Surface Models (LSMs) often struggle to accurately represent the multiple spatial scales of subsurface flow primarily due to the complexity of incorporating sufficient and yet efficiently surface heterogeneity, which significantly influences subsurface dynamics. Accurately modeling this heterogeneity requires substantial computational resources, often making it challenging to achieve in practice. This study introduces a multiscale approach to address this limitation. The approach leverages the hierarchical clustering scheme of the HydroBlocks model to define hydrologically similar areas that the model uses to capture local, intermediate, and regional flow dynamics within regional units, which interact laterally based on hydraulic gradients and soil properties. The proposed method is compared against a benchmark simulation with 1.4 million modeling units – 34 times the number of tiles in the multiscale experiment. The results show consistency in spatial distribution and a Pearson coefficient of correlation above 0.80 for the temporal variability of hydrological variables such as latent and sensible heat flux, surface runoff, and effective saturation at the root zone, demonstrating its ability to represent subsurface flow patterns adequately. The scheme, however, struggles to adequately represent volumetric water content at the bottom of the soil column, as evidenced by lower correlation coefficients, where the misrepresentation of elevation heterogeneity may play a larger role. This multiscale approach offers a computationally efficient way to incorporate detailed subsurface processes into large-scale hydrological simulations, improving our understanding of water cycle dynamics and supporting informed water resource management."

The ISIMIP (The Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project) groundwater sector combines multiple global groundwater models to capture a range of possible outcomes and reduce uncertainty. Initial comparisons reveal significant differences between models in key metrics like water table depth and recharge rates, highlighting the need for structured model intercomparisons. 
 Groundwater serves as a crucial freshwater resource for people and ecosystems, playing a vital role in adapting to climate change. Yet, its availability and dynamics are affected by climate variations, changes in land use, and abstraction. Despite its importance, our understanding of how global change will influence groundwater in the future remains limited. Multi-model ensembles are powerful tools for impact assessments; compared to single-model studies, they provide a more comprehensive understanding of uncertainties and enhance the robustness of projections by capturing a range of possible outcomes. However, to date, no ensemble of groundwater models has been available to assess the impacts of global change. Here, we present the new Groundwater sector within ISIMIP, which combines multiple global, continental, and regional-scale groundwater models. We describe the rationale for the sector, the sectoral output variables that underpinned the modeling protocol, and showcase current model differences and possible future analysis. Currently, eight models are participating in this sector, ranging from gradient-based groundwater models to specialized karst recharge models, each producing up to 19 out of 23 modeling protocol-defined output variables. To showcase the benefits of a joint sector, we utilize available model outputs of the participating models to show the substantial differences in estimating water table depth (global arithmetic mean 6–127 m) and groundwater recharge (global arithmetic mean 78–228 mm yr−1), which is consistent with recent studies on the uncertainty of groundwater models, but with distinct spatial patterns. We further outline synergies with 13 of the 17 existing ISIMIP sectors and specifically discuss those with the global water and water quality sectors. Finally, this paper outlines a vision for ensemble-based groundwater studies that can contribute to a better understanding of the impacts of climate change, land use change, environmental change, and socio-economic change on the world's largest accessible freshwater store – groundwater."

The method uses a three dimensional incremental variational approach focusing on the physical relationships between all the state vector variables errors. Testing in the Mediterranean Sea showed that a complex sea level operator based on a barotropic model works best. 
 This study presents the development and sensitivity analysis of the sea level operator within the OceanVar software which implements an oceanographic incremental three-dimensional variational data assimilation scheme. In OceanVar, the background error covariance matrix is decomposed into a sequence of physically based linear operators, allowing for individual analysis of specific error matrix components. The key development of OceanVar2.0 is the full integration of both dynamic height and barotropic model formulations as a flexible option for handling sea level covariance. The comparison of the two formulations of the sea level operator which provides correlations between Sea Level Anomaly, temperature and salinity increments is presented. The sensitivity experiments were performed in the Mediterranean Sea and the quality of the analysis assessed by comparing background estimates with observations for the period January–December 2021. The results confirm the methodological advantage of the barotropic model operator, which successfully overcomes the physical and operational limitations associated with choosing an appropriate level-of-no-motion for the dynamic height formulation. Furthermore, we present a method to assimilate along-track satellite altimetry considering a forecasting model with tides."

We simulate the atmospheric concentration of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and corresponding sulfur deposition fluxes and compare the results with observational data from a satellite instrument and with ground-based in-situ measurements. For the evaluation of the simulated atmospheric lifetime of SO2, we also simulate the fate of SO2 emitted by two volcanic eruptions that happened in 2019. 
 Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a key atmospheric pollutant, primarily emitted through human activities such as fossil fuel combustion. In atmospheric models, accurate representation of SO2 emission sources, transport, and removal processes are essential for evaluating air quality and radiative forcing.In this study, we present, for the first time, a comprehensive examination of atmospheric SO2 simulated by the ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) model, here operated under the Chemistry–Climate Model Initiative (CCMI-2022) protocol. First, the tropospheric sulfur budget simulated by EMAC is verified to be closed. This closure means that all sulfur sources and sinks are balanced and no artificial gain or loss occurs over time due to numerical or conceptual errors. This budget closure is a prerequisite for any further analysis. Second, the results of EMAC simulations are compared with observations from three ground-based networks (the Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTnet), the European Monitoring and Evaluation Program (EMEP), and the Acid Deposition Monitoring Network in East Asia (EANET)), mainly over polluted regions, and with vertical column densities retrieved from a TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board the Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor mission (Sentinel-5P) satellite. The EMAC simulated SO2 concentrations near the Earth's surface for the year 2019 are, depending on the region, between 1.4 and 1.8 times larger than observed. This discrepancy aligns well with the differences between simulated and retrieved satellite-based measurements of SO2 vertical column densities over the same regions. It indicates that the prescribed SO2 emissions used for the EMAC simulations might be overestimated. Over a longer time period (2000–2019), the EMAC simulation reproduces the measured declining trends of SO2 concentrations and deposited sulfur fluxes in the USA and Europe, but fails to simulate the observed trends in East Asia. This is most likely attributable to the prescribed SO2 emission inventories. Furthermore, sensitivity simulations are performed to assess the emitted amount of SO2 following the Raikoke and Ulawun volcanic eruptions in 2019. The results show a very good agreement of the simulated temporal evolution of the amount of atmospheric SO2 after the eruptions with that retrieved from satellite-based observations."

We present a regional coupled ocean-atmosphere model setup for Europe, tailored to provide consistent climate change information for the North and Baltic Seas. The simulation effectively captures the mean climate, variability, and extremes such as storm surges and marine heatwaves. Using this setup, we will contribute climate projections to EURO-CORDEX. 
 Evaluation results from the reanalysis-driven (ERA5/ORAS5) simulation for the years 1979–2021 with a regional coupled ocean–atmosphere model (ROAM) are presented. The coupled setup portrayed here is one of the first regional climate modeling systems to couple the ICON atmosphere model in climate limited-area mode (CLM) with the ocean model NEMO for the North and Baltic Sea (NBS), using a flux-based OASIS3-MCT coupling approach. Along with the simulation using the coupled model configuration ROAM-NBS, the simulations with the uncoupled components (ICON-CLM and NEMO-NBS, respectively) are analyzed and compared with various observational datasets. ROAM-NBS complements atmosphere-only climate projections with the same atmospheric model and setup, which will all be published in accordance with EURO-CORDEX specifications. Climate projections by ROAM-NBS will enrich the data available to support the German Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change (DAS), especially for our target region, which are the German national waters.In general, the mean model climate is well represented by all setups. The sea surface temperature (SST) bias is, on average, about ±0.5 K. Differences in fluxes and precipitation over the ocean between the coupled and uncoupled simulations are largely related to SST differences. However, the mean influence on the land areas is negligible. The evaluations of ocean variables indicate a strong agreement between ROAM-NBS and NEMO-NBS. Compared to observations, both simulations overestimate sea ice concentration and extent. Mean temperature and salinity profiles in the Baltic Sea are generally reproduced by both simulations, with biases in the deeper layers. Major inflow events are captured but underestimated. Sea surface height and storm surge highly coincide with observational data, with NEMO-NBS slightly outperforming ROAM-NBS in terms of correlation. The marine heat wave (MHW) evaluation against observations in the North and Baltic Sea demonstrates that the simulations capture the inter-annual variability of MHW characteristics.Overall, the coupled simulation demonstrates adequate performance for both the atmosphere and the ocean, and the setup will be used to produce coupled regional climate projections for Europe. However, bias correction for the deeper Baltic layers remains necessary for further applications, and future work will focus on refining the setup for this region."

Using virtual potential temperature, a ratio-based cost function, and a microphysics closure, it reduces biases relative to ERA5 and 1D-Var, improves cloud liquid water representation, and enhances heavy rainfall precursors, extending lead times. This approach strengthens continuous profiling and supports high-impact weather nowcasting. 
 Ground-based microwave radiometers (GMWRs) provide continuous thermodynamic profiling but suffer from degraded accuracy under cloudy and precipitating conditions when using classical one-dimensional variational (1D-Var) retrievals. To address this, we develop a thermodynamic-constrained Kalman filter variational framework (TCKF1D-Var) that enforces moist-thermodynamic consistency through the use of virtual potential temperature as the control variable, employs a ratio-based cost function independent of prescribed background and observation error covariances, and integrates a diagnostic microphysics closure to represent liquid and ice water. Validation over 44 GMWR sites in North China, including seven with collocated radiosondes, shows that TCKF1D-Var systematically reduces temperature and humidity biases relative to ERA5 (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis version 5) and 1D-Var, with the largest improvements above 2 km for temperature and below 5.5 km for humidity. Temperature root-mean-square errors remain comparable to ERA5 and lower than 1D-Var below 8.5 km, while humidity errors are improved near the surface though degraded in the mid-troposphere due to vertical-resolution mismatch and channel cross-talk. Evaluation against collocated EarthCARE (Earth Clouds, Aerosols and Radiation Explorer) cloud liquid water content profiles demonstrates that TCKF1D-Var yields the lowest biases and errors and best reproduces observed distributions, confirming the benefit of the microphysics constraint. Case analyses of short-duration heavy rainfall further show that TCKF1D-Var enhances precursor signals of convection, extending the effective lead time for early warning relative to ERA5 and substantially outperforming 1D-Var. These results highlight the value of embedding physical constraints and microphysical closure within GMWR retrievals, offering a practical pathway to improve continuous thermodynamic monitoring and support high-impact weather nowcasting."

We present a number of challenges associated with concentrated viscous deformation and demonstrate strategies to overcome them. The strategies include automatic selection of appropriate time steps to react to rapid changes in model behavior, automatic rescaling to avoid rounding errors, and three methods to prevent model instability. This way, we are able to accurately capture very fast viscous deformation. 
 Strain localization is among the most challenging mechanical phenomena for computational Earth sciences. Accurately capturing it is difficult because strain localization initiates spontaneously, is self-accelerating, and its characteristic length and time scales are typically significantly smaller than the spatial and temporal resolutions of the model. This results in an undesirable dependence of the model behavior on numerical parameters and comes at a large computational cost. Strain localization is most commonly associated with brittle failure, but processes such as thermal runaway can also result in rapid ductile localization.  Here, we present a numerical model to investigate thermal runaway, and propose strategies to overcome the challenges associated with resolving rapid localization: (i) adaptive time stepping; (ii) adaptive rescaling; (iii) viscosity regularization; and (iv) gradient regularization. We demonstrate the effect of these strategies in one- and two-dimensional models. We rely on the accelerated pseudo-transient method to solve the governing equations and use graphics processing units to accelerate two-dimensional computations.  Our adaptive time stepping strategy allows us to accurately capture spontaneous and rapid stress release during thermal runaway while reducing time steps by more than ten orders of magnitude. Adaptive rescaling further reduces rounding errors and the number of required iterations by two orders of magnitude. Viscosity regularization and gradient regularization enable us to mitigate resolution dependencies but may differently impact the physical response of the model. Viscosity regularization results in lower slip velocities, whereas gradient regularization results in lower temperatures and broader shear zones."

Conventional recycling techniques typically produce low-value materials, failing to recover the inherent chemical potential. This study presents an upcycling strategy that converts copper from hazardous waste etchant directly into a highly active (Pb,Mn)-doped Cu2O electrocatalyst. This catalyst exhibits exceptional activity for C–N coupling between nitrate pollutant and biomass-derived acetone to produce acetoxime, a valuable chemical, with 97.94% selectivity. Advanced spectroscopic techniques and density functional theory calculations reveal that such high activity originates from the synergistic effect of Pb/Mn-doping and oxygen vacancies in the catalyst, which facilitates the formation of the *NH2OH reaction intermediate via an •H-mediated hydrogenation process. Techno-economic analysis confirms a substantial profit of over $1500 per ton of acetoxime produced. The general applicability of this methodology is demonstrated by its successful extension to 31 distinct industrial waste sources.

Currently, research on the isotopic composition of combustion-derived water vapor (CDWV) predominantly relies on theoretical calculations. This has hindered the comprehensive understanding of the characteristic patterns in isotopic variations and associated isotopic fractionation mechanisms during CDWV formation. In this study, we systematically investigated the variation characteristics in the isotopic composition of water vapor emitted from the combustion of various fuels and initially established the characteristic isotopic signatures of CDWV. The δ18O–H2Ov produced by fossil fuel combustion inherits the isotopic signature of atmospheric O2, resulting in a significantly positive δ18Ov value (> +10‰) and markedly negative d-excessv (< −200‰) characteristic. Through this study, we demonstrated the reliability and universality of the theoretical values of CDWV isotopic composition. Through experiments, we observed the dynamic variations in isotopic compositions and water vapor mixing ratios during fossil fuel combustion processes. The distinct isotopic disparity between the CDWV and the natural water vapor enables us to use d-excessv as a quantitative tracer for estimating the contribution of anthropogenic fossil fuel combustion to atmospheric moisture."

As a result, nontire uses such as footwear, gloves, seals, and construction materials remain poorly quantified, leaving a critical gap in understanding their growing contributions to resource demand, stock accumulation, and waste generation. Here, we develop a 45 year dynamic material flow analysis (1978 to 2022) of rubber in China that covers 12 virgin rubber types, 7 product categories, 8 application sectors, and 7 end-of-life pathways. The model also accounts for fillers, chemical additives, and microrubber particle releases during use. Results show by 2022, nontire products reached 22.5 Mt·yr–1 (67% of total consumption), driving rapid growth in special use synthetic rubbers (SSR) and thermoplastic elastomers (TPE). In-use rubber stocks in nontransportation sectors accumulated to 156.2 Mt (89% of the national total), indicating substantial future waste streams. Yet, only 27% of recycled rubber came from nontire products, reflecting persistent barriers in collection, sorting, and processing. These results demonstrate the growing significance of nontire uses and underscore the need for upstream material innovation, clearer classification and statistics, and downstream sector-specific waste management to close rubber loops and reduce environmental pressures."

Herein, machine learning (ML) was employed to design catalysts with SO2 resistance. A multidimensional data set containing 242 data points was constructed, including elemental descriptors, catalyst structures, reaction conditions, and SO2 poisoning conditions. Regression models such as XGBoost (XGB) were trained to predict NOx conversions and SO2 resistance over different catalysts. It was found that the electronegativity descriptor (EN.) was the critical factor influencing NOx conversions in the presence of SO2, with approximately a monotonic positive correlation trend with NOx conversions within the range of 0.7–0.8. Based on these findings, quaternary CeMoFe/Ti catalysts were further synthesized via an inverse design. It was observed that this catalyst could still maintain 60% NOx conversion in the presence of SO2 after  6 h at 250 °C, wherein the SO2 resistance was significantly improved compared to ternary CeMo/Ti (∼40%) and binary Ce/Ti (∼4%) catalysts. In addition, the ML revealed the core roles of EN. in the design of SO2 resistance catalysts, breaking through the limitations of traditional ternary catalyst systems. This study provided a data-driven  paradigm for  precise design of SO2 resistance catalysts for the LT-SCR reaction, holding promise to accelerate the research and development of effective catalysts."

In this study, we evaluate a family of Fe(III) complexes and their corresponding molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) as efficient, green catalysts for the oxidative degradation of representative dyes: methyl orange, methylene blue (MB), and malachite green (MG). In solution studies revealed that the nature of the ligand influences the relative contributions of radical-mediated and high-valent Fe(V)═O oxidation pathways, enabling tunable reactivity. The most active complexes were used as templates to generate water-compatible MIPs that combine adsorption with Fenton-like degradation. The best performing MIPs were those containing the bis(2-pyridylmethyl)amine complex (Fe-BMPA@MIP), prepared either without pH adjustment (ca. pH 3) or at pH 6. Both achieved 65–98% dye decolorization in 3 h while minimizing iron leaching and converted MB and MG into lower molecular weight products with reduced cytotoxicity. A test in MB-spiked paper-mill effluent further confirmed near-complete decolorization by Fe-BMPA@MIP under realistic conditions. Collectively, these results highlight Fe(III)-complex-imprinted polymers as promising for the design of versatile and efficient pre-treatment platforms that reduce dye pollutant hazards in greener wastewater treatment processes."

Whether phytoplankton can directly produce RDOC has remained untested. Here, we show that two ecologically contrasting diatoms, Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Chaetoceros sp. DS1, intrinsically release RDOC that persists against microbial degradation. Between 21 and 36% of direct diatom-released DOC is biorefractory (operationally defined as DOC resistant to microbial degradation over 90 days), molecularly enriched in sulfur-containing compounds, and distinct from microbially reprocessed RDOC. Comparative analyses against a global ocean DOC molecular data set reveal that diatom-released RDOC signatures are ubiquitous throughout the water column, from surface to abyssal depths, accounting for a substantial fraction of oceanic DOC. We roughly estimate that direct diatom RDOC production can contribute 0.2–2.2 Pg C yr–1 in global oceans, representing an important and previously underappreciated contribution to oceanic carbon storage. These findings confirm phytoplankton as direct and globally significant contributors to recalcitrant carbon storage, expanding the framework of ocean carbon sequestration."

Here, we present high-resolution oceanographic measurements from a submesoscale cyclone in the Western Mediterranean Sea, revealing a pronounced subsurface accumulation of textile microfibers (MFs) within the eddy core (0.34 MF l–1) relative to surrounding waters (0.09 MF l–1). This enrichment persisted in a secondary, smaller cyclone that detaches following the main cyclone’s fragmentation. Elevated chlorophyll-a concentrations in the upper 40 m, driven by isopycnal uplift, point to a coupled biological response to physical forcing. Spatial heterogeneity in pollution sources, vertical circulation, and mixing likely explains the observed microfiber distribution. Our findings demonstrate that submesoscale cyclones can function as transient yet efficient reservoirs of man-made contaminants, with potential consequences for pollutant exposure pathways and trophic transfer in marine ecosystems."

Quantitative dose–response relationships obtained from NAMs are often dichotomized into categorical outcomes (toxic/nontoxic), introducing uncertainty and potential misclassification in hazard characterization because the applicability domain of NAMs is currently constrained to the medium-hydrophobicity segment of the chemical universe. Until physicochemical limitations to the testability of (super)hydrophobic chemicals are overcome and hydrophilic and charged chemicals are tested at higher doses than  is present practice, “no response” should not be equated with an absence of toxicity. Toxicity is not categorical─it is the dose that makes the poison. Data gaps for difficult-to-test chemicals can be filled with baseline toxicity predictions. Baseline toxicity is the minimum toxicity, but it is often a robust predictor. Persistence constitutes a hazard criterion in its own right. Combining persistence with toxicity into a “persistent toxicity” metric may provide a more integrative indicator of the hazard potential. Persistent toxicity indicators measured with NAMs could play a pivotal role in comparative hazard assessment for substitution chemicals and the development of safe and sustainable by design (SSbD) chemicals."

Here, we develop a machine learning framework that integrates multiendpoint toxicity data with semisupervised learning to predict the toxicity of untested DBPs. We compiled four data sets encompassing cytotoxicity in CHO and HepG2 cells, developmental toxicity in zebrafish embryos, and genotoxicity in CHO cells, covering 227 DBPs with standardized endpoints (LC50, EC50). By unifying these data sets and incorporating endpoint-specific parameters (cell type, exposure duration), our model achieved robust predictive performance (R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 0.44), outperforming single-endpoint models (R2 = 0.41–0.73). To expand applicability, we implemented semisupervised learning with a hybrid acquisition function balancing structural similarity and prediction uncertainty, increasing coverage of structurally similar compounds by 18%. Predictions on untested DBPs revealed that several unregulated classes, particularly iodinated acetonitrile, halogenated diones, and halobenzoquinones, exhibit 2–10× higher toxicity than regulated trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids. Notably, haloacetonitriles dominate cytotoxicity and genotoxicity rankings, whereas halobenzoquinones show elevated developmental toxicity. This integrated framework, strengthened by external validation, provides a robust tool to prioritize toxic DBPs, guiding monitoring strategies and informing regulatory standards for safer drinking water."

Certain BrC chromophores act as photosensitizers by producing reactive oxidants such as singlet oxygen (1O2*) and triplet excited states (3C*) upon solar irradiation, but we still cannot predict which functional groups drive the production of these excited-state oxidants. We hypothesized that since the major sink for O2*1 is solvent deactivation, water-based extractions of chromophores may (1) underestimate O2*1 production in BBOA, as well as (2) overlook water-insoluble chromophores potentially important in hydrophobic aerosol phases. To better represent the multiphase nature of atmospheric aerosols in this work, we employed a cosolvent extraction using acetonitrile and water to extract the hydrophobic fraction of BrC chromophores. Primary organic aerosol (POA) filters from the combustion of beechwood, cow dung, straw, and plastic were collected during the BAMBE campaign and subsequently analyzed using a two-probe photochemical method with furfuryl alcohol and syringol as probes to quantify O2*1 and 3C* steady-state concentrations and quantum yields, respectively, under UVA irradiation. The acetonitrile–water mixture enhanced chromophore recovery and modulated the quenching of the excited state of O2*1 back to O2, leading to up to a 6-fold increase in O2*1 concentrations. Fuel type significantly influenced oxidant yields. Beechwood and plastic extracts showed the highest O2*1 and 3C* production, up to 4.9 ± 0.1% for O2*1 and 4.2 ± 0.2% for 3C*, respectively. Complementary FIGAERO–CIMS analysis revealed compositional differences between fuels and combustion conditions, suggesting that nitrogen-containing species drove the variability in sensitization efficiency. Our findings underscore the importance of solvent selection and fuel source in assessing BrC photochemical activity and offer new insights into the oxidative potential of BBOA in atmospheric multiphase environments."

In a graded observational cohort with documented occupational noise histories, we integrated serum metabolomics, lipidomics, and immunophenotyping with interpretable machine learning. Mediation analysis suggested that a panel of metabolites, including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), fumaric acid, and sphingolipids, accounted for a substantial proportion of the association between noise exposure and tinnitus severity (indirect effect = 92%, p < 0.001). Lipidomic profiling indicated early sphingolipid perturbations, followed by patterns consistent with T helper 1 (Th1)–skewed immune activation and lower circulating GABA, outlining a putative “Exposure–Metabolism–Immunity” cascade. A CatBoost predictive model trained on these features stratified tinnitus severity with 84.8% accuracy and a mean absolute error of 0.174.

This study aimed to investigate the impact of multiple air pollutants and meteorological conditions on common ocular diseases utilizing Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) and to delineate the pathogenic relationships among them. We analyzed data from 28,981 hospitalizations in ophthalmology (2019–2024) at a tertiary hospital in Wuhan, China, coupled with daily environmental data for key air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3) and meteorological parameters (temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, precipitation, etc.). Eleven distinct FCM models were developed via differential evolution algorithms to quantify both environment–disease and disease–disease interactions. Our findings indicated that optic neuropathy (ON) exhibited the highest environmental sensitivity, showing a positive correlation with PM10. Besides, positive associations were identified between minimum temperature and glaucoma as well as between CO exposure or temperature and cataract risk. Diseases of the Ocular Surface and Appendages (DOSA) exhibited a robust correlation with precipitation, which was negatively associated with cataract and ON. Analysis of the disease interaction network identified thyroid-associated orbitopathy (TAO) as a central hub, subject to considerable input from other ocular conditions (ON → TAO: n = 59; LDD → TAO: n = 49; DOSA → TAO: n = 57; TAO → U: n = 42; TAO ↔ S: w = 0.45; G ↔ TAO: w = 0.37; OT ↔ TAO: w = 0.72). The most robust bidirectional association was observed between ON and Ocular Trauma (OT) (average weight = 0.93). Overall, this study highlights the effectiveness of FCM for modeling in environmental ophthalmology, revealing that PM10 exerts a critical influence on optic nerve health, while temperature and precipitation serve as vital modulators in glaucoma and cataract pathways. These findings should be interpreted as offering novel insights with implications focusing on future causal validation rather than establishing deterministic relationships. These insights provide quantitative evidence supporting the potential role of environmental factors in ocular diseases, thereby underscoring the need for targeted public health strategies and optimized medical resource allocation to mitigate the ocular health hazards posed by regionally prevalent and seasonal environmentally related eye disorders."

We conducted a longitudinal study to investigate the dynamic changes in pharyngeal and gut microbiota before, during, and after acclimatization to the Mount Qomolangma region (high-altitude, 4300–5200 m above sea level, m.a.s.l.). Twenty healthy participants underwent four health visits: at baseline level (Beijing, 50 m.a.s.l.), upon arrival at the high altitude, after a week of acclimatization, and upon return to the baseline level. Throat swabs and fecal samples were collected for 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to assess microbial composition and diversity. Linear mixed-effects models were employed to estimate the altitude-associated variations in pharyngeal and gut microbes compared to the baseline. Pharyngeal microbial diversity showed statistically significant alterations after 1 week at high altitude, with the Shannon index decreasing by 12.0% (95% CI: −21.8 to −2.9%) and the Simpson index increasing by 2.6% (1.3 to 4.0%). In contrast, gut microbial diversity decreased upon initial high-altitude exposure but tended to revert to baseline after 1 week of acclimatization. Beta diversity analyses revealed significant differences in pharyngeal microbiota across visits, while gut microbiota differences were less pronounced. Using the linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) method, we identified 11 pharyngeal and four gut microbes that were differentially abundant across visits, which could shape the host’s resilience to high-altitude challenges. Our study reveals that high-altitude exposure disrupts pharyngeal and gut microbial diversity over time and modulates the abundance of some opportunistic pathogens. These shifts may mediate host responses to hypoxic environments, underscoring the microbiomes’ role in physiological acclimatization."

However, the detailed mechanisms governing the loss of relativistic electrons have remained unclear, largely due to the limited energy coverage and coarse resolution of previous measurements. Here we report high‐resolution observations of bursty electron precipitation across a broad energy range (0.3–2.3 MeV), obtained by the Relativistic Electron and Proton Telescope integrated little experiment‐2 (REPTile‐2) onboard the Colorado Inner Radiation Belt Experiment (CIRBE) CubeSat. REPTile‐2 employs a novel instrument design that minimizes background to enable clean spectral measurements with the highest energy resolution achieved to date in low‐Earth orbit for this energy range. During the conjunction events when CIRBE was close to the same field line with Arase satellite at higher altitudes, our analysis shows that pitch angle diffusion driven by chorus waves can fully account for the observed three bursty precipitation events over the entire energy range. These results provide the definitive evidence for a unified chorus‐driven electron loss process acting across a wide energy range and underscore the critical importance of high‐resolution measurements in resolving long‐standing uncertainties in radiation belt dynamics. Furthermore, they offer new insight into the energy‐dependent atmospheric impacts of electron precipitation, with broad implications for space weather forecasting and upper atmospheric chemistry."

However, following calcite formation, the accumulated thermoluminescence (TL) signal can date the initial subaerial exposure event. This study pioneers the application of isothermal thermoluminescence (ITL) dating of reef calcite from the Xisha Islands, South China Sea. ITL single‐aliquot regenerative‐dose protocol improved the precision of equivalent dose measurement.

We further apply multilinear regression to assess the regional contributions and statistical significance of changes in five key climate modes: the El Niño‐Southern Oscillation, NAO, Southern Annular Mode, Indian Ocean Dipole, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.

A global compilation of magma injection rates in subduction zones derived from satellite geodetic data indicates that rates such as those of Aniakchak are not sustained over periods of time longer than 1 year. Therefore, pulses like that on their own are usually not likely to reach the conditions that promote eruptions, unless the reservoir is very close to failure."

L. Chan,Do Tropical Cyclones Have a Steady Translation Under a Uniform Steering Flow?,"Changes in tropical cyclone (TC) movement are commonly attributed to those in the steering flow, beta effect, or topographic influences. However, a series of idealized simulations suggest that significant track deflections can still occur even under a steady steering flow on an f plane. TCs embedded in easterly flows of varying strength systematically deflect southward from the expected westward track when radiative effects are included. The resulting track deflection reaches approximately 200 km in some experiments over a 144‐hr period, comparable to typical 72‐ to 96‐hr forecast errors in global numerical weather prediction model. A potential vorticity tendency analysis reveals that the deflection primarily results from the diabatic heating and horizontal advection terms, each linked to asymmetries in the convection and wind fields, respectively. These asymmetries are initially triggered by vortex–flow interactions and further enhanced by radiative diurnal cycles. Our findings highlight the role of internal vortex asymmetries in modulating TC motion."

Methoxyphenols in the atmosphere are pivotal in modulating climate change, secondary particle pollution, and human health risks. However, the quantity of methoxyphenol emissions from vegetation due to wildfires and their spatiotemporal trends remain unclear on a global scale. Here, we established a global atmospheric emission inventory of methoxyphenol due to wildfires at 0.25° × 0.25° resolution from 2001 to 2020, and clarified their global spatial distribution and seasonal variations. The annual emissions of methoxyphenol released by wildfires globally range from 798.6 to 1385.3 Gg, with Africa being the region with the highest emissions. Among the cumulative emissions of methoxyphenols, the emission of methyl syringol is the highest, reaching 2809.6 Gg. Simultaneously, alkyl and ketone substituents have higher emissions than those of acid substances. For land cover types, the proportion of methoxyphenols emitted from the burning of deciduous broadleaf forests is the highest, possibly because the fallen leaves provide ample fuel for the fire. These findings depict the global methoxyphenol pollution caused by wildfires, providing a foundation for further exploration of the methoxyphenols‐mediated environmental, climate, and health effects from wildfires."

However, the improvement in deep soil simulation remains challenging as limited by the relative shallow penetration depth (< 5 cm). With advancements in satellite RS technologies like P‐band sensors, retrieving deeper SM has become increasingly feasible. Here, we demonstrate the potentially added value of enriched deep soil moisture information in land surface data assimilation (DA) by using ground‐based SM observations from a dense monitoring network in the central Tibetan Plateau. Specifically, a cost function‐based multi‐layer SM DA framework is developed to optimize soil texture profiles and organic matter content. A series of DA experiments were conducted to explore the optimal assimilation and optimization depths. The results suggest that assimilation of top 20 cm SM is adequate to reasonably optimize key soil parameters for all soil layers, and thereby improves SM estimates to the depth of 40 cm. This improvement can further propagate into soil temperature profiles and surface flux (e.g., evapotranspiration) estimates. Besides, the performance of deep SM DA is found insensitive to assimilation frequency varying up to 5 days, highlighting the promise and feasibility of regional land DA with 0–20 cm SM products, which are readily accessible from future satellite missions."

These vortices impact surface weather in various ways, and their dynamics may be affected by recent anthropogenic climate change. However, key aspects of these dynamics, such as the processes of energy and helicity cascading, remain unclear. In this study, we propose a novel approach to studying polar vortex dynamics that considers kinetic helicity. Mainly using ERA5 reanalysis data but also Aeolus Level 2C wind data, we examine the evolution of kinetic helicity in the stratosphere over the Arctic region during winter 2022/23. Our focus is on the formation and stability of the polar vortex, as well as sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs). We find that the polar vortex is strongly helical, with the sign of kinetic helicity depending on the evolutionary stage of the vortex. Our analysis of the kinetic energy and kinetic helicity spectra reveals the presence of dual cascades during vortex formation. The spectral properties of the stratosphere over the Arctic change seasonally and as a function of the magnitude of the kinetic energy and helicity, with spectra being steeper during polar vortex activity. Similar correlations are absent for the spectra in the troposphere. Finally, we found that the evolution of kinetic enstrophy and helicity can predict the occurrence of SSWs with an accuracy of approximately 8 days."

 Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) are small, airless bodies that orbit in near-Earth space. Recent studies suggest that their surface rocks can undergo crack growth and fragmentation through thermal fatigue induced by diurnal temperature cycling. This process may expose materials yet to be altered by solar wind irradiation and micrometeorite impacts, known as surface rejuvenation. However, the mechanism that generates the initial cracks required to trigger thermal fatigue fragmentation remains poorly understood despite its importance for understanding the geophysical evolution of asteroids. Here we use numerical approaches to show that stony, or S-complex NEAs, the most compositionally common group, can experience rapid temperature changes, or thermal shocks, sufficient to generate microcracks in surface rocks as they pass through the shadow of a terrestrial planet. Our statistical analysis of backward orbital integrations demonstrates that these asteroids pass through planetary shadows more often than they encounter planets closely enough for planetary tides to rejuvenate their surfaces. We also found that shadow passages are shorter than typical asteroid spin periods, indicating that expansion stress from rapid heating occurs immediately after contraction stress from rapid cooling. These results suggest that thermal shock caused by planetary shadows may help trigger the surface rejuvenation of stony NEAs. Stony near-Earth asteroids may undergo fragmentation of surface rocks triggered by thermal shocks as they pass through the shadows of terrestrial planets, leading to surface rejuvenation, according to orbital simulations and thermophysical modelling."

 The high prevalence of diabetes mellitus-induced erectile dysfunction (DMED) in males and the limited efficacy of existing therapies necessitate deeper mechanistic insights. We identify pathological lactate accumulation in the corpus cavernosum as a major driver of DMED in male mice, promoting structural degeneration and smooth muscle cell loss. Mechanistically, transcriptional repression and functional impairment of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (Fbp1), a rate-limiting gluconeogenic enzyme, underlie this lactate accumulation. Epigenetic profiling revealed suppression of Fbp1 transcription associated with histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation. Palmitoylation at the FBP1 Cys282 residue, catalyzed by zinc finger DHHC-type containing 13, further disrupted its gluconeogenic function, exacerbating lactate accumulation. To rescue these defects, we engineered lipid nanoparticles loaded with the Fbp1-C282S mutant mRNA, restoring FBP1 expression, blocking pathological palmitoylation, and ultimately improving erectile function in diabetic male mice. Here, our study in male mice identifies cavernosal lactate accumulation as a central pathological factor, elucidates its molecular regulation, and provide a targeted therapeutic strategy for DMED.

Here the authors reveal distinct roles of TPP1 and POT1 in telomerase recruitment and telomere protection using siingle-cell telomerase activity assay. 
 Telomeres are proposed to alternate between “closed” states, in which chromosome ends are protected from DNA damage signaling and inaccessible to telomerase, and “open” states, where they become accessible for telomerase mediated elongation but less protected. Whether these states reflect distinct molecular mechanisms or mutually exclusive structural conformations remains unclear. Here, we develop a single-cell assay to monitor telomerase activity in mouse embryonic stem cells. Using this approach, we demonstrate that the shelterin component TPP1 is essential for telomerase recruitment via its interaction with TIN2, independently of POT1. In contrast, POT1 is dispensable for telomerase function but required for telomere end protection, acting independently of TPP1. These findings challenge the classical open-closed telomere model and reveal that telomerase recruitment and end protection are mediated by genetically and molecularly separable mechanisms. Telomeres need to open from a close state which protects the chromosome ends to allow extension by telomerase.

 Biomolecular condensates are essential for cellular organization, yet their formation dynamics and molecular content exchange properties remain poorly understood. Here we show that flow cytometry provides a high-throughput, solution-based platform for analyzing condensate behavior at the single-droplet level. Using self-interacting NPM1 condensates as a model, we demonstrate that this approach quantifies phase behavior across protein and salt conditions, measures the partitioning of diverse macromolecules—including antibodies, lipids, small-molecule drugs, and RNA—and detects molecular colocalization with high statistical precision. Importantly, we establish a high-throughput assay to track real-time molecular exchange between preformed condensates and newly added, orthogonally tagged protein. These measurements reveal that condensate aging significantly reduces molecular dynamisms, likely due to altered biophysical properties with time. Compared to conventional imaging techniques that require surface immobilization or complex instrumentation, our method enables rapid, quantitative characterization of condensate dynamics and molecular content, providing a scalable framework for probing condensate function.

 Reducing the energy cost and CO2 emission of traditional urea synthesis through alternative strategy is crucial for the sustainable social development. Herein, we report the electrosynthesis of urea from nitrate and CO2 on Ag/CdO heterostructured catalyst with low overpotential. The optimized Ag0.07/CdO catalyst demonstrates a high urea yield rate of 111.6 ± 3.1 mmol gcat.–1 h–1 with 50.0 ± 2.7% Faradaic efficiency at −0.15 V vs. RHE in a flow cell, and can further achieve a urea yield rate of 427.0 ± 30.2 mmol gcat.–1 h–1 in an optimized two-electrode cell with stable response for 1000 h. Operando spectroscopy and theoretical calculations indicate that Ag attracts *NO2 intermediate as well as promotes the reconstruction of CdO into low coordinated CdCO3 that facilitate the activation of CO2, thus benefits *CO/*NO2 adsorption and coupling at low overpotential as well as suppresses the generation of CO and NH3 by-products.

Here, the authors show that in fruit flies, a hormone released from the productive organs increases and sustains sexual drive through a feedback loop with the brain. 
 The interplay between the nervous and reproductive systems, encapsulated by the brain-gonad axis, is pivotal for reproduction. However, it remains largely unclear how hormones released from reproductive system actively regulate male sexual behaviors and mating strategies. Here we find that sexual priming induces an elevated sexual drive in both male mice and Drosophila, triggered by the surge of circulating steroid hormones 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) in flies and testosterone in mice, respectively. In Drosophila, 20E is released from the male reproductive system upon sexual priming, which is controlled by a descending brain-gonad pathway composed of P1 neurons, Dsk neurons, and Crz/CrzR neurons. In return, 20E activates P1 neurons to elevate and sustain male flies’ mating drive. The enhanced mating drive not only fosters consequent mating success but also makes full use of the reproductive materials prepared during the pre-ejaculatory emission stage, e.g., seminal proteins which would otherwise be potentially harmful to males’ gonads. Collectively, our study offers insights into how hormones regulate males’ reproductive strategies.

Here, the authors show that, in embryonic stem cells, the pluripotency factor OCT4 promotes early activation of normally late-firing replication origins by increasing local chromatin accessibility. 
 DNA replication initiates at specific genomic regions known as initiation zones (IZs), which follow a defined spatiotemporal program that is partially dependent on cell type. Here, we examine the replication-initiation patterns of pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), which are characterized by a very short G1 phase and rapid entry into S phase. Using EdU-seq combined with cell-cycle synchronization and Repli-seq, we identify IZs that activate during S phase in mESCs and classify them as early, mid, or late according to the replication-timing (RT) domain to which they map. Remarkably, we find that some IZs mapping to mid or late RT domains activate within 1–2 hours of entry into S phase. Chromatin and nascent-transcriptome profiling reveal that these IZs associate with regions of open chromatin structure that are bound by the pluripotency factor OCT4. Transient OCT4 depletion reduces both chromatin accessibility and replication-initiation efficiency at these sites. These results provide an example of a pioneer factor, OCT4, facilitating DNA replication initiation by promoting local chromatin accessibility.

Here, the authors present a bioadaptive nickel single atom catalyst that resists organic poisoning to enable high-rate CO-mediated isopropanol production from CO2. 
 Hybrid systems that integrate electrochemical CO2 reduction with microbial upgrading offer a viable route to high value organic compounds from CO2 at ambient conditions. However, electrocatalyst deactivation in microbial growth media remains a key barrier, limiting efficiency and increasing cost. Here we show that a bioadaptive single-atom nickel catalyst (Ni SAC), coupled with genetically engineered Clostridium ljungdahlii, enables robust electrosynthesis of isopropanol (IPA) from CO2 via a CO-mediated pathway. Instead of relying on H2 as an electron carrier, the system applies high-rate CO formation in complex growth media, maintaining a tunable CO Faradaic efficiency up to 92%, which is 9.4 to 52.7 times greater than conventional Ag catalysts. This performance supports stable IPA production at current density of 10.8 A/m2 and production rate of 161.3 mg/L/day. In situ Raman and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, together with theoretical calculations, indicate that the Ni SAC can resist competing organic adsorption and retain its coordination structure during CO2 reduction in bioelectrolytes, providing a mechanistic basis for the catalyst stability and integrated process performance.

 Battery monitoring requires high accuracy and robustness throughout the entire lifespan to ensure safe and optimal operations. Here we introduce mechanistic leading residual learners to enhance the monitoring of battery charge and health states, as well as guide safety warnings, targeting large-scale applications. Leveraging prior knowledge from real-time filtering as primary guidance, complemented by mechanistic and statistical features, our approach significantly improves accuracy and robustness. We propose and validate two general residual learning pipelines, namely the correction model and compensation model, across various scenarios, encompassing different battery types, loading profiles, aging conditions, and environmental conditions, using three aging datasets under dynamic cycling. Our method achieves a relative root mean square error reduction of over 50% from the results observed in prior estimations. The extrapolation capability under unseen conditions, along with interpretability, enhances both accuracy and trustworthiness. The models remain effective even with reduced training data and sampling frequency, maintaining the potential for practical electric vehicle applications. Application demonstrations confirm the efficacy in providing continuous monitoring across lifespan without the need for offline testing and model calibration during operation.

 Oceans provide essential benefits to people and the economy, underpinned by the extent and condition of marine ecosystems and infrastructure—or ‘blue’ capital. However, the impacts of climate change on blue capital have been largely overlooked in influential indicators such as the social cost of carbon (SCC). Here we integrate the latest ocean science and economics into a climate-economy model, capturing climate change impacts on corals, mangroves, seaports, fisheries and mariculture to estimate their welfare repercussions at a global scale. Conceptually, this ocean-based SCC (blue SCC) represents a component of the total SCC currently omitted in standard estimates. We estimate the 2020 blue SCC to be US$48 per tCO2 (US$38–70, 25th–75th percentile) with baseline discounting, representing an almost doubling of the SCC estimate from the same model without considering ocean-related impacts.

Mack,Increased deciduous tree dominance reduces wildfire carbon losses in boreal forests,"More frequent fires in the North American boreal are causing shifts from conifer to deciduous forests. This study finds that when deciduous forests burn, their carbon losses are driven by weather, but are lower than in conifer forests, potentially dampening climate–fire feedbacks. 
 Climate change is driving more frequent and severe wildfires in northwestern North American boreal forests, initiating shifts from conifer to broadleaf deciduous forest dominance. The resulting forests sequester more carbon and are more resistant to burning. However, when deciduous forests do burn, patterns and drivers of carbon losses are important for predicting long-term carbon storage in boreal forest landscapes. Here we use a combination of field and statistical modelling approaches to quantify carbon combustion losses in burned deciduous boreal forests. On average, deciduous forests lose less than half as much carbon to wildfire combustion as conifer forests per unit burned area. Although deciduous stands are more sensitive to top–down fire weather drivers than conifer stands, carbon loss is always lower than the minimum for conifer stands. This, along with the fire-suppressive effects of deciduous stands, could slow the positive feedback between wildfire and climate in fire-prone boreal landscapes. More frequent fires in the North American boreal are causing shifts from conifer to deciduous forests. This study finds that when deciduous forests burn, their carbon losses are driven by weather, but are lower than in conifer forests, potentially dampening climate–fire feedbacks."

Muñoz;Jesús Peña-Izquierdo;Laia Romero;Albert Soret;Markus G. Donat,Data-driven seasonal climate predictions via variational inference and transformers,"Data-driven seasonal climate predictions via variational inference and transformers 
 Most operational climate services providers base their seasonal predictions on initialised general circulation models (GCMs) or empirical statistical techniques. GCMs are widely used but require substantial computational resources, limiting their capacity. In contrast, statistical methods often lack robustness due to the short historical records available. Recent works propose machine learning methods trained on climate model output, leveraging larger sample sizes. Yet, many of these studies focus on prediction tasks that may be restricted in spatial or temporal extent, thereby creating a gap with existing operational predictions. Others fail to disentangle the sources of skill in the context of climate change, where strong trends provide spurious estimates. This study combines variational inference with transformers to predict global and regional seasonal anomalies of temperature and rainfall. The model is trained on output from CMIP6 and tested using ERA5 reanalysis data. Temperature predictions demonstrate skill beyond the climatology and climate-change trend and even outperform the numerical state-of-the-art system SEAS5 in some ocean and land areas. Precipitation forecasts show more limited skill, with fewer regions outperforming climatology and fewer surpassing SEAS5. Furthermore, the consistency found in both teleconnections and skill spatial patterns against SEAS5 suggests that both systems build on similar sources of predictability."

 Accurate monitoring of seasonal to decadal snow cover dynamics is essential for climate change attribution and sustainable water resource management. As part of the European Space Agency (ESA) Snow Climate Change Initiative (CCI+) Phase-2 project, this study introduces an Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) snow cover fraction (SCF) product portfolio, with a particular emphasis on the development of AVHRR10C1.V4—the first 45-year (1979–2023), global, daily SCF product. This dataset achieves unprecedented temporal consistency by addressing long-standing challenges such as orbital drift, inter-sensor inconsistencies, reduced cloud contamination, and enhanced SCF retrieval accuracy. The AVHRR10C1.V4 product was generated by integrating newly calibrated EUMETSAT AVHRR Fundamental Data Record (FDR) data from 16 AVHRR sensors on a 0.05° grid through a calibration method, modified cloud masking, an updated SCF retrieval method, refined post-processing, and a novel consolidation framework. Comprehensive validation against 66 high-resolution Landsat/Sentinel-2 SCF maps and extensive ground-based snow measurements confirms the robust accuracy of the AVHRR10C1.V4 product: root mean square errors of 16–19% for viewable snow cover fraction (SCFV) and 18–28% for ground snow cover fraction (SCFG), with overall accuracy (OA) ranging from 0.80 to 0.92. The consolidation approach remarkably reduces RMSEs by 7%–48% and lowers missing data rates by ∼30% compared to single-sensor products. The product maintains strong temporal consistency with ERA5-Land SCF product (R > 0.8) and in situ snow measurements. Statistical analysis over the 45-year record and multiple separate periods confirms minimal sensor-drift biases, revealing no statistically significant breakpoints or drift trends (Mann-Kendall p > 0.05). While the SCFV product proves robust to variations in viewing geometry and vegetation conditions, SCFG accuracy is more sensitive to forest cover density—exhibiting substantially increased estimation uncertainties in dense forest canopies (forest cover density > 50%) due to canopy radiative effects and the use of static land cover assumptions. This open-access, climate data record–quality AVHRR10C1.V4 product establishes a critical benchmark for studying snow-climate interactions and long-term cryospheric monitoring. It supports the development of next-generation global SCF products, enabling reliable detection of snow trends, improved hydrological modeling, and informed climate adaptation in a warming climate."

 The rapid spread and destructive nature of wildfires and volcanic activity have intensified the need for low latency detection systems. The growing intensity and frequency of globally distributed thermal hotspots have driven the development of satellite-based detection solutions. Conventional approaches rely on ground-based processing, which limits low latency capabilities due to revisit times over ground stations and data handling requirements. This work proposes the first onboard payload processing pipeline for segmentation of thermal hotspots in raw multispectral satellite imagery. The pipeline leverages the Near InfraRed (NIR) and Short-Wave InfraRed (SWIR) spectral bands, and the combination of onboard Artificial Intelligence (AI) and raw imagery significantly reduces the delay between image acquisition and event detection. Furthermore, we present Segmentation of Thermal Hotspots in Raw Sentinel-2 data (SegTHRawS), the first publicly available dataset for thermal hotspot segmentation in raw multispectral satellite imagery. The segmentation model employed is a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) derived from U-Net, named ResUnet-S2, designed for fast on-device inference. This model achieved an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.988 and an F-1 score of 0.986 on SegTHRawS, with its detection and generalization capabilities validated using an external thermal hotspot segmentation dataset. The proposed pipeline was verified on CubeSat-compatible hardware, achieving an end-to-end execution, from image acquisition to event detection, in 1.45 s, faster than the image acquisition process, and consuming a peak power of 4.05 W. These results demonstrate the potential of onboard processing solutions for minimizing the detection latency of current approaches, particularly for thermal hotspot segmentation, using edge computing satellite hardware."

 Cardiovascular exercise is a popular activity that aims to improve physical fitness and overall health, however practicing outdoors enhances pollutant inhalation. The main objective was to estimate the dose received by inhalation of airborne particles during cardiovascular exercise in urban environments. Dosimetry simulations used particle mass concentrations (PM2.5, PM2.5-10) to estimate the deposited dose in the human respiratory tract that assumed a young and healthy adult male and female train at variable activity intensities. Hourly dose rates were substantially increased with activity intensity due to increased inhaled volumes, with a 9.5-fold increase from rest (60 bpm) to high-intensity exercise (170 bpm). PM levels played also a crucial role as increased concentrations were linked with increased deposition rates. Heating, and Sahara events comprised the most burdened cases with unfavorable conditions for exercise. Higher % nasal contribution for female trainees was the reason for higher deposition in the anterior nose compared to male trainees. Linking these results with a health risk showed that females have an increased risk related to a health outcome in the upper respiratory tract whereas male trainees have increased risk for a health impact in the lungs. Overall, health risk analysis verified the negative impact of elevated PM concentrations and the enhanced risk accompanied by increased intensity for experienced trainees. To prevent negative health outcomes, trainees are recommended to practice in areas with reduced particulate pollution (e.g suburban areas) and during times of the day where concentrations are expected to be lower."

 BackgroundSouth Africa experiences high levels of ambient air pollution, with PM2.5 concentrations routinely exceeding WHO guidelines of 5 μg/m3. Early childhood represents a critical window of neurodevelopmental vulnerability, yet the impacts of postnatal PM2.5 exposure on developmental outcomes remain underexplored in this context.MethodsWe analysed nationally representative data on 5222 children aged 50–59 months attending 1248 Early Learning Programmes (ELPs) across South Africa, using the Early Learning Outcomes Measure 4&5 (ELOM) to assess development across five domains. Twelve-month cumulative PM2.5 exposure at each ELP was estimated using satellite-derived, ground-calibrated data. Spatial lag and error models were employed to account for residual spatial autocorrelation.ResultsA 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure was associated with lower total ELOM scores (β = −0.12 SD, p < .05), with the largest associations observed for gross motor development (β = −0.17 SD, p < .01) and fine motor coordination (β = −0.12 SD, p < .05). No significant associations were detected for executive functioning, literacy, or numeracy domains.ConclusionThis study provides evidence of associations between ambient PM2.5 exposure and specific developmental domains in preschool-aged children in South Africa. The findings highlight the need to integrate air quality interventions into early childhood policy and to further research mechanisms, exposure timing, and mitigation."

 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) has emerged as a well-established atmospheric observing system, with Zenith Total Delay (ZTD) and integrated water vapor routinely assimilated by several global and regional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) centers. While co-derived tropospheric gradients effectively capture water vapor horizontal anisotropy, their assimilation has yet to be widely adopted. Here, we introduce a novel approach for assimilating GNSS tropospheric gradients into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model by constructing pseudo-ZTD observations from GNSS-derived ZTD and gradient data. Through two comparative experiments, we evaluate the potential influence of GNSS tropospheric gradients on WRF forecasts. The results indicate that assimilating these gradients improves humidity and wind field predictions in the lower-to-middle troposphere (850–500 hPa), with a neutral impact on surface fields. Verification against radar estimates further demonstrates enhanced precipitation forecast skills, particularly for heavy precipitation events, by better resolving the spatial distribution and intensity of precipitation systems. A diagnosis of a precipitation event suggests that the assimilation of GNSS tropospheric gradients is able to adjust the forecast mid-level moisture distribution and modulate the forecast upward motion, thereby influencing the formation of spurious precipitation."

 Under global climate change, precipitation variability and extreme events pose significant challenges to regional ecological security and water resource management. This study proposes the Dynamic Line Scanning Method (DLSM) to quantitatively assess the migration of China's 800 mm precipitation isohyet during 1961–2022. Using long-term precipitation data, we systematically examined its spatial and temporal variation, explored links with drought–flood regimes and extreme precipitation, and identified the main drivers. Results indicate that the isohyet experienced a two-phase shift: an initial southward retreat followed by accelerated northward movement after 2001, with the latter trend markedly intensifying. These shifts have directly influenced regional drought–flood patterns and altered the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events. Analysis further reveals that the East Asian Summer Monsoon Index (EASMI) is the dominant factor driving the isohyet's movement. Overall, this study provides novel methodological insights and robust empirical evidence regarding the dynamics of precipitation isohyets in China in the context of climate change. The findings enhance understanding of hydroclimatic variability and offer a scientific foundation for developing region-specific adaptation and water management strategies."

We found that obesity induced Nod-like receptor pyrin domain–containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome hyperactivation and excessive interleukin (IL)–1β production in macrophages by disrupting SAM and HD domain–containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), a deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) hydrolase crucial for nucleotide balance. This caused aberrant accumulation of dNTPs, which can be transported into mitochondria, and initiated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) neosynthesis, which increased the presence of oxidized mtDNA and triggered NLRP3 hyperactivation. Deletion of SAMHD1 promoted NLRP3 hyperactivation in cells isolated from zebrafish, mice, and humans. SAMHD1-deficient mice showed elevated circulating IL-1β, insulin resistance, and metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis. Blocking dNTP mitochondrial transport prevented NLRP3 hyperactivation in macrophages from obese patients and SAMHD1-deficient mice. Our study revealed that obesity by inhibiting SAMHD1 rewired macrophage nucleotide metabolism, thereby triggering NLRP3 inflammasome hyperactivation to drive disease progression."

However, the cells that express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I–related protein 1 (MR1) and present microbial vitamin B–derived antigens (VitBAg) to MAIT cells remain unknown. We found that MR1 expression varied across tissues and cell types. Macrophages from the lung and peritoneal cavity expressed the highest levels of MR1 and were the most efficient at capturing and presenting VitBAg to MAIT cells. Expression of MR1 in macrophages was regulated transcriptionally and induced by the tissue environment and microbiota. Depletion of MR1 in macrophages, dendritic cells, and monocytes changed the composition of the microbiota and impaired MAIT cell responses against bacterial infection. We concluded that macrophages are key for MR1 antigen presentation and MAIT cell immunity."

However, the generative mechanisms of the vast repertoire of human INs remain elusive. We performed spatial and single-cell transcriptomics of human medial ganglionic eminence (hMGE), a pivotal source of cortical and subpallial INs, and built the trajectories of hMGE-derived cells during brain development. We identified spatiotemporally and molecularly segregated progenitor cell populations fated to produce distinct IN types. We uncovered an evolutionarily distinct progenitor cell type in the hMGE subventricular zone that maintained the production of INs and glial cells throughout human brain development. Our findings reveal evolutionarily distinct features of IN generation and shed light on the distinct mechanisms underlying human brain development."

These limitations are most pronounced in colloidal perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs), given their soft ionic lattices and labile surfaces. We introduce a hierarchical shell (HS) structure comprising interbonded PbSO4-SiO2-polymer multilayers that simultaneously locks and stabilizes soft lattices and labile interfaces. HS-CsPbBr3PeNC films exhibitT90(10% PLQY loss) = 3211 hours under accelerated 60°C, 90% relative humidity (RH) andT90= 12,000 hours under blue-light exposure. HS strategy generalizes across PeNC compositions—including mixed-halide, mixed-cation, iodide, and hybrid PeNCs—and enables MAPbBr3with extendedT90= 3900 hours (60°C, 90% RH) andT90= 27,234 hours (blue light). Moreover, HS-MAPbBr3films with 100.0% PLQY eliminate self-absorption losses and achieve an EQY of 91.4%, approaching the theoretical maximum. The HS barrier also prevents lead leakage for safety of large-area, high-resolution displays and bio-optoelectronics."

Rohr,Chronic low-dose exposure to chlorpyrifos reduces life span in a wild fish by accelerating aging,"Low concentrations of chemicals are widespread in the environment, but exploration of the effects of their chronic exposures on animal life span in the wild is limited. Field investigations showed that fish populations of lake skygazer (Culter dabryi) with chronic low-dose chlorpyrifos loads had shortened telomeres and truncated age structures. Laboratory experiments confirmed that chronic low-dose chlorpyrifos exposure induced telomere degradation and reduced survival in a dose- and physiological age–dependent manner, whereas acute high-dose exposure did not. Together, these studies provide evidence that chronic low-level chlorpyrifos exposure reduces life span and population viability in a wild fish by accelerating physiological aging. Given the pervasive presence of low pesticide concentrations in the environment and the conserved mechanisms of aging across vertebrates, these findings raise concerns that even low doses of pesticides may pose long-term risks to longevity."

However, the three-dimensional organization of cardiac tissue underlying left ventricular hypertrophy remains poorly understood. We developed CaMVIA-3D, a deep-learning volumetric imaging and analysis pipeline to characterize cardiac microarchitecture. Analysis of tissues from HCM hearts revealed genotype-specific differences in cardiomyocyte volume, morphology, and extracellular volume, with pathogenic variants exhibiting greater concentric cellular hypertrophy and disarray and variant-negative cases showing predominant fibrosis. Longitudinal profiling of a pig HCM model revealed early-onset fibrosis preceding cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Integrating transcriptomic and morphologic changes, we identified genes associated with cellular and extracellular remodeling. These findings define genotype-specific microstructural differences in HCM, offering insights to improve diagnostics and targeted therapies."

Brown fat is associated with protection from cardiovascular pathology, but whether this relationship is causal remains unknown. In this work, we investigate the role of mouse beige fat, as a model of human inducible brown fat, in adipocyte-vascular cross-talk. Using adipocyte-specificPrdm16knockout mice with a loss of beige adipocyte identity, we discovered marked remodeling of perivascular adipose tissue, increased vascular reactivity, and elevated blood pressure. We show that the circulating enzyme QSOX1 is derepressed inPrdm16-deficient adipocytes, and deletion ofQsox1inPrdm16conditional knockout mice prevented vascular fibrosis and normalized vascular reactivity. These results demonstrate a key role for beige adipocytes in blood pressure regulation and identify QSOX1 as an important mediator of adipocyte-vascular cross-talk."

However, the plate configuration at the complex Mendocino triple junction, where the San Andreas Fault and the Cascadia subduction zone meet, remains uncertain. We analyzed fault slip associated with a recently identified zone of tectonic tremor and low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) near the southern edge of the subducting Gorda slab. Based on tidal sensitivity and P-wave first motions, we show that the LFEs are generated by dipping, strike-slip motion. This suggests that a former Farallon slab fragment, now captured by the Pacific plate, is translating northward beneath westernmost North America. This geometry effectively extends the slab interface fault, challenging prevailing interpretations of slab window formation and creating a potential unaccounted earthquake hazard in this region."

At the center stage are bioderived furans, from which valuable platform chemicals can be obtained exclusively through oxidative or reductive processes. By contrast, the conceptually straightforward redox-neutral hydrolysis of furan to succinaldehyde and 2-substituted furans to 1,4-ketoaldehydes has been considered unfeasible owing to their endergonicity and polymerization side reactivity. In this work, we report the realization of this uphill furan hydrolysis through photocatalysis involving a highly strained, 10-membered 1,6-dioxecine intermediate. Succinaldehyde, as well as 1,4-ketoaldehydes, can be directly obtained from furans. Additionally, furfural derivatives undergo redox-enhanced Piancatelli rearrangements, accessing antimicrobial natural products (±)-Terrein and (±)-epi-Pentenomycins. The methodology was applied to the redox-neutral production of common industrial fine chemicals, avoiding wasteful redox detours typical in biomass-based synthesis."

Saupe,Paleogeography modulates marine extinction risk throughout the Phanerozoic,"Understanding the factors that have influenced the intensity and selectivity of extinction throughout Earth’s history is important for explaining past biodiversity change and forecasting biotic responses to environmental change. Here, we investigated the role of coastline geometry and paleogeographic boundary conditions in shaping extinction risk for shallow-marine taxa over the past 540 million years. We show that interactions between the geographic distributions of taxa and the geometric configurations of continental margins consistently predict relative extinction risk: Taxa with potential dispersal pathways that are long relative to the range of latitude traversed—such as those that occur along east-west–oriented coastlines, islands, or inland seaways—consistently exhibit higher extinction risk than taxa with potential dispersal pathways that provide more direct latitude-traversing paths. This dispersal distance selectivity is amplified during mass extinction events and hyperthermal intervals, suggesting that geographic constraints become more important during periods of rapid climate change. Our results provide another mechanism that potentially contributes to the generally elevated extinction rates during the Paleozoic, an interval characterized by complex inland seas and a preponderance of east-west coastlines. These insights underscore the importance of considering paleogeographic context when interpreting past extinction patterns and provide empirical support for assumptions that underlie extinction risk assessments of extant species."

We demonstrate that ceratobranchial (“hyoid”) histology is useful for ontogenetic assessment in extant and extinct archosaurs. The ceratobranchial histology of theN. lancensisholotype indicates that it was nearing or had reached skeletal maturity, suggesting that it is taxonomically distinct from the coevalTyrannosaurus rexand that Hell Creek (and equivalent) ecosystems supported a diverse assemblage of predatory dinosaurs approaching the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction."

However, knowledge of this critical boundary has depended on interpolation between irregularly distributed geophysical surveys, creating major spatial biases in maps of Antarctica’s subglacial landscape. As stress changes associated with ice flow over bedrock obstacles produce ice surface topography, recently acquired, high-resolution satellite maps of the ice surface offer a transformative basis for mapping subglacial landforms. We present a continental-scale elevation map of Antarctica’s subglacial topography produced by applying the physics of ice flow to ice surface maps and incorporating geophysical ice thickness observations.

We demonstrate dissipationless transport, even in the presence of interactions and finite temperature, signifying ballistic propagation of conserved quantities corresponding to lowest-order hydrodynamics. Our approach provides a robust and transparent framework for characterizing transport in strongly correlated quantum matter, applicable in regimes where theory remains incomplete."
