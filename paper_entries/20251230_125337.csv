This study proposes an analogue ensemble algorithm based on historical best-track data to quantify TC track uncertainties in the along-track (AT) and cross-track (CT) directions. The results reveal a strong latitudinal variation in the dominant direction of uncertainty: AT uncertainty is larger near the equator and within the mid-latitude westerlies, whereas CT uncertainty increases in recurvature zones. Moreover, the ratio of CT to AT uncertainty exhibits a negative correlation with TC translation speed. A comparable anisotropic pattern of track uncertainty is also identified in multi-model ensemble forecasts, indicating that the state-dependent preferred direction of position variability is a natural characteristic of TC track predictions. These findings provide the global-scale quantification of intrinsic anisotropic TC track uncertainty and highlight the importance of representing anisotropic uncertainty in probabilistic risk assessment and operational forecasting."

We focus on understanding these national-scale mining impacts in Côte d’Ivoire, which is a global biodiversity hotspot within the Upper Guinean Forests that has lost >80% of its forest cover since 1960. We combine high-resolution land-use maps with a staggered difference-in-differences approach to assess deforestation and degradation dynamics after mine openings in the Côte d’Ivoire tropical moist forest (TMF) zone between 2001 and 2020. We identify 446 mining clusters, which together directly caused the loss of 5631 ha of forest. We estimate that the total effects extended far beyond mine sites, causing an additional 4.8 percentage-point increase in deforestation within 5 km over 10 years compared to unmined areas. Crucially, for every hectare of deforested land directly cleared for mining, 163 ha were deforested for other, indirect end uses—primarily agricultural and urban expansion linked to mining activity. There was little evidence of significant increases in forest degradation triggered by mining. Our results demonstrate that the true environmental impact of mining vastly exceeds the mine footprint itself and underscores the grave threat that mining poses to moist tropical forests. We recommend the urgent development of national policies and revisions to the mining code to acknowledge the wide area of effect that mining creates, and embedding mitigation efforts to minimise spillover impacts into adjacent forests."

While stratospheric intrusion is regarded as an important source of surface O₃, its contribution to O₃ concentrations is typically small compared to local near-surface photochemical processes. However, a severe O₃ pollution event occurred in China’s Pearl River Delta region with O₃ concentrations increasing by 28.2 μg m−3 during September 2–4, 2024. Our Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model analysis indicates that the maximum contribution of stratospheric origin air masses can reach 71.0% due to a distant-source transport of stratospheric intrusion caused by super typhoon YAGI. Distinct from conventional localized stratospheric intrusion, this distant-source transport, driven by a typhoon and mid-latitude systems, enables vertical transport and horizontal delivery exceeding 2000 km, with typhoon-induced subsidence completing the grounding of stratospheric O₃. These findings reveal a new dynamic mechanism of vertical downward transport for stratospheric mass and underscore the necessity of joint prevention measures against stratospheric intrusion. Failure to elucidate the mechanisms against the backdrop of a projected increase in super typhoon events may lead to a severe underestimation of stratospheric intrusion contributions to tropospheric ozone pollution."

This enhanced propagation is facilitated by a zonal asymmetry in moistening during warm pool expansion. Moisture increases more rapidly over equatorial zone compared to off-equatorial regions over the western-central Pacific, near the east expanding boundary of the warm pool. As a result, the moistening rate preceding MJO convection, which is linked to the intensified equatorward moisture gradient, outpaces the growth rate of MJO amplitude, which depends on total column moisture there. This differential establishes more favorable thermodynamic conditions for eastward propagation of MJO events from the MC into the western Pacific under global warming. By the end of the century, the emergence frequency of MJO convection over the western Pacific is projected to rise by 36%. In consequence, the intraseasonal variations of precipitation extremes induced by the large-scale MJO convection over the western Pacific may become more pronounced in future climate scenarios."

Reductionistic understandings have tended to overemphasize livestock impacts and support restrictive interventions, which can ironically undermine synergistic relationships between pastoralism and biodiversity. Within a collectively-titled pastoralist landscape in Laikipia, Kenya, we built on long-term research to examine spatial relationships between locally-varying livestock use intensity and patterns of vegetation change over a 26 year period. We integrated remote sensing, field vegetation measurements, and pastoralist expert accounts of vegetation change to map vegetation transitions and their spatial distribution. We triangulated between multiple lines of inference, including classifications of vegetation community types and transitions, maps of varying livestock use zones and topography, qualitative analysis of expert explanations of vegetation change, and NDVI time series, to infer the contributions of grazing intensity and other drivers to the observed vegetation transitions. First, the most salient landscape change was the loss of two Euphorbia spp. in ∼22% of the study area; with elephants largely driving the loss of one species, and climate being a probable driver of loss of the other. Second, approximately 40% of the area experienced some degree of shrub encroachment. Spatial comparisons with livestock use zones indicated that shrub encroachment was more likely driven by fire suppression and/or climate. Third, there was ∼26% decrease of area supporting moderate or dense herbaceous vegetation cover. These decreases were primarily associated with increasing temperature, woody encroachment, and higher livestock pressure in areas that both formerly supported Euphorbia spp. canopies and also experienced year-round livestock use imposed through a conservation intervention. We recommend integrative triangulation between multiple epistemologies to understand how landscape changes in dryland ecosystems are driven by complex, interacting drivers such as spatio-temporal climate variability, megaherbivores, fire suppression, sedentarization, and changing livelihoods."

Here we examine compound weather systems based on environmental diagnostics of cyclones, fronts and thunderstorms applied to global reanalysis data for the first time based on multiple decades. Occurrence frequencies are mapped for each type of compound weather system from 1979 to 2020. Results for the double weather system types show that the cyclone and front combination mostly occurs in high-latitude ocean regions, whereas the cyclone and thunderstorm combination as well as the front and thunderstorm combination mostly occur in midlatitude land regions. The triple weather system type of the cyclone, front and thunderstorm combination is rare but tends to occur near the midlatitude east coast and adjacent maritime region of each continent. Thunderstorm-related compound weather systems have occurrence frequency maxima around 35° S and 35° N for ocean regions, with larger occurrence frequencies in the Northern Hemisphere than the Southern Hemisphere, whereas for land regions these occurrence frequencies are smaller in the Northern Hemisphere than the Southern Hemisphere. Long-term trends indicate more thunderstorm-related compound systems in some tropical land regions and midlatitude locations near the east coast of each continent, as well as changes in the Southern Hemisphere extratropics consistent with cyclones moving poleward. This dataset and methodology are also intended to be useful for future studies relevant to a range of disciplines, such as for insight on drivers of hazardous rain, wind and ocean waves through this framework of compound weather systems in regions through the world."

Vertical greenery systems (VGS) are increasingly promoted as nature-based solutions for space-constrained cities, yet their performance remains highly variable and context-dependent. This systematic review, conducted in accordance with preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines and synthesising evidence from 34 peer-reviewed studies, demonstrates that VGS hydrological efficacy is not a universal constant but is fundamentally moderated by local climatic conditions. Climate acts as the primary filter, shaping system function across tropical, temperate, Mediterranean, arid, and cold zones, each presenting distinct opportunities and constraints. Beyond climate, performance is refined by system typology (green façades versus living walls), plant functional traits (notably root architecture), and substrate composition, which together determine trade-offs between runoff delay, retention, and water quality improvement. The review further reveals a stark divergence in adoption barriers: in the Global North, high costs, regulatory complexity, and data gaps create institutional inertia, whereas in the Global South, limited awareness, misaligned priorities, and weak policy frameworks relegate stormwater management to a low priority. To address these challenges, we propose a five-pillar implementation framework centred on climate-responsive design protocols, advanced economic valuation of co-benefits, adaptive governance, long-term monitoring, and context-sensitive community engagement. This review provides actionable, evidence-based guidance for integrating VGS as resilient, equitable, and multifunctional components of sustainable urban water management, tailored not to global templates, but to local environmental and socio-institutional realities."

These datasets provide valuable insight in the study of deep ocean dynamics and its possible impact on climate variability. By applying standardized post-processing and quality control procedures, we ensure the data's reliability and usability for further analysis and model validation, addressing critical gaps in deep-sea monitoring. 
 The deep ocean was long assumed to be in a quasi-stationary state, and therefore excluded from studies on climate variability. The awareness of the unsteady state of the deep ocean is a fairly recent achievement, but despite its pivotal role in the assessment of climate variability, the understanding of abyssal ocean dynamics remains largely unknown, primarily due to the scarcity of observations. This is why any observations below 2000 meters depth, although poor or widely dispersed, constitute valuable knowledge that is mandatory to enhance and make available."

The high uncertainties discussed here underscore the need for comprehensive monitoring, improved process understanding, and appropriate modeling strategies to assess the climate change impacts on PM and vPvM substances."

We developed a global wildland fire organic emission inventory (1997–2023) with full-volatility coverage using volatility-binned and chemically specific emission factors by vegetation type. Compared to the traditional POA + VOC framework, full-volatility organic emission inventories filled a gap of 25.1 Mt/year of I/SVOCs; grassland, tropical forest, boreal forest, peatland, and temperate forest fires contributed 66%, 13%, 11%, 6%, and 4%, respectively, to full-volatility emissions (averaged over 1997–2023). Southern Hemisphere Africa was the top emission hotspot, with full-volatility organic emissions of 4.4 t/km2/year, 1.3–6.9 times greater than the next highest-emitting emission hotspots: Northern Hemisphere Africa, Southern Hemisphere South America, and Equatorial Asia. On a global scale, wildland fire organic emissions are 79% of anthropogenic organic emissions, but their I/SVOC emissions are comparable. With a more comprehensive consideration of the mass and chemical speciation of full-volatility organics, this emission inventory could enhance our understanding of the impact of wildland fires on air quality and human health."

In natural circumstances, the concentrations and behaviors of the OPEs and PAEs are inevitably influenced by various environmental factors, but the driving mechanisms behind these are still unclear. This study focused on the main tributary of the Yangtze River basin: Chishui River. It quantified the contents and sources of OPEs and PAEs and integrated DOM and microbial characteristics to specifically analyze the key driving factors influencing pollutant levels. The results showed that the concentration ranges of OPEs and PAEs from Chishui River were 8.92 × 102–1.37 × 103 and 39.6–1.04 × 103 ng/L in water and 1.85 × 103–3.63 × 103 and 1.10 × 102–1.43 × 104 ng/g dry weight in sediment. TEP, DBEP, and DMEP were the main components requiring prioritized attention. These pollutants mainly originate from domestic waste and industrial plastics. The levels of the OPEs and PAEs were regulated by DOM adsorption and microbial degradation, respectively. Protein-like fluorophore at Ex/Em: 275/342 nm and FI jointly verified the wastewater source of TBEP. a253/a203 demonstrated potential for monitoring the concentration of TCrP. Tolerant Exiguobacterium exhibited potential for degrading PAEs. Optical signatures of the DOM served as potential tracers for monitoring the OPEs in environmental matrices. These provide new insights into the risk assessment and fate of emerging pollutants in the natural environment."

Diskin;Haofei Zhang,Rapid Levoglucosan Oxidation as a Key Process in Biomass Burning Aerosol Aging,"The globally increasing wildfires significantly impact air quality, public health, and the climate. Extensive studies have focused primarily on the chemical transformation of the volatile gases and secondary aerosol formation in wildfires, but organic aerosol evolution and its impacts on aged plumes remain poorly understood. Here, we performed laboratory multiphase oxidation of levoglucosan aerosol, the single largest primary organic aerosol component in wildfires, by hydroxyl radicals (•OH), and we quantified the oxidation products using thermal desorption chemical ionization mass spectrometry coupled with hydrogen–deuterium exchange. We show that levoglucosan undergoes unexpectedly rapid oxidation under atmospherically relevant •OH concentrations, driven by a combination of condensed-phase bimolecular autoxidation, ring-breaking reactions, and α-OH-peroxy radical unimolecular reactions. This chemistry efficiently produces highly oxygenated products and gaseous formic acid in high yields. These products have important implications for aged biomass burning aerosol composition and properties. Aircraft observations of western U.S. wildfires confirm rapid levoglucosan decay with kinetics consistent with laboratory results. The aircraft data suggest that levoglucosan oxidation explains 15–46% of the observed formic acid formation in aged wildfire plumes, representing a major hitherto unrecognized source. These findings reveal critical gaps in the current understanding of wildfire chemistry and highlight the important role of multiphase aerosol oxidation."

Here, we evaluate these biological cobenefits for 27 marine calcifiers whose calcification has declined under OA, by quantifying both historical OA-driven calcification losses and the potential of OAE to reverse them under scenarios with and without air–sea equilibration. Regression models describing calcification as a function of TA-DIC reveal substantial declines since preindustrial times, particularly in linear responders (mean 22%, range 7–44%), such as gastropods and pteropods, while threshold responders show minimal decline (∼3%). A realistic addition of 50 μmol kg–1 of OAE alkalinity restores species-specific calcification rates maximally only between 0 and 52.2%, with the largest benefits in OA-sensitive taxa. However, restoring preindustrial calcification requires far larger TA additions (mean 104 ± 58 μmol kg–1 without equilibration and more than triple this amount when equilibration with atmospheric CO2 is considered). While higher CDR efficiency enhances atmospheric CO2 drawdown, it simultaneously reduces the potential for biological OA mitigation. Thus, restoration of marine calcifiers through the OAE will not necessarily align with its climate goals, complicating its application in ocean management and CDR policy."

Linden,Far-UVC (222 nm) Suppresses Bacterial UV Resistance and Repair through Inhibition of DNA Repair Pathways,"Controlling pathogenic bacteria is essential for safe drinking water, but conventional UV disinfection can be compromised by bacterial DNA repair and radiation-resistant strains. This study demonstrates that microbial radiation resistance is fundamentally wavelength-dependent, established through a molecular-level understanding of DNA repair disruption. While conventional 254 nm UV (UV254) and far-UVC 222 nm (UV222) induce comparable DNA damage at practical fluences (20–50 mJ/cm2 ), UV222 uniquely suppresses repair through wavelength-specific protein targeting and damage. UV222 enhances protein absorption by 2.58-fold and amino acid photolysis quantum yield and then directly photolyzes substitute repair enzymes, leading to protein fragmentation with almost complete enzymatic inactivation (>95%) compared to UV254. This targeted proteome damage systematically dismantles repair pathways, with recA, the master regulator of DNA repair, experiencing >90% transcriptional suppression under UV222, contrasting with significantly elevated expression under UV254. Genetic validation using recA-deficient mutants confirms this pathway-specific vulnerability. UV222-induced protein damage likely mediates inhibition of DNA repair, preventing genomic restoration. This repair suppression mechanism enables UV222 to overcome UV254-resistant bacteria such as Deinococcus radiodurans and produces multitime scale disinfection in tap water, achieving both immediate inactivation and regrowth prevention. These findings advance understanding of wavelength-dependent UV resistance and bacterial DNA repair processes, providing new insights for improved UV disinfection methods."

This study presents novel hierarchically porous TiO2-embedded polymeric optical fibers (TiO2–POFs) with a lotus-leaf-like bionic and micro/mesoporous structure for the removal of emerging contaminants (ECs). When coupled with UV-A LEDs and trace chlorine (5.0 mg/L), the system achieved a carbamazepine degradation rate constant of 0.0302 min–1 (1.167 cm2/μeinstein or 0.0143 cm2/mJ), which was 8.4 times that without chlorine, and a order of magnitude lower electrical energy per order (EE/O) of CBZ degradation (0.001 kWh/m3/order) compared to the median EE/O of the existing UVC-based AOPs. The enhancement was attributed to chlorine activation by photoinduced holes, electrons, and superoxide radicals, ultimately generating hydroxyl radicals (HO•), which were responsible for 99.4% of the degradation. The unique hydrophobic interface of TiO2–POFs confers a high affinity for hydrophobic pollutants and superior resistance to matrix quenching by hydrophilic natural organic matter. This enables the rapid degradation (within 2–5 min) of ECs at environmentally relevant (ng/L) levels in complex matrices like real tap water. The system maintained high activity after treating ∼454 L of tap water and exhibited excellent structural stability under an accumulated HO• exposure of ∼1.04 × 10–8 M·s. A 40% decrease was observed after high Cu2+ exposure, i.e., equivalent to treating 19,800 L of water due to copper oxide/hydroxide deposition. Simple acid washing using household vinegar or dilute nitric acid readily restores their activity. Furthermore, the process yielded less disinfection byproduct (DBP) compared to UV–C/chlorine due to the in situ adsorption and degradation of DBPs and their precursors. With its high selectivity, efficiency, safety, and stability, the UV-A-irradiated TiO2–POF chlorine process represents a highly promising strategy for safe and effective decentralized water purification."

Catalytic decomposition into O2 is widely considered to be a promising technology for O3 pollution elimination in the ambient environment. Unfortunately, developing a catalyst with high activity and moisture resistance, as well as applications through a facile approach, remains a huge challenge. In this study, we synthesized an excellent, active, and stable NiO catalyst with double active sites of hydroxyl groups and oxygen vacancies for catalytic O3 decomposition. The simple NiO catalyst exhibited nearly 100% conversion of 40 ppm of O3 within 100 h at a space velocity (600 L g–1 h–1) and 50% RH, suggesting exceptional chemical stability and water resistance over a long time. The hydroxyl groups in NiO directly bonded with O3, inducing the reconstruction of NiO to form a new intermediate reactive species (NiOOH) and facilitating the involvement of H2O molecules in the reaction, thus inhibiting the negative effects of moisture. Meanwhile, the coexisting oxygen vacancies effectively regulated the local electronic structure near Ni to promote the release of intermediate species and increased the number of active sites, resulting in dramatically enhanced catalytic O3 decomposition. The mechanisms of catalytic O3 decomposition were elucidated, underlying the hydroxyl groups cooperating with oxygen vacancies, with the combined in situ DRIFTS, Raman, EXAFS, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work not only demonstrates the great potential of NiO materials in catalytic applications but also deepens the insight into the mechanism of O3 decomposition."

MNPs can also adsorb other contaminants present in aquatic environments, and there is limited information on exposure scenarios involving MNP and pesticide mixtures. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation and chemical oxidation of MNPs can affect the sorption properties of MNPs and chemicals, thus altering the exposure and effects on fish. Our study investigated the toxicity and bioaccumulation of a lindane and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) mixture adsorbed onto pristine and weathered polyethylene (PE) MNPs. Three different PE MNP types were used: microplastics (2–10 μm), oxidized microplastics (10–15 μm), and a MNP mixture (0.2–9.9 μm), and additionally each type was UV-aged for comparisons. RTgutGC cells, derived from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) intestine, were used to evaluate the role of the particle type on pesticides bioaccumulation and toxicity. Results showed that UV aging did not affect the agglomeration in solution but decreased the MNP’s capacity to adsorb the pesticides (i.e., non-aged adsorbed 35% and 69% and UV-aged adsorbed 9.7% and 63% of lindane and DDE, respectively) likely due to a shift in MNPs hydrophobicity and consequently reduced the cytotoxicity of the pesticide MNPs mixture. Nanoplastics induced  approximately 20% more lysosomal damage than microplastics, suggesting a distinct toxicity mechanism. Fluorescently labeled MNPs accumulated in intestinal cells which confirmed the internalization. Finally, bioaccumulation of DDE decreased approximately 2 to 8-fold in cells coexposed with all particle types, although lindane was not detected in the cells.

However, the roles of gut iron(III)-reducing bacteria (IRB) in arsenic transformation in soil animals remain unclear. This study enriched gut IRB from soil earthworms (Pheretima guillelmi) over three generations (189 days) with glucose and lactate as electron donors to investigate their impacts on arsenic reduction, methylation, and demethylation. Intestinal IRB was dominated by Clostridium (42%) and Bacillaceae spp. (25%) in glucose treatments and by Veillonellales-Selenomonadales spp. (34%) and Thermincola (19%) in lactate treatments. As(V) reduction and DMAs(V) demethylation mediated by IRB were detected during incubation, which was more efficient in glucose treatments than in lactate setups. However, no arsenic methylation was identified in all treatments. The dominant IRB in the earthworm gut, including Clostridium, Bacillus, and Paenibacillus, harbored genes involved in As(V) respiration (arrA), As(V) reduction (arsC, arsR, GstB, mgsR, and spxA), and arsenic efflux (ACR3, arsA, arsB, arsD, etc.). Besides, Methanobacterium, Methanomassiliicoccus, and Methanosarcina were potential DMAs(V)-demethylating taxa. Overall, arsenic-transforming microbes comprised up to 100% of gut iron(III)-reducing microbial communities during incubation. Therefore, this research deepens our insights into the role of gut microbiota in soil-dwelling animals in iron–arsenic biogeochemical cycles."

A common outcome of plant stress is increased emissions of acyclic terpenes. The paucity of information about acyclic terpene SOA chemistry contributes to uncertainties in predictions of SOA global loadings and impacts on Earth’s radiative budget, particularly in a changing climate where acyclic terpene emissions could become more prominent. This study compared properties of SOA derived from hydroxyl radical (OH) oxidation of acyclic and cyclic monoterpenes (β-ocimene, α-pinene) and sesquiterpenes (β-farnesene, β-caryophyllene). Single-particle mass spectrometry was used for assessing shape, density, and evaporation kinetics of size-selected SOA particles, and nanospray desorption electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry (nano-DESI-HRMS) was used to measure the molecular composition of SOA. Acyclic terpene SOA exhibited higher viscosity and lower volatility compared to cyclic terpene SOA, and had a greater volume fraction remaining (VFR) after ∼24 h of evaporation─approximately 1.3–1.6 times higher VFR than that of cyclic terpene SOA. Additionally, HRMS analysis revealed greater chemical diversity and higher fractions of extremely low-volatility compounds (56–62% ELVOC/LVOC) in acyclic terpene SOA compared to cyclic counterparts (25–37% ELVOC/LVOC). Our findings highlight the potential importance of accounting for acyclic terpene aerosol chemistry under conditions of plant stress to improve predictions of SOA loadings and impacts."

Recent studies have observed unexpectedly strong aerosol absorption on the TP, leading to positive direct aerosol radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere (DARFTOA) and potentially accelerating TP warming. However, light absorption by different aerosols remains poorly quantified, especially when considering the influence of dark-brown carbon (d-BrC), which exhibits characteristics similar to black carbon (BC). Based on size-resolved aerosol chemical compositions and optical properties measured on the TP, this study proposes a novel framework to derive aerosol absorption contributions by BC, the lensing effect, methanol-soluble organic aerosols (MSOA), and d-BrC. Contrary to expectations, approximately 50–70% of aerosol absorption across the 405–780 nm wavelength range is attributed to d-BrC in Lulang and Lhasa, rather than BC. DARFTOA changes from +2.83 to −0.42 W/m2 when absorption by d-BrC is excluded. These results reveal that d-BrC is a key factor determining aerosol warming or cooling effect on the TP, and it should be incorporated into weather and climate models for improving the assessment of aerosol radiative forcing."

We identified bladder cancer-specific glucose metabolism-related genes (GMGs) using Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) and a case–control study (580 cases and 1,101 controls) through genetic association and interaction analyses with cigarette smoking. Among 811 GMGs, we observed that PRKCE rs4953292 G > A was significantly associated with increased bladder cancer risk [odds ratio (OR) = 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03–1.37, Padj = 1.87 × 10–2] and exhibited an interaction effect with cigarette smoking (Pinteraction < 0.05). Smokers with rs4953292 A allele had higher bladder cancer risk than nonsmokers with G allele (Ptrend < 9.09 × 10–3). We performed functional experiments using 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP)-treated bladder cancer cells and found that the rs4953292 A allele combined with 4-ABP decreased PRKCE expression levels in bladder cancer cells, which could upregulate PKG and phosphorylate VASP within the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, enhance glucose uptake, lactate generation, and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) to reprogram glycolysis, thus promoting bladder cancer susceptibility. This study elucidates that cigarette smoking-regulated PRKCE facilitates bladder cancer susceptibility by mediating glycolytic reprogramming through activating the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. The findings provide valuable predictors for bladder cancer susceptibility, aiding in prevention strategies."

Here, we perform hundreds of 3D dynamic rupture simulations to investigate the rupture dynamics, constrained by near‐fault strong‐motion waveforms, optical and SAR pixel offsets, and a kinematic source model. Our preferred model suggests that the rupture involves asymmetric supershear ruptures, with stable rupture speeds following initial bilateral subshear propagation, as supported by the low frequency of aftershocks and high seismic radiation efficiency. The Burridge‐Andrews mechanism and free‐surface effects likely dominate the supershear transition. Moreover, the derived slip distribution exhibits segmentation in both extent and magnitude, with few shallow slip deficits, which correlate with the interseismic locking depth and slip rate. Our results demonstrate that data‐constrained dynamic rupture simulations offer valuable insights into the physical mechanisms governing complex earthquake rupture processes."

This study investigates the convective updraft sensitivity to random initial temperature perturbations using an idealized ensemble modeling framework informed by in situ thermodynamic and aerosol observations from the DOE TRACER field campaign. We analyze the impact of small‐scale initial perturbations on updraft velocity and supersaturation, and determine the ensemble size required to minimize stochastic internal variability. Results show that minor thermodynamic perturbations can produce updraft variability comparable to aerosol‐induced changes reported in prior work. An ensemble of 10 members sufficiently reduces variability, enabling robust investigation of aerosol‐related updraft invigoration and informing the design of future ensemble‐based aerosol‐convection interaction studies in environments with significant spatiotemporal mesoscale thermodynamic and aerosol heterogeneity."

Using reanalysis data, we identify 54 Chaco jet events and categorize them based on antecedent soil moisture over northern Argentina; 63% occur under drier‐than‐normal conditions. Dry soils are associated with enhanced surface sensible heating, lower‐tropospheric warming, and a deepened thermal low, which intensifies the Chaco jet (2.8 times stronger than in wet cases) during the 5 days before its peak. These results highlight the importance of land‐atmosphere interactions in modulating SALLJ dynamics and suggest that antecedent soil moisture information could improve jet forecasts in the region."

Using reanalysis data and a theoretical framework that separates the deep and shallow convective modes, we quantify their individual and combined contributions to energy and moisture transport. Results show that deep mode GDS and GQS are strongly correlated with sea surface temperature (SST). In contrast, GMS is much smaller and exhibits weaker SST dependence, particularly when the shallow mode is included. The deep mode generally stabilizes the atmosphere through moist static energy export, whereas the shallow mode destabilizes it through moist static energy import. When combined, GMS is positive over convective regions but negative or near‐neutral over subtropical oceans and cold tongue, and its spatial distribution closely corresponds to observed Madden–Julian Oscillation activity."

However, no significant changes in the orbital forcing were found at the two transitions, and the forcing was too small to drive these cycles. Here, a stochastic resonance model is proposed to resolve these two issues. Earth's radiative imbalance varies with temperature but is modulated by non‐stationary greenhouse gas concentrations leading to a persisting warm state (the inter‐glacials) and a colder state (the glacials) only in the Pleistocene. A noise that encodes volcanic eruptions and short‐term climate variations acts to trigger glacial‐interglacial jumps modulated by periodic orbital variations. The mid‐Pleistocene transition to the 100 kyr world is shown to be favored by a weakened noise amplitude. This formulation offers a unified view of Pliocene‐Pleistocene evolution that can be extended to hothouse and snowball climates."

DCAPE is projected to increase by 5%–12% on average in most areas, independently of wind shear. A diagnostic of downdraft buoyancy is introduced to understand the mechanisms of DCAPE responses. Much of the increase in mean DCAPE is temperature‐driven, with additional contributions from changes in relative humidity and downdraft origin heights. However, extreme values increase at much faster rates than can be explained by local warming. In winter, the latitude of significant DCAPE and CAPE shifts poleward by more than 5° due to larger changes in downburst environments within midlatitude cyclones.

 Hailstorms producing hail larger than 5 cm cause the most severe damage to property and infrastructure, often leading to multibillion-dollar losses. Here we develop a global climatology of these very large hail events from 1950 to 2023 by combining statistical modelling with atmospheric reanalysis and examine trends in their frequency and related economic impacts. Northern Argentina emerges as the global hotspot of very large hail events, followed by Uruguay, Paraguay, southern Brazil, the US Great Plains and South Africa. Asia—and to a lesser extent, Europe and Australia—show substantially lower frequencies. Europe is seeing the sharpest rise in the frequency of very large hail events, driven by increasing low-level moisture and atmospheric instability. By contrast, the Southern Hemisphere—especially South America—is experiencing notable declines, linked to reduced mid-level humidity and instability. Hail-related losses have increased in the USA, Australia and Europe. In Europe, the rise is mainly due to more frequent very large hail events, whereas in the USA and Australia, increasing exposure and vulnerability are the primary drivers. These contrasting regional trends in hail frequency and related losses underscore the need for tailored risk management strategies that account for both climatic drivers and socio-economic vulnerabilities.

 Optical heterostructures, which feature spatially heterogeneous optical properties at the subwavelength scale, represent a key frontier for next-generation integrated photonics and optoelectronics. While typically realized by joining dissimilar materials, achieving such heterogeneity in single-component systems has remained a fundamental challenge. Here, we report an intrinsic optical heterostructure in a uniform organic nanosheet, manifesting as strongly enhanced fluorescence in the inner zone compared to the outer zone. We demonstrate that this emission heterogeneity stems from a spatially localized solid-state transition in the central top layer, which transforms the initial single crystal into an out-of-plane twin structure and significantly enhances the radiative recombination efficiency. This transition is driven by the competitive interplay between molecule-substrate and intermolecular interactions, as corroborated by multiscale structural, optical, and theoretical analyses. Our findings not only establish a platform for realizing optical heterostructures in organic materials but also open avenues for exploring structural-dynamics-governed photonic phenomena, offering broad implications for future materials design and micro-optical applications.

 Synergistic-tuning the permselectivity and chemical stability of polymer membranes with a scalable method is an imminent demand for sustainable and energy-efficient organic solvent nanofiltration, but remains an intricate challenge. Here, we report a bifunctional molecular engineering strategy to fabricate sub-20 nm fluorinated polyamide nanofilms via scalable interfacial polymerization. Experiments and molecular simulations reveal that in situ incorporation of noncoplanar contorted segments with hydrophobic fluorine-rich pendants into a flexible hydrophilic polyamide backbone constructs a highly crosslinked 3D interconnected Janus microporous framework with rigid–flexible and hydrophilic–hydrophobic duality. This Janus structure instigates simultaneous control over the dissolution and migration of polar and nonpolar organic solvents. The resulting membranes exhibit enduring chemical stability, unprecedentedly high solvent permeance, and concomitantly low molecular weight cutoff, rivaling state-of-the-art membranes. This work provides a promising paradigm for the development of high-performance membranes to promote the sustainability of energy-intensive filtration of organic solvents over a wide range of solvent polarity.

Here we introduce PRIMER (Precipitation Records Infinite MERging), a framework that fuses these complementary sources. PRIMER employs a coordinate-based diffusion model that learns from arbitrary spatial locations and associated intensity values, enabling seamless integration of gridded data and irregular gauge observations. Through two-stage training—first learning large-scale patterns, then refining with gauge measurements—PRIMER captures both large-scale structure and local precision. Once trained, it can correct biases in existing datasets—yielding significant error reductions at most gauge sites—and downscale reanalysis. In addition, by combining background estimates with extra gauges, it produces analysis fields that further reduce errors. All tasks are achieved through posterior sampling utilizing the prior obtained by fusing multi-source records. Crucially, it generalizes without retraining, correcting biases in operational forecasts and downscaling future scenario precipitation fields. This demonstrates how PRIMER can transform imperfect data into a source of strength. This study presents PRIMER, a coordinate-based diffusion model, that fuses multiple imperfect precipitation records into a unified prior, enabling Bayesian inference like downscaling, bias correction, and data assimilation."

In this study, the authors uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying SpbK’s self association-dependent NADase activity and its activation by the SPβ phage portal protein YonE. 
 Bacteria have a variety of mechanisms for limiting predation by phages. SpbK is a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing antiphage defence protein from Bacillus subtilis that provides protection against the temperate phage SPβ via abortive infection. Here we structurally characterise SpbK and its interaction with the SPβ protein YonE. We demonstrate that SpbK is an NADase that produces both ADP-ribose (ADPR) and canonical cyclic ADPR with a N1-glycosidic bond (cADPR, also referred to as N1-cADPR). Combining cryo-EM, in silico predictions, site-directed mutagenesis, and phage infection assays, we show that formation of two-stranded head-to-tail assemblies of SpbK TIR domains is required for both NADase activity and antiphage defence. We also demonstrate that YonE is a dodecameric portal protein that activates the NADase function of SpbK by facilitating TIR domain clustering. Collectively, our results provide insight into how bacterial TIR NADases recognise phage infection. SpbK protects Bacillus subtilis from phage infection by depleting NAD⁺. In this study, the authors uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying SpbK’s self association-dependent NADase activity and its activation by the SPβ phage portal protein YonE."

Here the authors show that variations in the number of incoming viral particles across cell types is a key factor of this decision, identifying entry efficiency as a key regulator of latency. 
 Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection results in either productive or latent infection, the latter enabling life-long viral persistence. Monocytes support latent infection but become permissive to productive infection upon differentiation into macrophages. These differentiation-driven differences have been largely attributed to chromatin-mediated repression of the viral genome. Using metabolic labeling of newly synthesized RNA, we observe markedly lower viral transcription at early stages of infection in monocytes compared to macrophages. Unbiased comparison reveals that this difference is partly explained by inefficient viral entry in monocytes: fewer viruses enter, and correspondingly, fewer genomes reach the nucleus. Indeed, ectopic expression of known HCMV entry receptors in monocytes enhances viral entry and enables productive infection, demonstrating that these cells can support full lytic replication if entry is efficient. We further identify integrin β3 as a differentiation-induced surface protein playing an important role in HCMV entry into macrophages, partially accounting for the observed differences in entry efficiency. Finally, we show that cells receiving fewer viral genomes are the ones that establish latent infection and have the capacity to reactivate. Overall, our findings reveal that entry is a previously unrecognized factor contributing to latent infection in monocytes, adding a critical layer to the paradigm of HCMV latency. HCMV infection can become productive or latent. Here the authors show that variations in the number of incoming viral particles across cell types is a key factor of this decision, identifying entry efficiency as a key regulator of latency."

Here the authors develop a multi-arm topological universal dynamic crosslinker platform to enable mechanical upcycling of incompatible mixed plastics. 
 Mechanical recycling of postconsumer plastics, especially incompatible mixed plastics, is often a downcycling process, resulting in brittle materials. Here we introduce a multi-arm universal dynamic crosslinker (UDC) platform to enable mechanical upcycling of incompatible mixed plastics. The topological UDC platform is based on readily accessible diazomalonate carbene precursors joined by dynamic siloxane linkages. It creates in situ star-like multiblock copolymer compatibilizing architectures from mixed plastics, irrespective of polymer types, and is compatible with reactive extrusion re/processing. Such architectures are credited for not only drastically enhancing creep resistance by two to four orders of magnitude but also improving the extensibility of polymer blends by up to 100-fold. By adjusting the topological UDC architecture and loading, broad property tunability between thermoset- and thermoplastic-like materials is achieved from mechanical upcycling of mixed apolar/polar plastics. This work provides a viable approach to improve the circularity of plastics. Mechanical recycling of incompatible mixed plastics is challenging, as it often downcycles plastics into brittle materials.
