In some cases, data describing regional status are spatially aggregated to provide a global assessment. Several aggregation approaches can be observed, and the chosen approach may impact the conclusions. This study systematically reviews approaches of aggregating regional environmental boundaries and their state at the global level and uses a case study to compare them, aiming to highlight assumptions and implications and show how inconsistent approaches affect the accuracy and comparability of global boundary states. In the comprehensive literature review, 25 studies dealing with spatial aggregation of regional occupation of SOS and 43 associated regional boundary records were identified and categorized according to five spatial aggregation approaches and five types of adjustments that apply across approaches. These approaches were further classified as high- and low-risk approaches based on their assumptions and value judgments regarding precautionary levels and accepted regional transgressions. Notably, key publications dealing with multiple environmental boundaries use different aggregation approaches across the boundaries, potentially introducing biases. The application of these approaches to a case study revealed that the choice can influence the resulting aggregated occupation of SOS substantially, impacting conclusions as to whether or not a boundary is exceeded. To mitigate biases and inconsistencies, future estimates of spatially aggregated regional SOS should transparently communicate the assumptions underlying the chosen aggregation approach, address potential inconsistencies across boundaries, and advance our understanding of spatial propagation mechanisms."

To address this need, we develop a robust machine learning model to capture TC-induced power outage risk. When applied to 900 000 synthetic TCs downscaled from simulated historical and future climate conditions under a strong warming scenario, we find outage risk in the United States and Puerto Rico is expected to increase broadly by the end of the century, with some states seeing increases of 60% and higher. Further, we discover that rising rainfall rates will play an increasingly important role in TC-induced power outage risk as the climate changes, explaining more than 50% of the projected change in risk in some regions. These insights are important for guiding decision-makers in their future outage risk investment and mitigation plans."

The results from this study suggest that the upper-level atmospheric waves across Eurasia induced by the warm sea surface temperature (SST) in the eastern North Atlantic and large snow melting in southern Siberia are responsible for a large temperature increase in Siberia. These suggested mechanisms are examined by both observed data analysis and ideal numerical model simulations, which reasonably explain the record-breaking extreme heat events in 1997 and 2020. Future climate change scenarios simulated by a global climate model with large ensembles project a much larger increase in surface air temperature in Siberia compared to the surrounding area. Under future climate conditions, with significantly warmer SSTs in the eastern Atlantic and increased snowmelt in southern Siberia, the risk of extreme heat events in Siberia is expected to rise considerably. This is due to the enhanced large-scale atmospheric teleconnections and intensified local atmosphere-land feedback that will result from these changes."

Peatland fires require sufficiently hot, dry conditions and/or drainage for the peat to burn. Although these conditions have historically been infrequent, the warming and drying climate could increase the potential for wildfires and subsequent emissions. Here, we evaluate how climate change impacts peatland fire emissions by using the United Kingdom as a case study—where peatlands store an estimated 3.2 PgC. We use a fire emission model to quantify fire-driven C emissions using high-resolution land-surface data and fire-weather indices. Between 2001 and 2021, we estimate 0.8 TgC has been emitted from fires on peatlands, which can contribute up to 90% of total annual UK fire-driven C emissions. Consequently, protecting peatlands from fires in the UK would be a cost-effective way to slow climate change by avoiding future emissions. Peatland emissions spike during prominent dry years, implicating the inter-annual climate as a dominant driver of year-to-year variability. Integrating future climate projections suggests that a 2 °C global warming level could increase fire-driven C emissions in peatlands by over 60% solely via increased burn depths. Our findings are likely a bellwether for other temperate peatlands where climate change is leading to drier conditions, which increase burn depths and C emissions."

Here, we combine livestock system indicators based on remote sensing and livestock vaccination data with a biophysical grass growth model to assess forage production, livestock carrying capacity, and grazing pressure on rangelands in the South American Dry Chaco. Specifically, we assess how considering different livestock systems (e.g. fattening in confinement, grazing with supplementary feeding, woodland grazing) changes estimations of grazing pressure. Our results highlight an average carrying capacity of 0.48 animal units equivalents (AUEs) per hectare for the Chaco (0.72 for pastures, 0.43 for natural grasslands, 0.37 for woodlands). Regional livestock requirements ranged between 0.02–6.43 AUE ha−1, with cattle dominating livestock requirements (91.6% of total AUE). Considering livestock systems with different production intensities markedly altered the rangeland carrying capacity and degradation estimations. For example, considering confinements and supplementary feeding drastically reduced the pasture area with potential overgrazing, from about 58 000 km2 to <19 000 km2 (i.e. 13.5% vs 5.7% of the total rangeland area). Conversely, considering the typically unaccounted-for cattle of woodland smallholders markedly increased the potentially degraded woodland area, from 3.2% (∼1000 km2) to 12.1% (3700 km2) of the total woodland area. Our work shows how ignoring production intensity can bias grazing pressure estimations and, therefore, conclusions about rangeland degradation connected to livestock production. Mapping indicators characterizing the intensity of livestock systems thus provide opportunities to understand better grazing impacts and guide efforts towards more sustainable livestock production."

Cyclogenesis and the occurrence of tropical-like cyclones (also known as Medicanes) in the Mediterranean appear to have intensified during the last decades. This study investigates the relationship between increased sea surface temperature (SST) levels and low-pressure systems in the Mediterranean Sea over four recent decades (1982–2020), highlighting a strong spatial variability in regions affected by MHWs. Key areas, such as the Ligurian, Tyrrhenian, Ionian, Aegean, and Northern Levantine Seas, demonstrate a notable interaction between MHWs and cyclogenesis. Stronger relations are identified at the west of Cyprus (Northern Levantine), in the northern Ionian Sea, and in the Gulf of Genoa (Ligurian Sea). Conversely, weaker interactions are observed in the southern Mediterranean, where both MHWs and cyclonic activity are weaker. The sea level pressure (SLP) in the Mediterranean and the intensity of the surface MHW revealed decreasing and increasing trends, respectively, during the 39 year period. A marked negative trend in SLP and an increase in SSTs in the northern Aegean point to heightened cyclone activity in this region. MHWs may ampilfy atmospheric systems that increase coastal hazards like flooding, strong winds and heavy precipitation. The study also highlights that periods of intense cyclonic activity often coincide with intense MHW formations, with both phenomena peaking in 2018. The cumulative intensity of the MHWs, measured by their duration and magnitude, correlates with the intensification of low-pressure systems in most of the Mediterranean sub-regions. These findings suggest that monitoring MHWs could improve the understanding and forecasting of cyclogenesis, benefiting both short-term weather predictions and long-term climate assessments."

Few studies have systematically addressed whether urban areas exhibit a higher/lower probability of precipitation and/or higher/lower annual total precipitation and/or intensification/weakening of intense precipitation events relative to nearby rural areas across a range of hydroclimatic conditions and urban contexts. Here we address this literature gap using the IMERG V07 data set and analyses of rural and urban samples drawn from 47 conurbations across North America. Specifically, we quantify whether/how precipitation regimes over the urban grid cells differ from those in rural grid cells located 100–250 km from the city center and at a similar elevation. As in previous research, there is evidence that both the probability of precipitation and annual total precipitation are typically higher in the urban grid cells. However, most conurbations have lower upper percentile precipitation rates in the urban sample and lower median precipitation rates above the 95th percentile than are present in samples drawn from rural grid cells. Thus, these conurbations are not, on average, intensifying high-magnitude precipitation events over urban grid cells. Further, the total volume of water accumulated at the surface during events of equivalent duration is not systematically higher over the urban areas, and 20 year return period values of 30 min and wettest pentad precipitation are also not systematically higher over the urban areas. The nature of urban modification of precipitation is a strong function of the prevailing hydroclimate. For example, the heaviest rainfall periods are enhanced over urban grid cells within regional hydroclimates where the overall probability of precipitation and annual total precipitation are low. Conversely, there is evidence for urban suppression of the highest percentile precipitation rates in wetter hydroclimates."

As a critical transitional region between the open ocean and pack ice, the MIZ plays a pivotal role in mediating ocean-atmosphere interactions, influencing sea ice dynamics, and supporting polar ecosystems. This study investigates the dynamic variability and morphological evolution of the Arctic MIZ from 1979 to 2023 using the Bootstrap sea ice concentration (SIC) product. Results reveal that while the overall MIZ extent has remained relatively stable over the long term, the MIZ fraction (i.e. the ratio of MIZ extent to Arctic sea ice extent) has increased significantly, as the total sea ice extent has decreased over time. The seasonal cycle is pronounced, with minimum extents observed in March or April and maximum extents in August or September. From June to September, the SIC values within the MIZ showed a significant downward trend in spatial distribution, indicating that the SIC in this region generally decreased during summer. Furthermore, the MIZ has experienced a northward shift over the past four decades, with an accelerated rate of migration post-2000. This shift is accompanied by morphological changes, characterized by a smoother ice edge and more compact ice during late summer. A significant change point was detected in 2006, signaling a structural shift in MIZ dynamics. Post-2006, the frequency of MIZ occurrence increased in high-latitude regions, particularly across the Beaufort, Chukchi, East Siberian, and Laptev Seas. These findings provide critical insights into Arctic sea ice dynamics, highlighting the evolving nature of the MIZ and its role in shaping the future Arctic ice regime under continued climate change."

This study aims to assess how the impact of mesoscale eddies on air–sea CO2 fluxes varies throughout their lifecycle. We compared six machine learning models, including light gradient boosting machine, support vector machine, and XGBoost models, to construct an FCO2 evaluation model. Among these, the XGBoost model performed the best, with model validation yielding the coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.9046 and a root mean square error of 1.4165 mmol m–2 d–1, successfully assessing the air–sea CO2 fluxes in the South Atlantic. Analysing eddies with a lifespan exceeding 300 d during the period from 1995 to 2020, we identified two distinct peaks in the influence of eddies on air–sea CO2 fluxes during their life cycle: the first peak occurs approximately between the second and fifth deciles of the life cycle, during which the eddies have a broader impact range but weaker influence; the second peak emerges between the seventh and ninth deciles, exhibiting a narrower impact range but significantly stronger influence. These findings provide crucial quantitative evidence for understanding the marine carbon sequestration mechanism and reveal the complexity and dynamic nature of mesoscale eddies’ impact on air–sea CO2 fluxes."

In the context of decision-making processes, there is growing interest in understanding the near-term climate evolution of this region. Climate change projections consistently indicate that Southern Europe and the Mediterranean region will undergo significantly drier conditions in the latter half of the 21st century. However, in considering the upcoming decade, a critical question arises: Are climate change projections the best product for understanding climate evolution in the near future? This is a matter of great importance for numerous stakeholders and decision-makers. In this study, using retrospective forecasts from eight decadal prediction systems contributing to the CMIP6 Decadal Climate Prediction Project and the corresponding ensemble of non-initialized simulations (historical and projections), we compare the capabilities of the state-of-the-art climate models in predicting the near-term climate anomalies of the wintertime Mediterranean region for some key quantities, also assessing the added value of initialization. Our findings indicate the superior performance of the decadal predictions, exhibiting higher skill than uninitialized historical simulations and projections, particularly over the North Atlantic subpolar gyre for surface temperature and over Southern Europe for precipitation. We also develop a hybrid (dynamical-statistical) model to explore the role of the North Atlantic Oscillation and subpolar sea surface temperatures on Mediterranean precipitation predictability. It is shown that the developed hybrid model further enhances predictive skill, underscoring the importance of using initialized decadal predictions for precipitation across Europe and the Mediterranean region."

Leung;Jasper F. Kok;Longlei Li;David M. Lawrence;Natalie M. Mahowald;Simone Tilmes;Erik Kluzek,A global dust emission dataset for estimating dust radiative forcings in climate models,"This study derives a gridded dust emission dataset for 1841–2000 by employing a combination of observed dust from core records and reanalyzed global dust cycle constraints. We evaluate the ability of global models to replicate the observed historical dust variability by using the emission dataset to force a historical simulation in an Earth system model. We show that prescribing our emissions forces the model to better match observations than other mechanistic models. 
 Sedimentary records indicate that atmospheric dust has increased substantially since preindustrial times. However, state-of-the-art global Earth system models (ESMs) are unable to capture this historical increase, posing challenges in assessing the impacts of desert dust on Earth's climate. To address this issue, we construct a globally gridded dust emission dataset (DustCOMMv1) spanning 1841–2000. We do so by combining 19 sedimentary records of dust deposition with observational and modeling constraints on the modern-day dust cycle. The derived emission dataset contains interdecadal variability of dust emissions as forced by the deposition flux records, which increased by approximately 50 % from 1851–1870 to 1981–2000. We further provide future dust emission datasets for 2000–2100 by assuming three possible scenarios for how future dust emissions will evolve. We evaluate the historical dust emission dataset and illustrate its effectiveness in enforcing a historical dust increase in ESMs by conducting a long-term (1851–2000) dust cycle simulation with the Community Earth System Model (CESM2). The simulated dust depositions are in reasonable agreement with the long-term increase in most sedimentary dust deposition records and with measured long-term trends in dust concentration at sites in Miami and Barbados. This contrasts with the CESM2 simulations using a process-based dust emission scheme and with simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), which show little to no secular trends in dust deposition, concentration, and optical depth. The DustCOMM emissions thus enable ESMs to account for the historical radiative forcings (RFs), including due to dust direct interactions with radiation (direct RF). Our CESM2 simulations estimate a 1981–2000 minus 1851–1870 direct RF of −0.10 W m−2 by dust aerosols up to 10 µm in diameter (PM10) at the top of atmosphere (TOA). This global dust emission dataset thus enables models to more accurately account for historical aerosol forcings, thereby improving climate change projections such as those in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment reports."

We then discuss how machine learning can advance the field, discussing recent work that provides potentially stronger and more robust links between observed data and future climate projections. We further discuss the challenges of applying machine learning to climate science. 
 Global climate change projections are subject to substantial modelling uncertainties. A variety of emergent constraints, as well as several other statistical model evaluation approaches, have been suggested to address these uncertainties. However, they remain heavily debated in the climate science community. Still, the central idea to relate future model projections to already observable quantities has no real substitute. Here, we highlight the validation perspective of predictive skill in the machine learning community as a promising alternative viewpoint. Specifically, we argue for quantitative approaches in which each suggested constraining relationship can be evaluated comprehensively based on out-of-sample test data – on top of qualitative physical plausibility arguments that are already commonplace in the justification of new emergent constraints. Building on this perspective, we review machine learning ideas for new types of controlling-factor analyses (CFAs). The principal idea behind these CFAs is to use machine learning to find climate-invariant relationships in historical data which hold approximately under strong climate change scenarios. On the basis of existing data archives, these climate-invariant relationships can be validated in perfect-climate-model frameworks. From a machine learning perspective, we argue that such approaches are promising for three reasons: (a) they can be objectively validated for both past data and future data, (b) they provide more direct – and, by design, physically plausible – links between historical observations and potential future climates, and (c) they can take high-dimensional and complex relationships into account in the functions learned to constrain the future response. We demonstrate these advantages for two recently published CFA examples in the form of constraints on climate feedback mechanisms (clouds, stratospheric water vapour) and discuss further challenges and opportunities using the example of a rapid adjustment mechanism (aerosol–cloud interactions). We highlight several avenues for future work, including strategies to address non-linearity, to tackle blind spots in climate model ensembles, to integrate helpful physical priors into Bayesian methods, to leverage physics-informed machine learning, and to enhance robustness through causal discovery and inference."

Lewis;Arthur J. Sedlacek III;Tyler Tatro;Maria A. Zawadowicz;Paquita Zuidema,Burning conditions and transportation pathways determine biomass-burning aerosol properties in the Ascension Island marine boundary layer,"Biomass-burning aerosol is commonly present in the marine boundary layer over the southeast Atlantic Ocean between June and October. Our research indicates that burning conditions, aerosol transport pathways, and prolonged oxidation processes (heterogeneous and aqueous phases) determine the chemical, microphysical, and optical properties of the boundary layer aerosol. Notably, we find that the aerosol optical properties can be estimated from the chemical properties alone. 
 African biomass-burning aerosol (BBA) in the southeast Atlantic Ocean (SEA) marine boundary layer (MBL) is an important contributor to Earth's radiation budget, yet its representation remains poorly constrained in regional and global climate models. Data from the Layered Atlantic Smoke Interactions with Clouds (LASIC) field campaign on Ascension Island (7.95° S, 14.36° W) provide insight into how burning conditions, fuel type, transport pathways, and atmospheric processing affect the chemical, microphysical, and optical properties of BBA between June and September 2017. A total of 10 individual plume events characterize the seasonal evolution of the BBA properties. Early-season inefficient fires, determined by low refractory black carbon to above-background carbon monoxide mixing ratios (rBC : ΔCO), led to enhanced concentrations of organic- and sulfate-rich aerosols. Mid-season efficient fires, determined by higher rBC : ΔCO values, led to rBC-enriched BBA. A mix of efficient and inefficient fires later in the season resulted in conflicting BBA properties. Prolonged transport (∼ 10 d) through the MBL and lower free troposphere (FT) facilitated chemical and aqueous-phase processing, which led to a reduction in organic aerosol mass concentrations. This resulted in lower organic aerosol (OA) to rBC (OA : rBC) mass ratios (2–5) in the MBL compared to higher values (5–15) in the nearby FT.

Source attribution is quantified by the local thermodynamics of the combustion temperature (NOx/NO2). Emission results identify sources which do not exist in the a priori datasets, especially medium industrial sources located next to the Yangtze River. 
 This study applies a mass-conserving model-free analytical approach to daily observations on a grid-by-grid basis of NO2 from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) to rapidly and flexibly quantify changing and emerging sources of NOx emissions at high spatial and daily temporal resolution. The inverted NOx emissions and optimized underlying ranges include quantification of the underlying atmospheric in situ processing, transport, and physics. The results are presented over three changing regions in China, including Shandong and Hubei, which are rapidly urbanizing and not frequently addressed in the global literature. The day-to-day and grid-by-grid emissions are found to be 1.96 ± 0.27 µg m−2 s−1 on pixels with available a priori values (1.94 µg m−2 s−1), while 1.22 ± 0.63 µg m−2 s−1 extra emissions are found on pixels in which the a priori inventory is lower than 0.3 µg m−2 s−1. Source attribution based on the thermodynamics of combustion temperature, atmospheric transport, and in situ atmospheric processing successfully identifies five different industrial source types. Emissions from these industrial sites adjacent to the Yangtze River are found to be 161. ± 68.9 Kt yr−1 (163 % higher than the a priori), consistent with missing light and medium industries located along the river, contradicting previous studies attributing water as the source of NOx emissions. Finally, the results reveal pixels with an uncertainty larger than day-to-day variability, providing quantitative information for placement of future monitoring stations. It is hoped that these findings will drive a new approach to top-down emissions estimates, in which emissions are quantified and updated continuously based consistently on remotely sensed measurements and associated uncertainties that actively reflect land-use changes and quantify misidentified emissions, while quantifying new datasets to inform the bottom-up emissions community."

Accurate and precise measurements with a high time resolution have been achieved, allowing use on aircraft, as demonstrated during flights in the USA. 
 Hydroxyl radical (OH) reactivity, which is the inverse lifetime of the OH radical, provides information on the burden of air pollutants, since almost all air pollutants react with OH. OH reactivity measurements from field experiments can help to identify gaps in the measurement of individual reactants and serve as a proxy for the potential formation of secondary pollutants, including ozone and particles. However, OH reactivity is not regularly measured specifically on airborne platforms due to the technical complexity of the instruments and/or the need for careful instrumental characterisation to apply accurate correction factors to account for secondary chemistry in the instruments. The method used in this work, based on the time-resolved measurement of OH radicals produced by laser flash photolysis in a flow tube, does not require corrections as secondary chemistry in the instrument is negligible for typical atmospheric conditions. However, the detection of OH radicals by laser-induced fluorescence is challenging. In this work, an OH reactivity instrument has been further developed specifically for airborne measurements. The laser system used to detect the OH radicals has been simplified compared to previous setups, thereby significantly reducing the need for user interaction. The improved sensitivity allows measurements to be made with a high time resolution on the order of seconds and a measurement precision of 0.3 s−1. The OH reactivity measurements were validated using a propane gas standard, which allowed the determination of the reaction rate constant of the OH reaction with propane. The values are in excellent agreement with literature recommendations within a range of 4 % to 8 %. Deviations are well within the combined uncertainties. The accuracy of the OH reactivity measurements is mainly limited by the determination of the instrumental zero, which has a typical maximum uncertainty of 0.5 s−1. The high sensitivity of the improved instrument facilitates the data acquisition on board an aircraft as demonstrated by its deployment during the AEROMMA (Atmospheric Emissions and Reactions Observed from Megacities to Marine Areas) campaign in 2023."

Accurate monitoring and reliable forecasting of snow and water resources in such basins are crucial for a wide range of applications. Our dataset is valuable for improving physics-based snow, land surface, and hydrological models, with potential applications in similar high-alpine catchments. 
 We present an hourly hydrometeorological and snow dataset with 100 m spatial resolution from the alpine Dischma watershed and its surroundings in eastern Switzerland, including station measurements of variables such as snow depth and catchment runoff. This dataset is particularly suited for different modelling experiments using distributed and process-based models, including physics-based snow and hydrological models. Additionally, the data are highly useful for testing various snow data assimilation schemes and for developing models representing snow–forest interactions. The dataset covers 7 water years from 1 October 2016 to 30 September 2023. The complete domain spans an area of 333 km2 with altitudes ranging from 1250 to 3228 m. The Dischma Basin, with its outlet at 1671 m elevation, occupies 42.9 km2. Included in the dataset are high-resolution (100 m) hourly meteorological data (air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, precipitation, and long- and shortwave radiation) from a numerical weather predication model and rain radar, land cover characteristics (primarily forest properties), and a digital elevation model. Notably, the dataset includes snow depth acquisitions obtained from airborne lidar and photogrammetry surveys, constituting the most extensive spatial snow depth dataset derived using such techniques in the European Alps. Along with these gridded datasets, we provide daily quality-controlled snow depth recordings from seven sites, biweekly snow water equivalent measurements from two locations, and hourly runoff and stream temperature observations for the Dischma watershed. The data compiled in this study will be useful to further develop our ability to forecast snow and hydrological conditions in high-alpine headwater catchments that are particularly sensitive to ongoing climate change.

Under long-term climate change, the carbon storage in sediments slows down carbon cycling and influences feedbacks in the atmosphere–ocean–sediment system. This paper describes the coupling of a sediment model to an ocean biogeochemistry model and presents results under the pre-industrial climate and under CO2 perturbation. 
 This study describes the coupling of the process-based Model of Early Diagenesis in the Upper Sediment with Adaptable complexity (MEDUSA version 2) to an existing ocean biogeochemistry model consisting of the Finite-volumE Sea ice–Ocean Model (FESOM version 2.1) and the Regulated Ecosystem Model (REcoM version 3). Atmospheric CO2 in the model is a prognostic variable which is determined by the carbonate chemistry in the surface ocean. The model setup and its application to a pre-industrial control climate state is described in detail. In the coupled model, 1390 PgC is stored in the top 10 cm of the bioturbated sediment, mainly as calcite, but also as organic matter (10 %). In the coupled simulation, atmospheric CO2 stabilizes at ∼295 ppm after 2000 years, in line with the CO2 level expected from the climate forcing conditions. Sediment burial of carbon, alkalinity, and nutrients in the coupled simulation is set to be compensated by riverine input. The spatial distribution of biological production is altered depending on the location of riverine input and reduction in sedimentary input, as well as the strength of local nutrient limitation, while the global productivity is not affected substantially. With this coupled ocean–sediment system the model is able to simulate the carbonate compensation feedback under moderate perturbation of CO2 in the atmosphere."

However, the release and lability of soil carbon following wildfire remain unclear, limiting our ability to predict fire impacts on carbon cycling. Here, we investigated chemical alterations in soil water-extractable organic matter (WEOM) following a subtropical forest wildfire by comparing burned soils to an adjacent unburned site. The consensus is that fire-altered DOM is aromatic and less reactive. However, we found that 10 months postfire, burned soils contained nearly three times more water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC) than the control site. Reactomics analysis further revealed an overall 8-fold increase in potential reactivity of this carbon, identified by higher abundances of molecular formulas involved in identified microbial reaction pathways. Specifically, burned soils exhibited elevated potential oxidative enzyme reactions, linked to a higher nominal oxidation state of carbon (NOSC) in WEOM. Metagenomic analysis revealed an enrichment of microbial taxa specialized in degrading aromatic compounds in burned areas, supporting the occurrence of potential microbial reaction pathways acting on WEOM in postfire soils. These findings highlight that wildfires may accelerate soil carbon loss through reactive WEOM mobilization and microbial response, with implications for long-term carbon-climate projections."

Based on exposure data of 46 chemicals in a nationally representative 13,286 people, logistic regression and mixture modeling were used to preliminarily identify environmental pollutants with significant impacts on 12 indicators for cardiometabolic disorders. A total of 15 chemicals were found to be associated with the integrated latent class, among which four chemicals (perfluorononanoic acid [PFNA], perfluorooctanoic acid [PFOA], thiocyanate, and thallium) also contributed significantly to the mixture effect. We constructed the adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) for nine significant toxicants in both models of individual chemicals and the mixture for each cardiometabolic disorder. Notably, fluoroalkyl substances affect multiple aspects of hyperlipidemia by activating PPARα. We performed molecular docking and in vitro experiments to verify and supplement the toxicological mechanism of PFNA. Through binding to PPARα, PFNA increased the levels of downstream molecules including CD36 (fatty acid transfer), ACSL1 (fatty acid activation), and CPT1a (intracellular transfer for β-oxidation) and ultimately promoted the accumulation of triglycerides and lipid droplets in HepG2 cells.

Herein, we revealed the distinct adsorption, oxidation, and crystallization mechanisms of Mn on hematite (Hem), ferrihydrite (Fhy), and goethite (Gth). Gth exhibited highest ability in Mn(II) removal and oxidation, followed by Hem and Fhy. Manganite and hausmannite were the main MnOx products with distinct proportions, and morphologies cross the systems. MnOx growth mechanisms involve surface-induced nucleation, crystallization by particle attachment (CPA), and self-catalyzed growth. On Fhy, self-catalyzed growth was dominant; for Gth, surface-induced nucleation was prevalent, supplemented by CPA; and Hem combined all three mechanisms. These distinct mechanisms led to nanoparticles primarily of hausmannite on Gth and nanowires of manganite and hausmannite on Hem and Fhy, with those on Hem displaying lower aspect ratios. Differences in MnOx structure and morphology were attributed to Mn(II)-FeOx complexation, FeOx electronic band structure, and crystal structure mismatch between MnOx and FeOx, which respectively influenced the direct and indirect electron transfer and heterogeneous nucleation efficiency. This work advances our understanding of MnOx crystallization on FeOx at the nanoscale, explaining the diverse morphology and structure of MnOx in different environments."

Traditional purification techniques, while adept at removing sulfur-containing acid gases (e.g., H2S) and hydrocarbons, have overlooked a critical aspect: the efficient management of mercury, leading to storage tank corrosion and significant safety hazards in gas utilization. In this study, we demonstrate that core–shell ZnS@Sx enriched with low-coordinated polysulfide species, prepared by coating the sulfur shell through the in situ conversion of H2S with additional SO2 on the surface of the ZnS core, exhibits a superior saturated Hg0 adsorption capacity of 79.8 mg/g, over 1000 times that of the pristine ZnS counterpart. In situ spectroscopic analysis revealed a direct positive correlation (R2 = 0.9524) between the concentration of short-chain Sx (x = 3–5) and Hg0 adsorption ability. Theoretical calculations further substantiated the superior adsorption energy of ZnS@S4 for Hg0 among the various Sx species. Notably, the activity of ZnS@Sx is efficiently restored through intermittent online H2S conversion, achieving the concurrent purification of mercury and partial acid gas, paving the way for a safer and more sustainable natural gas utilization."

Based on satellite and multiaxes-differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) data, the horizontal and vertical distributions of the FNR have been respectively obtained. To further enhance the generalizability of this approach, we also reproduced the vertical profiles of the FNR using a machine learning model (Bagged trees) and feature variables. Here, using the three-dimensional distribution of the FNR during the summer of 2019 as an example, a fourth-order polynomial relationship was found between the reconstruction factors (fcol_i) and altitudes, demonstrating a correlation coefficient of 0.98. Utilizing this established relationship, a significant difference was found between the reconstructed surface FNR and the satellite column FNR, with the former decreasing by 56.9%. Moreover, the reconstructed 3D spatial distribution of the FNR for the summers from 2018 to 2022 revealed a trend over the five years in Shanghai of the ozone formation control regimes gradually shifting toward the transition and NOx-limited regimes.

As such, emission avoidance or carbon sequestration monitoring can be conducted directly and in the same location as the projects.

We apply a Bayesian inversion to compute the posterior distribution of potential dike opening models for each eruption by considering dv/v $dv/v$ measurements for varying channel pairs and frequency bands, and assuming this velocity change is tied to volumetric strain associated with dike‐opening.

Here we find that the projected Antarctic warming robustly correlates with simulated averaged temperature trends during 1958–2012 across the CMIP6 multi‐models under each scenario, which is thereby used to refine future air temperature projections using observation‐based temperature reconstruction. The median of future warming projections under the five scenarios reduces by 24%, 19%, 18%, 21%, and 21%, respectively. The constrained uncertainty ranges are narrowed down, with the likely range by the end of the century relative to 1850–1900 baseline declining from 4.2°C–6.8°C to 3.2°C–6.1°C under the highest emission scenario.

Paleoclimate proxies indicate that similar OAC drifts occurred on orbital timescale as well. However, the characteristics and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, by conducting simulations with different Earth's orbits, we investigate how changes in Earth‐Sun distance affect the OAC. We find that a closer Earth‐Sun distance (perihelion) causes a poleward drift of OAC. This drift in circulation is dynamically consistent with displacement of meridional temperature gradient. Precession alters the perihelion season on orbital timescales, leading to a seasonal poleward drift in OAC. This drift is amplified during the hemispheric summer, reaching magnitudes of ∼ ${\sim} $10° under high eccentricity. The identified OAC drifts reshape the seasonality of precipitation and temperature over land, as well as ocean upwelling and downwelling, ultimately affecting the distribution of Earth's terrestrial and marine ecosystems."

This is because melting of surrounding peridotite, together with the EM1 component, can dilute the “EM1 fingerprints” in these rocks. Here, we present barium isotope data for well‐characterized EM1‐type continental basalts from northeast China to constrain their nature and origin. Our results show that these basalts have δ138/134Ba values ranging from −0.1‰ to 0.08‰, which are lower than the depleted MORB mantle. Correlations between δ138/134Ba and K/U, Ba/Th, U/Pb, εNd and 206Pb/204Pb suggest a heterogeneous source involving binary mixing between the lithospheric mantle and an EM1 component. The EM1 component, characterized by light δ138/134Ba and low 206Pb/204Pb ratios, can be attributed to the addition of recycled ancient sediments to the source.

We use long‐term cloud radar observations to statistically investigate the horizontal and vertical dimensions as well as the typical duration of riming events. We extend a recent retrieval for rime mass fraction into an algorithm that can separate the data into individual riming events and estimate the spatial dimensions using horizontal wind profiles. For 2,500 riming events, we find an average horizontal extent of the riming regions of 13 km and a duration of 18 min. Vertical profiles indicate that the majority of rime mass is built within the uppermost 250 m of the region where the radar can detect riming. Similar to previous studies, the riming events are almost exclusively detected between 0°C and −15°C. To further examine the correlation between riming and thermodynamic profiles, we derived liquid water content from radiosonde data. We find that strong riming usually starts close to the level where the liquid water path exceeds 0.2 kg m−2. By defining a control group of nonriming events, we also find significantly enhanced liquid water below the −15°C isotherm for the riming cases. However, the existence of the 0.2 kg m−2 level in ice clouds alone is not indicative of strong riming. We find this level to be four times more likely than strong riming events. We expect our multiyear statistical riming characteristics to be valuable for the future development of riming retrievals and model validation."

A Regional Assessment to Improve Water Supply Availability Considering Potential Storage and Flood Scenarios,"Most of the world's population faces freshwater scarcity threats, and reservoirs, built both for ensuring water supply during prolonged droughts and reducing downstream flood risks, are critical infrastructure for water sustainability. Historical inflow data and water demand were used to estimate reservoir storage allocation and operation policies when designing and building reservoirs, 50–100 years ago. This study assesses historical reservoir operations in 16 Southeastern reservoirs and evaluates the potential for utilizing existing flood control storage for alternative purposes without increasing downstream flood risk. Using a reservoir simulation model, we evaluate the resulting storage under four initial storage conditions for observed and synthetic seasonal maximum 6‐day flood pulses. For most reservoirs, we find conservation storage is depleting and did not exceed the flood storage capacity in their historical operation. The simulation model resulted in most of the reservoirs' storage levels staying within the flood control pool for all scenarios (for observed and synthetic floods). Additional flood risk was lowest for initial storage condition 1 (flood control pool empty) and highest with condition 2 (50% of the flood control pool full). Flood risk increased the most for reservoirs with small ratios of flood control to conservation pool storage. Our study shows the potential for reallocation and utilization of flood control storage to meet the increasing demand. As limited opportunities for new reservoirs exist, utilizing current reservoir storage without introducing additional downstream risk may be an effective management strategy to mitigate flood and drought risk under climate change and population growth."

 The mammalian fatty acid synthase (FASN) enzyme is a dynamic multienzyme that belongs to the megasynthase family. In mammals, a single gene encodes six catalytically active domains and a flexibly tethered acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain that shuttles intermediates between active sites for fatty acid biosynthesis1. FASN is an essential enzyme in mammalian development through the role that fatty acids have in membrane formation, energy storage, cell signalling and protein modifications. Thus, FASN is a promising target for treatment of a large variety of diseases including cancer, metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease, and viral and parasite infections2,3. The multi-faceted mechanism of FASN and the dynamic nature of the protein, in particular of the ACP, have made it challenging to understand at the molecular level. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of human FASN in a multitude of conformational states with NADPH and NADP+ plus acetoacetyl-CoA present, including structures with the ACP stalled at the dehydratase (DH) and enoyl-reductase (ER) domains. We show that FASN activity in vitro and de novo lipogenesis in cells is inhibited by mutations at the ACP–DH and ACP–ER interfaces. Together, these studies provide new molecular insights into the dynamic nature of FASN and the ACP shuttling mechanism, with implications for developing improved FASN-targeted therapeutics.

 The surface of Mars has long been seen as a basaltic, monotonous world, but observations in the past decade have revealed more petrological diversity. Orbital and in situ rover investigations show that Mars developed a silica-rich crust early in its history. This is supported by studies of the Martian regolith breccia Northwest Africa (NWA) 7533 (and paired meteorites). When and to what extent rocks on Mars differentiated, and which geodynamical process could lead to this evolution, is still unclear. Here we use petrology and in situ geochemical analyses to document the presence of quartz in lithic clasts of NWA 7533. The clasts have a granitic composition with a mineral assemblage dominated by quartz, potassium feldspar and plagioclase. Such quartz-bearing clasts are the most evolved silicic rocks yet recognized among differentiated Martian lithologies. These clasts suggest the likely existence of pre-Noachian granitic rocks on Mars that formed in the presence of water. In bulk composition they resemble the oldest terrestrial rocks (Acasta gneisses, Canada) and also rocks from the large Sudbury impact structure. Therefore, we suggest that the combined action of hydrothermal activity and impact melting could have triggered the formation of granitic rocks and evolved crust on early Mars and Earth.

In this study, we perform large-scale molecular dynamics simulations driven by machine learning potentials of ab initio quality to investigate the diffusion of W along ferropericlase grain boundaries and in (Mg,Fe)O liquid.

 Individuals experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depression have been shown to exhibit persistent underconfidence. The origin of such metacognitive biases presents a puzzle, given that individuals should be able to learn appropriate levels of confidence from observing their own performance. In two large general population samples (N = 230 and N = 278), we measure both 'local' confidence in individual task instances and 'global' confidence as longer-run self-performance estimates while manipulating external feedback. Global confidence is sensitive to both local confidence and feedback valence—more frequent positive (negative) feedback increases (respectively decreases) global confidence, with asymmetries in feedback also leading to shifts in affective self-beliefs. Notably, however, global confidence exhibits reduced sensitivity to instances of higher local confidence in individuals with greater subclinical anxious-depression symptomatology, despite sensitivity to feedback valence remaining intact. Our finding of blunted sensitivity to increases in local confidence offers a mechanistic basis for how persistent underconfidence is maintained in the face of intact performance.

 Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is an emerging biomarker for the treatment of early breast cancer (EBC). We sought to evaluate a highly sensitive tumor-informed ctDNA assay in a real-world cohort of patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) to assess clinical validity and explore prognostic outcomes. ctDNA is detected in 77.2% (88/114) of participants at baseline, with 18/88 (20.5%) having a baseline estimated variant allele frequency (eVAF) of <0.01%. Persistent detection of ctDNA, measured midway through NAT (mid-NAT), is associated with disease recurrence in all participants, reaching statistical significance in those with HER2-negative disease. Stratified analyses demonstrate that ctDNA detected mid-NAT enhances the prognostic accuracy of the residual cancer burden (RCB) score for disease recurrence. Postoperative or follow-up detection of ctDNA demonstrates a 100% positive predictive value for disease recurrence, with a median lead time of 374 days (range: 13-1010 days). These data suggest that assays with high analytical sensitivity may improve baseline ctDNA detection in patients with EBC. The ability to replicate the prognostic association of ctDNA dynamics in a real-world cohort supports further investigation. Prospective trials incorporating ctDNA testing are warranted to assess and develop the clinical utility of ctDNA-guided treatment strategies.

Here authors reveal that embryonic ablation of cerebellar output neurons leads to powerful compensation by extra-cerebellar circuits, whereas mutations (En1/2) disrupt extra-cerebellar circuits regulating non-motor behaviors. 
 The capacity of the brain to compensate for insults during development depends on the type of cell loss, whereas the consequences of genetic mutations in the same neurons are difficult to predict. We reveal powerful compensation from outside the mouse cerebellum when the excitatory cerebellar output neurons are ablated embryonically and demonstrate that the main requirement for these neurons is for motor coordination and not basic learning and social behaviors. In contrast, loss of the homeobox transcription factors Engrailed1/2 (EN1/2) in the cerebellar excitatory lineage leads to additional deficits in adult learning and spatial working memory, despite half of the excitatory output neurons being intact. Diffusion MRI indicates increased thalamo-cortico-striatal connectivity in En1/2 mutants, showing that the remaining excitatory neurons lacking En1/2 exert adverse effects on extracerebellar circuits regulating motor learning and select non-motor behaviors. Thus, an absence of cerebellar output neurons is less disruptive than having cerebellar genetic mutations.

They show high responsiveness of phenology to EWEs and highlight the potential for EWEs to drive phenological mismatches. 
 The ability to explain and predict phenology across space, time and taxa has largely relied on annual average and seasonal climatic variables, ignoring the potential role of extreme weather events (EWEs) in regulating phenology. Yet, EWEs, which are predicted to increase in their severity and frequency with climate change, are also probably strong proximal phenology cues. Here we leveraged expansive community science resources to determine how EWEs affect plant flowering and insect flight beginning, termination and duration for 581 angiosperm species and 172 Lepidoptera across the contiguous United States. Our results provide evidence that plant and insect phenology is highly responsive to EWEs after accounting for seasonal and annual average climatic variables. The impact of EWEs on phenology varies depending on climatic context, and plant and insect responsiveness, while often similar, can be in the opposite directions. This suggests that EWEs may be key drivers of multitrophic phenological mismatches.

 This paper systemically assesses the performances of two assimilation methods, i.e., the Offline Ensemble Kalman Filter (OEnKF) and the Hybrid Gain Analog Offline EnKF (HGAOEnKF) with three proxy databases, on reconstructing the temperature and precipitation during the last two millennia. The results show that, among three databases, increasing the number of proxy records significantly improves the reconstruction skill for both assimilation methods, with a larger improvement in HGAOEnKF. In the instrumental era, six reconstructions have comparable skill (similar correlation coefficients, CEs, and RMSEs) when validated against out-of-sample proxy records and instrumental reanalyses. During the pre-industrial era, HGAOEnKF shows better assimilation performance by improving the background field of assimilation when the number of proxy records is limited. Compared with the temperature reconstruction, the skill of precipitation reconstruction is relatively lower. The proxy records from the ocean contribute more to the temperature reconstruction skill with both assimilation methods. Finally, a new reanalysis product (NNU-2ka Reanalysis) is generated through the HGAOEnKF with the expanded proxy database."

 The demise of the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) and the rise of the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912) marked an epochal moment in Chinese and world history. Attention has been given to the North China droughts during 1627–1643 that destabilized the Ming Dynasty. However, there is little attention paid to how climate influenced the rise of a minority Manchu state in Northeast China and its conquest of the Ming. Here, we find that contrasting climate conditions between North and Northeast China persisted over a six-decade period (1581–1644), which diversely affected economic, societal, and political changes at the regional level. Five successive megadroughts ravaged North China, while relatively wet and mild climate conditions prevailed in the Manchu homeland of Northeast China. Furthermore, in the early decades of Manchu rule in North China (1645–1680), increased precipitation facilitated the Qing Dynasty’s consolidation. Reconstructions and climate model simulations revealed that these unusual climatic patterns were influenced by the centennial variation of clustering El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and were amplified by the Little Ice Age cooling. These findings shed light on how long-term contrasting future climate changes could lead to divergent socioeconomic responses, potentially increasing the risk of conflict between neighboring states."

Given their present submergence, little is known about the vegetation dynamics, particularly at annual time scales, of these formerly terrestrial sites due to erosional processes associated with marine transgressions.

This chronology not only reveals historical vegetation dynamics at annual resolutions during Marine Isotope Stages 3–5a, but it also captures a catastrophic mortality event likely connected to intense storm activity, perhaps driven by freshwater fluxes from Heinrich events.

 Fires are a major source of air pollutants in Southeast Asia. Over the past few decades, there has been an increase in fire activities in this region, and the causes are not entirely clear. By analyzing multiple observational and reanalysis datasets, as well as conducting climate model simulations, we uncover a distinct positive impact of Arctic sea ice loss on Southeast Asian fire weather. There is a possibility that the fall in the autumn Sea Ice Concentration (SIC) over the Beaufort Sea the year prior contributes to the increase in boreal spring fire activity in Southeast Asia. This sea ice reduction generates a local low warm anomaly, triggering an upper atmosphere Rossby wave train that propagates from the tropical Pacific to Southeast Asia and arrives in Southeast Asia as a high-pressure anomaly with descending air. Moreover, two meridional cells originating from equatorial and polar regions intensify the sinking airflow. This Arctic-driven teleconnection causes high pressure with warmer and dryer surfaces in Southeast Asia, creating favorable conditions for fire ignition and expansion. Based on the fire weather classification criteria, a negative change in SIC of one standard deviation below the climatological mean will expose over 500 million people to very high levels of fire pollution across Southeast Asia, and the number of people exposed to extreme fires will be 1000 times greater than in the present scenario. The above-mentioned mechanism has great implications for projecting decadal air quality and developing relevant health policies to cope with climate change in Southeast Asia."

 Human well-being relies on the presence and role of pollinators, as they contribute to the vitality of ecosystems, support the reproduction of wild plants, increase crop yields, and strengthen overall food security. While wild bee populations are dwindling due to climate and environmental change, there has been a notable 45% rise globally in the number of managed honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies over the past five decades. Given their economic significance and their relative ease of tracking, honey bees have the potential to serve as bioindicators of global pollinator health. Consequently, honey bees have emerged as a keystone species requiring protection and conservation efforts. Here, we investigate the intricate relationship between air quality, environmental factors, and honey bee mortality across Canada and the United States. Using statistical and machine learning modeling, our findings underscore the honey bee’s role as a bioindicator. We found that air quality is an important predictor of honey bee mortality. The risk of honey bee mortality increased with poor air quality (ozone and Air Quality Health Index) but was substantially reduced in regions with greater vegetation availability (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). Therefore, our study offers a beacon of hope: improving management practices by increasing greenery can significantly mitigate the impact of deteriorating air quality on honey bees, providing a vital solution to safeguard our essential pollinators.

 Stratospheric aerosol injection could mitigate harmful effects of global warming, but could have undesirable side effects, such as warming the stratosphere and depleting the ozone layer. We explore the potential benefits of solid alumina and calcite particles as alternatives to sulfate aerosols by using an experimentally informed aerosol-chemistry-climate model. Compared to sulfur dioxide, injection of solids reduces stratospheric warming by up to 70% and diffuse radiation by up to 40%, highlighting their potential benefits. Achieving −1 W m−2 of radiative forcing would likely result in very small ozone changes, but sizable uncertainties remain. These arise from poorly understood heterogeneous chemical and microphysical processes, which, under less likely assumptions, could lead to larger global ozone column changes between −14% and +4%. Our work provides recommendations for improving the understanding of stratospheric aerosol injection using materials other than sulfur dioxide, and underscores the need for kinetic laboratory studies.

 Seagrass meadows facilitate the capture and storage of organic carbon, but spatial variability in carbon has been observed among and within meadows. Here we combine sediment and seagrass data with aerial images collected near the Annisquam River, Massachusetts, USA to examine spatial variations in carbon retention across a patchy seagrass meadow. Tidal velocities were reduced within patches and elevated in bare regions, which was expected to promote carbon accumulation within the patches. However, organic carbon was not correlated with the spatial distributions of seagrass or velocity. Historical aerial images showed continual patch movement, with vegetation persistence of less than a decade throughout the meadow. The highest carbon stock occurred in the largest area of recent vegetation persistence. Though present for >45 years, the meadow accumulated negligible carbon, likely due to the migration of patches.

 Mediterranean coastal wetlands account for important biodiversity and ecosystem services. But climate-change induced sea-level rise poses a critical risk to their survival. Here, we assess these risks for Mediterranean coastal marshes, one key type of Mediterranean coastal wetlands, and identify main drivers for future coastal marsh change for the Mediterranean and comparable coastlines. We apply an integrated modelling approach that accounts for future sea-level rise, sediment accretion, coastal management and marsh inland migration processes. Depending on climate mitigation scenarios, widespread coastal marsh loss is projected, ranging from 8% to 92% of current extents. For Egypt, France, and Algeria, we predict (near) total loss of coastal marshes by 2100 for current coastal management and sediment supply scenarios. Overall, losses could at least be halved if additional inland migration space were created, e.g. through passive or active habitat restoration. Bold climate mitigation and local adaptation are needed to preserve existing coastal marshes.

 The patchy distribution of prey in marine environments has a large effect on upper trophic level foraging strategies and distributions. While currents can disperse or concentrate low-motility plankton into patches that reflect the dynamic fluid environments they inhabit, it remains unclear whether surface flows affect motile zooplankton. Here, we used an in-situ optical dataset to detect phytoplankton patches, active acoustics to observe krill, and GPS-tagged penguins to observe three levels of the food web. These data allowed us to investigate whether the local food web overlaps with small-scale surface transport patterns as evidence that dynamic flows structure marine food webs. In Palmer Deep Canyon, Antarctica, we deployed High Frequency radars to measure hourly ocean surface currents, which were subsequently applied to estimate attractive Lagrangian Coherent Structures. We found that phytoplankton patches, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) and gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) were preferentially located in attracting Lagrangian Coherent Structure features. These results provide evidence that Lagrangian Coherent Structures act as hotspots for prey and associated foraging predators, thus spatially focusing the food web.

 Orogenic reconstructions typically assume lithostatic pressure, which can be converted into burial depth. Deviations from lithostatic conditions, such as fluid overpressure, are recognized but poorly understood in natural rocks. Here we integrate petrological analysis, radiometric dating, and diffusion chronology to explore the thermal overprinting on metapelites from a Precambrian orogen caused by ca. 110 Ma porphyritic intrusions in Northern Korea. The dissolution-reprecipitation textures of garnet and monazite from the metapelites reveal rapid heating, dehydration, and reworking within ~300 years, reaching 600‒640 °C and 0.75‒0.85 GPa at ca. 110 Ma. The barometric results indicate depths that, if lithostatic, sharply contrast with the shallow emplacement of the contemporaneous porphyries nearby, indicating dehydration-induced supralithostatic fluid overpressure. These findings challenge the lithostatic paradigm and suggest that rapid dehydration and deviation from lithostatic pressures may be more prevalent than previously recognized, with important implications for orogenic reconstructions and seismogenic behaviors at plate boundaries.

 Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) has considerable potential for large-scale soil moisture (SM) monitoring. With the Fengyun-3 (FY-3) E, F, and G satellites currently in orbit, the FY-3 satellite series has formed the GNSS-R constellation. A comprehensive analysis and validation of the SM retrieval capability of the FY-3 GNSS-R constellation observations are essential. This study is the first to use FY-3 GNSS-R constellation observations to evaluate their performance in quasi-global daily SM retrieval. Specifically, this study proposed an effective SM retrieval method for obtaining an FY-3 GNSS-R SM with minimal ancillary data. Compared with the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) reference SM, the FY-3 SM exhibited a reasonable global spatial pattern as SMAP, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.039 cm3/cm3 in low vegetation areas. Validation results from over 200 independent in situ stations showed that the unbiased RMSE and correlation for FY-3 SM were 0.039 cm3/cm3 and 0.60, respectively. Triple collocation (TC) analysis showed that the standard deviation and correlation for the FY-3 SM were 0.017 cm3/cm3 and 0.62, respectively. Global and local validations indicate that the SM derived from the FY-3 GNSS-R constellation observations has well-defined accuracy and effectively captures spatiotemporal variations. Compared to the contemporaneous Cyclone GNSS official SM, the accuracy of the FY-3 SM retrieved using the proposed method improved by 17.1 %. Consequently, the SM from the FY-3 GNSS-R constellation observations can be an invaluable complement to the global SM dataset. Furthermore, this method effectively reduced systematic bias and random errors in SM retrievals (unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE) from 0.041to 0.034 cm3/cm3and TC standard deviation from 0.034to 0.017 cm3/cm3), which may provide a valuable reference for generating SM products from subsequent FY-3 GNSS-R constellations."

 Particulate organic carbon (POC) is fundamental to the marine carbon cycle, yet accurately estimating its concentration from satellite data remains challenging. In this study, we developed a novel machine learning framework that incorporates multiple data streams, covering apparent and inherent optical properties, biological indicators, and environmental variables, to improve global POC retrieval. Our model achieved high accuracy, with a Spearman’s correlation coefficient of 0.92, root-mean-square error of 68.46 mg m−3, and median absolute percentage error of 25.01 %, outperforming conventional algorithms that rely solely on remote sensing reflectance. Applying our approach to a long-term satellite dataset (1997–2023), we identified four major seasonal variation patterns across different oceanic regions: In high-latitude regions (Type 1), POC peaks in summer due to increased light availability, while mid-latitudes (Type 2) exhibit a stable pattern with a spring peak driven by water mixing and favorable sea surface temperatures. In the Equatorial Atlantic and Indian Oceans (Type 3), a spring trough and autumn peak suggest potential significant wind-driven nutrient inputs, whereas the Equatorial Pacific (Type 4) maintains high POC levels year-round, likely influenced by persistent upwelling and nutrient dynamics. These findings highlight the advantages of integrating machine learning for improved POC estimations and provides deeper insights into global POC dynamics."

 Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTSs) are severe manifestations of permafrost degradation with profound implications for regional environments and ecosystems. Previous studies heavily rely on high-resolution imagery and deep learning methods for RTS mapping. However, the acquisition of high-resolution imagery and the extensive computation of the deep learning-based method present challenges for long-term and large-scale monitoring. The image stacks method can overcome the defects of deep learning but is not sensitive in low-productivity ecosystems. This study proposes a feature-enhanced image stacks method. Instead of utilizing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) directly in time-series change detection, the method employs the ratio of NDVI to its background value to enhance weak RTS signals caused by little change in NDVI or climate variation. A case study applied in the source region of the Yangtze River (SRYR), Tibetan Plateau, indicates that the method can amplify the RTS signal by more than 50 %, yielding accuracy slightly lower than the deep learning methods based on high-resolution imagery, but with a speed advantage of nearly an order of magnitude. The overall precision is 0.74, the F1 score is 0.73, and the maximum Intersection over Union (IOU) is 0.8. The delineation of RTSs takes about half an hour for the entire study area (158,000 km2), even with relatively low hardware specifications. Besides, the experiment conducted in the Horton Delta in the Arctic also demonstrates a good generalization of the method, with signal enhancement exceeding 80 %. This study confirms the feasibility of using medium-resolution data for long-term and large-scale RTS monitoring and will contribute to understanding the impact of climate change on permafrost dynamics in cold regions."

 Nitrous acid (HONO) is a critical precursor of the hydroxyl radical (OH) and plays a pivotal role in atmospheric photochemistry. Although nitrogen dioxide (NO2) heterogeneous reactions (HET) on ground and aerosol surfaces are widely recognized as major paths of HONO production, their influencing factors are not well characterized in air quality models, limiting the understanding of HONO formation and the quantification of their regional impact. In this study, a novel parameterization scheme for the NO2 uptake coefficient, including the effects of solar radiation, relative humidity (RH) and ammonia (NH3), was developed and coupled into the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry. Nine simulation scenarios were designed to assess the impacts of RH and NH3 on HONO chemistry and O3 levels in the North China Plain (NCP). The results showed that the RH-impacted HET contributed 10−25% of HONO, with a significant increase of more than 35% during the haze periods; whereas the NH3-impacted HET contributed 15% of nighttime HONO and <5% of noontime HONO, playing a more significant role in rural areas. Vertically, the RH-impacted HET contribution to nighttime HONO concentrations remained 26−31% at an altitude of 700–900 m due to the higher RH levels (50−60%) during the haze periods; whereas the NH3-impacted HET contribution was minor above 500 m owing to the fast-decreasing NH3 concentrations with height. When RH exceeded the turning point (70%), nighttime HONO was suppressed by up to 1 ppb in eastern NCP. The combination of RH and NH3 produced a ground daily maximum 8h averaged O3 enhancement of 6–14 μg m−3 during the haze periods, exceeding the effect of solar radiation. These findings deepen our understanding of the role of RH and NH3 in HONO chemistry and imply the importance of reasonably expressing HET in air quality models."

They rely on inventories of past landslide locations, which are difficult to collect and often nonrepresentative. Furthermore, susceptibility maps are most needed in regions without the means to assemble an inventory. To overcome these challenges, we develop a method for assessing shallow landslide susceptibility based on a probabilistic morphometric analysis of the landscape’s topography, rather than the characteristics of landslides. The model assumes that hillslopes with higher relief and gradient compared to the surrounding landscape are more prone to landslides. We demonstrate the superior performance of this approach over contrasting data-driven models across the northwestern United States. As our morphometric model only requires elevation data, it overcomes the major limitations of data-driven models and facilitates the creation of effective susceptibility models in areas where it was previously unfeasible."

Here, we report that during oxidative stress, TDP-43 becomes SUMO2/3-ylated by the SUMO E3 ligase protein PIAS4 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT 4) and enriches in cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs). Upon pharmacological inhibition of TDP-43 SUMO2/3-ylation or PIAS4 depletion, TDP-43 enrichment in SGs is accompanied by irreversible aggregation. In cells that are unable to assemble SGs, SUMO2/3-ylation of TDP-43 is strongly impaired, supporting the notion that SGs are compartments that promote TDP-43 SUMO2/3-ylation during oxidative stress. Binding of TDP-43 to UG-rich RNA antagonizes PIAS4-mediated SUMO2/3-ylation, while RNA dissociation promotes TDP-43 SUMO2/3-ylation.

Gene family-wide characterization of their organismal expression and function is, however, lacking. Using genome-engineered reporter alleles, we established an atlas of expression of the entire set of 12 cadherin gene family members in the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans, revealing differential expression across neuronal classes, a dichotomy between broadly and narrowly expressed cadherins, and several context-dependent temporal transitions in expression across development. Engineered mutant null alleles of cadherins were analyzed for defects in morphology, behavior, neuronal soma positions, neurite neighborhood topology and fasciculation, and localization of synapses in many parts of the nervous system. This analysis revealed a restricted pattern of neuronal differentiation defects at discrete subsets of anatomical scales, including a novel role of cadherins in experience-dependent electrical synapse formation. In total, our analysis results in previously little explored perspectives on cadherin deployment and function."

However, its existence remains under debate despite several experimental reports. In this study, we investigated the infrared transitions of methane embedded in clusters of parahydrogen molecules at 0.4 K using high-resolution helium nanodroplet spectroscopy. Our results revealed fully quantized rotational states of methane with minimal interference from surrounding H2molecules, enabling precise determination of the rotational constant for each hydrogen cluster. The cluster-size dependence of the determined rotational constant aligns with behavior predicted by path-integral Monte Carlo simulations, indicating that more than 60% of the hydrogen molecules in the clusters participate in quantum bosonic exchanges, a characteristic feature of superfluidity. This work provides strong experimental evidence for the existence of a superfluid phase of molecular hydrogen at 0.4 K, representing a major step forward in understanding quantum behaviors in molecular systems."

In a liquid crystal (LC), the topological nature of disclination lines and colloids induces chiral colloidal entanglements. How the chirality of the entanglements is deterministically created and how the chirality conversion is actuated in the disclinations with Möbius strip topology have never been explored. Here, we create colloidal entanglements with designed chirality in the nematic disclination loops with Möbius topology. An irreversible process of chirality change is revealed if we move the colloidal entanglement along the loops. A nonreciprocal chirality conversion in the dynamical colloidal entanglements is demonstrated, which is induced by the interplay between topological profiles and the geometrical curvature of the disclination loop. Colloidal entanglements in opposite chirality are templated in arbitrary shapes of disclination lines. This work opens opportunities to design smart colloidal materials."

Here, we describe a modular cell-free biosensing platform for generalizable protein detection that we call TLISA (T7 RNA polymerase–linked immunosensing assay), designed for extreme flexibility and equipment-free use. TLISA uses a split T7 RNA polymerase fused to affinity domains against a protein. The target antigen drives polymerase reassembly, inducing reporter expression. We characterize the platform and then demonstrate its modularity by using 16 affinity domains against four different antigens with minimal protocol optimization. We show that TLISA is suitable for POC use by sensing human biomarkers in serum and saliva with a colorimetric readout within 1 hour and by demonstrating functionality after lyophilization. Altogether, this technology has the potential to enable truly rapid, reconfigurable, modular, and equipment-free detection of diverse classes of proteins."

Yet, plasticity rules operating on one-shot episodic memory timescales rarely depend on both pre- and postsynaptic spiking, challenging Hebbian theory in this crucial regime. Here, we present an episodic memory model governed by a simpler rule depending only on presynaptic activity. We show that this rule, capitalizing on high-dimensional neural activity with restricted transitions, naturally stores episodes as paths through complex state spaces like those underlying a world model. The resulting memory traces, which we term path vectors, are highly expressive and decodable with an odor-tracking algorithm. We show that path vectors are robust alternatives to Hebbian traces, support one-shot sequential and associative recall, along with policy learning, and shed light on specific hippocampal plasticity rules. Thus, non-Hebbian plasticity is sufficient for flexible memory and learning and well-suited to encode episodes and policies as paths through a world model."

Mie resonators demonstrate fruitful electromagnetic multipole interference effects in scattering behavior. The research of these non-Hermitian singularities is typically conducted independently with the analysis of scattering interference. Here, we demonstrate fundamental relationships between non-Hermitian singularities and observe their manifestation in the scattering spectra. We reveal that exceptional points always exist in the anapole regime, and diabolic points are associated with superscattering. We confirm our theoretical findings in the microwave experiment by measuring the extinction spectra of subwavelength Mie-resonant ceramic rings. Our study underpins the generic behavior of non-Hermitian singularities in the scattering spectra of subwavelength Mie resonators, uncovering their special applications in non-Hermitian nonlinear optics and topological photonics."

Autoantibody binding leads to complement-dependent and complement-independent cytotoxicity, ultimately resulting in astrocyte death, demyelination, and neuronal loss. Aquaporin-4 assembles in astrocyte plasma membranes as symmetric tetramers or as arrays of tetramers. We report molecular structures of aquaporin-4 alone and bound to Fab fragments from patient-derived NMO autoantibodies using cryogenic electron microscopy. Each antibody binds to epitopes comprised of three extracellular loops of aquaporin-4 with contributions from multiple molecules in the assembly. The structures distinguish between antibodies that bind to the tetrameric form of aquaporin-4 and those targeting higher-order orthogonal arrays of tetramers that provide more diverse bridging epitopes."

Here, we identify various polariton states via electrical bias within a monolayer of n-type MoS2. The MoS2channel was squeezed within a distributed Bragg reflector microcavity which was combined with a transparent graphene gate-electrode and a hexagonal boron nitride insulator. We observe trion polaritons with distinct lower polariton branch (LPB) and upper polariton branch (UPB). This allows us to modulate the intensity and energy switchings via gate bias: At gate bias below threshold voltage, both polaritons are decoupled, and above threshold voltage, they are coupled to form LPB-UPB pair, and at high bias, complex polaritons (CPB) emerge due to polariton screening, a phenomenon consistent with Rabi splitting. Further, we observe a peculiar nonlinearity at intermediate power regime."

Herein, we report subnanopore-rich carbon spheres encapsulated with Sn single atoms (Sn/CS@SC) as a Li host to address these challenges. Owing to the high Li affinity of Sn single atoms, Sn/CS@SC can promote storage of quasi-metallic Li within the inner void space other than direct plating of metallic Li on the outer surface. Moreover, the subnanopores with a strong spatial confinement effect can prevent the penetration of ester electrolyte for reduced side reactions. As expected, the Sn/CS@SC host demonstrates a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.8% over 600 cycles.

Among them, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), known for their superior electrical properties, are ideal for ultrathin semiconductor applications. Their unique epitaxial characteristics enable seamless integration with 3D materials, facilitating the development of gate stacks and heterojunction devices.

ZnSe and MoSe2, sharing chalcogen elements, enable large-area quasi van der Waals epitaxy with sharp interfaces without intermediate phase.
