10.1088/1748-9326/adcf39,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注高山亚洲地区（HMA）的积雪覆盖变化，特别是雪线高度（SLA）的季节性和年代际变化。研究利用Sentinel-2和Landsat卫星数据，分析了1999-2019年间HMA地区冰川流域的雪线变化，并将其与气候变量联系起来。研究结果表明，该地区雪线变化的驱动因素主要是固态降水的时机和分配，而不是直接由温度或降水控制。虽然论文使用了卫星数据，但其重点在于积雪和水资源，而非大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测或大气成分分析。,"['snow cover', 'snowline altitude (SLA)', 'Sentinel-2', 'Landsat', 'precipitation phase', 'climate change', 'high mountain Asia (HMA)']",M Bernat;E S Miles;M Kneib;K Fujita;O Sasaki;T E Shaw;F Pellicciotti,Precipitation phase drives seasonal and decadal snowline changes in high mountain Asia,"Snow cover is of key importance for water resources in high mountain Asia (HMA) and is expected to undergo extensive changes in a warming climate. Past studies have quantified snow cover changes with satellite products of relatively low spatial resolution (∼500 m) which are hindered by the steep topography of this mountain region. We derive snowlines from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 5, 7 and 8 images, which, thanks to their higher spatial resolution, are less sensitive to the local topography. We calculate the snow line altitude (SLA) and its seasonality for all glacierized catchments of HMA and link these patterns to climate variables corrected for topographic biases. As such, the snowline changes provide a clear proxy for climatic changes. Our results highlight a strong spatial variability in mean SLA and in its seasonal changes, including across mountain chains and between the monsoon-dominated and the westerlies-dominated catchments. Over the period 1999–2019, the western regions of HMA (Pamir, Karakoram, Western Himalaya) have undergone increased snow coverage, expressed as seasonal SLA decrease, in spring and summer. This change is opposed to a widespread increase in SLA in autumn across the region, and especially the southeastern regions of HMA (Nyainqentanglha, Hengduan Shan, South–East Himalaya). Our results indicate that the diversity of seasonal snow dynamics across the region is controlled not by temperature or precipitation directly but by the timing and partitioning of solid precipitation. Decadal snowline changes (1999–2009 vs 2009–2019) seasonally precede temperature changes, suggesting that seasonal temperature changes in the Karakoram–Pamir and Eastern Nyainqentanglha regions may have responded to snow cover changes, rather than driving them."

Freddy’s long lifespan benefited from an anomalously strong Mascarene High, which steered Freddy westward along its northern flank, thereby preventing it encountering cold water areas. In addition to its long lifespan, we found Freddy experienced a record-breaking six rapid intensification (RI) events and analyzed the atmosphere-ocean conditions driving Freddy’s multiple RI events. The results indicated that during the six RI events, Freddy experienced high sea surface temperatures, weak vertical wind shear, high potential intensity, and high relative humidity, with all four environmental factors more favorable than historical averages. Notably, three of these RI events occurred within the Mozambique Channel, which also prolonged its coastal activity (21 d). This phase of TC Freddy generated extreme rainfall with maximum cumulative precipitation of 877 mm, compounded by secondary disasters, which caused substantial economic losses and fatalities in coastal areas. Additionally, it was found that the frequency of RI events and the number of intense TCs reaching Category 4 or above in the SIO showed statistically significant upward trends during 1980–2023, indicating a growing threat to Africa, which is likely to face more intense TCs in a warming climate. With rising sea levels and increasing threat from TCs, greater focus on coastal disaster prevention and mitigation strategies is needed to address the escalating risks associated with TCs in the SIO in the context of global warming."

The measurement and discussion of clean fuel affordability is almost always based on the unitary, or single decision-maker, household as the unit of analysis, although the more realistic household disaggregated into its individual decision-makers is a well-established literature. The limited work on intra-household dynamics in clean cooking cannot reveal who is buying the stove or fuel and at what true cost. Following an experiment testing the effect of microsavings to increase clean fuel consumption in Shirati, a rural town in Mara region, Tanzania, we conducted 90 interviews and numerous focus groups/budget games with a stratified random sample of mostly female main cooks. Drawing on over two years of fieldwork, we investigate the range of household needs, the role of gender in household finances, and how these combine to determine cooking fuel purchases. We find distinct and gendered financial domains where spouses do not disclose their expenses to one another and are responsible for different categories of needs. Cooking fuel is firmly in the female domain. Thus, liquefied petroleum gas affordability is constrained by these gendered financial domains, as women must choose between using savings for daily necessities or refilling the gas. Our extensive ethnographic evidence demonstrates the inappropriateness of the unitary model for cooking fuel affordability and the implications of ignoring separate-account household models. Our work requires new interpretations of saving for, and affordability of, clean fuels that the clean cooking literature has yet to confront. We offer recommendations for how the clean cooking literature could measure affordability and design policy for regions where cooking fuel is exclusively in the female financial domain."

Despite its small geographical area, it faces escalating environmental challenges, including air pollution, water pollution, soil degradation, and poor waste management, that compromise natural resources, biodiversity, and public health. This review compiles and analyzes scientific literature and official reports on Lebanese river pollution from 1994 to 2024. It presents the status of river water quality, identifies major pollution sources and types, including untreated sewage, industrial discharges, and agricultural runoff, and highlights the use of bioindicators, alongside governmental and non-governmental mitigation efforts. Findings indicate widespread contamination across most Lebanese rivers due to the presence of pathogens, potentially toxic elements, and organic pollutants. Water quality degradation has often impaired access to safe water for drinking, irrigation, and industrial use. Although research and monitoring efforts have increased over the past decade, the implementation of control measures remains insufficient. Key challenges include fragmented environmental governance, lack of long-term monitoring programs, and limited public awareness. Addressing these issues requires integrated water resource management, stricter enforcement of environmental regulations, promotion of sustainable agricultural and industrial practices, and expansion of research on emerging contaminants. The evidence presented in this paper highlights the urgent need for science-informed policies and coordinated multi-sectoral actions to mitigate water pollution, restore riverine ecosystems, and safeguard both environmental."

The short range covered by direct AMOC observations, inconsistent paleoclimate records, and scattered hydrographic data are insufficient to realistically reconstruct the AMOC strength since 1900. An AMOC proxy index based on sea surface temperatures suggests that the AMOC has declined by 15% since the late 19th century but this index received extensive scientific criticism. Here, we use a deep learning algorithm and climate model simulations to accurately reconstruct the AMOC strength between 20° N and 60° N since 1900. In contrast with the existing indices, our reconstructions are well in agreement with AMOC strength variations simulated by climate models and direct observations at 26.5° N. Our novel set of AMOC reconstructions contribute to a larger confidence in 21st century AMOC decline projections from climate models."

This study leverages the latest reanalysis data and single-forcing ensemble models to investigate the origins of Arctic aerosols and their contribution to regional warming over the period from 1980 to 2023. Our findings indicate that aerosols in the Arctic predominantly originate from mid-to-high latitude regions through radial transport. Overall, aerosols mitigate some of the warming effects induced by greenhouse gases, accounting for 19% of Arctic warming, with notable variations among different aerosol types. We demonstrate that aerosols influence cloud formation and alter surface net solar radiation, thereby significantly affecting heat flux and contributing to Arctic warming. Furthermore, we project future Arctic temperature responses to aerosols, offering a theoretical foundation for advancing research on global climate change."

Yet these scenarios have often projected near-term CCS deployments that far exceed what is currently planned, let alone operational. They have also failed to consider regional differences in capacity to deploy large-scale CO2 capture, transport, and subsurface injection. Here, we update a leading integrated energy-economy-land model by recalibrating maximum deployments to publicly announced CCS projects through to 2030. We also quantify a range of regionally explicit future scaling and maximum injection rates for the overall CCS value chain and evaluate their implications for emissions trajectories, energy mix, use of rate-limited storage capacity, and mitigation costs. Under limited CCS growth rates, deployment at mid-century and 2100 could be reduced by a factor of 7 relative to a scenario that does not consider injectivity or growth rate limits. However, sustained efforts to rapidly scale CCS could reduce transition costs by nearly $11 trillion (20%) globally, with cost reductions most heavily concentrated in regions such as China and India. Delayed mitigation combined with slower-than-expected CCS deployment could result in large and prolonged temperature overshoot. Conversely, there are lower peak and long-term temperatures with aggressive emissions cuts in anticipation of slow CCS scaling that subsequently far exceeds expectations."

Surface treatment of filter media using the PTFE membrane can improve its filtration performance. Badly, the reprocessing of used filter media has become a major challenge due to the ecological impact and potential human toxicity of PTFE. Herein, a novel PPS-based gradient filtration material (mPPS-25/NF-5) with high efficiency, low resistance, and controllability was prepared by combining numerical simulation, high-temperature melt-blown process, and lamination technology with PPS micronano-embedded fiber membranes (mPPS) as the surface layer structure. Benefiting from the three-dimensional porous network structure formed by the staggered arrangement of fibers in mPPS and the effective prediction and optimization of the structural performance of the designed filter media in advance, mPPS-25/NF-5 demonstrated superior filtration performance. Specifically, compared with commercial PTFE membrane lamination filter media, the average cleaning cycle of mPPS-25/NF-5 has been improved by 188.13 s, while the average residual resistance has been reduced by 41.84 Pa, which truly realizes a high efficiency, low resistance, and long service life. This work may offer fresh insight into new materials and their rapid and controllable production methods for flue gas purification under “ultralow emission” measures."

However, accurately measuring low-concentration colloids and differentiating between colloids of different particle sizes remains challenging. In this study, we encapsulated specific DNA fragments within colloids of sizes 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, and 5.0 μm to conduct column-scale experiments with either single-size or multi-size colloids. These experiments were designed to characterize the colloid breakthrough curves and quantify their SEE. This approach significantly enhanced detection signals, enabling accurate colloid detection at very low concentrations (≤10 mg L–1) and precise colloid size differentiation. Furthermore, the colloid breakthrough curves were fitted to quantify a key SEE parameter, i.e., the water saturation inaccessible to mobile colloids (γ). Regression analysis revealed a power function correlation between the γ parameter and the colloid diameter, indicating that the SEE intensifies with increasing colloid diameter. These findings highlight the potential of DNA labeling for high-resolution characterization of low-concentration and mixed-size colloidal particle transport in porous media.

Jin;Tian Chen;Jun Li;Gan Zhang;Jianmin Chen,Concurrent Formation of Low-Maturity EC and BrC in Biomass and Coal Burning: O-PAH as a Precursor,"Black carbon (BC) significantly influences climate change through light absorption. Traditional emission inventories equate BC with elemental carbon (EC) and overlook the variability in its properties across sources, leading to uncertainties in climate predictions. This study shows that EC from solid fuel combustion contains substantial low-maturity EC (char), whose emissions increase alongside the light absorption of soluble organic carbon (OC) as the fuel aromaticity rises. Concurrently, the abundance of oxygenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (O-PAHs) in soluble OC also increases. This suggests that char and brown carbon (BrC) share similar formation pathways with O-PAHs as key precursors. Time-resolved analysis during combustion cycles revealed a significant positive correlation between O-PAHs, the light absorption of soluble OC, and char emissions, further supporting this shared pathway. The nonbonding orbitals in BrC and char facilitate n → π* transitions in the visible region, which are more wavelength-dependent than the π → π* transition in high-maturity EC (soot). This study highlights char as a light-absorbing intermediate, influencing light absorption of EC emitted from solid fuel combustion. These insights into the formation pathways and optical properties of carbonaceous aerosols enhance our understanding of their climate impacts and underscore the need to differentiate between char and soot in climate models to improve accuracy."

Besides species traits, the gut microbiome may provide an untested additional predictive factor since it often plays a role in host defense against stressors. Therefore, we investigated the gut microbiome’s causal role in shaping differences in pesticide sensitivity between two congeneric damselfly species. After an antibiotic treatment, reciprocal gut microbiome transplants were performed between pesticide-sensitive Ischnura elegans and more tolerant Ischnura pumilio larvae, with donor larvae first preexposed to either chlorpyrifos or a solvent control to match the subsequent pesticide treatments of the recipients. The gut microbiome, determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, of both species included pesticide-degrading bacteria, but also showed shared and species-specific responses to the pesticide. Notably, the most pesticide-sensitive combination, with the highest pesticide-induced mortality, consisted of I. elegans larvae receiving I. elegans donor gut microbiota, whereas the least sensitive combination consisted of I. pumilio larvae receiving I. pumilio donor gut microbiota, whereby the pesticide did not increase larval mortality. The two mixed donor–recipient gut microbiome combinations resulted in an intermediate sensitivity. Remarkably, I. elegans recipient larvae experienced a lower chlorpyrifos-induced mortality when they received an I. pumilio donor gut microbiome than when they received their conspecific I. elegans donor gut microbiome. Our results provide, to our knowledge, the first proof-of-evidence that the gut microbiome causally contributes to species differences in pesticide sensitivity."

The results showed that Zostera marina L. detritus captured nonylphenol (NP) and bisphenol A (BPA) with high efficiency (>90%) and enhanced organic carbon sequestration in marine ecosystems. Under various seawater-sediment scenarios (pure seawater, nonburial, and burial systems), phenolic EDC rerelease rates were low (<20%), while total organic carbon (TOC) stocks increased by 21.5%–28.8% in EDC-treated groups compared to controls. Kinetic analyses revealed that NP and BPA were rapidly captured onto heterogeneous active sites of the detritus surface, with capture efficiency influenced by the physicochemical properties of contaminants, environmental factors, and the specific characteristics of the detritus. Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) and density functional theory (DFT) were employed to investigate synergistic mechanisms between phenolic EDCs and carbon at cellular and molecular levels. The lipids mediated NP sequestration through hydrophobic interactions with lipid-rich sites (such as phospholipids), while polysaccharides facilitated BPA binding via electrostatic interactions, highlighting their crucial roles in capturing phenolic EDCs.

Mechanism studies demonstrated that both radical (SO4• –) and non-radical (1O2)  contributed to the superior degradation performance. Additionally, vdW-CPNSs could be integrated into a flow-through wastewater treatment setup, achieving nearly 100% removal of environmentally realistic level antibiotic contaminants, which exhibited a great potential for practical wastewater purification.

This study provides new observational insights into the relationship between black carbon (BC) and magnetite at a remote site in East Asia, Japan, focusing on combustion sources, seasonal trends, and potential overestimation of BC by the light-absorbing magnetite. Magnetic measurements of PM2.5 samples, complemented by detailed chemical analyses, reveal similar temporal variations between BC and magnetite while demonstrating that the relative abundance of magnetite to BC varies by combustion source, driving seasonal trends. Magnetite abundance during combustion episodes was found to follow the order: coal > oil > biomass, with mass concentrations roughly estimated via magnetization to be 9–10%, 5–6%, and <2% of BC, respectively. Furthermore, magnetite was estimated to contribute up to 5% of the BC absorption coefficient, suggesting the considerable overestimation of BC depending on the source.

Their structural disorder can alter the central metal redox states, enhancing oxyanion adsorption. Previously, we demonstrated that the reduced redox state of titanium in amorphous titanium (hydr)oxide (a-TiHO) increased arsenate and arsenite adsorption. Here, we show that incorporating cerium into a-TiHO further enhances redox modulation, improving the simultaneous adsorption of multiple oxyanions (arsenate, vanadate, tungstate, chromate, and selenate) from water. Using sol–gel synthesis, we produced cerium–titanium (hydr)oxides with varying Ce(III)/Ce(IV) and Ti(III)/Ti(IV) ratios, including a highly crystalline material via annealing. The best adsorption occurred in a 98% amorphous material with a 10:1 reduced-to-oxidized ratio of the central metal, achieving capacities of 22 and 19 μmol of oxyanion per millimole of metal at pH 6.5 and 8.5, respectively. Increasing the cerium content consistently improved oxyanion mixture adsorption. Advanced characterization, such as pair distribution function (PDF), combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), revealed that higher (III)/(IV) central metal ratios correlate with increased oxygen vacancies, which enhance oxyanion adsorption.

Previous high-throughput phenotypic profiling (HTPP) studies using the Cell Painting assay in the RTgill-W1 rainbow trout cell line have demonstrated that 6PPD-quinone toxicity occurs at much lower concentrations than the 6PPD parent molecule, which is consistent with available in vivo toxicity data in rainbow trout. Current research efforts include identifying alternative antiozonant compounds to potentially replace 6PPD in tire manufacturing. To fill bioactivity data gaps for potential 6PPD alternatives, 18 compounds including other substituted p-phenylenediamines (PPD) and PPD-quinones were assayed using HTPP in RTgill-W1 cells. 7PPD-quinone and 77PD-quinone produced changes in cellular phenotype similar to those of 6PPD-quinone at comparable concentrations. IPPD-quinone produced changes in cellular phenotype at higher concentrations than 6PPD-quinone, with a phenotypic profile that was most similar to its parent molecule IPPD. These findings suggest that 7PPD-quinone and 77PD-quinone may exhibit similar effects in rainbow trout and potentially other 6PPD-quinone sensitive salmonids. In contrast, IPPD may be less toxic to salmonids than 6PPD, given the relative lack of bioactivity of IPPD-quinone compared to 6PPD-quinone."

Wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) offers a noninvasive and community-level approach to monitoring the circulation of pathogens, including the measles virus. Here, we retrospectively applied a duplex digital PCR assay to distinguish between wild-type and vaccine strains of the measles virus in wastewater samples available from an existing national WBS program. Samples originated from the wastewater treatment plant serving the Lausanne city catchment area, where an outbreak occurred before spreading to the broader Canton Vaud region. Despite high vaccination rates, viral loads of the measles wild type were detected during the first transmission event involving 21 cases identified within a week. However, viral loads were no longer detectable after the initial 21 cases, despite an additional 30 cases reported in the following 3 weeks, possibly due to lower incidence rate or location outside the catchment. Measles vaccine strain was not detected during the outbreak. Our results demonstrate the complementarity of WBS with clinical surveillance and suggest its potential as an early warning system for measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases. Further improvements in the assay sensitivity and integration with epidemiological data could enhance the utility of WBS for outbreak detection and control."

Using the Southern Ocean Freshwater Input from Antarctica (SOFIA) multi‐model ensemble, we study the atmospheric response to a 100‐year idealized freshwater release of 0.1 Sv. All models simulate a surface‐intensified tropospheric cooling and lower‐stratospheric warming south of 35°S. Tropospheric cooling is attributed to sea ice expansion and the associated albedo enhancement in winter and a colder sea surface in summer. This cooling yields a downward displacement of the tropopause, reduced stratospheric water vapor content and ultimately warming around 200 hPa. An enhanced southward eddy heat flux explains warming at 10–100 hPa during austral winter. Despite a temporally (and spatially) uniform prescribed freshwater flux, a prominent sea ice seasonal cycle and atmosphere dynamics result in a distinct seasonal pattern in the occurrence and magnitude of the temperature responses."

However, here we find that quite a few of subsurface MHWs in the western tropical Pacific Ocean show significant co‐occurrence with subsurface anticyclonic eddies using in situ observations from buoys and Argo floats.

The results reveal a relationship between the spectral energy density of KAWs and PAD of relativistic electrons, with butterfly PAD features becoming more pronounced and showing larger dip‐sizes as the spectral energy density of KAWs increases, particularly for electrons in 0.5–3.4 MeV energy range. At these times the magnetopause sub‐solar stand‐off distance renders magnetopause shadowing an unlikely formation mechanism.

Here, we use a realistically forced global configuration of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model to investigate an enhanced superharmonic signal in the equatorial Pacific Ocean.

However, the relative importance of synoptic atmospheric processes in the development of these events remains unclear, as previous studies have predominantly focused on quasi‐stationary systems. Here, we demonstrate that a severe marine heatwave (MHW) over the Southwest Pacific unfolded through two distinct warming stages followed by a cooling phase, all dominated by recurrent synoptic Rossby wave packets propagating through the upper troposphere. During each warming phase, these wave packets organized near‐surface circulation anomalies that inhibited wind‐driven mixing, causing unusually shallow mixed‐layer depths. The resultant shoaling amplified surface warming by intensifying the effects of increased solar radiation, ultimately triggering the extreme MHW. Conversely, during the intermediate cooling phase, the mixed layer returned to its climatological state, allowing the heatwave conditions to dissipate. Strong quasi‐stationary patterns emerged only near the ends of both intensification and decay, downstream of the recurring wave events. These blocking patterns appear to have helped terminate the recurrence by causing potential instability to build up to a point of more widespread release. A diagnostic analysis of the lower tropospheric vorticity budget highlights the central role of dynamical vorticity production tied to the anomalous atmospheric circulation forced by upper‐level waves."

 Chiral superconductors are unconventional superconducting states that break time reversal symmetry spontaneously and typically feature Cooper pairing at non-zero angular momentum. Such states may host Majorana fermions and provide an important platform for topological physics research and fault-tolerant quantum computing1–7. Despite intensive search and prolonged studies of several candidate systems8–26, chiral superconductivity has remained elusive so far. Here we report the discovery of robust unconventional superconductivity in rhombohedral tetra- and penta-layer graphene without moiré superlattice effects. We observed two superconducting states in the gate-induced flat conduction bands with Tc up to 300 mK and charge density ne down to 2.4*1011 cm-2 in five devices. Spontaneous time-reversal-symmetry-breaking due to electron’s orbital motion is found, and several observations indicate the chiral nature of these superconducting states, including: 1. In the superconducting state, Rxx shows magnetic hysteresis in varying out-of-plane magnetic field B⊥—absent from all other superconductors; 2. the superconducting states are robust against in-plane magnetic field and are developed within a spin- and valley-polarized quarter-metal phase; 3. the normal states show anomalous Hall signals at zero magnetic field and magnetic hysteresis. We also observed a critical B⊥ of 1.4 Tesla, higher than any graphene superconductivity and indicates a strong-coupling superconductivity close to the BCS-BEC crossover27.

 Around 40% of the US population and 1 in 6 individuals worldwide have obesity, with the incidence surging globally1,2. Various dietary interventions, including carbohydrate, fat and, more recently, amino acid restriction, have been explored to combat this epidemic3–6. Here we investigated the impact of removing individual amino acids on the weight profiles of mice. We show that conditional cysteine restriction resulted in the most substantial weight loss when compared to essential amino acid restriction, amounting to 30% within 1 week, which was readily reversed. We found that cysteine deficiency activated the integrated stress response and oxidative stress response, which amplify each other, leading to the induction of GDF15 and FGF21, partly explaining the phenotype7–9. Notably, we observed lower levels of tissue coenzyme A (CoA), which has been considered to be extremely stable10, resulting in reduced mitochondrial functionality and metabolic rewiring. This results in energetically inefficient anaerobic glycolysis and defective tricarboxylic acid cycle, with sustained urinary excretion of pyruvate, orotate, citrate, α-ketoglutarate, nitrogen-rich compounds and amino acids. In summary, our investigation reveals that cysteine restriction, by depleting GSH and CoA, exerts a maximal impact on weight loss, metabolism and stress signalling compared with other amino acid restrictions. These findings suggest strategies for addressing a range of metabolic diseases and the growing obesity crisis. Conditional cysteine restriction in mice causes substantial weight loss, exceeding that seen with essential amino acid restriction, by activating the integrated stress and oxidative stress responses, and by unexpectedly depleting coenzyme A, leading to metabolic inefficiency."

 Globally, 2023 was the hottest year on record and saw the development of a strong El Niño with widespread impacts. This El Niño event was unusual for its strong oceanic warming yet muted Southern Oscillation and wind anomalies over the tropical Pacific. This discrepancy is perplexing given the historically close coupling of El Niño and the Southern Oscillation. Atmospheric model experiments show that warming in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans in 2023 and the slow background sea surface temperature trend reduced the surface wind response over the tropical Pacific by modulating the Walker circulation. We develop a hindcast system that reproduces 87% of the June–December El Niño warming even without wind stress feedback after April 2023. The intense oceanic warming was primarily driven by the strong build-up of western Pacific heat content during the preceding prolonged La Niña. This indicates that the 2023–2024 El Niño primarily arose from oceanic processes, independent of the classic positive Bjerknes feedback mechanism. Due to the strong ocean memory, this event was highly predictable at long time leads. Climate model simulations suggest that such 2023-like El Niños may become more frequent in a warming climate.

 Phase transformations are widely invoked as a source of rheological weakening during subduction, continental collision, mantle convection and various other geodynamic phenomena. However, despite more than half a century of research, the likelihood and magnitude of such weakening in nature remain poorly constrained. Here we use experiments performed on a synchrotron beamline to reveal transient weakening of up to three orders of magnitude during the polymorphic quartz to coesite (SiO2) and olivine to ringwoodite (Fe2SiO4) phase transitions. Weakening becomes increasingly prominent as the transformation outpaces deformation. We suggest that this behaviour is broadly applicable among silicate minerals undergoing first-order phase transitions and examine the likelihood of weakening due to the olivine-spinel, (Mg,Fe)2SiO4, transformation during subduction. Modelling suggests that cold, wet slabs are most susceptible to transformational weakening, consistent with geophysical observations of slab stagnation in the mantle transition zone beneath the western Pacific. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating transformational weakening into geodynamic simulations and provides a quantitative basis for doing so.

 Mangroves are a carbon-dense and highly productive ecosystem but can experience massive dieback under environmental extremes. Climatic oscillations, such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), are major drivers of global climate variability, yet their impact on mangrove growth at the global scale remains uncertain. Here, using long-term satellite observations from 2001 to 2020, we show that more than 50% of global mangrove areas experience significant variations during ENSO events, exhibiting a seesaw-like pattern across the Pacific Basin where mangrove leaf area decreases in the western Pacific but increases in the eastern Pacific during El Niño, with the reverse occurring during La Niña. The Indian Ocean Dipole affects mangroves across the Indian Ocean similarly but with a lower magnitude relative to ENSO. These patterns are driven by corresponding sea-level fluctuations across the Pacific and Indian ocean basins, with local contributions from lunar nodal cycles. Our study highlights the crucial role of short-term sea-level fluctuations driven by climatic oscillations in dominating the variability of coastal wetland growth and, consequently, in influencing the blue carbon sink.

Here, the authors use sophisticated biochemical reconstitutions to address how kinetochores, the microtubule-binding structures of chromosomes, regulate this checkpoint. 
 The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) ensures mitotic exit occurs only after sister chromatid biorientation, but how this coordination is mechanistically achieved remains unclear. Kinetochores, the megadalton complexes linking chromosomes to spindle microtubules, contribute to SAC signaling. However, whether they act solely as docking platforms or actively promote the co-orientation of SAC catalysts such as MAD1:MAD2 and BUB1:BUB3 remains unresolved. Here, we reconstitute kinetochores and SAC signaling in vitro to address this question. We engineer recombinant kinetochore particles that recruit core SAC components and trigger checkpoint signaling upon Rapamycin induction, and test their function using a panel of targeted mutants. At approximately physiological concentrations of SAC proteins, kinetochores are essential for efficient mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) assembly, the key effector of SAC signaling. Our results suggest that kinetochores serve not only as structural hubs but also as catalytic platforms that concentrate and spatially organize SAC components to accelerate MCC formation and ensure timely checkpoint activation.

Hippocampal circuits balance possible goals based on how much behavioral change is needed while prefrontal circuits represent changing plans. 
 Navigating a dynamic world requires rapidly updating choices by integrating past experiences with new information. In hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, neural activity representing future goals is theorized to support navigational planning. However, it remains unknown how prospective goal representations incorporate new, pivotal information. Accordingly, we designed a navigation task that precisely introduces new information using virtual reality, and we recorded neural activity as male mice flexibly adapted their planned destinations. Here we show that new information triggered increased hippocampal prospective representations of both possible goals; while in prefrontal cortex, new information caused prospective representations of choices to rapidly shift to the new choice. When mice did not adapt, prefrontal choice codes failed to switch. Prospective codes were dependent on the amount of behavioral adaptation needed; the new goal arm was represented more strongly when animals needed to change their behavior more. Thus, we show how prospective codes update with new information to flexibly adapt ongoing navigational plans. Neural mechanisms underlying flexible navigation are not fully understood.

 Posttranscriptional and posttranslational modifications play crucial roles in plant immunity. However, how plants fine-tune such modifications to activate antiviral immunity remains unknown. Here, we report that the m6A methyltransferase TaHAKAI is utilized by wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV) to increase viral genomic m6A modification and promote viral replication. However, TaHAKAI also functions as an E3 ligase that targets the viral RNA silencing suppressor P2 for degradation and inhibits viral infection. A major allele of TaHAKAI in a susceptible cultivar exhibited reduced E3 ligase activity but not m6A methyltransferase activity, promoting viral infection. Interestingly, TaHAKAIR attenuates the stability of TaWPS1 (Wheat paired spikelets 1, WPS1) mRNA, the negative regulator of spike development, which might increase panicle length and spikelet number by modulating its m6A modification.

Here, the authors present a method to provide real-time 3D temperature monitoring with minimal invasiveness, by matching a patient-specific library of simulations to a set of scarce and noisy measurements. 
 Oncological microwave hyperthermia is a clinically proven sensitizer of radio- and chemo-therapies; it acts by selectively increasing the temperature of tumor cells by means of antenna applicators. Its current limitations mostly come from the inability to reliably predict, and hence control, temperature inside the patient during treatment, especially for deep-seated tumors. Simulations are employed in treatment planning, but due to related uncertainties invasive thermometry is necessary, usually via catheters. Being invasive, their use must be minimized and provides very limited spatial information. Here, we demonstrate an approach to obtain 3D temperature information in real time from few measurement points via massive use of high-performance simulations carried out prior to treatment. The proposed technique is tested both in a fully anthropomorphic in-silico scenario, and in an experimental controlled setting. The obtained results demonstrate the potential of the proposed method as a low-cost real-time temperature monitoring technique in cancer hyperthermia. Use with intra-luminal, minimally-invasive catheters is supported by the positive outcome experimentally obtained using data points directly acquired in the trachea-mimicking phantom structure.

 Halide perovskite gas sensors have a low gas detection limit at room temperature, surpassing the performance of traditional metal oxide chemiresistors. However, they are prone to structural decomposition and performance loss due to the lack of coordination unsaturated surface metal ions and sensitivity to environmental factors such as water, oxygen, heat, and light. To address this issue, we present a general strategy: replacing the cation Cs+ in inorganic perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 with long-chain alkylamines. This modification synthesizes perovskite sensor materials that effectively block moisture and exhibit excellent stability under real-working conditions. The chemiresistors show high sensitivity and stability to CO gas, with (BA)4AgBiBr8 detecting CO at a limit of 20 ppb, maintaining performance after 270 days of continuous exposure to ambient air. The exceptional performance of (BA)4AgBiBr8 is elucidated through density functional theory calculations combined with sum frequency generation spectroscopy, marking a significant breakthrough in halide perovskite-based gas sensing by surpassing the stability and sensitivity of traditional sensors.

Preferential phosphate removal by ferric oxides and microbial competition may have promoted its biological usage. 
 Phosphorus availability has influenced the co-evolution of life and Earth’s environments. While phosphate was likely the main phosphorus source for life during the Archean, phosphite (HPO32−) gained importance leading up to the Great Oxidation Event (GOE). However, the concentration of phosphite in seawater at that time, and the processes driving this shift in P utilization, remain poorly constrained. Using lab experiments and phosphite data from banded iron formations (BIFs), we show that hydrous ferric oxides (HFO) preferentially remove phosphate over phosphite. This suggests that shallow seawater at the onset of the GOE could have contained up to 0.17 µM phosphite, comprising 5–88% of total dissolved inorganic phosphorus. We propose that phosphate depletion driven by HFO adsorption and microbial competition may have promoted the use of phosphite as an alternative P source.

 While Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy may result in durable remissions in recurrent large B cell lymphoma, persistence is limited and the mechanisms underlying long-term response are not fully elucidated. Using longitudinal single-cell immunoprofiling, here we compare the immune landscape in durable remission versus early relapse patients following CD19 CAR T cell infusion in the NCT02348216 (ZUMA-1) trial. Four weeks post-infusion, both cohorts demonstrate low circulating CAR T cells. We observe that long-term remission is associated with elevated native cytotoxic and proinflammatory effector cells, and post-infusion clonotypic expansion of effector memory T cells. Conversely, early relapse is associated with impaired NK cell cytotoxicity and elevated immunoregulatory cells, potentially dampening native T cell activation. Thus, we suggest that durable remission to CAR T is associated with a distinct T cell signature and pattern of clonotypic expansion within the native T cell compartment post-therapy, consistent with their contribution to the maintenance of response. The contribution of native T cells to the durability of post-CAR T cell responses is incompletely understood.

 One of the most challenging problems in paleoclimate research is how orbital cyclicities forced Earth’s climate variations during the late Quaternary. To address this issue, we investigated the differences in silicate weathering, a sensitive climate indicator, at different latitudes on orbital timescales by examining geochemical and clay mineral data from the mid-latitude Sea of Okhotsk and integrating published weathering records from low to high latitudes. Results show that silicate weathering in the mid-latitude Sea of Okhotsk responded sensitively to both temperature and rainfall, indicating the combined influence of ice sheets and low-latitude monsoons. However, silicate weathering is more sensitive to temperature in high-latitude regions, and to rainfall in tropical areas.

 East Asia (EA) has experienced a decreasing trend in the summer-to-winter temperature difference (temperature seasonality) in the context of ongoing global warming. However, the impacts of natural external forcing remain unclear. The last deglaciation, marked by substantial global warming, provides a paleoclimate context for understanding the roles of natural forcing in EA temperature seasonality changes. Here, using transient simulations (iTraCE), we demonstrate that EA experienced greater winter warming compared to summer during the last deglaciation, supported by paleo-climatic reconstructions. Sensitivity experiments indicate that the inundation of continental shelf area due to rising sea-level played a critical role in driving these differential warming trends. Further quantifications highlight the contributions of greater heat capacity instead of reduced surface albedo of the expanded ocean area. Resulting atmospheric responses expanded the seasonality change to EA landmass by cloud‒radiation feedback and temperature advection processes. These findings provide insight into the potential climatic impacts of sea-level rise under ongoing global warming."

 The Asian tropopause aerosol layer (ATAL) causes significant regional radiative forcing which may influence the tropospheric weather and climate. Our analysis reveals that the intensified ATAL weakens the South Asian High (SAH) and the South Asian Monsoon. The ATAL leads to increases in diabatic heating in the upper troposphere in the SAH region, induces an anomalous upward flow which decreases the adiabatic heating and causes cooling anomalies in the upper troposphere in the SAH region, and ultimately weakens the SAH (diabatic heating mechanism). However, responses of the SAH to the ATAL are nonlinear. Model results indicate that when the ATAL intensity is doubled, a temperature inversion occurs in the upper troposphere which tends to stabilize the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) and prevent the upward moisture transport (static stability mechanism). The reduced latent heat release induces middle and upper tropospheric cooling in the SAH region, thereby weakens the SAH."

 Atmospheric CO2-based top-down approaches enable objective evaluation of climate mitigation efforts but face dual constraints: sparse monitoring limits spatial resolution, while emission heterogeneity hampers downscaling. To enhance downscaling accuracy, we present a hybrid training method integrating multi-resolution inverse fluxes—national-scale coarse grids with fine-scale grids (Shanxi/Jiangsu). Experiments show hybrid training outperforms conventional approaches, increasing R² from 0.56 to 0.61 with 2.7%-area fine grids and reducing prediction biases compared to data fusion without high-resolution inputs while vastly exceeding nearest-neighbor interpolation (R² = 0.39). By combining gap-filled CO/NO2 columns, nighttime lights, population density, vegetation indices, and meteorological data, we downscaled national 45 km eight-day CO2 fluxes to daily 10 km resolution. The derived dataset reveals emission inequities: top 20% cities contribute more than 50% of national emissions, exposing regional capacity disparities.

 The D” seismic discontinuity is one of the most prominent and enigmatic seismic anomalies in Earth’s lower mantle, and its origin remains unclear. Since the discovery of the post-perovskite phase, seismic anisotropy observed in the D” layer has been attributed to the texturing of this phase. However, no substantial seismic velocity jump has been observed across the isotropic post-perovskite phase transition boundary, revealing a critical gap in experimental data linking the discontinuity to phase texture.

Here we report isotopic measurements of seep carbonates (calcium, molybdenum, strontium, neodymium) generated by gas hydrate dissociation, sampled from a core drilled at the South China Sea. Our results show that there is approximately −1.2‰ calcium isotopic fractionation between aragonite and seawater.

Here we analyse sedimentary architecture and sequence chronology, suggesting ancient seismicity led to channel deformation in the valley floor, forming a natural dam and the resultant palaeolake. Drainage of the lake at 4.5 ka, linked to climate fluctuations, triggering human migration from the surrounding mountains to the lower reaches of the Hei River.

 The ocean has absorbed 25% of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions over the past 40 years, effectively slowing atmospheric carbon dioxide growth but causing ocean acidification. As acidification intensifies, the seawater absorption capacity for carbon dioxide will decline. While the Revelle factor has been used to assess carbon dioxide absorption, it becomes inapplicable at pH < 7.5. Here, we propose a new factor, γCO2, to better measure the absorption capacity for carbon dioxide and acidification. γCO2 decreases with increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide and decreased pH, indicating reduced absorption capacity and intensified acidification.

Projections under SSP5-8.5 anticipate an average γCO2 of 4.72 by 2100, with 61.5% of global ocean regions below the critical threshold of γCO2 = 3.0, potentially harming aragonite-based organisms.

 Satellite land surface temperature (Ts) provides valuable information on vegetation drought stress via its physical linkage to plant stomatal activity and transpiration. New-generation geostationary satellites offer opportunities to monitor sub-diurnal variations in Ts and thus track plant physiological stress response occurring at sub-daily timescales. Nevertheless, the potential of satellite Ts and its derived metrics for early detection of vegetation drought stress before visible canopy changes occur has not been widely assessed. Here, we developed a parsimonious Surface-Air Temperature Difference Anomaly (SATDA) method for tracking vegetation drought stress using the cumulative sub-diurnal difference from late-morning to early-afternoon between Ts from the Himawari-8 geostationary satellite and hourly air temperature (Ta) from meteorological grids. SATDA utilised Ts−Ta as the physical driving gradient for sensible heat flux (H) to capture anomalous sensible heating due to reduced plant transpiration. We used SATDA to monitor the spatio-temporal patterns of the 2017–2019 Tinderbox Drought in southeast Australia. We benchmarked the skill of SATDA in forecasting visible drought-induced vegetation greenness decline against both conventional water availability-based indices (i.e., precipitation and soil moisture anomalies) and existing satellite Ts indices (i.e., Temperature Condition Index and Temperature Rise Index) across diverse climates and land covers. SATDA effectively captured a rapidly intensifying flash drought event at multi-week timescales (Jul to Sep 2019) embedded within the multi-year Tinderbox Drought, which contributed to detrimental impacts on agricultural production and increased wildfire risk. SATDA showed the best vegetation greenness forecast skill in the transitional semi-arid and sub-humid climates, with forecast correlation >0.5 at 32-day lead time. The advantage over water availability-based indices was more evident in woody-dominated ecosystems than herbaceous-dominated ecosystems, likely due to the importance of physiological regulations by trees during droughts such as deeper roots and stronger stomatal control. SATDA, based on Ts−Ta, showed overall better vegetation greenness forecasts than two Ts-only indices, especially in woody vegetation. Finally, SATDA showed consistently greater advantage over water availability-based and Ts-only indices in forecasting visible vegetation decline as the drought intensity increased. The parsimonious process-based SATDA method suits global-scale operational implementation to complement vegetation drought monitoring and early warning systems."

 The integration of machine learning (ML) algorithms with remote sensing (RS) data offers significant potential for enhancing dynamic forest characterization and change detection through high temporal density mapping. This study evaluates the effectiveness of RS-ML models for forest mapping in parts of southern Nigeria, with particular emphasis on assessing their temporal scalability using multi-sensor data from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 platforms. Three strategies were evaluated: the first involved training RS-ML model on spectral vegetation indices generated based on datasets from single date and applying it to datasets captured in different dates; the second entailed training distinct models for each datasets captured in certain time period and the third one utilized datasets from various dates (multi-temporal) to land cover mapping. Accuracy assessments of the land cover maps generated by all strategies were conducted to determine the loss of accuracy when a RS-ML model is trained and applied to another temporal dataset. The highest F1-scores for the forest class were obtained from ML-RS models trained and applied on the datasets captured in the same time period. For instance, when trained independently on datasets from January and December 2022, the model achieved F1-scores of 93.09% and 91.56% for the forest class, respectively. Conversely, a ML-RS- model trained based on both multi-temporal datasets − January and December 2022 jointly − registered a lower F1-score of 74.29% for the forest class. A similar decrease in accuracy was observed with a another multi-temporal (multi-season) model trained jointly on data from December 2022 and December 2023, resulting in an F1-score of 71.58%. This indicates a significant drop in accuracy when multi-temporal features are used for forest mapping. Thus, for further analysis of forest change mapping, the most accurate forest maps were utilized generated by using models with the highest F1-scores. Although the ML-RS models are highly accurate for specific dates, their temporal scalability poses a challenge propably due to the specific tropical conditions. Therefore, for land cover mapping it is crucial to select models that align with the specific temporal and environmental conditions and provide high accuracy. To address this challenge, the study recommends prioritizing adaptive modeling strategies. These strategies involve continuously updating and retraining ML-RS models to ensure they remain accurate over different periods, thereby improving the reliability of forest mapping over time. This approach emphasizes the importance of model selection based on the intended application period and environmental variability, to ensure the generation of accurate and reliable forest maps."

 Coal fires present significant global environmental and energy challenges, posing substantial barriers to achieving carbon-neutral goals. Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing (TIRS) technology, which is used to retrieve land surface temperatures, plays a crucial role in detecting coal fires. However, its accuracy suffers from solar radiation interference. In addition, there is limited research focused specifically on detecting coal fires over large areas. In this paper, thermal anomaly indices (TAIs), derived from short-wave infrared and near-infrared data, were selected for coal fire detection due to their relatively low sensitivity to solar radiation. Using these TAIs alongside other remote sensing (RS) indices, a coal fire detection model (CFDM) was developed and trained using the AutoGluon machine learning (ML) framework. The model is capable of identifying large-scale coal fire target areas without relying on deformation associated with coal fires. CFDM outperformed other ML algorithms, achieving Recall, Precision, F1-score, and Kappa coefficient values of 0.89, 0.94, 0.93, and 0.92, respectively.

 Accurately monitoring impervious surface (IS) changes is vital for assessing the effects of urbanization on human activities and its broader environmental, economic, and social sustainability. However, optical building shadows pose significant challenges for IS extraction in high-density urban core areas. Even though combining optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery makes it easier to identify impervious surfaces, buildings block SAR signals, causing them to mix with optical shadows. Ascending (AS) and descending (DE) SAR imagery offer potential solutions due to their AS/DE characteristics. This study proposes an IS extraction method utilizing hierarchical samples, optical and AS/DE SAR imagery (HS-OAD). Firstly, the AS/DE SAR-based shadowed index (ADSI) is proposed by analyzing the characteristics of building shadowed areas. Then, the OTSU method is adopted to threshold imagery into non-shadowed areas, optically shadowed areas, and SAR shadowed areas. Within each area type, samples representing four urban land covers—IS, vegetation, bare soil, and water bodies—are comprehensively labeled. Subsequently, a random forest classifier is employed to extract IS integrating optical, AS SAR, and DE SAR imagery. The results indicated that the integration of AS and DE SAR imagery significantly reduces the misclassification of IS and water bodies within optically shadowed areas. Furthermore, the hierarchical samples enhance the classification accuracy and reduce the misclassification between IS and vegetation in optically shadowed areas. Moreover, samples labeled in SAR-shadowed areas contribute to the reduction of misclassification between IS and bare soil. Our proposed method performed well in high-density urban core areas with extensive shadows, achieving an overall accuracy of 89.61% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.79."

 Anthropogenic pressure on urban air quality is a concerning issue, and the transport sector plays a crucial role contributing with exhaust and non-exhaust emissions, such as Tyre and Road Wear Particles (TRWPs). TRWPs can accumulate on roadsides, be carried by stormwaters, and enter the atmosphere, together with their additives. Benzothiazoles (BTHs) are a family of compounds mostly employed as rubber additives in tire production, but they are also exploited in other applications. In urban environments, airborne BTHs are strongly linked to TRWPs, and they are potentially exploitable as traffic markers. Considering the limited information on airborne BTHs, and the unexplored potentiality as markers, a deepening on their occurrences, sources, and possible degradation phenomena was needed. PM10 aerosol samples were collected from thirteen cities in Northern Italy. BTH-SO3H was the most concentrated (up to 7 ng m−3), followed by BTH-MeS, BTH and BTH-OH. Cities close to airports showed a higher presence of BTHs, possibly indicating a new source for these compounds. BTH-SCNMeS, known to be easily degradable, was found in relative high concentrations (0.2 ± 0.1 ng m−3) only in Montebello Vicentino station, which is close to an industrial area with several leather manufacturing industry. In Aosta, at 580 m a.s.l., BTH-SH and BTH-NH2 were found higher than other stations, possibly indicating an additional apport from antifreeze liquids and stainless-steel industry. Accumulation and degradation phenomena, occurring on road and roadsides, might partially explain the higher concentrations of BTHs by-products."

 This study investigates the trend and health risk associated with carcinogenic particulate nitrosamines in the atmosphere of Seoul, South Korea from 2013 to 2019. The average concentration of five particulate nitrosamines (NDEA, NDBA, NPIP, NPYR, and NMEA) during this period was 3.94 ± 8.38 ng/m3, while seven particulate nitrosamines (including NDMA and NMOR) averaged 8.96 ± 16.94 ng/m3. Mann-Kendall analysis revealed that while overall nitrosamine levels showed no notable trend, decreasing trends were observed for NDMA (τ = −0.12, p < 0.05) and NDEA (τ = −0.45, p < 0.001), while NDBA showed an increasing trend (τ = 0.20, p < 0.001). Analysis of correlations of the observed nitrosamines with primary emission indicators (PAHs and CO) and atmospheric reactants (NO, NO2, and O3) suggests contributions from both primary emissions and secondary formation processes. Nitrosation appears to be the major reaction pathway, particularly in cold seasons, as evidenced by strong correlations with NO2 and liquid water content, while ozonation could affect the particulate nitrosamines formation in warm season. A health risk assessment was conducted using Monte Carlo simulations based on the Korean exposure factors database. The median cumulative lifetime cancer risk from particulate nitrosamines in Seoul was estimated at 10−7 to 10−5, which falls within the generally acceptable risk range (10−6 to 10−4). The highest risks were observed in winter 2018 (ranging from 7.16·10−7 to 6.10·10−6), with the age group 3–19 showing the highest risk levels. The risk levels in Seoul were comparable to those observed in other urban areas such as Chuncheon, Korea and North Kensington, UK (∼10−6). The increasing trend in nitrosamine concentrations, despite being within acceptable risk ranges, highlights the need for continued monitoring and potential mitigation strategies, particularly during winter months when risk levels are elevated."

 In this study, we investigated the temporal variation of outdoor radon (222Rn) and its decay products (218Po, 214Pb, 214Bi, 210Pb), focusing on their relationship with boundary layer height (BLH), meteorological factors and particulate matters (PM2.5 and PM10) measured in Bratislava, Slovakia. The activity concentrations of radon and its short−lived progeny show a pronounced diurnal pattern, with highest levels in the early morning (03:00–05:00) and lowest in the afternoon (14:00–16:00), with a distinct seasonality. Seasonal variations of radon and its decay products show elevated concentrations during late autumn and winter and lowest concentrations during spring and summer. The diurnal and seasonal variations of radon and its progeny were observed to be primarily governed by BLH. The mean ± std. deviation of the radon equilibrium factor was found to be 0.44 ± 0.26, with relatively clear diurnal and seasonal patterns influenced mainly by atmospheric pressure and BLH. The ratios of radon decay products (218Po/222Rn, 214Pb/218Po, and 214Bi/214Pb) show distinct diurnal and seasonal variability, highlighting periods of disequilibrium between them. In particular, the 214Bi/214Pb ratio showed a strong positive correlation with BLH, suggesting its potential use as an indicator of atmospheric mixing and stability. Canonical correlation analysis revealed a positive association between radon and its progeny with PM concentration. This highlights their similar atmospheric behaviour and the effect of pollution events in increasing the radon and its decay products levels. In addition, the mean aerosols residence times derived from the ratios of 210Pb/214Pb, 210Pb/214Bi and 210Pb/222Rn ranged from 0.35 to 6.73 d, which agrees with previous studies."

 The Mentawai Islands, located in the eastern Indian Ocean approximately 150 km west of Sumatera, experience precipitation patterns heavily influenced by the eastward propagation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). This study investigates the impact of the MJO on local precipitation patterns, with a specific focus on diurnal cycles, during the rainy season (November–March, NDJFM). The analysis is based on Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) data spanning from 2000 to 2022. It emphasizes diurnal patterns through the lens of precipitation amount (PA), precipitation frequency (PF), and precipitation intensity (PI). The size of the islands strongly shapes the diurnal precipitation patterns during the rainy season. On Siberut, the largest island, two pronounce precipitation peaks are observed: one in the afternoon (15 LST) and another in the early morning (04 LST). Two precipitation peaks were also observed in South Pagai, with an earlier early morning peak (02 LST) and an early afternoon peak (13 LST), exhibiting weaker afternoon peak values compared to those in Siberut. The early afternoon precipitation peak on larger islands suggests a dominant role of local convection in the diurnal precipitation system of the Mentawai Islands. In contrast, the smaller islands—Sipora and North Pagai—exhibit a single precipitation peak at 02 LST, dominated primarily by offshore precipitation propagation from Sumatera. The presence of the Mentawai Islands has been observed to disrupt the offshore propagation of convective systems during nighttime, as indicated by the disruption of PI propagation. However, this disruption becomes negligible when nighttime low-level winds from Sumatera strengthen during MJO phases 2–3. During these enhanced phases, the intensified offshore propagation from Sumatera significantly impacts both the peak values and timings of early morning precipitation in the Mentawai Islands. The enhancement of offshore precipitation propagation during phases 2–3 shifts the peak timing of early morning precipitation in the Mentawai mainland forward by 2 h. This shift in peak timing is particularly pronounced on the smaller islands, where stronger low-level winds associated with the MJO enhance precipitation propagation toward the Mentawai Islands. Understanding the MJO's influence on precipitation patterns in this region is critical for improving weather prediction models and enhancing preparedness for extreme weather events."

 This study investigates the impact of aerosol component data assimilation on air quality forecasting using the WRF-Chem model coupled with a 3DVAR framework and Observation System Simulation Experiments(OSSE). Four observation network configurations(27 km, 100 km, 270 km, and full-density 2016 stations) were tested to evaluate how spatial resolution and station density influence the simulation of six aerosol components(SO₄2−, NH₄+, NO₃−, BC, OC, OIN). Results demonstrate that assimilating aerosol speciation data significantly outperforms total PM₂.₅/PM₁₀ assimilation, reducing initial field RMSE by 38.2 % and enhancing 48-h forecast correlation(CORR) by 0.15–0.18. The DA_270km experiment, with only 119 stations, achieved accuracy comparable to the full-density DA experiment, highlighting the critical role of spatial representativeness over station count. High-resolution networks(e.g., DA_27km) exhibited suboptimal performance, particularly for carbonaceous aerosols(BC, OC), where RMSE increased by 25–30 % due to “super-resolution assimilation” effects and amplified subgrid parameterization errors. Mechanistically, traditional 3DVAR frameworks showed limitations in handling ultra-dense networks, including redundancy in observational data and scale mismatches between model grids and observation density. Chemically inert components like OIN showed minimal assimilation impacts(<5 % variance), emphasizing the need for refined emission inventories. These findings advocate for optimized observation networks(50–100 km resolution) balancing spatial coverage, model resolution, and cost-effectiveness, prioritizing aerosol speciation data to advance air quality forecasting and emission control strategies."

These effects impair TICs’ oxidative metabolism and generate reactive oxygen species, further amplifying cellular stress. LSD1i also impairs TICs’ glycolytic activity, causing their metabolic decline. TICs with enhanced glycolysis benefit from LSD1-directed therapy. Conversely, metabolically silent TICs mantain ER and mitochondrial homeostasis, adapting to stress conditions, including LSD1i treatment. A dropout short hairpin RNA screening identifies postglycosylphosphatidylinositol attachment to proteins inositol deacylase 1 (PGAP1) as a mediator of resistance to LSD1i. Disruptions in ER and mitochondrial balance holds promise for improving LSD1-targeted therapy efficacy and overcoming treatment resistance."

However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, using a mouse model of chronic restraint stress (CRS), we observed a notable increase in the activity, rather than its overall expression level, of hippocampal Rap1, a small guanosine triphosphatase belonging to the Ras superfamily. Pharmacological inhibition of Rap1 activity in the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) effectively mitigated CRS-induced anxiety. Cell type–specific manipulation of Rap1 activity revealed that Rap1 dysfunction in vHPC pyramidal neurons (PNs), but not in astrocytes or interneurons, contributed to CRS-induced anxiety-like behaviors. Mechanistically, the heightened Rap1 activity in vHPC PNs augmented their intrinsic excitability through Kv4.2 phosphorylation at the Thr607site, which contributes to the onset of anxiety-like behaviors in mice following CRS. Overall, our study reveals a previously undescribed anxiogenic effect of Rap1 and highlights it as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in stress-related mental disorders."

To overcome these issues, we introduce a universal alcohol-based molecule coupling (AMC) method to regulate amorphousness and inhibit V dissolution in VOs (VO2, V2O5, and V6O13), resulting in high-performance cathodes. The strategy enables alcohol molecules with different chain lengths (ethanol, isopropanol, and isobutanol) to couple with VOs by forming V─OH bonds under Lewis acid–based interactions, inducing controlled amorphization. Among these, isopropanol coupling stands out by enabling the formation of short-range ordered amorphous structure (SOA-VO/Ipr). This structure enhances the reaction kinetics and suppresses V dissolution. As a result, the SOA-VO/Ipr cathode achieves 219.4 mAh g−1at 100 A g−1, retains 92.6% capacity over 10,000 cycles, and delivers 228.8 mAh g−1at 9.1 A g−1under high loading (21.9 mg cm−2) over 3500 cycles, demonstrating a promising method for durable zinc-ion batteries."

The co-chaperone BAG3 (Bcl-2–associated athanogene 3) plays an important role in maintaining intracellular protein homeostasis by regulating heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). Here, we reported that BAG3 expression was significantly elevated in AD. It interacted with and stabilized BACE1 by delaying its degradation through ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosomal pathways. BAG3E455Kand BAG3R480Amutations reduced their interaction with BACE1. SPOT peptide arrays revealed that BACE1 carboxyl-terminal peptide fragments bound to the RQ domain of BAG3. This interaction can be disrupted by BACE1-derived peptide (Tat-BACE1480-494), leading to decreased BACE1 stability. In APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice, Tat-BACE1480-494reduced BACE1 levels, decreased Aβ production, and improved synaptic and cognitive deficits.

Using single-cell RNA sequencing of embryonic hearts, we identified prothymosin α (PTMA) as a key factor driving cardiomyocyte proliferation. Overexpression of PTMA in primary mouse and rat cardiomyocytes significantly promoted cardiomyocyte proliferation and similarly enhanced proliferation in human iPSC–derived cardiomyocytes. Conditional knockout ofPtmain cardiomyocytes impaired neonatal heart regeneration. AAV9-mediated overexpression ofPtmaextended the neonatal proliferative window and showed therapeutic promise for enhancing adult heart regeneration. Mechanistically, PTMA interacted with MBD3, inhibiting its deacetylation activity within the MBD3/HDAC1 NuRD complex.

We then establish the utility of oxygen-enhanced-multispectral optoacoustic tomography, a label-free, ionizing radiation-free imaging modality, to visualize and quantify spatiotemporal changes in tumor hypoxia in response to AVO.

Mechanistically, in a steady state, highly expressedSnora54anchored the nucleolar protein Lyar in the nucleolus of ISCs, preventing Lyar from translocation into the nucleoplasm. Thereby, Lyar failed to recruit on theNotch2promoter region in the nucleoplasm to promoteNotch2transcription, leading to suppression of ISC self-renewal. By contrast, with deletion ofSnora54, Lyar translocated to the nucleoplasm of ISCs where it enriched on theNotch2promoter to initiate its transcription resulting in the activation of Notch2 signaling pathway.

Notably, Rab27-dKO brain endothelial cells exhibit deficient tight junctions, whereby they enable large-scale extravasation of cytotoxic T cells into the tumor mass.

They exhibit distinctive solidification textures, formed through rapid cooling from a molten state. The formation conditions of these textures have primarily been inferred on the basis of dynamic crystallization experiments; however, the theoretical verification of the solidification process has been largely neglected. Here, we conducted numerical simulations of the solidification of chondrule melt and successfully reproduced a crystal growth pattern resembling a typical barred olivine chondrule texture. This pattern emerged under conditions of rapid cooling, exceeding 104kelvins hour−1, which is substantially larger than those inferred experimentally. These results suggest that theories of chondrule formation in the nebula, which have been developed based on experimental results, should be reexamined."

While most WM research has centered on the mechanisms of objects, there has been a lack of investigation into the cognitive and neural mechanisms of events, which are the building blocks of our experience. Using confirmatory factor analysis, psychophysical experiments, and resting-state and task functional magnetic resonance imaging methods, our study demonstrated that events have an independent storage space within WM, named as event cache, with distinct neural correlates compared to object storage in WM. We found the cerebellar network to be the most essential network for event cache, with the left cerebellum Crus I being particularly involved in encoding and maintaining events. Our findings shed critical light on the neuropsychological mechanism of WM by revealing event cache as an independent component of WM and encourage the reconsideration of theoretical models for WM."

We do not know how a touch becomes ticklish or why we respond to other people’s tickles but not our own. No theory satisfactorily explains why touch on some body areas feels more ticklish than on others or why some people are highly sensitive while others remain unresponsive. Gargalesis is likely the earliest trigger for laughter in life, but it is unclear whether we laugh because we enjoy it. Socrates, Aristotle, Bacon, Galileo, Descartes, and Darwin theorized about tickling, but after two millennia of intense philosophical interest, experimentation remains scarce. This review argues that gargalesis is an exhilarating scientific puzzle with far-reaching implications for developmental, sensorimotor, social, affective, clinical, and evolutionary neuroscience. We reflect on the challenges in defining and eliciting ticklish sensations in the lab and unraveling their neural mechanism, discuss five classic yet unanswered questions about tickle, and suggest directions for future research."
