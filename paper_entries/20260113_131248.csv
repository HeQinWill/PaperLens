Mitchell,Constraining a Radiative Transfer Model with Satellite Retrievals: Contrasts between cirrus formed via homogeneous and heterogeneous freezing and their implications for cirrus cloud thinning,"Cirrus clouds play a key role in Earth’s climate by trapping heat. Using satellite observations and radiative transfer modeling, we examined how thinning these clouds might help cool the planet. We find that natural homogeneous and heterogeneous cirrus have distinct radiative effects, and that the instantaneous impact of cirrus cloud thinning can lead to either cooling or warming, depending on atmospheric dynamics. These insights help guide future studies of cirrus clouds using climate models. 
 The efficacy of the climate intervention method known as cirrus cloud thinning (CCT) is difficult to evaluate in climate models, largely due to uncertainties governing the relative contributions of homogeneous and heterogeneous ice nucleation. Here we take a different approach by employing recent satellite retrievals from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) which provide estimates of the fraction of cirrus clouds dominated by homogeneous and heterogeneous ice nucleation and their associated physical properties. We employ a radiative transfer model (RTM) to quantify the cloud radiative effect for homogeneous and heterogeneous cirrus clouds at the top of atmosphere (TOA), Earth's surface, and within the atmosphere. The RTM experiments are initialized using cirrus microphysical profiles derived from CALIPSO retrievals for cirrus clouds dominated by homogeneous and heterogeneous ice nucleation across different regions (Arctic, Antarctic, and midlatitude) and surface types (ocean and land). We define two bounds: the lower bound assumes a full microphysical transition from the observed composition of homogeneous- and heterogeneous-dominated cirrus to only heterogeneous cirrus and production of new cirrus. The upper bound assumes production of new cirrus and that the atmospheric dynamics enables homogeneous freezing nucleation to occur regardless of the concentration of ice nucleating particles. Based on these bounds, we estimate an instantaneous surface effect ranging from −0.5 to +0.6 W m−2 and a TOA effect from −0.9 to +1.1 W m−2, respectively, showing the possibility of both cooling and warming. Recommendations are provided to improve the treatment of cirrus clouds in climate models."

We estimated carbon dioxide emissions in Zurich and Paris over one year by combining atmospheric observations with mesoscale model simulations. Our study shows how factors like city size, terrain, and measurement methods affect emission estimates. 
 Observation-based estimation of urban CO2 emissions can help cities track their pathway to net zero emissions, a goal many cities worldwide have adopted. While mesoscale atmospheric transport models are an effective component in inversion systems estimating country-level emissions, their use in urban-scale inversions presents a significant challenge. Here, we present one-year flux inversion results with the mesoscale ICON-ART atmospheric transport model for two cities with contrasting size and topographic complexity: Zurich and Paris. Inversions were performed with an ensemble square root filter, assimilating observations from a dense rooftop CO2 sensor network in Zurich and from a tall tower network in Paris. The inversion framework optimized gridded anthropogenic and biospheric fluxes, along with background mole fractions from eight inflow regions. Prior anthropogenic emissions were based on detailed inventories provided by local authorities. In Zurich, the inversion resulted in a posterior annual anthropogenic emission of 1012.3±38.8 kt yr−1, representing approximately a 30 % reduction compared to the prior, with the most significant decreases during winter periods of elevated ambient temperatures. In contrast, the posterior fluxes in Paris remained close to the prior, with an annual emission of 3580.0±101.9 kt yr−1, which is 7 % higher than the prior. This comparison highlights the influence of city-specific factors – such as topography, city size, and observational network – on the inversion system performance. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate the potential of mesoscale models to refine urban emission estimates, offering valuable insights for policymakers and researchers working to improve emission inventories and advance urban climate strategies."

This is the first approach to measure those emissions aircraft-based, to assess their magnitude and drivers. We identified emission hotspots and temporal changes in agricultural emissions in the Netherlands. Our approach is applicable to further greenhouse gas emitters, therefore it builds a step towards more comprehensive emission quantification. 
 This study reports on the first successful deployment of a new airborne eddy covariance (EC) setup to better characterize and quantify non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. The system was deployed aboard the DLR research aircraft Cessna Caravan to quantify growing-season emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in Friesland, an agricultural region in the Netherlands, in early summer 2023. The EC system consists of a commercial quantum cascade laser spectrometer, specifically adapted for airborne observations and providing 10 Hz data of N2O and CH4, and the meteorological measurement suite METPOD, delivering data of the vertical wind, horizontal winds, water vapor and temperature. Our measurements are a novelty for N2O, since they are the first implementation of quantifying agricultural emissions with airborne EC, combining the advantages of regional-scale coverage, while maintaining high spatial resolution and hence are well suited to capture the spatial complexity of this dominant emission sector. The system provides fluxes with minimal low- and high-frequency distortions, low detection limits, and total uncertainties (30 %–100 %) comparable to other airborne methods, despite the complexity of agricultural emissions. During measurements in Friesland, we identified clear N2O emission hotspots and hot-moments, with peak fluxes of 0.34  µg m−2 s−1 on the regional-scale after intensive precipitation following a relatively dry period. Single small-scale hotspot emissions were as high as 1 µg m−2 s−1 In contrast, CH4 fluxes showed less temporal variations around a mean flux of 1.62 µg m−2 s−1 throughout the three-week campaign. N2O emissions were relatively high compared to other agricultural regions worldwide, and preliminary comparisons with EDGAR v8.0 and the Dutch emission inventory Emissieregistratie suggest substantial underestimation of growing-season N2O emissions in current inventories and the lack of an appropriate annual cycle. Our results further document the urgent need for independent verification of reported N2O and CH4 emissions from agriculture, which is the most dominant anthropogenic sector of non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions and is expected to become even more dominant in the future, with an increasing world population and food demand."

Direct measurements of dissolved oxygen are sparse, and interpolation methods are needed to study the variability and changes in oxygen content. In this work, we used machine learning to improve estimates of oxygen levels across the global ocean. Our approach produces a new gridded product that captures detailed changes in oxygen over time and space. 
 Ocean deoxygenation, driven by climate change, poses significant challenges to marine ecosystems and can profoundly alter nutrient and carbon cycling. Quantifying the rate and regional patterns of deoxygenation relies on spatio-temporal interpolation tools to fill gaps in observational coverage of dissolved oxygen. However, this task is challenging due to the sparsity of observations, and classical interpolation methods often lead to high uncertainty and biases, typically underestimating long-term deoxygenation trends. In this work, we develop a novel gridded dissolved oxygen product by integrating direct oxygen observations with machine-learning-based emulated oxygen estimates derived from temperature and salinity profiles. The gridded product is then generated through optimal interpolation of both the observed and emulated data. The resulting product (Ouala et al., 2025;  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15478088) shows strong agreement with baseline climatology and captures well-known patterns of seasonal variability and long-term deoxygenation trends. It also outperforms current state-of-the-art products by more accurately capturing dissolved oxygen variability at synoptic and decadal scales, and by reducing uncertainty around long-term changes. This study highlights the potential of combining machine learning with classical interpolation methods to generate improved gridded biogeochemical products, enhancing our ability to study and understand ocean biogeochemical processes and their variability under a changing climate."

It covers 50 African countries and regions. it aims to support the UN's sustainable development goal 9.1. With an accuracy rate of 77%–96%, it correlates well with existing data. It can be used to guide infrastructure upgrades, assess sustainable development goal, and analyze its impacts on traffic safety, energy consumption, ecological environment, and economic development. 
 Road surface types not only influence the accessibility of road networks and socio-economic development but also serve as a critical data source for evaluating the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 9.1. Existing research indicates that Africa generally has a low road paved rate, which limits local socio-economic development. Although the International Road Federation (IRF) provides statistical data on paved road length and road paved rates for certain African countries, this data neither covers all African countries nor specifies the surface type of individual roads, making it challenging to support decision-making for improving Africa's road infrastructure. To address this gap, this study developed the first dataset for 50 African countries and regions, incorporating the surface type of every road. This was achieved using multi-source geospatial data and a tabular deep learning model. The core methodology involved designing 16 proxy indicators across three dimensions – derived from five open geospatial datasets (OpenStreetMap road data, GDP data, population distribution data, building height data, and land cover data) – to infer road surface types across Africa. Key findings include: the accuracy of the African road surface type dataset ranges from 77 % to 96 %, with F1 scores between 0.76 and 0.96. Total road length, paved road length, and road paved rates calculated from this dataset show high correlation (correlation coefficients: 0.69–0.94) with corresponding IRF statistics. Notably, the road paved rate also exhibits strong correlation with GNI per capita and the Human Development Index (HDI) (correlation coefficients: 0.80–0.83), validating the reliability of the dataset. Spatial analysis of African road paved rates at national, provincial, and county scales revealed an average paved rate of only 17.4 % across the 50 countries and regions. A distinct pattern emerged, with “higher paved rates in the north and south and lower rates in the central region”; the average paved rate north of the Sahara is approximately three times that of Sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa). The African road surface type dataset developed in this study (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.29424107, Liu and Zhou, 2025) not only provides data support for enhancing road infrastructure and evaluating progress toward SDG 9.1 in Africa but may also facilitate research on how road surface types impact road safety, energy consumption, ecological environments, and socio-economic development."

Chand,Glacial Lake Observatory (GLO): Annual dataset of glacial lakes in Nepal and transboundary catchments (2017–2024),"Glacial lakes are expanding as glaciers melt in High Mountain Asia. These lakes store meltwater but can trigger dangerous outburst floods (GLOFs), threatening downstream communities. Using satellite imagery and deep learning, we mapped lakes across the Nepal-transboundary region (2017–2024) and found rapid growth, especially in the Koshi basin. This research supports the Glacial Lake Observatory, which will enable long-term monitoring and hazard reduction. 
 Global glacier mass loss is accelerating the formation and expansion of glacial lakes. These lakes store meltwater, contribute to enhanced glacier mass loss through positive feedback mechanisms, and in some cases can pose a risk to downstream populations, infrastructure, and ecosystems through glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Although satellite-derived inventories of glacial lakes exist at both global and regional scales, they vary in spatial and temporal resolution. Critically, fully automated and systematic monitoring of lake area changes is lacking, yet such monitoring is essential for detecting anomalous changes, estimating water storage, and understanding lake-glacier feedbacks. Here, we present a foundational dataset to support lake monitoring for the Glacial Lake Observatory (GLO), with an initial focus on lakes in Nepal and transboundary catchments. We trained a deep learning model to extract water bodies from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image mosaics from 2017 to 2024, subsequently classifying them as glacier-fed or non-glacier-fed based on their hydrological connectivity. In total, 18,389 and 22,419 individual lake outlines (≥ 0.001 km2) were mapped respectively from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery (2017–2024), resulting in 2,966 and 4,150 uniquely identified lakes (respectively). The number and total area of lakes increased over the eight-year period, driven largely by sustained expansion in the Koshi basin, which hosts about 61% of all mapped lakes and nine out of ten of the fastest expanding. On average, glacial lakes covered an average annual area of 169 km², with growth concentrated in high-elevation, glacier-fed systems. Validation against existing inventories and manually digitised outlines demonstrated good accuracy of our deep learning datasets (F1 scores = 0.80–0.92), with Sentinel-2 most reliably capturing smaller lakes. Datasets, as well as deep learning models, are openly available (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17802334)."

Padula,Impact of Wildland Fire Smoke PM2.5 on Birth Weight in California,"The increase in the frequency, duration, and intensity of wildland fires is a significant source of air pollution that can impact perinatal outcomes. This study assessed associations between wildfire fine particulate matter <2.5 μm (PM2.5) and adverse birth weight outcomes among singleton term births in California for 2007–2018. Exposure was assessed using bias-corrected Community Multiscale Air Quality Model, linked to residence at delivery. Logistic and linear regression models estimated associations between average daily wildfire PM2.5 and birth weight outcomes, adjusting for individual-level sociodemographic covariates and seasonality. We conducted race/ethnicity-stratified analyses to assess whether the influence of wildfire PM2.5 differed among racially marginalized populations. In a sample of 4,537,418 term births, a 1 μg/m3 increase in wildfire PM2.5 during pregnancy was associated with increased odds of large for gestational age and an increase in birth weight, as well as moderately decreased odds of low birth weight and small for gestational age. These associations were more pronounced among Hispanic individuals and those in the Other race category. Conversely, among American Indian and Alaska Native births, exposure to wildfire PM2.5 was associated with decreased odds of large for gestational age. Results underscore the importance of understanding how wildfire PM2.5 impacts fetal growth, especially among marginalized groups."

Russell;Shunliu Zhao;Amir Hakami;Shu Tao,Aligning Climate and Health Co-Benefits through Supply-Chain Energy Intensity Coordination in China,"The co-mitigation of carbon emissions and air pollutants offers substantial benefits but is complicated by divergent sectoral emission profiles and spatial disparities. By integrating input-output analysis with health impact source attribution, we examine how interprovincial trade redistributes CO2 emissions and PM2.5-related mortality across China’s supply chains. We find that demand from economically advanced provinces induces two distinct burden-shifting patterns between carbon emissions and health burdens. Carbon emissions are outsourced to sparsely populated northwestern regions through power generation, while health burdens concentrate in the densely populated industrial manufacturing belt of central and northern China. Despite production-side divergences, we identify a notable alignment at the final production level, offering opportunities to narrow the energy intensity gap through supply chain coordination. We simulate three convergence scenarios in which upstream producers in the nonmetal, metal, and power sectors adopt energy intensities of their downstream partners. These include full convergence (100% adoption) and two partial convergence scenarios (75% and 50% adoption), with the latter constrained by national benchmark performance. Full convergence reduces trade-related CO2 emissions by 17% (491 Mt) and averts 19% of associated mortality (3.8 × 104 deaths). Partial convergence scenarios still deliver meaningful co-benefits. This demonstrates that supply chain coordination offers pathways to reconciling production-side disparities and more balanced climate–health co-benefits in China."

Using Pinqing Lagoon (South China Sea) as a model system, we investigate how this feedback changes under eutrophication, whether sediments become enhanced nutrient sinks (buffering eutrophication) or disproportionate nutrient recyclers (exacerbating eutrophication) under increasing organic matter loading. We analyze sediments across a water-column productivity gradient and quantify sediment-water fluxes. Results show that the eutrophication-impacted nearshore exhibits a 30% sedimentation increase over two decades, with chlorophyll-a levels and sediment organic carbon flux 3 times higher than the less-disturbed offshore area. This causes a >50% shallower oxygen penetration (1.1 mm nearshore vs 2.4 mm offshore), impeding ammonium oxidation and likely promoting dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium. The thin oxic layer enhances fresh organic matter burial into anoxic zones, stimulating iron oxide reactivity and iron/sulfate reduction. These mechanisms amplify ammonium, phosphate, and dissolved Fe fluxes by 20-, 30-, and 100-fold, respectively, disproportionate to the 2–3 times increase in organic matter remineralization. This superlinear feedback suggests that eutrophic coastal systems may reach critical thresholds, making them progressively harder to manage. The magnified nutrient release may self-sustain eutrophication, with important implications for restoration timelines and management strategies."

In this study, we developed a novel, practical, and feasible framework for mechanistically correcting low-cost PM2.5 sensor measurements under high-humidity conditions by quantitatively separating aerosol liquid water mass (ALW) using the widely available EPA Chemical Speciation Network (CSN) data set, after accounting for the necessary optical calibration procedures that affect sensor performance at elevated RH. We introduced two key correction processes for a low-cost optical PM2.5 measurement system comprising a nephelometer and an optical particle counter: (1) optical calibration grounded in Mie theory to account for variations in sensor performance driven by aerosol size distribution, refractive index, and hygroscopic growth, and (2) determination of ALW to estimate dry-equivalent PM2.5 mass concentrations under high RH conditions. The corrected PM2.5 data exhibit strong agreement with EPA reference measurements, affirming the robustness of the proposed correction framework. Furthermore, the quantification of ALW offers valuable insights for advancing aqueous-phase aerosol chemistry and secondary aerosol formation studies. For regions without colocated CSN data, we provide practical guidance for applying these correction methods using surrogate information. Overall, the methodologies developed in this work are expected to significantly enhance the accuracy and applicability of low-cost optical PM2.5 sensors in humid environments."

This study reveals the key genes for salinity adaptation in Chlorella sp. MEM25, an early saltwater alga. 
 Deciphering adaptation to habitat shifts across the salinity boundary necessitates investigation of “lost” and “acquired” saline genes. By assembling a telomere-to-telomere genome, we propose that the euryhaline Chlorophyta Chlorella sp. MEM25 represents an early-diverging saltwater species that has evolved numerous genes essential for saltwater-freshwater transitions. By comparison with Viridiplantae genomes, we identify ancestral genes and lineage-specific genes related to salinity adaptation. Loss-of-function mutants of the proposed salt-sensitive genes in algae and plants exhibit increased salt resistance, highlighting the potential of the MEM25 genome as a breeding resource. Notably, the gene RMI1 plays an important role in salinity tolerance across species, from microalgae to higher plants.

 Bone aging compromises skeletal integrity and increases vulnerability to osteoporosis and other age-related disorders, underscoring the need for new therapeutic strategies. Although pharmacological and genetic approaches have been widely explored, how cellular mechanical remodeling contributes to bone aging remains unclear. Here, we find that senescent bone marrow stem cells show markedly reduced intracellular force and impaired mechanical behavior. Moderate mechanical stimulation in cell culture and in mice restores cellular force, increases chromatin accessibility at the FOXO1 locus, activates its expression, and reverses cellular senescence and bone aging. These mechanical interventions also improve physical performance in aged female mice and show a tendency to reduce systemic inflammation, whereas excessive force induces chromatin overextension and DNA damage, indicating the necessity of precise force control. In this work, we show that optimized mechanical stimulation provides a simple and effective strategy to counteract age-related bone deterioration and systemic inflammation, offering potential for clinical translation. Senescent bone marrow stem cells were revealed to exhibit reduced intracellular force, and optimized mechanical stimulation restores this force, enhances FOXO1 chromatin accessibility, and reverses cellular senescence and bone aging."

 Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disease caused by expanded GGC repeats in the 5’ untranslated region of the human-specific NOTCH2NLC gene. The high sequence similarity between NOTCH2NLC and its paralogs poses a significant challenge for precise gene editing. Here, we develop a CRISPR/spCas9-based gene-editing strategy that precisely excises the expanded GGC repeats in NOTCH2NLC without detectable off-target effects on the highly homologous NOTCH2/NOTCH2NL family genes (<2% sequence divergence at this locus). The efficacy, specificity and safety of this approach are rigorously validated across multiple experimental models, including human cell lines, NIID iPSCs, and our previously established transgenic NIID mouse model. Our results demonstrate that precise excision of the expanded GGC repeats effectively alleviates NIID-related neuropathological, molecular and behavioral abnormalities. This study establishes the proof of concept for genome editing as a therapeutic strategy for NIID and other related repeat expansion disorders.

Here, the authors address this issue by designing a smart nano reporter that travels with groundwater and releases signals upon contact with even trace-level contamination, allowing precise mapping of the residual organic contaminants. 
 Groundwater remediation is vital for meeting the ever-growing demand for clean water. However, accurately delineating subsurface contamination by free-phase organic contaminants (FPOCs) remains a major remediation hurdle. Here, we design a nano-structured reporter featuring a hydrophobic contaminant probe embedded within the framework of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-grafted carboxylated carbon black, for ultrahigh-sensitivity FPOC detection. When injected into the subsurface, the reporter moves with groundwater as the PVA chains prevent nanoparticle aggregation and deposition. The presence of even FPOC traces (as thin films or small droplets) triggers the release of probe molecules, enabled by the super-responsive coiling of PVA chains at organic–water interfaces. Contaminant mass is directly proportional to the amount of probe partitioning into the FPOCs, which can be accurately determined by fitting transport data with a two-site transport model. We offer proof-of-concept that this approach overcomes hydrogeological and FPOC distribution complexities that hinder conventional characterization of contaminant source zones. Accurately locating underground contaminations is a major hurdle for cleaning up groundwater.

 Topological soft matter systems rely on controllable defect structures to encode functionality, yet robust, large-scale, and reconfigurable manipulation strategies remain elusive. Here we present a versatile acoustic platform for dynamic control of liquid crystal defect arrays via engineered topological wavefields. By coherently superimposing surface acoustic waves, we generate spatially structured potential landscapes and acoustic streaming vortices that interact with the molecular orientation field of liquid crystals, enabling dynamic reconfiguration of topological defects. Tuning the acoustic parameter space allows precise modulation of defect density, symmetry, morphology, and spatial positioning. A theoretical framework based on Ginzburg-Landau modeling and free energy minimization captures the formation of vortex-induced instabilities and associated topological textures. The platform operates across diverse liquid crystal compositions, demonstrating material generality. This acoustically driven approach offers a scalable strategy for programmable topological structure in soft matter, with potential applications in reconfigurable photonic devices and active material systems.

 Dielectric ceramic capacitors with ultrahigh power density have become indispensable in modern power electronics, yet the persistent challenge of achieving superior energy density with high energy efficiency remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications. Herein, we propose an effective non-polar nanocluster confinement strategy through phase-field simulation-guided design of high-entropy (Bi0.2Na0.2Ba0.2Sr0.2Ca0.2)(Ti1-xSnx)O3 lead-free relaxor ferroelectrics. The incorporation of Sn4+ ions with low ionic polarizability leads to the formation of localized non-ferroelectric perovskite units, which constitute robust non-polar nanoclusters, being further stabilized and rendered immobile against electric fields by the substantial local random fields inherent to the high-entropy configuration. Consequently, these engineered non-polar nanoclusters serve as effective pinning centers to impede the merging and growth of polar nanodomains under electric fields, thereby reconciling the inherent conflict between polarization enhancement and hysteresis reduction. The optimized composition (x = 0.06) exhibits a high recoverable energy density of ~18.5 J·cm-3 together with an ultrahigh energy efficiency of ~92.4% in multilayer ceramic capacitors, representing a competitive combination among lead-free counterparts. This approach not only establishes a viable paradigm for next-generation energy storage dielectrics but also provides fundamental insights for designing functional materials with tailored electrical properties.

Here, authors show that the interconnected wirings between medial prefrontal cortex and claustrum contribute to the encoding and retrieval of methamphetamine reward memory in a pathway-specific manner. 
 Bidirectional communication between medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and claustrum (CL) plays a critical role in drug reward memory, particularly for conditioned drug-associated cues. However, their precise circuitry remains unclear. Here, using viral tracing, chemo-&opto-genetics and patch-clamp, alongside methamphetamine (METH) conditioned place preference (CPP) model, we dissected the connectivity pattern between mPFC and CL in male mice. Two relatively independent pathways of top-down mPFC-CL and bottom-up CL-mPFC were identified, each comprising both direct excitatory and indirect inhibitory projections. The mPFC-CL pathway predominantly mediates inter-hemispheric communication, while the CL-mPFC pathway mainly supports intra-hemispheric connections. Under physiological conditions, strong feedforward inhibition (FFI) via local GABAergic interneurons suppresses excitatory transmission between mPFC and CL. During METH CPP, FFI is weakened, resulting in enhanced excitatory signaling. The mPFC-CL pathway was engaged during reward memory encoding, whereas the CL-mPFC pathway mediated memory retrieval. These findings suggest potential therapeutic interventions for METH reward memory. The precise brain circuits underlying drug reward memory remain unclear. Here, authors show that the interconnected wirings between medial prefrontal cortex and claustrum contribute to the encoding and retrieval of methamphetamine reward memory in a pathway-specific manner."

 Humans show marked diversity in cultural values, beliefs, and preferences. Here, we analyze survey responses from 640,110 individuals in 117 countries (representing 89% of the World’s population), and 2,333 sub-national districts, surveyed in the World Values Survey and the European Values Study. Across multiple sets of comparable cultural traits, we find that religion consistently emerges as the cultural trait that exhibits the largest cross-country divergence (measured by the Cultural Fixation Index or simple variances). For example, personal emphasis on religion varies 5-10 times more across countries than emphasis on family, politics, or work effort, and religion is the most divergent quality valued for raising children. Likewise, differences in religious group membership across countries exceed those in other voluntary affiliations. These cross-country differences in religiosity stem partly from differences between religious traditions, but mostly from individual differences in religious involvement intensity. Our findings underscore the importance of religion in shaping cultural differences across societies. Societies differ widely in cultural values across the world.

 Topography in mountain areas redistributes the incoming solar radiation and determines water availability, creating microclimates and forming distinct habitat conditions within short distances. How this local topography modulates the impacts of climate change on the growth of vegetation on mountains at large scales remains unclear. Here we quantify the difference in vegetation density between polar-facing and equatorial-facing slopes (defined as aspect asymmetry) across the Northern Hemisphere and find a weakening trend of aspect asymmetry from 2003 to 2024. For regions that show higher vegetation density on the polar-facing slopes, the magnitude, area and seasonal duration of aspect asymmetry all decreased, implying a reduction in water control on vegetation growth. Further analyses show that the observed changes in vegetation aspect asymmetry are attributable to hydrothermal conditions, and are dominated by solar radiation and temperature in particular. Our findings highlight changes in an underexplored but important part of mountain ecosystems, with implications for ecological stability under climate change.

 Inferences of ice-sheet change through geological time rely on environmental proxies, yet these inferences assume an unchanging ice-sheet response to climate. Here, using 500-kyr long ice-sheet simulations, we show that the directionality of ice sheet change depends on the background state of the climate. Under cold atmospheric conditions with high-amplitude glacial–interglacial changes in sub-shelf melt, ice sheets advance during cold phases and retreat as the climate warms. However, under warmer air temperatures with reduced glacial–interglacial ice-shelf melt variability, ice sheets advance during warm phases and retreat during colder periods. Forced with a linearly changing climate, the ice sheet switches from one mode to the other, and a resonant response arises at half the forcing frequency. These findings imply that climate–ice sheet phasing is not constant over time, and suggest that ice sheet behaviour under a future, warmer, climate may be substantially different from today. Gradual cooling or warming of the atmosphere, combined with strong ocean-driven basal melt, could have led to major changes in the periodicity, phasing, and asymmetry of past ice sheet growth and decay, according to an ensemble of 500-kyr long ice sheet simulations."

 In the Arctic Ocean, a substantial portion of primary production occurs under sea ice and around the subsurface chlorophyll maximum. In these low-light environments, primary production will depend on photoacclimation, which increases phytoplankton’s chlorophyll content per unit of carbon biomass to enhance photon capture. Here, we incorporated a photoacclimation theory based on resource allocation optimization into a global ecosystem model, showing that remarkably high chlorophyll content responding to low-light environments is a primary driver of under-ice production. The distribution of primary production is more strongly correlated with phytoplankton carbon biomass than with chlorophyll concentration. We estimated that approximately half of the Arctic Ocean’s primary production occurs in regions where satellite observations are challenging (i.e., where ice concentration exceeds 10%). This mechanistic framework enhances our ability to interpret observed distributions of chlorophyll and primary production and predict ongoing changes in the Arctic Ocean primary production under shifting environmental conditions. Arctic chlorophyll content under ice and around the subsurface chlorophyll maximum is several times higher than surface open-water regions, resulting in a phytoplankton growth rate beneath the ice comparable to open-water areas, according to global ecosystem model simulations."

 Abrupt changes at decadal time scale are recurrent events in the modern climate system. Using multiple trend-change detection methods, here we report such an abrupt trend change in the early 2010s in the altimetry-based global mean sea level record, as well as in its thermal and mass components. Abrupt trend change in the mass component is mostly due to terrestrial water storage and to a lesser extent to ice sheet melting. The linear rate of rise of the global mean sea level increases abruptly from 2.9 ± 0.22 mm yr−1 over 1993–2011 to 4.1 ± 0.25 mm yr−1 over 2012–2024. Abrupt trend changes in numerous climate parameters have also been reported in the early 2010s, suggesting a more global phenomenon. Internal climate variability is likely the main driver of the early 2010s sharp change observed in sea level and components, although one cannot totally exclude any additional contribution from increased radiative forcing.

 Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), consisting of volatile organic compounds (VOC), can induce and prime defence-related responses in neighbouring plants. However, atmospheric pollutants such as tropospheric ozone (O3) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) can disrupt these interactions by accelerating VOC oxidation and inducing oxidative stress. Here, we investigated the effects of O3 and diesel exhaust pollution on interactions between Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) seedlings by examining the responses of undamaged receiver plants to cues from weevil-damaged neighbours. Using a novel Free-Air Diesel and Ozone Enrichment (FADOE) platform, we exposed seedlings to elevated O3, diesel exhaust (NOX), both in combination, and ambient air. Receiver seedlings exhibited a 49% reduction in bark damage, a 15% increase in net photosynthesis, and priming of green leaf volatile emissions compared to controls and altered blend of emitted VOCs. Despite air pollution affecting photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and VOC emissions, neighbour-induced defences against herbivory remained effective under polluted conditions.

 East Antarctic coastal polynyas—semi-permanent areas of ice-free ocean—are vital for sea ice production, Antarctic Bottom Water formation, and global heat redistribution. The Dibble Polynya has pronounced sea-ice production, yet the shelf water properties there and its offshore influence have been unclear. Here we show Dense Shelf Water outflow from the polynya that ventilates a lighter variety of local bottom water. Hydrographic records suggest Dense Shelf Water formation has persisted for 50 years, consistent with satellite-derived sea-ice production since the 1990s. Since the 2010s, the downstream cross-slope salinity gradient within bottom water has weakened and the Antarctic Slope Front has been modified, following a sharp decline in sea-ice production in the neighbouring Mertz Polynya after 2010 icescape changes. We infer that reduced denser Antarctic Bottom Water formation upstream weakens the slope current barrier, promoting outflow of not-so-dense shelf water from the Dibble Polynya that efficiently ventilates the abyssal basin.

 Episodic reductions in underwater light can be a key driver of marine ecosystem degradation.

Here, we proposed marine darkwaves as a framework for quantifying these episodic reductions of underwater light at specific depths which aligns with definitions of other episodic and extreme events.

We showed evidence of several intense marine darkwaves across these sites, with durations up to 64 days, cumulative light deficits reaching −105.6 mol photon·m−2, and up to almost 100% light loss versus climatology. We extended the framework to satellite-derived seabed irradiance data across New Zealand’s East Cape region (2002–2023), using a set of 10th percentile threshold and a minimum duration of 5 days. This revealed 25 to 80 spatially varying seabed events, and event durations of 5 to 15 days. Importantly, the framework enables local to continental-scale comparisons of the patterns and ecological consequences of episodic light reduction in marine ecosystems. Marine darkwaves can be used to compare patterns and ecological consequences of episodic light reduction in marine ecosystems, according to application of the framework to both in situ and satellite based light irradiance data from California and New Zealand."

 Rooftop greening is increasingly recognized as a pathway to urban sustainability and environmental equity, yet its fine-scale temporal dynamics and distributional fairness remain insufficiently examined. This study develops a building-level framework that constructs annual rooftop greenness time series from satellite-derived NDVI and introduces a Rooftop Greenness Inequality Index (RGII) based on the rooftop green fraction to evaluate distributive fairness. By integrating these measures with a multi-pattern trend classification, the framework captures the co-evolution of temporal dynamics and spatial inequality, and links them to socioeconomic conditions to identify key drivers and vulnerable communities. Using Hong Kong as a case study (2018–2024), we find overall greenness gains and inequality reductions, though unevenly distributed. Citywide, 22.1% of buildings showed significant increases, while 2.1% showed consistent decreases. All 452 communities saw inequality decrease, with the median RGII falling from 0.65 to 0.45. Greenness trajectories varied by land use and development stage: public housing showed a 38.9% rise compared with 21.1% in private housing, and late-stage new towns grew faster but with less stability than older districts. Socioeconomic disparities shaped outcomes: communities with high rent burden, large non-local populations, or many single-person households showed limited improvement, whereas those with more spatial capacity or stronger cultural cohesion performed better. Vulnerable areas were concentrated in older high-density districts where greenness remained low and inequality persisted. These findings demonstrate the framework’s capacity to integrate rooftop greenness change with social dimensions, providing transferable tools for equity-oriented greening strategies in high-density cities."

 Accurate, privacy-respecting soil information is essential for site-specific nutrient management and carbon accounting, yet the cost of laboratory analyses limits many farms to relatively sparse sampling grids. We propose a collaborative framework that couples a national Sentinel-2 bare-soil composite with FL to produce high-resolution clay and soil organic carbon (SOC) maps while keeping all local data on-premise. A one-dimensional convolutional neural network was first pre-trained on a 53,570-sample Brazilian archive and then fine-tuned across 50 farms through synchronous Federated Averaging. We benchmarked this hybrid configuration against (i) a purely centralized model trained on the same archive and (ii) a fully decentralized FL model initialized at random.Across farm-level validation sets, pre-trained FL lowered median RMSE by 42% for clay and 31% for SOC relative to the centralized baseline, while increasing median RPIQ by 33% and 25%, respectively. On farms with ≤150 samples, the gains remained substantial, confirming that the approach remains effective when local datasets are modest compared with national archives. Error distributions differed significantly between scenarios (Friedman and Wilcoxon tests), and the pre-trained FL maps removed most spatial artefacts observed in the centralized outputs while preserving fine-scale gradients. Because only encrypted weight updates are exchanged, sensitive information never leaves the farm, satisfying GDPR/LGPD-style constraints and allowing late-joining clients to inherit an increasingly mature global model. Taken together, these results indicate that continental pre-training followed by federated fine-tuning reconciles global generality with local specificity and offers a scalable blueprint for privacy-preserving, high-resolution soil mapping in settings where sample densities are often substantially lower than in experimental setups, without compromising data sovereignty."

 Satellite-derived formaldehyde (HCHO) column densities are commonly used to infer regional emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs). However, intercomparison and validation of HCHO retrievals from different satellite sensors remain scarce, especially under fire periods. Here, we use observations from FIREX-AQ (Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality experiment) and WE-CAN (Western Wildfire Experiment for Cloud Chemistry, Aerosol and Nitrogen), two flight campaigns dedicated to investigating smoke plumes during active fire seasons, combined with simulations from the GEOS-Chem to intercompare and validate five HCHO products from four satellites (OMI, OMPS-NPP, OMPS-N20, and TROPOMI). Our analysis suggests that all satellite products consistently capture elevated HCHO signals over the southeastern US and California, but they tend to report lower column values compared to our aircraft-constrained model estimates, with differences ranging from 11.0 % to 56.7 %. Our results imply that while vertical profile shape (reflected in the air mass factor, AMF) plays a role, errors in the slant column retrieval and the treatment of aerosol and cloud scattering effects may be key sources of uncertainty in the satellite HCHO products during fire events. Therefore, future retrieval improvements should prioritize better aerosol and slant column accuracy to reduce biases."

 The timing of the spring season in the boreal region is shifting under global warming, with profound impacts on ecosystems and hydrological processes. However, the mechanisms driving this transition and its considerable interannual variability are not well described, especially regarding the influence of large-scale atmospheric teleconnection patterns. This study examines the temporal variability of the observed thermal spring season across Finland, a boreal country warming faster than the global average. Key spring timing indices, including onset, end, duration, and growing season onset, were calculated and analyzed using high-resolution (1 km × 1 km) daily mean temperature data from 1961 to 2023. Spatial and temporal patterns were identified through Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) decomposition, and their associations with major atmospheric teleconnection patterns were examined. Results indicated that during the past six decades, the spring onset has advanced by 2–6 days/decade, with the most pronounced changes in the coastal and southwestern parts of the country. The duration of the spring season has extended by 3–6 days/decade in the northern areas and along the southwestern coast. The early spring onset was associated with a strong positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation (AO), and delayed spring end and growing season onset were linked to the positive phase of the East Atlantic–West Russia (EAWR) pattern. By contrast, an early growing season start was linked to the positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The duration of the thermal spring season showed a strong association with the Scandinavian (SCA) pattern."
