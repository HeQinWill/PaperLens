Yung,Environmental Filtering Weakens with Trophic Level in Urban Coastal Ecosystems,"Urban coastal ecosystems face increasing anthropogenic pressures and environmental variability, yet the consequences for multitrophic biodiversity and ecosystem networks remain poorly resolved. Here, we combine environmental DNA metabarcoding, visual surveys, flow cytometry, and environmental measurements to examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of marine metazoans, protists, and prokaryotes across estuarine, transitional, and oceanic habitats in Hong Kong’s urbanized coastal waters. Using permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), we demonstrate that environmental control over community composition weakens systematically at higher trophic levels. The variance explained by seasonal and spatial interaction was highest for prokaryotes (R2 = 0.76) and protists (0.59), but notably lower for benthic fauna (0.41) and bony fish (0.32). Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that oceanic habitats, dominated by heterotrophic prokaryotes, omnivorous fish, and hard corals, supported the most complex and stable multitrophic networks, with an average complexity of 0.54 compared to estuarine (0.23) and transitional habitats (0.29). Structural equation modeling further revealed habitat-specific drivers: temperature exerted the strongest direct effect in estuarine habitats (>0.44), while biotic interactions involving primary producers played a dominant role in oceanic habitats (direct effect >0.28). In contrast, transitional habitats lacked significant environmental or biotic drivers, indicating a system in flux where community dynamics are likely governed by complex variables beyond standard environmental or biotic regulation. These findings demonstrate the gradient-dependent interplay of environmental filtering and biotic regulation in shaping coastal ecosystem stability. Our results also highlight the value of an integrated eDNA-based framework for monitoring biodiversity and ecosystem change, providing insights for the management of urban marine environments under global change."

Silver (Ag), a core yet nonrenewable material in silicon solar panels, faces increasing scarcity with the surge in solar panel production and end-of-life (EoL) volume. We report a synergistic oxidative-coordination strategy for efficient silver recovery from EoL panels. This approach eliminates the use of toxic mineral acids and minimizes secondary pollution by harnessing the strong oxidative potential of hydroxyl radicals (·OH) in combination with the coordination ability of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Notably, the in situ formation of Ag–Ag2O heterostructures during oxidation promotes enhanced ·OH generation, thereby accelerating silver dissolution. Using this method, complete silver leaching is achieved within 60 min, while closed-loop regeneration of EDTA2– is enabled through chloride-induced precipitation. Life cycle assessment and technoeconomic analysis revealed significant reductions in energy demand, greenhouse gas emissions, and water consumption compared with conventional methods, alongside nearly 126% greater process profitability. This work establishes a sustainable and industrially viable Ag recovery pathway, addressing critical bottlenecks in EoL silicon solar panel waste management."

To overcome this limitation, we developed a novel spatially constrained PMF (SC-PMF) model that incorporates geographical information as a penalty term within the PMF objective function. Applied to a comprehensive soil data set from the YRD, the SC-PMF model successfully resolved six robust and physically plausible sources, in stark contrast to the conventional PMF, which failed to produce a stable solution under Bootstrap analysis. The identified sources included not only expected inputs such as agricultural activities but also a suite of previously obscured pathways, revealing contributions from consumer plastic packaging, long-range atmospheric deposition, and informal waste disposal. Critically, the model also decoupled distinct industrial processes by differentiating primary manufacturing emissions from secondary pollution caused by the degradation of industrial additives. These results prove that incorporating spatial constraints is a powerful strategy for resolving source ambiguity in heterogeneous media. The SC-PMF model thus offers significant methodological advancement for accurately tracing contaminant pathways and informing targeted pollution management."

Payne;Ryan P. McKeown;Haotian Cai;Xiao Yang;Anthony P. Straub;Daniel L. McCurry;Karl G. Linden,Native Nitrate in Wastewater Enhances 222 nm UV Advanced Oxidation of Micropollutants,"222 nm irradiation, emitted from krypton chloride excimer (KrCl*) lamps, of waters containing nitrate has previously been demonstrated to lead to de facto advanced oxidation, due to the high absorbance and hydroxyl radical quantum yield of nitrate at 222 nm. Because nitrate is widespread in environmental waters, including nitrified wastewaters and wastewater-impacted surface water, this raises the possibility of UV advanced oxidation, which harnesses in situ nitrate for radical generation when KrCl* lamps are used as the UV source. In turn, this process is effective directly in wastewater effluent without the addition of chemicals. In this study, we compare UV222 treatment, without the addition of an external radical promoter, to UV254 with 10 mg/L hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for the removal of 1,4-dioxane in three effluent waters containing nitrate at 2.1–8.9 mg-N/L. UV222 leads to 2.8–3.9 faster 1,4-dioxane degradation, on an incident fluence basis, resulting in an electrical consumption that is within 0.89–1.3 times that of UV254/H2O2, despite low-pressure mercury vapor lamps having at least 3.5× higher electrical efficiency than KrCl* lamps. When the cost of hydrogen peroxide dosing and quenching is considered, UV222 treatment leads to a projected cost savings of 12.4–21.8% compared to UV254/H2O2. Furthermore, despite the low UV transmittance (UVT) of these effluent waters at 222 nm (<30% UVT), UV222 treatment still leads to 1.5–3.2 times faster removal of NDMA compared to UV254, on an incident fluence basis, due to the enhanced photolysis of NDMA at 222 nm. Lastly, modeling results indicate that other reactive species generated by UV222 photolysis, such as CO3•– and NO2•, can contribute significantly to the degradation of micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals and consumer products."

Here, we employed the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem, a dynamic host-free in vitro model, to investigate how intestinally retained poly(ethylene terephthalate) MPs influence gut microbial communities. We show that MP retention is associated with two separable processes: surface-mediated spatial redistribution of microbes and additive-associated perturbations. Compared with additive-eluted MPs and inert SiO2 particles, MPs exhibited greater surface roughness and hydrophobicity, promoting selective colonization by hydrophobic, potentially pathogenic, and organic-degrading taxa. This surface-associated colonization coincided with the displacement of luminal keystone taxa and pronounced restructuring of microbial co-occurrence networks, reflected by reduced negative cohesion and altered community stability. In parallel, leachable MP-associated additives independently shifted microbial composition and predicted functional potential, including enrichment of pathways related to xenobiotic degradation. This work provides mechanistic insight into how retained MPs may condition gut microbial ecosystems and underscores the importance of considering MP-associated microbial perturbations in gut-relevant exposure assessments."

Here, virgin polystyrene (PS-0) and 45-day photoaged polystyrene (PS-45) were evaluated at environmentally relevant concentrations (0–100 μg/L) to assess aging-related effects and molecular pathways in Caenorhabditis elegans. Photoaging markedly altered PS physicochemical properties, including surface morphology, crystallinity, and functional groups. Exposure to 100 μg/L PS-0 or PS-45 significantly shortened lifespan, impaired physiological behaviors, and increased lipofuscin accumulation, whereas PS-45 at 10–100 μg/L elicited substantially stronger pro-aging effects. These enhanced toxicities were driven by particle-associated processes, particularly elevated environmentally persistent free radical generation and increased particle accumulation in nematodes. Mechanistically, PS-45 inhibited DAF-16 nuclear translocation and dysregulated insulin/IGF-1 signaling genes (daf-2, age-1, pdk-1, akt-1, and daf-16). Concurrently, PS-45 induced ferroptosis, as evidenced by increased Fe2+ and malondialdehyde levels, glutathione depletion, and suppression of ftn-1; these effects were alleviated by the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1. Mutations in daf-2, age-1, pdk-1, akt-1, daf-16, and ftn-1 significantly altered PS-45-induced aging phenotypes and ferroptotic stress, identifying the DAF-2–AGE-1–PDK-1–AKT–DAF-16–FTN-1 axis as a central regulatory pathway.  Collectively, this study reveals a mechanistic link between insulin signaling and ferroptosis in MPs-induced aging and highlights the elevated environmental health risks posed by photoaged MPs."

Childress,Enhanced Cross-Sectional Imaging of the Selective Layer of Reverse Osmosis Membranes,"The integrity and morphology of the selective layer of RO membranes significantly influence transport phenomena and membrane performance, motivating its cross-sectional imaging. Focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) is a less complex technique for cross-sectional imaging that offers a broader field of view and a greater depth of focus, albeit with less resolution than transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In this study, we introduce and demonstrate a new surface-milling approach to improve the FIB-SEM imaging of RO membranes. We develop a bilayer conductive Pt coating topped with a protective carbon deposit; this approach avoids the need to cryo-fracture the membranes, which overcomes drawbacks associated with TEM and conventional FIB-SEM cross-sectional milling (e.g., curtaining and polymer melting). Applied to a commercial RO membrane, the method enabled robust quantification of key structural features and clear visualization of void spaces within the ridge-and-valley structure of the selective layer and pores in the uppermost portion of the support layer. The bilayer platinum coating enhances the delineation of the upper boundary of the selective layer, enabling rapid and accurate identification. With a field of view more than 20 times larger than TEM, FIB-SEM imaging captures a substantially greater cross-sectional area, yielding more representative measurements."

The January 2025 Palisades and Eaton Fires in Los Angeles County caused elevated levels of PM2.5 in the downwind cities. This study leverages a high-resolution network of crowdsourced PurpleAir sensors to evaluate indoor and outdoor PM2.5 levels before, during, and after the wildfire smoke events. We matched indoor–outdoor sensors and analyzed disparities in smoke exposure across communities with different CalEnviroScreen (CES) vulnerability scores, ventilation types, and home values. Results indicate that outdoor PM2.5 increased substantially during smoke days, with the highest CES-burdened communities experiencing the greatest ambient concentrations. Indoor PM2.5 also increased across all neighborhoods but indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratios declined during the smoke period, indicating partial indoor protection and likely occupant behavior changes. Infiltrated PM2.5 increased during the smoke period and varied across the CES groups. Building attributes showed limited predictive power. These findings highlight the interplay between behavioral actions and neighborhood factors in shaping wildfire smoke exposure and underscore the need for targeted interventions to improve indoor air quality in vulnerable communities."

However, previous biogeochemical reconstructions focused mostly on primary productivity, overlooking changes in community structure (e.g., ratio of primary producers to consumers). In this study, we investigate the late Quaternary history of planktonic trophic structure in the western equatorial Pacific by generating sedimentary amino acid δ15N record of Site MD10‐3340. Our results demonstrate well‐preserved amino acid δ15N signatures. Using the δ15N gradients between trophic and source amino acids, we calculate the average sedimentary trophic position and design an idealized ecosystem model to quasi‐quantitively estimate changes in grazing proportion (the proportion of primary production consumed by zooplanktons). Notably, lower trophic position and smaller grazing proportion point to a decline of zooplankton grazing during precession maxima, which is primarily attributed to enhanced nutrient availability in the western equatorial Pacific during El Niño‐like mean‐states. Moreover, average grazing proportion is slightly lower during Interglacial warmth than the last glacial period, implying a secondary control of sea level change. Furthermore, our ocean‐biogeochemical simulations show that a halved grazing proportion could cause pronounced decrease in Pacific carbon storage and a remarkable increase in atmospheric pCO2, due to a shallower remineralization depth. We thus highlight the necessity to incorporate varying marine grazing proportions into future proxy reconstructions and model simulations to facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of the BCP."

However, their generation mechanism and environmental drivers remain poorly understood. Analysis of Van Allen Probes data reveals that low‐frequency chorus waves predominantly occur in the region of MLT range of 0–7 hr and L ∼ 6. These waves show a strong correlation with intense substorm activity and moderate magnetic storms, with the majority of waves clustering during storm‐time substorms. Their excitation mechanism is driven by the coexistence of isotropic low‐energy electrons (below 30 keV) and anisotropic high‐energy electrons (above 50 keV) during the storm's peak, along with concurrent geomagnetic field weakening due to enhanced ring currents."

Here, we use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict and quantify uncertainty in the intensity growth and trajectory of over 200,000 storms simulated with a 200‐year aquaplanet GCM. This idealized framework provides a controlled climate background for isolating factors that govern predictability. Results show that storm intensity is less predictable than trajectory. Strong baroclinicity accelerates storm intensification and reduces its predictability, consistent with theory. Crucially, enhanced jet meanders further degrade forecast skill, revealing a synoptic source of uncertainty. Quantitatively, jet meandering over the storm center and eastern regions is associated with a doubling of the predicted uncertainty sensitivity in storm growth to the jet structure. These findings highlight the potential of machine learning for advancing understanding of predictability and its governing mechanisms."

However, comparing convective structures across TCs is challenging because fixed‐radius metrics cannot adapt to TC size variations. We introduce the Outer‐to‐Inner Brightness‐temperature Ratio (TBR), a size‐adaptive metric quantifying the relative convective strength between the inner and outer region. Analysis of Northwest Pacific TCs (2001–2017) reveals TBR is strongly correlated with intensity (r ≈ 0.6), significantly higher than correlations considering only the inner (r = −0.34) or outer region convection (r = 0.24). TBR is also strongly linked to intensification, with the frequency of rapid intensification peaking within a narrow high‐TBR window (1.15–1.20). Furthermore, for the intensification stage, sustaining a high‐TBR state—a strong inner convection and quiescent outer region—is crucial for achieving a higher lifetime maximum intensity, a process linked to more efficient inward angular momentum transport. TBR provides a powerful tool linking size‐adaptive convection features to TC intensity and evolution."

Johnson;Susanna Winkelbauer,The Atmosphere's Substantial Role in Interannual Variability of Earth's Energy Imbalance,"Earth's Energy Imbalance (EEI) is a key metric to quantify climate change. While the ocean absorbs most excess heat, the atmosphere contributes only 1%–2% to the long‐term mean of EEI. However, our analysis of observational data demonstrates that variations in the atmosphere's energy content play a much larger role in interannual variations of EEI, especially in recent years. Including atmospheric energy uptake substantially improves agreement between observed variations in global net radiative flux at top‐of‐atmosphere (TOA) and ocean heat uptake interannually over 2005–2024. It also reconciles a delay between variability of these two quantities, with oceanic storage variability leading net TOA flux anomalies by ∼2 months. The phase shift can be explained by the atmosphere's important role in buffering and redistributing energy during El Niño – Southern Oscillation. The ability to robustly diagnose these relationships is owing to continuous efforts to monitor and improve estimates of the different EEI components."

We address this knowledge gap via two reduced‐scale physical delta experiments: one with constant discharge and the other with variable discharge. Floods with a peak discharge equal to three times the baseflow reduce the mean total delta‐top area by a factor of two and a half and increase slopes by a factor of two. Enhanced channel mobility increases delta top slopes and limits large‐scale shoreline movement, which reduce wetland planform.

The most likely cause of this truncation is that although the shallow faults in this area are many km in length, they are structurally constrained and have limited down‐dip widths, typically no more than approximately 1 km. Ruptures on faults of such limited width are not expected to attain high aspect ratios. As such, the ruptures on such faults would be limited to dimensions of roughly 1 km2, which corresponds to magnitudes which closely match the observed MMAX truncation. The MMAX truncation for induced earthquakes in the southern Delaware Basin has significant implications since it implies that down‐dip fault widths may play an important role in constraining the maximum magnitudes of induced events."

Using four decades (1984–2023) of visibility‐based observational records, we examine regional and seasonal trends in dust storm frequency across the Sahel and the Sahara, capturing their distinct dust dynamics. Results reveal a significant decline in dust activity in both regions, most pronounced during pre‐monsoon (MAM) and monsoon (JJA) seasons in the Sahel, and during post‐monsoon (SON) and dry season (DJF) in the Sahara. Integrating surface observations with local meteorology (precipitation, surface wind speed, vegetation) and climate indices (AMO, NAO, MEI), we find the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) as the primary driver, with region‐specific effects: in the Sahel, AMO‐driven warming and rainfall increase vegetation, suppressing dust; in the Sahara, AMO intensifies the Saharan Heat Low (SHL) and elevates temperatures, modulating dust through atmospheric stability and wind patterns. Local meteorology further differentiates responses, with precipitation and Leaf Area Index (LAI) dominating dust variability in the Sahel, while SHL strength and surface winds are most influential in the Sahara. By explicitly separating the Sahel and Sahara and integrating multiple drivers, this study provides a more spatially resolved understanding of dust–climate link and suggests continued declines in North African dust storm activity under future warming. These findings offer critical constraints for improving dust emission projections in climate models."

With increased rollout stability, the question of how these models perform for subseasonal to seasonal (S2S, week 3–8) forecasting has emerged. In this study we run a large set of subseasonal hindcasts over 2004–2023 to evaluate two ML weather forecast models at the S2S time scale, SFNO‐HENS (Nvidia, fully ML) and NeuralGCM (Google Research, hybrid). Corresponding hindcasts from the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) are used as a baseline for comparison to a physics‐based model. Because our focus is on predicting moisture transport over the Western United States between October and March, we evaluate the models' prediction skill for the Madden‐Julian Oscillation (MJO) and its associated teleconnections in the North Pacific. We find that both ML models are competitive with the ECWMF model, with comparable skill in predicting the North Pacific large‐scale circulation and the MJO at week 3 and beyond. Even though overall the mid‐latitude subseasonal prediction skill remains low, the ML models exhibit interesting behavior such as a realistic propagation of the MJO across the Maritime Continent and realistic teleconnections. A SFNO‐HENS sensitivity experiment with altered initial conditions in the tropics demonstrates the stability of the model, and it illustrates the capability of ML models to represent important physical processes of the atmosphere at the S2S time scale."

SCREAM simulates nearly completely frozen clouds, which is attributed largely to the unreasonably strong Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen (WBF) process that converts liquid to ice excessively and partly to the early over‐abundant ice production at cold temperatures from a temperature‐deterministic deposition ice nucleation scheme. Assuming no subgrid variation for the WBF process in the original formulation particularly conflicts with the instantaneous saturation adjustment assumption in the condensation scheme that assumes subgrid variability, leading to exaggerated WBF process rates. A proposed simple physically‐based improvement on the treatment of subgrid cloud overlap substantially increases supercooled liquid water content and notably improves cloud‐top phase partitioning, aligning better with observations. Improvement of supercooled liquid water content also converges with increasing horizontal resolution. The deposition ice nucleation scheme is found responsible for a falsely‐produced ice cloud aloft that is not observed, biasing the simulated cloud radiative effects and top‐of‐atmosphere radiative fluxes. This study identifies key deficiencies in cloud parameterizations that continue to challenge convection‐permitting models."

However, the current understanding of its concentration level, sources and atmospheric effects are still poor. This study investigates the drivers of elevated H2O2 concentrations during autumn in Beijing using comprehensive field observations from October to November 2021. The averaged H2O2 concentration in the urban boundary layer of Beijing is 0.26 ± 0.03 ppb, peaking at 16:00. By integrating Random Forest Regression and relative incremental reactivity analysis, we systematically examine the influence of meteorological factors, trace gases, and photochemical reactions on H2O2 concentrations. The result showed the significant contributions of temperature (T) and photochemical processes to H2O2 production, while identifying key inhibitors such as nitrogen monoxide (NO). Additionally, we explore the role of H2O2 in sulfate formation during haze pollution episodes, finding that although H2O2‐mediated oxidation contributes to sulfate production, it is not the dominant pathway during the campaign. These findings underscore the complex interplay between meteorological factors, trace gases, and multiphase reactions in regulating H2O2 concentrations and cycling, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of atmospheric oxidation processes and offer guidance for mitigating air quality issues in urban boundary layer."

Human activities have been confirmed to contribute to the increased occurrence of droughts; however, the dependence of these impacts on the durations of drought, and whether they differ between drylands and humid regions, remains insufficiently understood. This study investigates the human influence on droughts of different durations using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), derived from multi‐source observations and four sets of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) multi‐model simulations. The results show that human activities cause an intensification of long‐term droughts, particularly in drylands. This is primarily attributed to rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with both GHGs and aerosols exerting stronger impacts on droughts in drylands than in humid regions, though aerosols partly offset the intensifying effect. GHGs contribute to more extreme multi‐year droughts over drylands by amplifying temperature‐induced water demand, whereas aerosols reduce drought occurrence in drylands by enhancing precipitation, in contrast to their precipitation‐suppressing effects in humid areas in the past decades."

However, these ecosystems are increasingly threatened by climate change and human activities. This study evaluates vegetation dynamics in global mountain grasslands (2000–2021) using remote sensing data, CMIP6 climate projections, and human modification indices. By means of machine learning models (Random Forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Long Short‐Term Memory (LSTM)) we identified dewpoint temperature, total evaporation, and human modification as dominant predictors of vegetation change, while soil water content and latent heat flux exhibited region‐specific impacts. Results indicate that 35.1% of grasslands remained stable, 32.1% improved, and 32.7% degraded, with degradation hotspots identified in the Tibetan Plateau, Ethiopian Highlands, Rocky Mountains, and Andes, while the Middle Eastern Mountain Ranges showed signs of improvement. Future projections using a hybrid XGBoost–LSTM model indicate limited global‐scale vegetation shifts by 2050 across SSP1‐2.6, SSP2‐4.5 and SSP5‐8.5 scenarios. However, regional differences are notable: the Tibetan Plateau shows a substantial increase in vegetation cover, while the Andes, Rocky Mountains, and parts of East Africa exhibit slight changes. Distributional shifts, especially under SSP5‐8.5, suggest increasing spatial heterogeneity in grassland responses. These findings underscore the importance of regional‐scale strategies to support grassland resilience under future climate and land‐use pressures."

This approach avoids the need to condition future Earth System Model projections on storyline‐based climate scenarios and provides information that can be probabilistically interpreted directly for arbitrary climate metrics including regional climate impact drivers. This addresses a key need of climate risk assessment for climate adaptation. Our demonstration is intended to motivate further engagement on development and delivery of probabilistic climate information, that complements information from scenario‐based climate projections."

Here, the authors show that dense feature-based coding in the ventral temporal cortex is transformed into sparse, conceptual representations in the medial temporal lobe, revealing neural computational mechanisms of object recognition. 
 Understanding how the human brain encodes visual objects involves deciphering the neural computations and circuits in the temporal lobe. Here, we recorded intracranial EEG from the human ventral temporal cortex (VTC) and medial temporal lobe (MTL), as well as single-neuron activity in the MTL, to investigate the computational mechanisms of neural object coding. The VTC exhibited axis-based feature coding, and a neural feature space could be constructed using VTC neural axes, within which visual objects clustered according to high-level categorical relationships. Importantly, MTL neurons encoded receptive fields within this VTC neural feature space, exhibiting selective responses to objects that shared perceptual and conceptual similarities. This computational framework, therefore, explains how dense, feature-based representations in the VTC are transformed into sparse, high-level representations in the MTL. We further validated our findings using an additional dataset with different stimuli. Notably, we uncovered the physiological basis of this computational framework by demonstrating VTC-MTL interactions at multiple levels. Together, our neural computational framework provides a mechanistic understanding of the neural processes underlying object recognition. How the human brain transforms visual input into meaningful object representations remains unclear. Here, the authors show that dense feature-based coding in the ventral temporal cortex is transformed into sparse, conceptual representations in the medial temporal lobe, revealing neural computational mechanisms of object recognition."

 Heterotopic ossification (HO), the abnormal formation of bone in soft tissues, is a debilitating complication that occurs after severe burns, trauma, and joint replacement surgery. Current diagnostic methods detect HO only after substantial progression, limiting opportunities for early intervention. In this study, we show that circulating mesenchymal progenitor cells (cMPCs), isolated using a microfluidic iChip from patients undergoing hip replacement and a mouse model of traumatic HO, exhibit HO-associated gene expression as early as 6 hours post-injury—41 days before radiographic detection. RNA sequencing of cMPCs enabled development of a liquid biopsy-based HO risk prediction model, achieving up to 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity in human subjects. Furthermore, the model detected significant reductions in HO risk following prophylactic treatment, correlating with decreased HO volume. These findings establish a noninvasive platform for early detection and monitoring of HO and suggest broader utility for diseases involving aberrant mesenchymal cell fate. This approach enables high-throughput screening of at-risk patients and real-time assessment of therapeutic efficacy.

The authors show that anionic electrons act as lattice sites to create this rare electronic structure. 
 Flat electronic bands, where interactions among electrons overwhelm their kinetic energies, hold the promise for exotic correlation physics. The dice lattice has long been theorized as a host of flat bands with intriguing band topology. However, to date, no material has ever been found to host the characteristic flat bands of a dice lattice. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we discover a dice-lattice flat band at EF in the van der Waals (vdW) electride [YCl]2+: 2e-. In this system, excess valence electrons from Y deconfine from the cation framework to form an interstitial anionic electron lattice that constitutes the dice lattice. Our ARPES measurements unambiguously identify two sets of dice-lattice bands in YCl, including a nearly dispersionless band at the Fermi level. The near-EF electronic structure observed in ARPES, which consists of the flat bands and other dispersive band features, find excellent agreement with first-principles calculations and is well captured by a simple dice-lattice model. Our findings thus end the long quest of a real dice flat band material and establish vdW electride YCl as a prototype of dice metals. Our results further demonstrate the anionic electron lattice as a novel scheme for realizing lattice geometries and electronic structures rare to find in conventional crystalline systems. Using ARPES, this work identifies dice-lattice flat bands in the electride material YCl. The authors show that anionic electrons act as lattice sites to create this rare electronic structure."

Here, the authors show that even out-of plane symmetric metasurfaces can emit circularly polarized light, achieved by tuning an anisotropic continuum rather than breaking symmetry. 
 Manipulating emission polarization is crucial for advanced applications such as polarized fluorescence and lasing, thermal radiation control, stereochemistry and spintronics. Existing approaches for generating circularly polarized emission primarily rely on nanostructures with true chirality, where the far-field polarization at the Γ point is believed to require out-of-plane symmetry breaking. This raises a question: can an intrinsically achiral metasurface that preserves out-of-plane symmetry generate chiral emission? Here, we introduce the concept of anisotropic continuum, defined as a continuum state exhibiting distinct responses for orthogonal polarizations of incidence, as a new degree of freedom for intrinsically achiral metasurfaces. In such metasurfaces, chiral emission arises from manipulating the anisotropic continuum together with the metasurface’s in-plane perturbations. Degrees of circular polarization of 0.83 for upward emission and −0.9 for downward emission are achieved experimentally by integrating the fabricated silicon metasurface with fluorescent organic dyes. Our findings not only address a long-standing gap in the understanding of structural chirality, but also open new opportunities for high-performance applications in polarized fluorescence and thermal emission. Chiral light emission usually requires twisted or asymmetric nanostructures. Here, the authors show that even out-of plane symmetric metasurfaces can emit circularly polarized light, achieved by tuning an anisotropic continuum rather than breaking symmetry."

Here, the authors report a multicomponent synergistic approach integrating in-situ and dynamic exchange methods to construct hierarchical biopharmaceutical formulations. 
 Hierarchical immobilization of multicomponent biomacromolecules has been demonstrated to be a favorable protocol for constructing advanced biopharmaceuticals, but still with formidable challenges. Herein, we innovate a multicomponent synergistic immobilization approach combining an in-situ method with a structural-transformation-promoted dynamic exchange method in a flexible zeolitic pyrimidine framework (ZPF) platform to construct multicomponent biopharmaceuticals. In-depth mechanism investigation reveals that special functional groups (e.g., carboxyl, sulfhydryl, imidazolyl) on protein surface can significantly promote the dynamic structural transformation of ZPF and allow for the efficient immobilization of proteins on the surface of ZPF crystals via dynamic exchange approach. By combining with the in-situ method, which can immobilize biomacromolecules in the inner part of ZPF crystals, multicomponent biomacromolecules can be regionally localized within ZPF crystals. This controlled spatial preparation provides substantial advantages over conventional core-shell architectures for cascading enzyme immobilization and enables the development of advanced anticancer agents demonstrating enhanced therapeutic efficacy for female Balb/c nu mice. Moreover, this platform can also generate highly efficient hierarchical antibacterial formulations to significantly enhance the wound-healing process of male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. This study provides a revolution to immobilize multicomponent biomacromolecules and represents an innovative and effective platform of biopharmaceuticals with immense potential for anticancer and antibacterial formulations.

 Quasi-2D halide perovskites are chemically synthesized realizations of quantum well stacks with giant exciton oscillator strengths, tunable emission spectra, and very large exciton binding energies. While these features render quasi-2D halide perovskites a promising platform for room-temperature polaritonics, bosonic condensation and polariton lasing in quasi-2D perovskites have so far remained elusive at ambient conditions. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature cavity exciton-polariton condensation in mechanically exfoliated crystals of the quasi-2D Ruddlesden-Popper iodide perovskite (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 in an open optical microcavity. We observe a polariton condensation threshold of 0.41 µJ cm−2 per pulse and detect a strong non-linear response.

 Cells regulate processes through protein interaction networks. Most chemically induced dimerization (CID) systems respond to exogenous molecules, limiting integration with endogenous signaling. Here, we repurpose nuclear receptor (NR) ligand-binding domains (LBDs) and coactivators to develop hormone- or clinically approved drug-responsive CIDs. Using the LBDs of TRβ, VDR, RARγ, ERβ, and GR2 with a TIF2 coactivator peptide, we constructed CIDs responsive to triiodothyronine, vitamin D, retinoic acid, estrogen, cortisol, and their antagonists. These CIDs enable two-input transcriptional switches for gene regulation. Furthermore, we design hormone-responsive liquid-liquid phase-separated (LLPS) condensates that strongly amplify transcription when exceeding a critical interaction threshold. These functional LLPS condensates provide a tunable platform for transcriptional control with up to several hundred-fold activation. Our findings offer an approach for integrating synthetic biology with physiological signaling, advancing applications in gene circuits, biosensing, and therapeutics through ligand-controlled LLPS formation.

Beyond substitution, demand reduction and circularity are key to mitigating both impacts. 
 Plastics are a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss, with packaging accounting for around 40% of European plastic production. Bio-based plastics are often promoted as a climate-friendly alternative, yet their broader environmental implications remain unclear. Here, we conduct a harmonized life cycle assessment of fossil- and bio-based plastic packaging, integrating end-of-life fate and plastic leakage. We find that while bio-based plastics reduce greenhouse gas emissions, they increase ecosystem damage, primarily driven by land use. At the product level, outcomes are sensitive to feedstock origin and waste management. When mismanaged, environmentally persistent bio-based plastics contribute substantially to ecosystem damage. Scaling scenarios for Europe show that even complete substitution with bio-based plastics cannot offset the environmental burden of continued demand growth. Only strong demand-side measures, particularly demand reduction and improved circularity, can mitigate trade-offs across climate change and biodiversity, calling for a shift from material substitution to systemic interventions in production and consumption.

 Computer models are indispensable tools for understanding the Earth system. While high-resolution operational models have achieved many successes, they exhibit persistent biases, particularly in simulating extreme events and statistical distributions. In contrast, coarse-grained idealized models isolate fundamental processes and can be precisely calibrated to excel in characterizing specific dynamical and statistical features. However, different models remain siloed by disciplinary boundaries. By leveraging the complementary strengths of models of varying complexity, we develop an explainable AI framework for Earth system emulators. It bridges the model hierarchy through a reconfigured latent data assimilation technique, uniquely suited to exploit the sparse output from the idealized models. The resulting bridging model inherits the high resolution and comprehensive variables of operational models while achieving global accuracy enhancements through targeted improvements from idealized models. Crucially, the mechanism of AI provides a clear rationale for these advancements, moving beyond black-box correction to physically insightful understanding in a computationally efficient framework that enables effective physics-assisted digital twins and uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate its power by significantly correcting biases in CMIP6 simulations of El Niño spatiotemporal patterns, leveraging statistically accurate idealized models.

 Stable isotopes are widely used to investigate plant-water interactions, yet many studies report differences in deuterium (δ2H) ratios between plants and source waters (termed δ2H offsets). These δ2H offsets challenge the assumption that water uptake and transport in plants do not alter the isotopic composition of water. Here, we develop a conceptual framework that distinguishes three soil water pools and two plant water pools based on water potential. We synthesize data from 110 published studies across 212 field sites worldwide and reanalyze 6333 δ2H offset measurements using possible source water lines. We find that δ2H offsets are absent when using appropriate water pools (e.g., use sap flow water rather than bulk xylem tissue water to represent plant water), with mean offsets not statistically different from zero. We argue that accurately separating correct water pools from bulk water pools in soils and plants is key to reconciling the observed δ2H offsets.

 Global heavy metal(loid) (HM) pollution in soils threatens food security and human health, yet HM mobility—governed by chemical fractions—remains poorly understood at large scales. Here we develop an eXtreme Gradient Boosting model for classifying soil HM dominant fractions using a globally compiled dataset of 9489 field observations. We show that organic carbon and pH positively affect high-mobility of HMs in soil. Using mercury as a case study, we identify both known and previously unreported high-mobility hotspots. The global map indicates that mercury has high mobility across 17.85% of global regions. Combining population and cropland distribution maps with model predictions shows that an estimated 15.1 million people and 100.9 million hectares of farmland are situated in high-mobility regions, with Asia being disproportionately impacted.

We tested this framework on three simulated and two empirical case studies and found that this method can recover nonlinear biological interactions that produce complex behaviors including chaos and regime shifts. Their forecasting performance is context-dependent, with the best performance on chaotic and oscillating time series. This innovative approach leveraging both ecological theory and data-driven machine learning offers a promising new way to make accurate and useful predictions of ecosystem change. State-space universal dynamic equations can recover nonlinear biological interactions that produce complex behaviors, including chaos and regime shifts, offering a novel way for accurate predictions of ecosystem dynamics."

 Balancing ecosystem service provision with long-term ecosystem stability remains a critical challenge for sustainable land management. Here, we develop a spatial planning framework that integrates ecological resilience—the capacity of an ecosystem to recover from perturbations—with ecosystem services to identify priority areas for ecological restoration. Applying this framework to the Loess Plateau of China, we evaluate three management strategies—Service Priority, Balanced Priority, and Resilience Priority—to delineate restoration priorities. Our results indicate that ecosystem services have generally improved from 2000 to 2020, while resilience exhibits a turning point, shifting from an increasing to a declining trend. Spatial overlay analyses further show that areas with enhanced ecosystem service supply coincide with declining resilience, indicating a spatial mismatch between service gains and resilience loss. The three prioritization scenarios produce distinct spatial patterns, highlighting the importance of balanced strategies that reconcile short-term service gains with long-term ecosystem resilience to inform sustainable restoration and land management. Areas with increasing ecosystem service supply from 2000 to 2020 spatially overlap with declining resilience in the Loess Plateau, revealing mismatches between service gains and resilience losses, based on a multi-scenario spatial prioritization framework."

 Microvibrations degrade the geometric quality of optical Earth observation satellite imagery by introducing intra-scene spatial distortions, necessitating robust detection and compensation strategies. Like many optical Earth observation satellites, the Sustainable Development Goals Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1) faces similar challenges. To address this, this paper presented a novel microvibration detection and compensation framework based on line-by-line bundle adjustment for SDGSAT-1. By minimizing directionally weighted residuals of a modified rigorous imaging model—constructed from tie points (TPs) and virtual ground control points—the framework enabled high-temporal-resolution estimation of microvibrations, parameterized through the discrete attitude microvibration model, via least-squares optimization. A new sensitivity indicator was also proposed to evaluate the adequacy of the weighting scheme for microvibration detection during optimization and to guide the dynamic adjustment of TP weights. Applied to SDGSAT-1 data, the method successfully characterized microvibrations at 1.0 Hz in the along-track direction and 0.4 Hz in the cross-track direction for the first time. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed framework effectively suppressed microvibration-induced geometric distortions, consistently outperforming both raw imagery and classical approaches: it achieved a 33.16% reduction in RMSE compared to uncorrected data and improved cross-track precision by 27.82% over the conventional method. The impact of charge-coupled devices operating at heterogeneous imaging speeds was evaluated, with results showing no significant degradation in detection performance. These results validated the framework's effectiveness in enhancing geometric accuracy through robust microvibration modeling and compensation."

 Remote sensing (RS) soil moisture (SM) retrievals are frequently assimilated into land surface models (LSMs) to enhance their overall performance. However, uncertainty in LSM parameterization limits the capacity of current models to accurately capture the coupling strengths between SM and hydrological fluxes. This limitation reduces the effectiveness of SM data assimilation (DA) in improving estimates of key fluxes such as evapotranspiration (ET) and streamflow. Here, we introduce an improved SM DA framework with the optimization of LSM coupling strengths between SM and fluxes. Specifically, the SM DA framework is developed based on the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. The model first calibrates the SM-ET and SM-runoff coupling strengths using RS data to enhance its physical consistency and representation of land surface processes. Subsequently, RS SM retrievals are assimilated into the calibrated VIC model using the Ensemble Kalman Filter to improve ET and streamflow simulations. Results indicate that the developed SM DA framework enhances DA efficiency, with SM correlation increasing from 0.45 to 0.49. It also enhances hydrological flux simulations, increasing ET correlation from 0.77 to 0.80 and improving the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency for streamflow from 0.21 to 0.71, relative to the default VIC scheme. These improvements are especially evident in (sub-)humid regions, where the VIC model's runoff generation mechanism – based on saturation-excess processes – is well suited to representing local hydrological processes. Overall, the calibration of coupling strengths within LSMs offers a promising pathway to enhance hydrological fluxes simulation through land DA."

 Recent and upcoming carbon satellites, such as the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 (OCO-3) and the Copernicus Anthropogenic Carbon Dioxide Monitoring Mission (CO2M), offer unprecedented opportunities for top-down estimation of urban CO2 emissions. Their observations, i.e., 80×80 km2 Snapshot Area Map (SAM) for OCO-3 and 250 km wide swath for CO2M, enable the detection of urban emissions in a single pass. However, accurately identifying urban plumes remains challenging due to their broad spatial extent, low signal-to-noise ratio, and substantial data gaps in quality-filtered XCO2 snapshots. To address these challenges, we propose a Transformer-based deep learning (DL) model for XCO2 interpolation and plume detection. Our approach uses masked pre-training on synthetic CO2M data to learn spatial dependencies and emission-related structures of XCO2 values before fine-tuning for plume detection tasks. Experimental results on synthetic datasets show that the model reconstructs XCO2 with mean absolute errors below the instrumental noise and achieves stable plume detection performance across noise levels. It improves XCO2 gap-filling accuracy especially under regional and swath-missing conditions and significantly outperforms test- and wind-based methods in plume region segmentation accuracy. We further validated the model using 110 SAMs from 39 cities observed by OCO-3, integrating it into a lightweight inversion workflow. The resulting top-down emission estimates show improved consistency with bottom-up inventories compared to baselines (R2 = 0.61, total relative deviation = −0.10), and the city-level aggregation reproduces the bottom-up emission rankings with a Pearson’s r of 0.90. These results confirm the transferability and practical utility of our approach across global cities. This study presents a promising approach for reconstructing and detecting urban emission signals from XCO2 snapshots, demonstrating clear potential to support the next-generation carbon monitoring satellites."

 Accurate Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) with high spatiotemporal resolution is essential for hydrological modeling and agricultural applications. The Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) provides quasi-global SSM with relatively high temporal resolution, while its coarse spatial resolution limits regional usability. This study proposed a novel approach to generate daily continuous quasi-global SSM at 500-m resolution by integrating CYGNSS observations with optical imagery, without relying on in-situ SSM inputs. The method includes: (1) reconstruction of daily Surface Reflectivity (SR) using the Previously-Observed Behavior Interpolation (POBI) algorithm and retrieval of 9-km SSM via a modified Reflectivity-Vegetation-Roughness (R-V-R) model; (2) constructing a direct relationship between SSM and optical reflectance using the enhanced OPtical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM) as the foundational basis for subsequent downscaling process; (3) downscale coarse-resolution CYGNSS SSM using the Bayesian algorithm without requiring any in-situ SSM observations as inputs. The framework is applied over August 2019–2022 and validated against in-situ SSM from 194 International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) sites across diverse climate and land cover conditions. Results show improved spatial detail while maintaining accuracy, with a mean unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) of 0.061 cm3/cm3 and a positive GDOWN value of 0.017, indicating effective SSM downscaling. In addition, the proposed method outperforms both Linear and Random Forest models while maintaining robust performance. Overall, it offers a scalable solution for generating high-resolution, daily SSM products directly from satellite data."

 Remote sensing image change detection is critical for monitoring earth surface dynamics. Although deep learning has significantly improved change detection performance, traditional and existing deep super-resolution techniques for cross-resolution change detection often assume bi-temporal images share the same resolution, at least in the training phase. They also suffer from limitations including dependency on expensive high-resolution paired training data, suboptimal performance transfer from super-resolution to change detection accuracy, and heavy reliance on extensive pixel-level annotations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual pixel-level and subpatch-level network with cross-temporal super resolution (DPSNet) for change detection across spatial resolutions. Our method DPSNet, comprises two core components: 1) a Reference Image-Guided Generative Adversarial Network (RefIGM GAN) for cross-temporal super resolution; and 2) a Semi-supervised Dual-Path Network (SDNet) for pixel-level and subpatch-level change detection. A resource-efficient alternating optimization strategy is employed between RefIGM GAN and SDNet, creating a virtuous cycle in which super-resolution improves detection accuracy, and detection results optimize super-resolution reconstruction. Experiments were conducted on three datasets, i.e., CDD, SYSU, and HTCD, each characterized by distinct resolution variations. The CDD and SYSU datasets include bi-temporal images with 4 × and 8 × resolution differences, respectively, while the HTCD dataset contains both satellite and UAV imagery with inherent resolution disparities. The results demonstrate that by integrating reference-guided super resolution and semi-supervised learning, effective cross-resolution change detection can be achieved with only limited high-resolution data and pixel-level labels, showing great practical significance in scenarios where solely low-resolution historical images are available.

 Accurate in-season crop yield prediction is important for farm management, insurance planning, and food security decision making. Many studies have proposed different models and data sources, but their findings are difficult to compare because they focus on different crops, regions, spatial scales, prediction months, and evaluation metrics. This review presents a structured synthesis of in-season crop yield prediction studies and to identify key gaps that limit early and reliable prediction. We conducted a systematic literature review following a defined protocol. We searched multiple databases using targeted search strings, and screened studies using clear inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eligible studies focused on corn, soybean, or winter wheat, were published between 2014 and 2025, and predicted crop yield during the growing season. Review papers were excluded. This process identified 170 studies, of which 55 were retained for detailed analysis. For each selected study, we extracted information on modeling approach, input data sources, prediction lead time, spatial scale, and reported evaluation metrics. We synthesized results across three main model types, machine learning models, process-based crop models, and statistical models. This review addresses five research questions: (1) What modeling approaches are most commonly used for in-season crop yield prediction, and how do their predictive performances compare? (2) What input data sources and feature types are most frequently used, and how do they influence prediction accuracy? (3) What prediction lead times are most commonly used for major crops, and how does lead time affect model performance? (4) What are the main challenges and limitations in current in-season crop yield prediction studies? (5) What methodological and data-driven strategies can improve future in-season crop yield predictions? The reviewed literature shows that no single approach consistently outperforms others across all conditions. Model performance depends strongly on data quality, crop type, and regional conditions, with common limitations related to data gaps, cloud contamination in satellite imagery, and limited model interpretability."

 Terrace construction is a crucial human intervention for improving slope productivity and preventing soil erosion, especially in low-latitude hilly regions with heavy and concentrated rainfall. However, existing terrace mapping methods perform poorly in such areas. In this study, we generated the first high-resolution (0.9 m) terrace distribution map for low-latitude hilly regions by integrating deep learning with slope-area threshold denoising.

 Multi-category synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ship detection is limited by heterogeneity in imaging mechanisms and severe class imbalance, yielding accurate localization but frequent misclassification. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Knowledge Fusion and Imbalance-Aware Network (KFIA-Net). Specifically, we first propose a Domain Knowledge Feature Extraction (DKFE) to extract and encode knowledge tokens from four priors. Second, a Knowledge Cross-Attention Fusion (KCAF) module is designed to perform interpretable and sparsely selectable channel modulation using cross-attention and FiLM decoding. Thirdly, we further design an Imbalance-Aware Loss Function (IALF) that combines prior calibration, minority category margin expansion, and knowledge-consistency weighting to reduce loss bias. Finally, systematic experiments and comparisons are conducted on three datasets: SRSDD-v1.0, FAIR-CSAR-v1.0, and NUDT-SARship-v1.0.

Results reveal persistent subsidence in low-elevation and reclaimed zones (∼-5 mm/yr) with localized uplift (∼+1.5 mm/yr), affecting major airports, subway segments, and highways. Fifty-year projections indicate high angular distortion probabilities (0.6–0.8), with economic exposure estimated at ∼$8.20 billion for ∼ 6.1 km of subway lines and ∼$10.54 billion for ∼ 7.8 km of highways exceeding –2 mm/yr. Despite their limited spatial extent, these segments represent a disproportionately large share of total exposure. The findings emphasize the need for continuous monitoring, proactive mitigation, and targeted investment, highlighting the value of integrating geodetic data with probabilistic modeling to address subsidence and climate-related hazards."

 Domestic cooking is a key contributor to poor indoor air quality (IAQ) and one of the most significant indoor sources of particulate matter, including ultrafine particles (UFPs). Since cooking forms an essential part of domestic life, cost-effective active abatement strategies are necessary to improve IAQ. Increasing the ventilation rate by natural or mechanical means will reduce cooking related UFP concentrations but can lead to domestic heat loss: this represents an IAQ and energy efficiency dichotomy. In this study a specialist test facility is used to explore this dichotomy during short-duration cooking activities replicated under different ventilation scenarios, both related to natural and mechanical ventilation in the kitchen, and the relationship between ventilation and airflow around the home more generally. We relate our results to the recently introduced World Health Organization (WHO) good practice statement on UFPs to determine good IAQ. Energy penalties associated with heat loss are calculated to determine which combinations of behavioural and technological interventions can best balance the competing demands of good IAQ and energy efficiency. It was seen that IAQ benefits were achieved at little detriment to energy efficiency. For natural ventilation, behavioural interventions such as opening windows for 20 min yielded significant IAQ benefits, reducing UFPs from peak values by 86 %. Similarly, 20 min of mechanical extract ventilation operation yielded IAQ benefits, reducing UFPs from peak values by 94 %. However, in all ventilation scenarios UFPs remained above the WHO good practice high threshold for ∼1 h. All mechanical extract ventilation scenarios resulted in lower energy penalties than for natural ventilation. Our experiments also show that airflow within the house is important to consider when looking at the IAQ and energy efficiency dichotomy. Whilst results are primarily concerned with managing IAQ and energy efficiency under domestic cooking scenarios, there are wider implications for balancing IAQ and energy efficiency, which have increasing importance in light of management of the COVID-19 and energy crises and future policy, such as the Future Homes Standard."

 There is a body of evidence on the risk to human health posed by the exposure to desert dust. However, results from epidemiological studies from different regions are inconsistent. Among possible causes of inconsistency is the scarcity of daily desert dust contributions to PM10 and PM2.5 levels recorded in populated areas in order to conduct rigorous epidemiological studies, but also the lack of robust and harmonized methodologies to deliver airborne desert-dust concentrations. This study evaluated the performance of the main statistical methods currently used by European countries to estimate the net load of desert dust on PM10 and PM2.5 levels during the occurrence of desert dust outbreaks. To this end, long-term data series (2010–2023) on PM10 and PM2.5 levels and composition obtained in a regional background (Montseny) and an urban background (Barcelona) monitoring site, in Northeast Spain, were used. The results identify the most appropriate method for determining the regional daily PM10 background concentration, excluding dust-days. This involves applying a moving 50th percentile with a 30-day time window to data from nearby regional background environments. Such PM10 background is essential for calculating the daily net dust contribution (PM10 net-dust). However, applying this procedure to data from urban or industrial environments causes an overestimation of PM10 net-dust values, which intensifies with higher local PM10 levels. On the other hand, in the case of low PM10 net-dust values(<3 μg m−3) the relative errors are so high that it is not advisable to use these estimates of natural PM contributions to assess compliance with air quality standards. For PM2.5, however, the mineral dust content is much lower than for PM10. Consequently, applying the same methodology results in significantly greater relative errors in the PM2.5 net-dust estimates. In this case, it is also advisable to use PM2.5 data series obtained in regional background environments. However, if nearby regional background data is not available, the method can be applied directly to the evaluated urban or industrial datasets, but excluding traffic and industrial hotspots for the calculation of the PMnet-dust. In conclusion, accurately quantifying PMnet-dust is a complex issue, and it is necessary to continue improving current methods and developing new methods that allow for the most accurate estimation possible of daily desert dust contributions, especially for the low concentration ranges and for finer PM size fractions. The methodologies reported here are applicable to all regions affected by desert dust."

 Aerosols, one of the principal atmospheric pollutants, are receiving significant attention from the scientific community due to their impact on human health and climate. Despite the carcinogenicity of PAHs, the contributions of their sources to the urban atmosphere remain unclear. The present study examines the molecular distribution and source indices of various non-polar organic compounds, including n-alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), hopanes, and steranes, in PM10 samples collected in Daejeon, South Korea, from 15 April to 22 May 2013 using the thermal desorption gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (TD-GC/MS). The molecular distribution of n-alkanes was characterized by the predominance of C29, followed by C27. The total concentrations of n-alkanes exhibited strong positive correlations with elemental carbon (EC) and potassium ion (K+), indicating a significant contribution from fossil fuel combustion and biomass-burning sources. Among the PAHs, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene (IcdP) and dibenzo[a,h]anthracene (DahA) were the most prevalent compounds. The dominant hopanoid hydrocarbon was 17a(H),21b(H)-hopane (30ab), while 17b(H),21a(H)-hopane (30ba) was least abundant. During the sampling period, sterane compounds exhibited a higher concentration of C27 compared to C29. Based on the diagnostic ratios and source-specific markers, the present study revealed that coal combustion, biomass burning, and vehicular emissions were predominant sources of PAHs during spring. Positive matrix factorisation (PMF) analysis showed that in Daejeon, total PAHs were mainly from biomass and coal combustion (74%), followed by vehicle emissions (14%) and natural gas combustion (12%). Further, an inverse relationship has been found between PAH concentrations and air temperature; i.e., higher levels of PAHs correspond to lower temperatures, which could have significant implications for air quality and public health. The findings of this study offer valuable insights into the sources of organic compounds, which are highly carcinogenic, and can inform policymakers in developing effective air quality monitoring and mitigation strategies."

 This study evaluates the performance and associated uncertainties in Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model-simulated drop size distribution (DSD) using three microphysics schemes—Thompson aerosol-aware (Thompson), WDM6, and Morrison—across 138 rainfall events in eastern and southern China. Ground-based disdrometer observations were used to assess model performance under varying rain rates, precipitation types, and regional climates. Unlike prior single-event evaluations, this multi-station, multi-scheme analysis provides a comprehensive assessment of model biases and spread in key precipitation relationships, including the normalized intercept parameter versus mass-weighted mean diameter (log10Nw–Dm), Dm versus rain rate (Dm–R), radar reflectivity versus rain rate (Z–R), and rainfall kinetic energy density versus rain rate (KEv–R). Results show that WRF simulations exhibited systematic overestimations of Dm and underestimations of log10Nw, which propagated to biases in Z and KEv, with deviations up to 25% and 50%, respectively, under high rain rates. Among the schemes, Morrison outperformed other schemes for stratiform rain, while Thompson better captured convective events. Regional variability further modulated performance: Changchun's frontal systems and Xiamen's maritime climate induced distinct microphysical biases. These findings offer novel insights into microphysics scheme behavior and its cascading impacts on radar-based rainfall retrievals and hydrological modeling. The results highlight the need for integrating observational datasets and applying region-specific calibrations to improve DSD simulations in data-scarce regions."
