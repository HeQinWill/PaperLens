10.1088/1748-9326/ae0ae9,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注气候变化对人类风险认知的影响，通过分析142个国家的数据，发现经历过气候相关灾害的人更倾向于认为气候变化是一个非常严重的威胁。研究探讨了不同类型灾害（如热浪、干旱、洪水等）对风险认知的影响，并考察了个人和社会层面的因素如何调节这种影响。虽然论文讨论了气候变化和极端天气事件，但它并没有直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术的关联性较弱。,[],Fabian Dablander,Climate hazard experience linked to increased climate risk perception worldwide,"Climate change is intensifying extreme weather events worldwide. Using nationally representative survey data from 142 countries ( ), I found that people who have experienced a climate-related hazard are more likely to consider climate change a very serious threat than people who have not experienced any hazard within the same country. These effects are consistent across eleven hazard types, with the effect of experiencing a heatwave being comparable in magnitude to that of having a university education. The increase in risk perception among those who have experienced a climate-related hazard does not appear to be clearly amplified or attenuated by a person’s resilience, which is calculated by combining individual, household, community, and societal factors. Large differences in the effects are observed across countries for some hazards (e.g. droughts, heatwaves, and floods), whereas small differences are observed for others (e.g. hurricanes, landslides, and wildfires). At the country level, there does not appear to be an association between the proportion of people exposed to climate-related hazards and the proportion of people who perceive climate change as a threat. These results may help us anticipate public concern in a warming world and suggest promising avenues for future research."

The original aerosol module in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model v2 (E3SMv2) has problems simulating volcanic aerosols. We alter the aerosol module to simulate the 1991 Pinatubo eruption and implement a more complex chemistry scheme, producing results that better agree with observations. Process analyses of the volcanic aerosols help explain how they grow in the stratosphere. 
 Stratospheric sulfate aerosol produced by volcanic eruptions plays important roles in atmospheric chemistry and the global radiative balance of the atmosphere. The simulation of stratospheric sulfate concentrations and optical properties is highly dependent on the chemistry scheme and microphysical treatment. In this work, we implemented a sophisticated gas-phase chemistry scheme (full chemistry, FC) and a 5-mode version of the Modal Aerosol Module with Prognostic Stratospheric Aerosol (MAM5-PSA) for the interactive treatment of stratospheric sulfate aerosol in the Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 2 (E3SMv2) model to better simulate the chemistry-aerosol feedback following the Pinatubo eruption, and to compare it against a simulation using simplified chemistry (SC) and the default 4-mode version of the Modal Aerosol Module (MAM4). MAM5-PSA experiments were found to better capture the stratospheric sulfate burden from the eruption of the volcano to the end of 1992 as compared to the High-resolution Infrared Sounder (HIRS) observations, and the formation of sulfate in MAM5-PSA with FC (with an additional OH replenishment reaction) was significantly faster than in MAM4 with FC. Analyses of microphysical processes indicate that more sulfate aerosol mass was generated in total in FC experiments than in SC experiments. MAM5-PSA performs better than MAM4 in simulation of aerosol optical depth (AOD); AOD anomalies from the MAM5-PSA experiment have better agreement with observations. The simulated largest changes in global mean net radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere following the eruption were about −3 W m−2 in MAM5-PSA experiments and roughly −1.5 W m−2 in MAM4 experiments."

This study explores how nitrogen oxide emissions from African soils, especially in dry regions, contribute to atmospheric pollution. By using a climate-chemistry model, we show that considering these emissions improves predictions of nitrogen dioxide, nitric acid and ozone, although some discrepancies remain compared to observations. 
 In the context of climate change and increasing anthropogenic pressures in Africa, understanding the interactions between atmospheric chemistry, regional climate, and biogeochemical cycles is critical. This study investigates the potential role of biogenic nitric oxide emissions from African soils (BioNO), particularly in arid and semi-arid ecosystems, as major contributors to atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations and regional atmospheric chemistry. To this end, we rely on a modelling approach based on the RegCM5 regional climate model, including an updated atmospheric chemistry module and, amongst other, a specific parametrization for BioNO emissions. Throughout the paper, the performances of the model are evaluated  against various datasets, including in-situ observations from the INDAAF network and chemical reanalyses. Sensitivity studies  demonstrate that integrating BioNO emissions into the model enhances the accuracy of simulated NO2, nitric acid (HNO3), and ozone (O3) seasonal cycles and surface concentrations, and reduces simulated biases compared to ground based observations. Despite these improvements, notable discrepancies still exist, in particular between simulated surface ozone concentrations and in-situ measurements. Similar biases are also observed in a chemical reanalysis model and in a state-of-the-art chemistry transport model used for comparison. In addition to highlighting the impact and added value of including BioNO fluxes in regional atmospheric chemistry models, our findings also highlight the suitability of the RegCM5 coupled system for studying regional climate, chemistry and nitrogen cycle interactions over Africa."
10.5194/acp-25-12213-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文分析了热带对流层顶（TTL）的温度变化趋势，该区域是大气层中对流层向平流层过渡的关键区域。研究使用了探空仪、卫星数据（GNSS-RO）以及再分析数据集（ERA5、JRA-3Q、MERRA-2）的数据，发现1980年至2001年TTL温度呈下降趋势，而2002年至2023年则呈上升趋势。这些变化与大气环流的变化有关，并影响进入平流层的水汽含量。研究结果表明，大约在2000年左右，控制TTL温度的主导机制发生了转变，从2000年之前由消耗臭氧层物质引起的动力变化转变为2000年之后由温室气体引起的辐射增温，并伴随一些动力因素的影响。这项研究对于理解气候变化以及平流层水汽的长期变化趋势具有重要意义。,"['Tropopause temperature trends', 'Radiosonde data', 'Satellite observations (GNSS-RO)', 'Reanalysis datasets (ERA5, JRA-3Q, MERRA-2)', 'Atmospheric circulation', 'Stratospheric water vapour', 'Ozone-depleting substances', 'Greenhouse gases']",Mona Zolghadrshojaee;Susann Tegtmeier;Sean M. Davis;Robin Pilch Kedzierski;Leopold Haimberger,"Shift in cold-point tropopause trends derived from radiosonde, satellite and reanalysis data","The tropical tropopause layer (TTL) is a crucial region where the troposphere transitions into the stratosphere, influencing air mass transport. This study examines temperature trends in the TTL and lower stratosphere using data from weather balloons, satellites and reanalysis datasets. We found cooling trends in the TTL from 1980 to 2001, followed by warming from 2002 to 2023. These shifts are linked to changes in atmospheric circulation and impact water vapour transport into the stratosphere. 
 The tropical tropopause layer is the transition region between the well-mixed convective troposphere and the radiatively controlled stratosphere and plays a crucial role in air mass transport between these layers. In this paper, we present updated trends of tropopause and lower stratospheric temperature from radiosondes, GNSS-RO data, and the reanalyses ERA5, JRA-3Q and MERRA-2. Given its importance in determining the concentration of water vapour entering the stratosphere, we focus on temperature trends at the cold-point tropopause (CPT), which we determined from radiosonde observations after correcting for time-varying biases.Radiosonde and GNSS-RO data show a significant shift from strong cold-point cooling for 1980–2001 to warming for 2002–2023. Reanalysis datasets reproduce the robust change in the tropical tropopause temperature trends and furthermore show opposite trends in tropical upwelling for 1980–2001 compared to 2002–2023, consistent with the cold-point and lower stratosphere temperature changes. The shift in cold-point temperature trends around 2000 suggests a regime shift in the dominant mechanism controlling CPT temperatures, from ozone-depleting substance-induced dynamical changes before 2000 to greenhouse-gas-induced radiative warming with some dynamical contributions after 2000. While the role of dynamical changes after 2000 is not completely clear, this regime shift suggests that in the absence of strong dynamically induced cooling trends, radiative warming could dominate the cold-point temperature trends and thus stratospheric water vapour entry values."

We report growth rates for 14 experiments between −5.1 °C and −8.3 °C and observe strong variations depending on the cloud characteristics. Comparing our growth rates to laboratory data, we found similar temperature-dependent trends, but the laboratory rates are higher. These data fill the gap in quantitative in situ observation of ice crystal growth, helping to validate models and laboratory experiments. 
 Ice crystals are essential in the evolution of mixed-phase clouds, as ice crystals can quickly grow to large sizes by vapor diffusion and thereby trigger precipitation formation. Vapor diffusional growth rates of ice crystals were quantitatively studied in the laboratory for several decades, forming the basis of various ice crystal growth models. Since field measurements generally only provide snapshots that lack information on ice crystal age or changes induced by cloud processes, significant gaps remain in quantitative field observations, impeding the validation of laboratory experiments and models.Our study addresses this gap through innovative glaciogenic cloud seeding experiments in persistent low-level stratus clouds in the CLOUDLAB project.  The controllability and repeatability of our seeding experiments facilitates the quantification of diffusional ice crystal growth rates in natural clouds via in situ measurements. We report growth rates of 0.17–0.81 µm s−1 (major axis of pristine ice crystals) from 14 seeding experiments between −5.1 and −8.3 °C. We also observe how microphysical characteristics induce strong variations in the growth rates, e.g., reduced growth rates in seeding-induced regions of high ice crystal number concentrations. For better comparison to laboratory and non-seeded clouds, we developed two filtering methods to isolate growth conditions less affected by the experimental setup. The comparison shows that the temperature-dependent growth rate variations align with laboratory data, whereas absolute laboratory values are higher. Our findings provide valuable insights into the vapor diffusional growth of ice crystals in natural clouds and connect in situ observations with laboratory and modeling studies."

Jones;Thomas Röckmann,Amazon rainforest ecosystem exchange of CO2 and H2O through turbulent understory ejections,"Understory ejections are distinct turbulent features emerging in prime tall-forest ecosystems. We share a method to isolate understory ejections based on H2O–CO2 anomaly quadrants. From these, we calculate the flux contributions of understory ejections and all flux quadrants. In addition, we show that a distinctly depleted isotopic composition can be found in the ejected water vapour. Finally, we explored the role of clouds as a potential trigger for understory ejections. 
 We investigate the role of short-term variability in the mean ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide and water vapour. Specifically, we focus on quantifying how the intermittent turbulent exchange at the forest–atmosphere interface  –  characterised by sweeps, ejections, and outward/inward interactions  –  contributes to the mean exchange. To this end, we analyse observations of high-resolution (isotopic) flux measurements taken at 25 m above the forest canopy at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO) during the dry season. We identify short-term turbulent eddies that eject carbon dioxide and water vapour from the understory (0–15 m) into the atmosphere. The H2O ejected from the understory is shown to be depleted in deuterium (2H) by 10 ‰ compared to H2O originating from the top canopy. We show that this matches the depleted water isotopic compositions found in understory leaf and soil samples. The diurnal cycle of the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 is presented as a function of the sweeping and ejection motions and understory flux contributions. Understory contributions average 1.4 % of NEE, but they can reach up to 20 %. In exploring the connection between intermittent canopy turbulence and cloud passages, we found a weak relationship (r=0.027) between cloud passages and ejections, without a predominant influence of large clouds. These findings deepen our understanding of the gas exchange of the Amazon rainforest, which may ultimately allow decision-makers to incorporate policies that can prevent the region's transition from a carbon sink to a source."

 In this work, glutamic acid (Glu) was selected as a model amino acid (AA) to investigate its complexation with Fe(III) and Fe(II), focusing on its impact on the Fenton reaction and the photolysis of Fe(III) in the cloud aqueous phase. Glu was found to enhance the rate constant for the reaction of Fe(II)–Glu with H2O2 to 1.54 ± 0.13 × 104 M−1 s−1, which is significantly higher than that of classic Fenton reactions (∼ 50–70 M−1 s−1). In contrast, the photolysis quantum yield of the Fe(III)–Glu complex was determined to be 0.037 under solar-simulated irradiation, largely lower than Fe(III)–hydroxy complexes (0.216). In the overall process (Fenton or Fe(III) photolysis), it was found that •OH formation decreased in the presence of Glu. Additionally, the fate of Glu in the presence of Fe(III) was investigated as well as the oxidation process (driven by •OH and ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) reaction), which led to the formation of short-chain carboxylic acids and ammonium under simulated solar light. Interestingly, these two processes generated different primary short-chain carboxylic acids, indicating distinct mechanisms. This study provides valuable insights into the role and fate of amino acids in atmospheric chemistry, helping to further understand their impact on atmospheric processes."

We found that criteria using fixed thresholds or monthly average-based thresholds were more suitable for identifying ODEs than the others. Applying a threshold that varies with the monthly average or stricter fixed thresholds also indicated a more significant reduction in ODE occurrences. 
 Tropospheric ozone depletion events (ODEs) occurring in the Arctic spring are a unique photochemical phenomenon in which the boundary layer ozone drops rapidly to near-zero levels. However, the criterion for identifying ODEs remains inconsistent among different studies, which may influence conclusions regarding the characteristics of ODEs. To address this issue, in this study, we applied various criteria used in previous studies to identify springtime ODEs at Utqiaġvik, Arctic (the BRW Station), based on observational data spanning 23 years (2000–2022), and investigated the influence of implementing different criteria. We compared three types of criteria: traditional methods (fixed thresholds), variability-based methods (considering the mean value and standard deviation), and machine learning methods (Isolation Forest), and we found that criteria using fixed thresholds (e.g., 10 ppbv) and relative thresholds based on monthly averaged ozone levels (0.42 times the monthly average) are more suitable for capturing ODEs at BRW compared to other criteria. Results applying these appropriate criteria reveal a significant decline in ODE occurrence frequency over the investigated 23 years, particularly in April, suggesting potential links to climate change and Arctic sea ice melting. However, implementing relative thresholds or more stringent fixed thresholds (5 and 4 ppbv) instead of the 10 ppbv threshold reveals a more significant decline in the number of ODE hours across these 23 years.  Further investigation of meteorological conditions indicates that ODEs at BRW are more prevalent under northerly and northeasterly winds with moderate wind speeds (3–6 m s−1), at lower temperatures and higher pressures, while severe ODEs are more associated with lower wind speeds and temperatures below 256 K. This research highlights the importance of selecting appropriate criteria to accurately identify ODEs and contributes to a better understanding of the complex processes driving the Arctic ODEs."

Here we report on the development of a fully automated aerosol mass spectrometer for this project. We present technical specifications, necessary modifications for the automation, instrument calibration and comparisons, detection limits, and the first in-flight data. 
 In this study, we present a fully automated aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) that is operated during regular passenger aircraft flights in the CARIBIC (Civil Aircraft for the Regular Investigation of the Atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container) module of the European Research Infrastructure IAGOS (In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System – https://www.iagos.org/, last access: 20 September 2025). The instrument, termed CARIBIC-AMS, is able to measure the mass concentration of non-refractory aerosol species, namely sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and organics, in a particle diameter range of approximately 50–800 nm. The main challenge was the mechanical and electrical redesign of a commercial instrument in order to comply with the operating and safety requirements in the IAGOS-CARIBIC container-laboratory before and during flight. In the container-laboratory, the instrument has to operate fully autonomously, typically during four consecutive long-haul flights of 10 h. The CARIBIC-AMS weighs 74 kg, has a volume of 0.16 m3, and consumes 360 W of electrical power during regular operation. Due to the short time for evacuation of the vacuum chamber to sufficiently low pressures before measurement, detection limits are higher during regular flights than during ground operation and were determined to be 0.035 µg m−3 for sulfate, 0.055 µg m−3 for nitrate, 0.69 µg m−3 for organics, 0.38 µg m−3 for ammonium, and 0.022 µg m−3 for chloride (all at STP), for a time resolution of 30 s. These values represent typical averages under flight conditions and refer to a collection efficiency of 0.5. Since the IAGOS-CARIBIC project aims for climatological, regular, long-term data, longer data averaging times are possible, thereby lowering the detection limits by the square root of the number of averaged data points. Data validation, calibration, and instrument characterization were conducted by means of laboratory-based comparisons with existing established aerosol mass spectrometers. Here we report on the details of the automation and the instrument characterization, as well as first in-flight data measured in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere during two IAGOS-CARIBIC flights and during the TPEx (Tropopause Composition Gradients and Small-scale Mixing Experiment) field campaign, conducted in 2024 using a Learjet as research aircraft over northern Europe."

Cooper;Pavlos Kollias,Vertical wind and drop size distribution retrieval with the CloudCube G-band Doppler radar,"Current knowledge of the link between clouds and climate is limited by a lack of observations of the drop size distribution (DSD) within clouds, especially for the smallest drops. We demonstrate a method of retrieving DSDs down to small drop sizes using observations of drizzling marine layer clouds captured by the CloudCube millimeter-wave Doppler radar. We compare the shape of the observed spectra to theoretical expectations of radar echoes to solve for DSDs at each time step and elevation. 
 Macrophysical properties of clouds are influenced by underlying microphysical processes. In practice, there is often an observational gap in bridging the two. For example, our current understanding of aerosol–cloud interaction and cloud–climate feedback is hindered by a lack of robust measurements of the distribution of drop sizes within clouds, especially for the smallest drop sizes. Doppler radar measurements have proven useful in estimating rainfall drop size distributions (DSDs) but face an intermediate challenge of requiring a correction for the presence of vertical air motion. Recent advances in millimeter-wave technology have made radar measurements at increasingly smaller wavelengths possible, allowing for analysis of particle-size-dependent scattering effects to derive estimates of vertical winds and thereby DSDs. This work demonstrates a method of deriving range-resolved DSDs using Doppler spectra at 238 GHz measured by the CloudCube ground-based G-band atmospheric Doppler radar. The observations utilized are of marine boundary layer clouds during March and April 2023 in La Jolla, CA, USA, taken as part of CloudCube's participation in the Eastern Pacific Cloud Aerosol Precipitation Experiment (EPCAPE) campaign. This method first identifies notches in the velocity spectra and compares them to the theoretical notch velocities predicted by size-dependent backscattering and terminal velocity models to estimate the range-dependent vertical wind. After removing the vertical wind, binned DSDs are retrieved from the zero-wind spectrum. Bulk properties of the precipitation are then derived, including the number concentration, liquid water content, characteristic drop size, and precipitation rate. For the case study presented here, calculated bulk properties are found to be relatively invariant to the forward-model assumptions made in the estimation of the full DSD retrieval. Validation of this method on larger volumes of data would make such retrievals useful tools in assessing physical models of drizzle."

The data can be useful to ecologists, microbiologists, and policymakers regarding microbial distribution, evolution, and biohazard assessment for glacier microbiome under global climate change. 
 Glaciers cover 10 % of Earth's land area and are a pool of carbon and nitrogen for downstream ecosystems. Microbes, including bacteria, fungi, algae, and other microeukaryotes, are the primary inhabitants of glacier ecosystems and are key drivers of carbon and nitrogen transformation. Among them, prokaryotes (including bacteria and archaea) are the most diverse and abundant. Here, we present a dataset of supraglacial bacterial and archaeal (referred to as prokaryotic hereafter) communities across the Antarctic, Arctic, Tibetan Plateau, and other alpine regions. The dataset comprises 2039 amplicon sequencing data points, 999 cultured bacterial genomes, and 208 metagenomes, covering ice, snow, and cryoconite habitats. The dataset contains 64 510 prokaryotic amplicon sequencing phylotypes, with a higher diversity in the Tibetan glaciers than in the Antarctic and Arctic glaciers, which were respectively enriched with Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidota, and Alphaproteobacteria. The dataset also contains 62 595 715 unique genes and 4501 prokaryotic genomes, a 35.5 % expansion from previous publications. Genes were annotated for those associated with carbohydrate-active enzymes, nitrogen cycling, methane cycling, antimicrobial resistance, and microbial virulence, revealing the dynamic microbial functions in glacial habitats. This comprehensive dataset provides standardized prokaryotic diversity, taxonomy, community structure, and genetic functions of glacial microbiomes. The data can be leveraged to elucidate ecological principles governing the distribution of prokaryotes, to gain insights into the key functional genes for supraglacial microbiomes, to build mechanistic models, and to identify any potential biohazards for policymakers to make informed decisions regarding climate change.

To fill this gap, we developed a four-decade seamless global daily 5 km SM product using multi-source datasets and deep learning models. This product has long-term coverage, spatial and temporal integrity, and high accuracy, making it a valuable resource for applications like SM trend analysis, drought monitoring, and assessment of vegetation responses. 
 Soil moisture (SM) data records longer than 30 years are critical for climate change research and various applications. However, only a few such long-term global SM datasets exist, and they often suffer from large biases, low spatial resolution, or spatiotemporal incompleteness. Here, we generated a consistent and seamless global surface SM product (0–5 cm) spanning 1982–2021 using a deep learning (DL) model. The model was trained with the GLASS-MODIS SM product and was designed to integrate four decades of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)-derived albedo and land surface temperature, the land component of the fifth generation of European ReAnalysis (ERA5-Land) SM, and terrain and soil texture datasets as input features. Considering the temporal autocorrelation of SM, we explored two types of DL models that are adept at processing sequential data, including three long short-term memory (LSTM)-based models, i.e., the basic LSTM, bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), and attention-based LSTM (AtLSTM), and a transformer model. We also compared the performance of the DL models with the tree-based eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model, known for its high efficiency and accuracy. Our results show that all four DL models outperformed the benchmark XGBoost model, with the AtLSTM model achieving the highest accuracy on the test set, particularly at high SM levels (>0.4m3m-3). These results suggest that under some challenging conditions, utilizing temporal information and adding an attention module can effectively enhance the estimation accuracy of SM. Subsequent analysis of attention weights revealed that the AtLSTM model could automatically learn the necessary temporal information from adjacent positions in the sequence, which is critical for accurate SM estimation. The best-performing AtLSTM model was then adopted to produce a four-decade seamless global SM dataset at 5 km spatial resolution, denoted as the GLASS-AVHRR SM product. Validation of the GLASS-AVHRR SM product using 45 independent International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) stations prior to 2000 yielded a median correlation coefficient (R) of 0.73 and an unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) of 0.041 m3 m−3. When validated against SM datasets from three post-2000 field-scale COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS) networks, the median R values ranged from 0.63 to 0.79, and the median ubRMSE values ranged from 0.044 to 0.065 m3 m−3.  Further validation across 22 upscaled 9 km Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) core validation sites indicated that it could well capture the temporal variations in measured SM and remained unaffected by the large wet biases present in the input ERA5-Land SM product. Moreover, characterized by complete spatial coverage and low biases, this four-decade, 5 km GLASS-AVHRR SM product exhibited high spatial and temporal consistency with the 1 km GLASS-MODIS SM product and contained much richer spatial details than both the long-term ERA5-Land SM product (0.1°) and European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative combined SM product (0.25°). The annual average GLASS-AVHRR SM dataset from 1982 to 2021 is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14198201 (Zhang et al., 2024b), and the complete product can be freely downloaded from https://glass.hku.hk/archive/SM/AVHRR/ (last access: 18 September 2025)."

Due to complex physical and optical properties, BC remains poorly constrained. We combined satellite observations with physical models to build a daily, high-resolution, decadal global dataset of BC mass, number, size, and mixing details. The data contains both known sources and new hotspots. These results can support climate models, satellite products, and pollution mitigation. 
 Black carbon, a major absorbing component of atmospheric aerosols, plays an important role in climate regulation, air quality, and human health, yet its column concentration and microphysical properties at regional and global scales remains highly uncertain. In this study, we implement an integrated approach that combines multi-angle, multi-band observations from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer with a Mie scattering framework to estimate black carbon column properties including size and mixing state globally on a daily basis. By constraining particle size distributions with absorption aerosol optical depth and single scattering albedo across all four bands, the method simultaneously retrieves number and mass concentrations. Long-term simulations from 2005 to 2020 reveal distinct spatial and temporal patterns, with particularly high levels over biomass burning regions in Africa and South America as well as industrial and urban centers in Asia. Comparisons with ground-based sun photometer measurements and reanalysis data confirm the robustness and accuracy of the estimates. The resulting dataset provides a consistent global record of black carbon column concentrations, offering valuable support for constraining climate models, improving assessments of aerosol radiative forcing, and informing targeted mitigation strategies."

It focuses on Isfahan Province, Iran, and demonstrates substantial improvement over conventional techniques. The deep CNN method showed a 70 % enhancement in subsidence prediction, with the study area experiencing over 38 cm of subsidence between 2014 and 2020. 
 Land subsidence, whether gradual or sudden, poses a significant global threat to infrastructure and the environment. This study introduces a hybrid approach that combines deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PSInSAR) to estimate land subsidence in areas where PSInSAR data are unreliable or sparse. The proposed method trains a deep CNN using subsidence driving forces and PSInSAR data to learn spatial patterns and predict subsidence values. Our evaluation demonstrates that the CNN effectively mitigates discontinuities in PSInSAR results, producing a continuous and reliable subsidence surface. The model's performance was assessed using training, validation, and testing datasets, achieving root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 3.99, 8.47, and 9 mm, respectively. In contrast, traditional interpolation methods such as kriging, inverse distance weighting (IDW), and radial basis function (RBF) interpolation yielded RMSE values of 61.60, 66.21, and 61.76 mm, respectively, on the test dataset. Additionally, the coefficients of determination (R2) for CNN, kriging, IDW, and RBF were 0.98, −0.06, −0.22, and −0.06, respectively. The deep CNN model demonstrated an 85 % improvement in subsidence prediction accuracy compared to conventional interpolation methods, highlighting its potential for accurate and continuous land subsidence estimation."

This study integrates an intermediate-complexity snow-physics scheme into a sea ice model designed for climate applications. We show that modeling the temporal changes in properties such as the density and thermal conductivity of the snow layers leads to a more accurate representation of heat transfer between the underlying sea ice and the atmosphere. 
 Snow plays a crucial role in the formation and sustainability of sea ice. Due to its thermal properties, snow acts as an insulating layer, shielding the ice from the air above. This insulation reduces the heat transfer between the sea ice and the atmosphere. Due to its reflective properties, the snow cover also strongly contributes to albedo over ice-covered regions, which gives it a significant role in the Earth's climate system.Current state-of-art climate models use overly simple representations of the snow cover overlaying the sea ice. The snow cover is often represented with a one-layer scheme, assuming a constant density, no wet or dry metamorphism, or that no liquid water is stored in the snow. Here we implemented an intermediate-complexity snow-physics scheme (ISBA-Explicit Snow) into a sea ice model (SI3), which serves as the sea ice component for upcoming versions of the CNRM-CM climate model. This is, to our knowledge, the first time that a snow model with such a level of complexity has been incorporated into a sea ice model designed for global to regional applications. We validated our model by comparing 1D simulations with data from the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) but also simulations from another advanced snow-on-sea ice model (SnowModel-LG), as well as simulations with the previous SI3 snow scheme.Our model simulates realistic snow thicknesses, densities, and temperatures, aligning well with SHEBA observations and SnowModel-LG outputs, while capturing their temporal variability. We show that the thickness, density, and thermal conductivity of the snowpack are significantly affected by the choices made in parameterization for calculating snowfall density and wind-induced snow compaction and by the choice of the atmospheric forcing. Unlike the previous SI3 snow scheme that assumed constant density and thermal conductivity, our model realistically simulates the evolution of these properties, resulting in more accurate temperatures at the snow–ice interface. Ultimately, our study shows that modeling the temporal changes in the density and thermal conductivity of the snow layers leads to more realistic upper sea ice temperatures and therefore to a more accurate representation of heat transfer between the underlying sea ice and the atmosphere."

To understand how climate change will impact FT, we conducted field monitoring in the Pekerebetsu River basin, Hokkaido, Japan, and calibrated a numerical model to predict FT changes. Field measurements show that erosion and deposition of colluvium depends on local snow cover, because snow insulates the ground when present and greatly reduces FT cycles. We then generalize our results using a calibrated soil temperature equation and climate model scenarios to predict how FT may change under future climate. When snow cover is ignored, FT is predicted to decrease in the study area due to future warming. However, when insulating effects of snow cover are included, the area is predicted to have little change in FT in some places, and potentially large FT increases in other locations.

Furthermore, the presence of the WUI is associated with extended downwind fire heat transport compared to WF and flat terrain scenarios. This study is the first to simulate atmospheric flows near fires in a WUI setting with such high fidelity. The findings highlight the critical role of WUI features in shaping fire‐atmosphere dynamics, though further research is required to disentangle the contributions of individual WUI components to these effects."

Interestingly, an upper stratosphere/lower mesosphere (USLM) disturbance is captured at the beginning of the wind reversal. We find this abnormal zonal wind reversal is related to the enhanced activity of PW2 in the mesosphere by using Modern‐Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 reanalysis data. Further diagnostic analysis suggests that the enhanced planetary waves (PWs) may have developed from the broken PWs during the USLM. Simultaneously, the mesosphere of 30°–40°N contains additional wave sources associated with the baroclinic/barotropic instability. These enhanced PWs eventually cause the wind reversal. Additionally, during the wind reversal, the radar is in the position of constant negative temperature gradient and colder region, favoring the continuation of the wind reversal."

A dedicated parameterization of the deep injection of the plume into the stratosphere ensures a realistic representation when compared to Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer satellite observations. During the first 12 hr of the eruption, on 22 April 2015, SO2 mixing ratio reached 29 ppmv between 15 and 18 km for the first eruption pulse, and 38 ppmv between 12 and 16 km for the second. Most SO2 was injected directly into the stratosphere, with a stratospheric load reaching 308 ktS (kilotons of atomic sulfur, i.e. 616 kilotons of SO2) after the eruption. After 1 month, both stratospheric and tropospheric SO2 loads returned to near‐background levels. During analysis, the chemical conversion of SO2 into H2SO4 removed a part of SO2 from the stratosphere. During the long‐range advection, the co‐location between the subtropical jet stream and the Calbuco plume led to three significant stratospheric intrusions on 24, 26 and 28 April 2015. These events transferred stratospheric SO2 into the troposphere, SO2 mixing ratios in the upper troposphere reaching 15 ppmv, 26 and 15 ppbv, respectively. SO2 is gradually oxidized into H2SO4, with up to 5 ktS of gaseous H2SO4 in the stratosphere on 30 April, but dynamical processes dominate the SO2 atmospheric budget over chemical transformations. This study demonstrates that stratospheric intrusions can play a critical role in the removal of volcanic material from the stratosphere following a major eruption."

One of the goals of TRANS2Am was to study the evolution of ammonia (NH3) in plumes from large animal feeding operations. This work investigates the nearfield deposition of NH3 in four plumes from large animal husbandry facilities observed during TRANS2Am using a mass balance approach with methane (CH4) as a conservative tracer in the timescales of plume transport. Since the plumes in TRANS2Am were not sampled in a pseudo‐Lagrangian manner, an empirical model is developed to correct for variations in summertime NH3 emissions as a function of time of day. The mass balance approach results show that the average summertime NH3 decay time to 80% and 60% against deposition in plumes from large animal sources is 43 (+11/−7) and 85 (+19/−14) min, respectively. Additionally, we present estimates of net fluxes every 5 km downwind of the plume. Under the hot, dry summertime midday conditions sampled during TRANS2Am, we found that within 10–15 km of the large emission sources studied, NH3 undergoes net deposition. Beyond this distance, the complex environmental exchange of NH3 between the atmosphere and the surface suggests that fresh NH3 emissions from smaller nearby sources could switch the direction of the net flux to emission."

This examination utilizes an updraft selection algorithm and statistical analysis of convective updraft characteristics previously developed based on observations of TC rainband convective updrafts. The selected updrafts are collectively analyzed by their spatial frequency, radius, azimuthal location (relative to the environmental 200–850 hPa wind shear and environmental 850 hPa mean flow), structural characteristics, and secondary circulation (radial/vertical) flow pattern. The observed updrafts compare favorably with the simulated updrafts. A wavenumber‐1 asymmetry is found, showing that convective updrafts in the downshear quadrants of the TC are more frequent. The radial flow of updraft circulations aligns with the prevailing vortex‐scale radial flow, which is governed by the environmental shear or low‐level mean flow‐induced asymmetry. Convective‐scale circulations are hypothesized to be significantly influenced by vortex‐scale radial flow at the updraft base and top altitudes. The bottom‐up decay of aging convective updrafts, caused by increased low‐level downdrafts, affects the base altitude and the subsequent radial flow of the updraft circulation. The findings presented in this study support previous literature regarding observed convective‐scale patterns of organized rainband convection in a mature TC."

Using the wet‐bulb globe temperature, we reveal summer CHHEs exhibited consistently increasing trends across the China Land Monsoon (CLM) region during 1961–2022, significantly in the northeast and southwest. The 13‐year sliding correlations indicate that since 2000, the British Okhotsk Corridor (BOC)‐Silk Road Pattern (SRP) nexus shifted from a strong to weak state, which influenced CHHEs variability. During the weak BOC‐SRP nexus period, an anomalous high‐pressure system dominated northern China, especially northeastern CLM, and was intensified by negative potential vorticity anomalies through subsidence and diabatic heating. Simultaneously, abundant moisture transport from the western Pacific into northeastern CLM reinforced hot and humid conditions, jointly increasing CHHEs. Over southwestern CLM, the high‐pressure system strengthened anomalous easterlies, which together with negative vorticity advection increased moisture divergence. Additionally, meridional temperature advection promoted warm air accumulation in the lower troposphere, further increasing CHHEs. Finally, the weak BOC‐SRP nexus is modulated by North Atlantic tripole sea surface temperature anomalies by Rossby wave energy divergence, as confirmed by Community Earth System Model simulations.

Numerical modeling of these storms is an important component for understanding the physical processes that cause significant impacts and for predicting their effects ahead of time. Initial and boundary conditions are an essential component to limited‐area modeling; variability in these conditions can significantly alter the simulations. While previous modeling studies have investigated sensitivities in model physics, there has been limited exploration of the impact of different initial condition sources; differences within these sources can include horizontal and vertical resolution, data assimilation schemes, and domain. This study aims at identifying the sources of variability from the initialized atmospheric fields within four different sets of initial conditions and their impact on the prediction of winter precipitation processes. The key finding was that relative humidity across different initial and boundary conditions produced the most uncertainty on the model simulation, while variability in temperature or synoptic conditions had a minor role. To explain the precipitation differences seen during the simulations, vertical profiles of relative humidity and temperature were connected to microphysical hydrometeor species tracked within the model. The findings suggested that relative humidity differences are heavily linked to precipitation accumulation discrepancies and were the main source of variability from the initial conditions. These results call for the development of more accurate relative humidity profiles for model initial and boundary conditions."

Building upon the Global Scene‐Dependent Atmospheric Retrieval Testbed (GSDART), this study develops an enhanced one‐dimensional variational (1DVAR) precipitation retrieval algorithm specifically tailored for monitoring TCs based on Chinese FengYun‐3E (FY‐3E) passive microwave observations over the northwestern Pacific. The algorithm introduces a precipitation‐type differentiation module into the 1DVAR framework (1DVARDPT), employs the Advanced Radiative Transfer Modeling System (ARMS) as the forward operator, and utilizes observations from the FY‐3E microwave humidity and temperature sounders (MWTHS). A comprehensive comparative analysis from 19 TCs reveals that considering precipitation types significantly improves retrieval performances—reducing relative bias from −9.89% to 2.02% and mean absolute error (MAE) from 0.38 mm/hr to 0.32 mm/hr—while enhancing the detection of both light/moderate and heavy precipitation. Furthermore, using ARMS instead of the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) as the forward operator markedly reduces the systematic underestimation seen in conventional retrievals (bias improved from −23.50% to −9.89%), demonstrating ARMS's superiority in precipitation‐sensitive radiative transfer modeling. The findings from this study underscore the importance of accounting for precipitation‐type variability in 1DVAR retrievals and highlight the strong potential of FY‐3E observations and ARMS for advancing microwave‐based precipitation estimation."

COA reacts with atmospheric oxidants such as ozone, as it contains unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid. Laboratory studies during the last decades suggested that the atmospheric chemical lifetime of oleic acid ranges from minutes, whereas atmospheric observations demonstrated that the corresponding value is several hours to half a day. To account for the disagreement, the phase state of COA particles has been hypothesized as (semi‐)solid based on experimental studies for synthetic mixtures at room temperature. However, most of these studies employed substrate, which cannot fully represent the phase state of suspending aerosol particles. The phase state of suspending COA particles has rarely been measured, especially for the whole range of urban‐environment relevant temperatures. By measuring the bounce behavior of suspending particles as a function of temperature, we examined the phase state of major fatty acids in COA (oleic, linoleic, pimelic, and stearic acids), in addition to laboratory‐generated COA produced by heating canola oil, lard, and hotpot soup base. All types of fresh COA particles were liquid for the temperature range above −15°C. Comparison with recent laboratory kinetic study suggested that the phase transition may partially, but not fully, account for the reduced chemical reactivity at lower temperatures. As the temperature of most cities in the world is higher than −15°C, we suggest that fresh COA particles are mostly liquid on a global scale, though observational verification would still be needed."

The concurrence of different types of droughts and high temperatures, commonly termed compound drought and hot events (CDHEs), including compound meteorological drought‐hot events (CMDHEs), compound agricultural drought‐hot events (CADHEs), and compound hydrological drought‐hot events (CHDHEs), has received increasing attention due to their larger impacts than single events. Although different CDHEs have been evaluated separately, the linkages among them have seldom been quantified. Using monthly hydroclimatic variables, we evaluated spatial variations and temporal linkages of different CDHEs from 1952 to 2021. High frequencies of different CDHEs are observed in regions such as northeastern South America, central Africa, and southeastern China. The strong synchronous linkages among CDHEs, defined as the likelihood of simultaneous CADHEs/CHDHEs conditional on CMDHEs, are observed in low‐latitude regions, which are related to drought propagations. Additionally, cascading linkages, defined as the empirical likelihood of subsequent CADHEs/CHDHEs conditional on CMDHEs, are also modulated by temperature persistence. For different climate types, the strongest linkages are observed in equatorial climates, while the weakest linkage is found in snow climates. These findings provide critical insights for developing cross‐sectoral mitigation strategies to reduce CDHE‐related risks and enhance predictive capabilities for such compound events by considering their temporal linkages under global warming."

Here, we evaluate the skill of the ECMWF dynamical subseasonal‐to‐seasonal (S2S) forecast model to forecast QSWs in Northern Hemisphere winter. The model shows spatially varying prediction skill, with the North Pacific region showing the highest skill across all lead times studied (7–35 days). We find very large interannual and intraseasonal variability in the subseasonal skill of this North Pacific region. The interannual variability is statistically consistent across different S2S models, indicating that physical conditions varying from year to year influence the prediction skill. Further investigation shows improvements in the S2S skill under certain phases of the Madden‐Julian oscillation (MJO), under La Niña ocean conditions, during the westerly phase of the quasi‐biennial oscillation (QBO), and following the onset of sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs). These identified conditions may be windows of opportunity for better S2S QSW forecast skill.

The results show that the average hectare of urban garden in São Paulo could provide healthy food to more than 600 people, while theoretical city‐scale implementations reach 13%–21% of the city's population. This demonstrates UA's high potential for significant fresh and nutritious food production but also the trade‐offs that emerge when upscaling its implementation.

The ABM simulates 38,447 farmers using the RANAS behavioral framework, based on household surveys and observed data. Model results confirm the hypothesized feedback: increased water from CDs led to an 11.9% rise in cotton and 36.1% in wheat areas, boosting incomes and increasing adoption of drip and borewell irrigation, particularly near CDs. While drip irrigation systems improve water efficiency and post‐monsoon groundwater levels, the saved water enables further wheat expansion—triggering a second supply demand feedback loop. These changes are spatially concentrated near CDs, exacerbating within‐catchment disparities. Overall, about 54% of the additional recharge is used for irrigation expansion, lowering groundwater levels by 1.0 m and reducing the net benefit of recharge interventions.

These changes in ET, through moisture recycling, had redistributed precipitation and subsequent WA across regions, increasing WA in the Tibetan Plateau (0.38 mm/yr) while decreasing WA in the Eastern Monsoon Region (−0.59 mm/yr) and Northwestern Arid Region (−1.14 mm/yr). The Northwestern Arid Region experienced the greatest decrease in WA primarily due to significant moisture outflow to the Tibetan Plateau. The study underscores the necessity of integrating moisture recycling into water resources management to address the mismatch between land and water resources. Our results provide valuable insights for sustainable land and water resources management in China."

While ordinances may be developed for legitimate purposes to protect public health and safety, they could impede or increase costs of power sector decarbonization. We quantify the role of utility‐scale solar zoning ordinances on power sector decarbonization across the Great Lakes region (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin) by integrating 2,474 unique rural zoning ordinances (covering over 90% of county subdivisions in each state) into a power system planning model. Our analysis focuses on deploying utility‐scale PV on agricultural lands, where most existing solar installations in our region are located. Relative to a hypothetical counterfactual without zoning ordinances, existing zoning ordinances cause an 18% decline in utility‐scale PV investment (by 8 GW) and cost (by $4.8 billion), primarily due to “silent” ordinances that implicitly block solar development by failing to address its land‐use. Investment shifts from PV to energy storage (900 MW), wind (300 MW), and natural gas plants (3 GW). Starker declines in PV investment occur at the state level, with Michigan and Wisconsin seeing a 42% reduction. Our results underscore the need for planning that aligns local zoning laws with state and regional goals."

 Strain engineering is an effective approach to enhancing the activity of catalysts by tuning the electrical and geometric configurations. However, the impact of strain dimension on the sulfur redox kinetics and polysulfide adsorption configuration has yet been deciphered. Herein, we employ a biaxial-strained dichalcogenide catalyst with highly curved basal planes to activate the reserve metal atoms and realize efficient lithium-sulfur batteries. The high-dimensional strain enhances the exposure of Mo sites, thereby shifting the polysulfide adsorption mechanism from weak Li-S/Se bonding to strong S*-Mo bonding. Moreover, biaxial strain upshifts both d and p band centers, fostering the interfacial charge transfer and catalytic activity. Based on this mechanism, we obtain apparent correlations between biaxial strain and apparent activation energy for sulfur species conversion. This d-p hybridization dominated catalytic mechanism leads to obvious enhancement in capacity retention and rate performance. We showcase a 6 Ah-level multilayer pouch cell with a specific energy of 396 Wh kg–1 (based on masses of all components). Strain engineering is effective in modulating catalyst activity.

Here, the authors show that MDMs persist long-term in the brain after TBI and acquire a disease- and age-associated signature enriched in human TBI and AD brains. 
 Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an environmental risk factor for dementia and long-term neurological deficits, posing a significant public health challenge. TBI-induced neuroinflammation involves both brain-resident microglia and peripheral monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Previous research has shown that MDMs contribute to the development of long-term memory deficits, yet their long-term behavior following brain infiltration remains unclear. To address this, our study uses two complementary fate-mapping mouse lines, CCR2-creERT2 and Ms4a3-cre, for precise and lasting tracking of MDMs in vivo. Here we show that MDMs persist in the brain for at least 8 months post-TBI in both male and female mice. MDMs retain phagocytic activity for at least 30 days post-TBI, remain transcriptionally distinct from microglia, and display a gene expression profile associated with aging and disease. Moreover, we identify a core transcriptomic signature of MDMs shared across various mouse models and brain perturbations, which is also enriched in the brain myeloid cells of male subjects with TBI and Alzheimer’s disease patients. These findings enhance our understanding of MDMs' dynamics after TBI and inform future targeted myeloid-based therapies.

Here, the authors report transport signatures consistent with Wigner crystallization in AB-stacked bilayer graphene at both zero and finite magnetic fields. 
 AB-stacked bilayer graphene has emerged as a fascinating yet simple platform for exploring macroscopic quantum phenomena of correlated electrons. Under large electric displacement fields and near low-density van-Hove singularities, it exhibits a phase with features consistent with Wigner crystallization, including negative dR/dT and nonlinear bias behavior. However, direct evidence for the emergence of an electron crystal at zero magnetic field remains elusive. Here, we explore low-frequency noise consistent with depinning and sliding of a Wigner crystal or solid. At large magnetic fields, we observe enhanced noise at low bias current and a frequency-dependent response characteristic of depinning and sliding, consistent with earlier scanning tunnelling microscopy studies confirming Wigner crystallization in the fractional quantum Hall regime. At zero magnetic field, we detect pronounced AC noise whose peak frequency increases linearly with applied DC current—indicative of collective electron motion. These transport signatures pave the way toward confirming an anomalous Hall crystal. Graphene systems have the potential to host Wigner crystal states at zero magnetic field. Here, the authors report transport signatures consistent with Wigner crystallization in AB-stacked bilayer graphene at both zero and finite magnetic fields."

 Self-organised three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures, collectively called 3D-oids, include spheroids, organoids and other co-culture models. Systematic evaluation of these models forms a critical new generation of high-content screening (HCS) systems for patient-specific drug analysis and cancer research. However, the standardisation of working with 3D-oids remains challenging and lacks convincing implementation. This study develops and tests HCS-3DX, a next-generation system for HCS analysis in 3D imaging and image evaluation. HCS-3DX is based on three main components: an automated Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven micromanipulator for 3D-oid selection, an HCS foil multiwell plate for optimised imaging, and image-based AI software for single-cell data analysis. We validated HCS-3DX directly on 3D tumour models, including tumour-stroma co-cultures. Our data demonstrate that HCS-3DX achieves a resolution that overcomes the limitations of current systems and reliably and effectively performs 3D HCS at the single-cell level.

Here the authors introduce iodine anions into electrolytes to form interphases that adapt to morphology at the interface, lifting the dependence on high pressure. 
 All-solid-state lithium metal (Li°) batteries (ASSLMBs) are a promising next-generation energy storage technology due to their use of non-flammable solid electrolytes for enhanced safety and the potential for higher energy density. However, void formation and evolution at the interface between anode and solid electrolyte remains a major challenge, leading to accelerated performance degradation. Departing from traditional interfacial design strategies, here we introduce dynamically adaptive interphases, formed by controllable migration of pre-installed anions in solid electrolytes, to operate ASSLMBs stably under low external pressure. The interphases adapt to the Li° anode volume changes, maintaining close physical contact between the Li° anode and ‘rigid’ solid electrolyte under low or zero external pressure. The dynamically adaptive interphase enables Li° full cells to deliver excellent rate performance and 90.7% of capacity retention after 2,400 cycles at a current density of 1.25 mA cm−2. Notably, pouch cells with zero external pressure are assembled with 74.4% of capacity retention after 300 cycles. The present work resolves the critical issue of the continuous solid–solid contact loss between Li° anodes and high-modulus solid electrolytes, advancing the practical deployment of ASSLMBs as high-energy, sustainable electrochemical storage systems.

Here the authors present photoluminescent composites that combine subambient cooling with aesthetic colour, hydrophobicity and durability. 
 Passive radiative cooling offers a sustainable solution to reduce carbon emissions in space cooling by simultaneously reflecting sunlight and emitting thermal radiation. However, the super-white property of conventional passive radiative cooling materials poses challenges for large-scale urban applications by conflicting with aesthetic requirements and neglecting impacts on urban microclimate and pedestrian thermal and visual comfort. Here inspired by the biological photoadaptation of coral, we present photoluminescence-based aesthetic composites as innovative urban skins that harness the enhanced light conversion of rare-earth-doped phosphors while decoupling from light-scattering-based whiteness, providing cool colours with improved urban compatibility. These composites demonstrate effective spectral reflectance of over 100% and peak reflectance up to 141% in their emission regions, despite a moderate overall solar reflectance (90.2–93.2%). With vivid yet angle-insensitive green, yellow and red appearances, the composites achieve subambient temperature reductions of 2.2–3.7 °C compared with ambient air and 6.1–7.9 °C relative to their non-photoluminescent counterparts. Moreover, their moderate whiteness alleviates excessive thermal and visual stress induced by trapping of sunlight in urban environments. Featuring excellent durability, compatibility and stability, these composites offer a scalable solution for energy-efficient and aesthetically pleasing radiative cooling in architecture, textiles and beyond, advancing passive radiative cooling technologies towards diverse real-world implementations. Radiative cooling is an emerging technology for cooling with reduced energy consumption. Here the authors present photoluminescent composites that combine subambient cooling with aesthetic colour, hydrophobicity and durability."

 Rainfall is the main trigger for debris flows in torrent catchments. A systematic analysis of the critical rainfall for debris-flow initiation in Austria is lacking. This study quantifies and compares rainfall events that historically triggered debris flows and fluvial floods in Austria and assesses the expected impact of climate change on the frequency and spatial extent of such events. We derive critical rainfall conditions using hourly rainfall estimates based on radar-rain gauge data for more than 3600 torrent events between 2003 and 2022. Past and future return periods are estimated based on an ensemble of regional climate projections covering three emission scenarios until 2100. We find that the regional variations of the critical rainfall patterns are greater than the differences between the types of processes. A general dependence of triggering rainfall on the antecedent rainfall cannot be confirmed. In a warming climate, both the probability of occurrence and the affected area in Austria are projected to increase for both process types and across all emission scenarios. However, these changes are unevenly distributed throughout Austria. The results indicate that regional-scale predictions can improve mountain risk management in a changing climate, while risk management for individual torrents will benefit from process-based understanding.

 The contributions of climate change and human activities to runoff variation have been examined in multiple individual catchments, but upstream-downstream interaction relationships remain underexplored. Here, we propose a three-tiered attribution framework to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns, underlying drivers, and upstream-downstream relationships of runoff variations in the Yellow River Basin (1952–2021). The results indicate that the longitudinal cumulative effects of climatic (ranging from −8.6% upstream to 7.1% downstream relative to the whole basin) and anthropogenic disturbance (15.2%-92.9%) factors lead to higher risks of runoff variations in downstream regions, with more pronounced seasonal fluctuations (particularly in reservoir-regulated reaches). Glaciers, lakes, and reservoirs’ storage capacities cause lagged effects of climate change and human activities on runoff variations, while simultaneously serving as critical drivers for inter-basin water resource regulation. Integrating comprehensive understanding of multi-scale hydrological variability drivers and spatial interaction mechanisms is essential for advancing adaptive river basin management and sustainable water resources allocation.

 The European North-West shelf seas experienced a marine heatwave of unprecedented magnitude in June 2023. Quantifying the likelihood of reoccurrence of similar events is vital for mitigating impacts on marine ecosystems and human activities. Assessing the probability of such events is complicated by climate change-driven changes in the baseline conditions and the short length of the observational record with respect to modes of climate variability. Here, by employing a large ensemble of initialised climate model simulations, we show that the probability of June 2023-like events occurring is approximately 10% in any given year of the present-day climate. Moreover, there has been accelerating growth in the risk of occurrence over the last 30 years. The unprecedented nature of the record-breaking June 2023 event placed European marine heatwaves firmly in the public consciousness. However, the climate change trajectory means that whilst this event was unprecedented, such events should not be unexpected.

 Satellite-based remote sensing offers unprecedented opportunities for monitoring coastal dynamics at large spatiotemporal scales through proxies such as shoreline positions. Recent advances in computational tools and the accessibility of publicly available satellite imagery have made it feasible to derive these metrics efficiently using user-defined parameters (e.g., band combinations, segmentation algorithms, and preprocessing steps). This abundance of data and tools, coupled with increasing computational power, suggests that global-scale monitoring of shoreline change is within reach. However, efforts to develop continental-to-global shoreline change datasets remain limited, partly due to challenges associated with varying environmental conditions and the lack of standardized algorithms. Yet, quantitative relationships between errors in the satellite-derived observations and environmental conditions remain unexplored. Also, the large body of available methods for satellite-derived waterline (SDW) extraction has merely been inter-compared. In this study, we built on previous works to develop a customizable open-access SDW extraction Python toolkit. We assess the influence of spectral band combination and segmentation method on the accuracy of waterline and shoreline positions derived from Sentinel-2 and Landsat optical imagery, comparing 20 SDW extraction methods in total. By evaluating the performances of these extraction methods across eight sandy coast sites using in-situ beach elevation profiles and FES2022 tide model outputs, we highlight the systematic gap between SDW performances obtained at microtidal and meso- to macrotidal environments. We found that SDW/SDS accuracy at microtidal sites is slightly influenced by the choice of band combination, while the accuracy at meso- to macrotidal sites is rather impacted by the choice of thresholding method. We also validated related satellite-derived metrics, such as long-term trends, interannual variability, and seasonal cycles of shoreline change, as well as beach slopes, and found that there are generally well captured by the top-performing SDW methods, with errors in long-term trend, interannual variability and seasonal cycle amplitude estimations around 0.8 m/yr, 2 m, and 2.5 m, respectively. Finally, we address the issue related with low signal-to-noise ratio in SDS time series, emphasizing the necessity to quantify and mitigate noise by aggregating data over time, and propose empirical laws quantifying errors in shoreline position time series as a function of the inverse beach slope and the tidal excursion, meaning tidal range normalized by the beach slope. These results provide a critical framework for first order estimation of the accuracy of satellite-derived shoreline positions derived at sites lacking validation data, and bring insightful materials to discuss methodological challenges related to large-scale, automated shoreline monitoring, highlighting strengths and limitations of Sentinel-2- and Landsat-derived observations, beyond the sole coastal monitoring field."

 Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) are essential land variables for environmental monitoring and climate modeling. High resolution (≤30 m) gap-free LAI/FAPAR products are in high demand, but frequent cloud contaminations in optical data cause substantial data gaps. To address the ill-posed nature of land surface variable inversion by leveraging time-series information instead of traditional pixel-based inversions, this study presents a temporal deep learning model that jointly estimates gap-free, 20 m/5-day LAI/FAPAR from integrated Landsat-8/9 and Sentinel-2 sequential observations, denoted as High-resolution Global LAnd Surface Satellite (Hi-GLASS) LS20 LAI/FAPAR products, part of the Hi-GLASS level 3 product suite. A hybrid Bidirectional LSTM with an attention mechanism that synergizes multiple satellite observations effectively under different cloud cover conditions was trained on representative samples derived from GLASS LAI/FAPAR and 30 m land cover data, accounting for site heterogeneity. The algorithm was directly validated against 4046 in-situ measurements from 29 validation sites, achieving an R2 of 0.79 for LAI and 0.86 for FAPAR, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.0 for LAI and 0.155 for FAPAR. Intercomparisons with existing high and coarse resolution products showed superior continuity and accuracy. To implement the model, we constructed Landsat and Sentinel-2 Analysis Ready Data (LSARD) and generated the first 20 m gap-free LAI/FAPAR product over China from 2018 to 2023 (www.glasss.hku.hk). We also provide a web tool on Google Colab that can calculate LAI/FAPAR for any region of interest. Unlike methods that rely solely on clear-sky pixels from a single sensor, our approach enables spatiotemporally continuous and physically consistent LAI/FAPAR estimates from multiple sensors."

 Wildfires are recognized as essential climate variables (ECVs) due to their widespread impacts on ecosystems, greenhouse gas emissions, air quality, and the global carbon cycle. Accurate and scalable burned area mapping is therefore critical. However, conventional indices such as the differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) are prone to commission errors, often misclassifying unburned vegetation, clouds, shadows, or snow as burned. This study introduces the Automated Temporal Burn Index (ATBI), which leverages the co-occurring spectral signature of fire (NIR↓ and SWIR↑) through a multiplicative formulation. The differenced ATBI (dATBI) measures pre–post fire changes, while the multi-temporal variant (dATBItm) incorporates a fixed pre-fire image with multiple post-fire scenes to capture fire progression and suppress transient noise. This study evaluated dATBI and dATBItm across 50 wildfire events worldwide using Landsat imagery in Google Earth Engine, benchmarking against dNBR and its multi-temporal version (dNBRtm). Validation with Random Forest reference classifications showed that dATBI achieved substantially higher precision (∼0.92 vs. 0.73), higher F1 scores (∼0.94 vs. 0.84), and slightly better separability (M = 1.38 vs. 1.29) than dNBR, while maintaining similar recall. ROC analysis confirmed superior discrimination, with dATBI consistently reducing false positives at low false positive rates. Threshold analysis revealed that dATBI is far less sensitive to class break adjustments than dNBR, enabling more consistent severity mapping across ecosystems. The multi-temporal dATBItm further improved robustness, accurately reconstructing cumulative burn scars across boreal, tropical, Mediterranean, and savanna ecosystems while suppressing cloud, shadow, and snow artifacts. Finally, sensitivity tests demonstrated that SREM-corrected reflectance yielded cleaner dATBI outputs than standard LaSRC products, underscoring the importance of preprocessing. Overall, dATBI and dATBItm provide reliable alternatives to dNBR for operational burned area monitoring. Their robustness to commission error, threshold variability, and atmospheric noise makes them suitable for integration into large-scale wildfire assessment and climate resilience strategies."

 Geoportals have become essential tools for accessing and analyzing geospatial data, facilitating open spatial data sharing and online geo-information management. They typically follow interaction logic similar to common GIS systems and use a layered visualization structure. However, these designs can make geoportals less accessible to non-expert users, who may find complex functionalities overwhelming and struggle with overlapping data layers that obscure spatial relationships.To address these challenges, we propose a step towards a barrier-free GeoQA Portal enabling natural language interaction with geospatial data using a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework. User queries are decomposed into individual subtasks and handled by distinct LLM agents. Our portal can process complex spatial queries and extract geographic data relevant to user interests. Additionally, task plans are presented to users, improving transparency and engagement. The portal supports both default and user-provided data, flexibly addressing diverse user needs. We enhance accessibility via semantic search using word vector similarity, allowing users to retrieve relevant data even if terms or spellings are imperfect. Through case studies, system evaluation, and user testing, we demonstrate the system’s effectiveness in meeting the geospatial data access and analysis needs of non-expert users. The results highlight how our portal bridges the gap between complex GIS workflows and public data accessibility, offering a more intuitive and user-friendly solution for future geoportal development."

 Understanding size-resolved physicochemical characteristics of atmospheric aerosols is pivotal for elucidating their formation mechanisms, behavior, and atmospheric fate. However, most aerosol studies rely on mass-based methods, which often underestimate the contribution of ultrafine and submicron particles due to their low mass fractions. Despite their small mass, these particles dominate the aerosol number concentrations and play a critical role in atmospheric chemical processes. Herein, we investigate the size-resolved characteristics of submicron aerosols, focusing on three major components: carbon, nitrate, and sulfate, using an integrated analytical approach that combines particle size distribution (PSD) and chemical composition analytical analysis. Online PSD measurements and offline size-segregated aerosol sampling were simultaneously performed using an electrical low-pressure impactor (ELPI+), covering aerodynamic diameters from 6 nm to 1.64 μm. Raman spectroscopy was applied to investigate the chemical composition of size-resolved samples. This integrated approach was applied during a winter haze event. Our results indicate that ultrafine carbonaceous particles, primarily from local traffic emissions, dominated the concentration of submicron aerosols. In contrast, secondary inorganic aerosols (sulfate and nitrate) were prominent in the accumulation mode, forming heterogeneously on pre-existing particles’ surfaces. Nitrate concentrations were particularly elevated during daytime haze periods and coexisted with highly oxidized carbonaceous particles. The observed evolution in carbonaceous aerosol oxidation states and mixing characteristics contributed to enhanced atmospheric reactions, light absorption and scattering modification, and reduced visibility, which are key drivers of haze formation. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the integrated analytical approach for advancing our understanding of submicron aerosol behavior and their role in air pollution and climate."

While PM2.5 decreased significantly (3.76 μg m−3 yr−1) along with its inorganic components (SO42−, NO3− and NH4+, ranging from −0.57 to −0.34 μg m−3 yr−1), secondary organic aerosol (SOA) conversely increased (+0.18 μg m−3 yr−1).

 During May 2022, the Middle East region (MER) experienced four prolonged and severe atmospheric pollution episodes (APEs), resulting in severe fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution in the region. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was employed to simulate meteorological fields, while the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was applied to simulate PM2.5 during the APEs. Using ground-based observations, the performance of the models was evaluated, and the spatiotemporal patterns of PM2.5 and meteorological influences during the APEs were elucidated. The WRF model adequately reproduced the observed meteorological variables, while the CMAQ model quantitatively captured the temporal trends of observed PM2.5 concentrations, and the models' performance metrics met their suggested benchmarks. The results show that APE1 peaked on May 11 with its highest PM2.5 concentrations in Iran, the UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Oman. On May 17, APE2 peaked as the pollution spread across the region with elevated PM2.5 concentrations (250 ≤ PM2.5 ≤ 400 μg/m3) in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, the UAE, and Oman. APE3 was the most severe episode, peaking during May 18–20 with clusters of elevated PM2.5 concentrations (150 ≤ PM2.5 ≤ 600 μg/m3), especially in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Yemen, Oman, and the UAE. APE4 was also severe but less compared to APE2 and APE3 in most areas. Furthermore, unfavorable meteorological conditions enhanced the formation of these episodes. The results demonstrate the CMAQ model's capability in reproducing elevated PM2.5 concentrations during severe APEs and can be further used to elucidate source attributions and processes contributing to PM2.5 in the MER."

 This study examines hailstorm hazards and losses in the Netherlands by combining high-resolution radar-based maximum expected hail size (MEHS) data, weather station observations, and reanalysis data with a unique agricultural asset-level insurance loss dataset. We analyse hail climatology to identify the spatial and temporal characteristics of hail events and their impacts on agricultural buildings. Using correlation and regression methods, we assess optimal MEHS thresholds and spatial scales for aggregated damage analysis. The findings indicate that a 1.5 cm MEHS threshold with a one-digit postal code level of aggregation provides the strongest correlation with reported losses. In addition, we utilise random forest models to evaluate the predictive power of underlying meteorological variables linked to convective systems, thus identifying potential proxy variables for hailstorm hazard and associated losses. The random forest evaluation shows that models that use ERA5 data have good overall performance. These models consistently prioritise convective-related variables such as convective inhibition (CIN) and convective available potential energy (CAPE), in addition to the less frequent variables such as (dewpoint) temperature and precipitation. Furthermore, using the entire time series of the period of interest, we can first predict hail days and then use a model to identify days with hail large enough to cause significant damage. These insights help to improve hailstorm risk models and inform strategies to mitigate future impacts."
