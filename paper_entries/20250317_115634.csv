M. Ross;B. Vega;L. Frouté;T.‐W. Kim;A. R. Kovscek,Hydrogen Generation and Serpentinization of Olivine Under Flow Conditions,"Serpentinization of olivine is often studied in the laboratory under batch conditions. Olivine conversion in situ with enhanced natural hydrogen production will likely be implemented via injection of aqueous solutions. Hence, transport is relevant to the extent of olivine reaction and, potentially, the morphology of precipitates formed. To test conditions for optimal H2 generation and outcomes, serpentinization was induced by injecting pH = 12.5 brine at 0.015 cm3/min (0.5 pore volumes per day) into an olivine sand pack (250 to <355 μm grain size) at 245°C generating, at minimum 76 and 89 mol% H2 at 35 and 57 d, respectively. Grain‐coating serpentine with radiating needles cemented the reacted sand grains. Importantly, pore space was maintained between the dissolving grains and the serpentine precipitates. Hence, reactivity continued as a result of fluid access to mineral surfaces, the large grain size, and the continuous injection of undersaturated alkaline fluids."

Gao,The Distribution of Linear Virgae Across the Saturnian Moons,"Linear virgae are long (10–100s km), narrow (<5 km), and bright features, first found on the surface of Dione. On Dione, linear virgae run parallel to the equator and are found in the low‐to‐mid latitudes. Linear virgae are likely formed by a process that involves the emplacement of materials from an exogenic Chronocentric (Saturn centric), or moon‐centric source through low‐velocity impacts. All of Saturn's mid‐sized icy satellites, Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, and Iapetus, were analyzed to determine whether the formation of linear virgae is a process that occurs local only to Dione or whether it is a regional or Saturn system‐wide process. We examine the entirety of Cassini's Imaging Science Subsystem archive <1 km/pixel for each moon to determine the distribution of linear virgae. We find linear virgae form exclusively in the Dione‐Rhea region of the Saturn system."

The physical mechanisms driving this variability remain inadequately understood. This study demonstrates that onset of El Niño events can occur over a broad range of months from March to September, with its onset timing closely linked to the precondition of oceanic recharged state and the occurrence of westerly wind bursts (WWBs) in the preceding spring. A stronger recharged state and increased frequency of WWBs promote earlier onset by efficiently transporting warm water to the equatorial eastern Pacific. Supporting evidence from MIROC6 simulations and a conceptual model underscores the crucial roles of both the recharged state and WWBs in determining the timing of El Niño onset. These results enhance our understanding of El Niño dynamics and hold important implications for seasonal climate prediction."

The results show that the longitudinal variations of TTL KWs during different seasons are primarily driven by zonal winds rather than static stability. Investigations on the annual variations of TTL KWs reveal that below the tropopause, TTL KWs reach the maxima during June, July, and August (JJA) and the minima during December, January, and February (DJF) over 150°E–240°E (Pacific Ocean (PO)) and 270°E–360°E (Atlantic Ocean; AO), where zonal winds and static stability present similar annual variations, while over 30°E–120°E (Indian Ocean; IO), zonal winds and static stability present different annual variations, resulting in weakened KW annual variation. Above the tropopause, TTL KWs generally reach the maxima during DJF and the minima during JJA, which is mainly modulated by static stability. El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO) modulates the longitudinal distribution of TTL KWs by affecting the zonal winds, leading to that strong TTL KWs present broader longitudinal distribution during El Niño than during La Niña. El Niño‐Southern Oscillation also affects the vertical distribution of TTL KWs by static stability, resulting in weaker (stronger) KWs below the tropopause and stronger (weaker) KWs above the tropopause during La Niña (El Niño) over 90°E–180°E. The opposite process occurs over 180°E–270°E. Quasi‐biennial oscillation (QBO) may affect the interannual variations of TTL KWs above around 18 km by affecting zonal winds and static stability, leading to TTL KWs reach the maxima before westerly shears occur."

This study proposes a novel approach for generating “pseudo soundings” for the atmospheric model's initial conditions. In each “pseudo soundings”, the vertical profiles of heat and moisture are estimated by a random forest algorithm from the evolution and mean state of precursor convective precipitation. Results indicate that the vertical structures of temperature and humidity in “pseudo soundings” estimated in this study could be superior to the reanalysis data set, and could well remedy the insufficient heat and moisture information for model's initial condition over the TP where in situ conventional soundings are absent. Compared to the ERA5 reanalysis data set, the mean relative error of temperature and specific humidity estimated in this study could be reduced by 0.7% and 5.7%, respectively. Verification based on a series of simulations illustrates that assimilating vertical profiles of heat and moisture in “pseudo soundings” would alleviate the spurious and overestimated summer precipitation in simulations over the TP. The mean simulation bias of hourly precipitation could be reduced by 31.8%, compared to assimilating in situ conventional soundings only. Further investigations suggest that assimilating vertical profiles of heat and moisture in “pseudo soundings” would improve the simulation performance of summer precipitation by producing a dryer and more convective stable lower atmosphere over the TP."

However, how the electrical parameters in lightning channels change during reactivation processes and how reactivation affects the development of lightning leaders are still unclear. In this study, we employed the two‐dimensional self‐sustained charge neutrality lightning model to simulate the discharge process of intracloud lightning flashes and conducted an extensive analysis of channel decay and reactivation processes. Our results suggest a close correlation between the length of reactivated channels and the distribution of channel electrical parameters, and the reactivation process has a significant influence on lightning channel development. Specifically, it is found that greater charge accumulation at the reactivation starting point and higher residual conductivity of the decayed channels can lead to longer reactivated channels. And, the reactivation initiated from the positive leader end may both promote the resumption of the extension of the positive leader branch that has stopped extending and accelerate the propagation of an advancing positive leader. Moreover, reactivation may also activate the decayed negative leader channel, facilitating the lateral generation of new branches, which is crucial for the formation of hybrid lightning, needle‐like structures, etc. The simulation results validate the previous speculations from observation studies regarding the potential influence of the reactivation process on lightning channel development and lay the foundation for the subsequent use of this model to explore the differences between the reactivation process initiated from the positive and negative leader end."

Mikkelsen;Alfonzo Saiz‐Lopez;Thomas Röckmann;Matthew S. Johnson,Photocatalytic Chlorine Production From Iron Chlorides in Atmospheric Aerosols: Strategies for Quantifying Methane and Tropospheric Ozone Control,"It was recently discovered that chlorine is produced photocatalytically from mineral dust‐sea spray aerosols, impacting methane and tropospheric ozone, and an evaluation was made of the climate and environmental impact of a chlorine‐based intervention to draw down methane. The generation of chlorine by the iron chlorides Fe(III)Cln(3−n) ${\mathrm{C}\mathrm{l}}_{n}^{(3-n)}$ will also occur due to iron present in shipping plumes. To study efficiency and environmental implications, there is a need for additional information about the behavior of the process under a range of atmospheric conditions. Here, we use box modeling to evaluate whether it is possible to experimentally observe this mechanism in a ship's plume, or in a plume of pure iron dust, emitted for example, from a tower. Detection limits for Cl, Cl2 ${\text{Cl}}_{2}$, HOCl, ClO, ClNO3 ${\text{ClNO}}_{3}$, ClNO2 ${\text{ClNO}}_{2}$, CO, C2H6 ${\mathrm{C}}_{2}{\mathrm{H}}_{6}$, δ13CCO ${\mathit{\delta }}^{13}{\mathrm{C}}_{\mathrm{CO}}$, and CH2O ${\text{CH}}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ are determined based on values from the literature. We find that the most promising and low‐cost experimental indicators of chlorine atom production are the concentration of photoactive iron and the CO:ethane ratio, and Cl2 ${\text{Cl}}_{2}$ is a useful indicator if cost is not a limitation. For ships with high NOx ${\text{NO}}_{x}$ emissions, ClNO2 ${\text{ClNO}}_{2}$, and ClNO3 ${\text{ClNO}}_{3}$ could also potentially be used, and for towers emitting Fe without NOx ${\text{NO}}_{x}$ the concentration of HOCl and ClO could be used. δ13CCO ${\mathit{\delta }}^{13}{\mathrm{C}}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ is a very direct method to detect methane removal, but only gives a clear signal for high iron emissions."

Meteorological factors such as surface solar radiation, temperature, and wind influence the photovoltaic potential (PVPOT) and wind energy potential (WEP). Black carbon aerosols (BC), with their strong capacity to absorb shortwave radiation, induce regional climate changes, underscore the non‐negligible impact on PVPOT and WEP. This study utilizes the Community Earth System Model to project changes in PVPOT and WEP under shared socioeconomic pathways and their responses to BC. Results indicate that the model accurately delineated the spatial distribution and historical trends of five meteorological elements: wind speed, air temperature, surface solar radiation, surface pressure and surface specific humidity. In the SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios, both PVPOT and WEP exhibited remarkable regional and seasonal variations. In Western Europe, Canada, Tibetan Plateau, and most parts of eastern China, PVPOT is projected increase, while the induced BC enhances the increase in PVPOT on the Tibetan Plateau. Effects of BC on the annual trends of PVPOT vary across regions. Furthermore, the global average of both PVPOT and WEP is expected to increase, with BC strengthening the increase of PVPOT, but scenario differences exist in WEP. In the SSP245 scenario, BC will induce a global average PVPOT increase of 0.41 × 10−3 W/m2 by 2100."

A better understanding of the loading pathways, fluxes, and fate of this debris is necessary for more effective mitigation efforts, and to reduce ocean emissions that become marine debris. This study presents a novel framework for quantifying riverine debris using a holistic mass balance modeling approach, applied in the San Diego River, California, a regionally important river with a large, urban watershed. This framework quantifies urban riverine debris sources, sinks and transport dynamics at the watershed scale. The model integrates a community science data set of floodplain debris with a simple stormwater runoff model to account for debris loading and applies probabilistic transport functions to estimate ocean emissions. Our key finding is that most riverine debris in the San Diego River is not washed in through storm drains but is directly deposited in the floodplain (79%–92% of total debris), with homeless encampments the largest contributing factor (62%–75% of total debris). Ongoing cleanup efforts substantially reduce the debris accumulation rate: without these efforts, debris stored on the floodplain increases by up to 48%. However, despite cleanups debris continues to accumulate over time with the potential for increased ocean emissions in subsequent years, especially during years with large flood events. Our approach is transferable to other urban rivers to understand the fate and flux of local debris, and therefore to inform effective mitigation initiatives."

Here, the authors report an indium-organic framework heterostructure that facilitates the conversion of CO2 and H2O into HCOOH and H2O2 under sunlight. 
 Overall artificial photosynthesis, as a promising approach for sunlight-driven CO2 recycling, requires photocatalysts with efficient light adsorption and separate active sites for coupling with H2O oxidation. Here we show a In-based metal–organic framework (MOF) heterostructure, i.e., In-porphyrin (In-TCPP) nanosheets enveloping an In-NH2-MIL-68 (M68N) core, via a facile one-pot synthesis that utilises competitive nucleation and growth of two organic linkers with In nodes. The coherent interfaces of the core@shell MOFs assure the structural stability of heterostructure, which will function as heterojunctions to facilitate the efficient transfer of photogenerated charge for overall photosynthesis. The In-TCPP shell in MOFs heterostructure improves CO2 adsorption capabilities and visible light absorption to enhance the photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Simultaneously, In-O sites in M68N core efficiently catalyze H2O oxidation, achieving high yields of HCOOH (397.5 μmol g−1 h−1) and H2O2 (321.2 μmol g−1 h−1) under focused sunlight irradiation. The superior performance of this heterostructure in overall photosynthesis, coupled with its straightforward synthesis, shows great potential for mitigating carbon emissions and producing valuable chemicals using solar energy.

Here, the authors provide a set of guidelines for best practices in the use these methods. 
 In-situ and operando techniques in heterogeneous electrocatalysis are a powerful tool used to elucidate reaction mechanisms. Ultimately, they are key in determining concrete links between a catalyst’s physical/electronic structure and its activity en route to designing next-generation systems. To this end, the exact execution and interpretation of these lines of experiments is critical as this determines the strength of conclusions that can be drawn and what uncertainties remain. Instead of focusing on how techniques were used to understand systems, as is the case with most reviews on the topic, this work instead initiates a nuanced discussion of 1) how to best carry out each technique and 2) initiate a nuanced analysis of which level of insights can be drawn from the set of in-situ or operando experiments/controls carried out. We focus on several commonly used techniques, including vibrational (IR, Raman) spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and electrochemical mass spectrometry. In addition to this, we include sections of reactor design and the link with theoretical modelling that are applicable across all techniques. While we focus on heterogeneous electrocatalysis, we make links when appropriate to the areas of photo- and thermo-catalytic systems. We highlight common pitfalls in the field, how to avoid them, and what sets of complementary experiments may be used to strengthen the analysis. We end with an overview of what gaps remain in in-situ and operando techniques and what innovations must be made to overcome them.

 The accumulation of large datasets by the scientific community has surpassed the capacity of traditional processing methods, underscoring the critical need for innovative and efficient algorithms capable of navigating through extensive existing experimental data. Addressing this challenge, our study introduces a machine learning (ML)-powered search engine specifically tailored for analyzing tera-scale high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data. This engine harnesses a novel isotope-distribution-centric search algorithm augmented by two synergistic ML models, assisting with the discovery of hitherto unknown chemical reactions. This methodology enables the rigorous investigation of existing data, thus providing efficient support for chemical hypotheses while reducing the need for conducting additional experiments. Moreover, we extend this approach with baseline methods for automated reaction hypothesis generation. In its practical validation, our approach successfully identified several reactions, unveiling previously undescribed transformations. Among these, the heterocycle-vinyl coupling process within the Mizoroki-Heck reaction stands out, highlighting the capability of the engine to elucidate complex chemical phenomena.

Here, by integrating bacterial genome and metagenome data with machine learning the authors show that genetic incompatibility is a main limiting factor, while co-occurrence of bacteria in the human microbiome and wastewater contributes to gene transfer. 
 The dissemination of mobile antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) via horizontal gene transfer is a significant threat to public health globally. The flow of ARGs into and between pathogens, however, remains poorly understood, limiting our ability to develop strategies for managing the antibiotic resistance crisis. Therefore, we aim to identify genetic and ecological factors that are fundamental for successful horizontal ARG transfer. We used a phylogenetic method to identify instances of horizontal ARG transfer in ~1 million bacterial genomes. This data was then integrated with >20,000 metagenomes representing animal, human, soil, water, and wastewater microbiomes to develop random forest models that can reliably predict horizontal ARG transfer between bacteria. Our results suggest that genetic incompatibility, measured as nucleotide composition dissimilarity, negatively influences the likelihood of transfer of ARGs between evolutionarily divergent bacteria. Conversely, environmental co-occurrence increases the likelihood, especially in humans and wastewater, in which several environment-specific dissemination patterns are observed. This study provides data-driven ways to predict the spread of ARGs and provides insights into the mechanisms governing this evolutionary process.

 The experimental realization of single-crystalline high-κ dielectrics beyond two-dimensional (2D) layered materials is highly desirable for nanoscale field-effect transistors (FETs). However, the scalable synthesis of 2D nonlayered high-κ insulators is currently limited by uncontrolled isotropic three-dimensional growth, hampering the achievement of simultaneous high dielectric constants and low trap densities for small film thicknesses. Herein, we show a 2D edge-seeded heteroepitaxial strategy to synthesize ultrathin nonlayered 2D CaNb2O6 nanosheets by chemical vapor deposition, exhibiting high-crystalline quality, thickness-independent dielectric constant (~ 16) and breakdown field strength up to ~ 12 MV cm−1. The MoS2/CaNb2O6 FETs exhibit an on/off ratio of over ~ 107, a subthreshold swing down to 61 mV/dec and a negligible hysteresis.

However, it is important that our policies do not forget about those who are immobile to migration. This perspective explores different forms of involuntary immobility and how climate policy can address this. 
 Globally, populations are increasingly located in areas at high risk of climate change impacts. Some populations lack the agency to move out of harm’s way, leading to involuntary immobility. The climate risks these populations face are insufficiently addressed in climate policy and disaster planning. While policy and planning should be data-informed, the lack of appropriate data should not limit governments and institutions from taking action to reduce the risk of involuntary immobility. Incorporating involuntary immobility within the broader sustainable development goals of climate action and safe, orderly, and regular migration may substantially reduce the risk of involuntary immobility.

 Temporal prediction is a fundamental function of neural systems. Recent results show that humans anticipate future events by calculating probability density functions, rather than hazard rates. However, direct neural evidence for this hypothesized mechanism is lacking. We recorded neural activity using magnetoencephalography as participants anticipated auditory and visual events distributed in time. We show that temporal anticipation, measured as reaction times, approximates the event probability density function, but not hazard rate. Temporal anticipation manifests as spatiotemporally patterned activity in three anatomically and functionally distinct parieto-temporal and sensorimotor cortical areas. Each of these areas revealed a marked neural signature of anticipation: Prior to sensory cues, activity in a specific frequency range of neural oscillations, spanning alpha and beta ranges, encodes the event probability density function. These neural signals predicted reaction times to imminent sensory cues. These results demonstrate that supra-modal representations of probability density across cortex underlie the anticipation of future events. The neural mechanisms that underlie temporal predictions remain unclear.

However, contrasting model-data isotopic trends in tropical mountains challenge interpretations and call for further investigation by the paleoclimate community. 
 Resolving discrepancies in long-term Holocene temperature trends between climate models and proxy records is essential to improve future climate projections. However, uncertainties in paleoclimate reconstructions limit their ability to constrain models. This study compares ice core-derived oxygen isotope records with isotope-enabled climate simulations to evaluate model performance and investigate Holocene temperature variability. Our results show that simulated and observed oxygen isotope trends in Greenland and West Antarctica are generally consistent, driven by orbital forcing. However, the model underestimates the early Holocene peak and subsequent decline observed in Greenland records. The most striking mismatch appears in tropical mountains, where the model shows a slight increase in isotopic trends, while proxy records indicate a clear decline. The mechanisms controlling this decreasing isotopic trend remain unclear and cannot be fully explained by temperature or hydroclimate changes alone. Addressing this tropical mountain oxygen isotope conundrum requires efforts to improve the model and paleoclimate interpretations.

 Antarctic glacier retreat and changing sea ice extent are long-standing global issues, yet their ecological impact on coastal food webs remains unclear. We analysed stable isotopes of diets and consumers at five sites along Marian Cove during the 2018–2019 austral summer. Carbon isotope enrichment near the glacier differed from outer sites, reflecting environmental heterogeneity. Over the past decade, limpets’ primary diet shifted from micro- to macroalgae due to increased light penetration and glacial nutrient input.

 Knowledge of anisotropy-induced spatial and temporal variations of land surface temperature (LST) is crucial for enhancing the quality of remote sensing products, refining land surface process modeling, and optimizing climate models. However, the limited availability of simultaneous multi-angle LST observations from space has hindered the exploration of this topic. NASA's latest ECOSTRESS sensor deployed on the International Space Station (ISS) generates multi-angle LST measurements at a 70-m spatial resolution for different times of day/night, providing a new avenue for investigating urban thermal anisotropy. In this study, we presented an initial examination of the performance of ECOSTRESS LST observations in unraveling the fine-grained urban thermal anisotropy, by taking the City of Phoenix, Arizona, United States, as the study area. We proposed a method to generate a quasi-simultaneous multi-angle ECOSTRESS LST dataset over the course of the diurnal cycle with the assistance of air temperature data from weather stations and hourly LST observations from a geostationary satellite, GOES-R. We then examined the thermal anisotropic patterns and their diurnal and seasonal variations across different Local Climate Zones (LCZs) at a spatial resolution of 200 m. Based on quasi-simultaneous multi-angle ECOSTRESS observations, Vinnikov and Vinnikov-RL models were employed to generate LCZ-scale anisotropy profiles of the study area to quantify and correct the LST directional effect. The results revealed that ECOSTRESS observations manifest unique angular patterns, featuring substantial variations in sensor viewing azimuth angles (VAA) and limited changes in sensor viewing zenith angles (VZA) within a 30° range. The angular effect led to notable variations in the observed LST, with potential deviations at the city scale of up to 10 K during winter and around 5 K during summer, relative to the nadir LST. Furthermore, the LST anisotropy exhibited distinct diurnal and seasonal patterns across LCZs, characterized by prominent variations in the intensity and width of hot/cold spots. LCZ 6, 9, and D typically displayed higher hotspot intensity and width than other LCZs at varying times of day in both summer and winter. In addition, the Vinnikov-RL model had good performance in simulating diurnal LST anisotropy over LCZs. This study reveals the potential of multi-angle ECOSTRESS LST observations in exploring urban thermal anisotropy, and contributes to better utilization of ECOSTRESS LST products. The integration of ECOSTRESS LST data with other satellite derived LST data have important implications for studying urban climate and improving long-term surface climate record, contributing to global climate studies."

 The integration of Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) data with Optical Photogrammetric Satellite Stereo Imagery (OPSSI) for Block Adjustment (BA) has emerged as a novel approach for generating large-area, high-accuracy Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). However, owing to the discrepancies between these two data platforms and the systematic errors of their sensors, errors arise in the BA fusion outcomes during the matching process of the two datasets. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a method aimed at enhancing the accuracy of the BA process. Initially, the multi-characteristic constraint is used to filter the ICESat-2 ATL08 product to obtain control points and check points. Subsequently, the Terrain Matching Correction is applied to control points, and then integrated with the GF-7 OPSSI for BA to generate DEM. Ultimately, the check points are employed to assess the accuracy of the established DEM. Experiments in a 2,000 km2 test area in the Wuding River Basin show that: (1) The inclusion of ICESat-2 data has remarkably enhanced the accuracy of DEM modeling utilizing GF-7 OPSSI, and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) has been reduced from the range of 5–10 m to 2–6 m. (2) Multi-characteristic constraint filtering is crucial for the identification of high quality ICESat-2 control points in flat and low relief areas. When implementing this filtering method, the established criteria should comprehensively consider both the quantity and the spatial distribution of control points to ensure optimal results. (3) Terrain Matching Correction on ICESat-2 data has effectively elevated the vertical accuracy of DEM modeling, particularly in regions with flat terrain. The RMSE of the vertical accuracy in such areas can be decreased by 1–3 m. In summary, the integration of spaceborne laser altimeter data with OPSSI holds immense significance for the production of large-scale and high-accuracy DEMs, offering a promising solution for terrain modeling and analysis on regional scales."

 Data primarily from the China Lightning Detection Network and dual-polarization radars were analyzed to investigate the cloud-to-ground lightning activity and its relationship with the thunderstorm structure in a supercell in Wuhan, Hubei, China, on May 14, 2021. This storm produced an EF3-scale (Enhanced Fujita Scale) tornado and exhibited complex variations in cloud-to-ground lightning activity. The dominant polarity of cloud-to-ground lightning transitioned from negative to positive and back to negative, with each polarity reversal accompanied by a decrease in cloud-to-ground lightning frequency. During a period when positive cloud-to-ground flashes accounted for 92.7 % of all cloud-to-ground flashes, the mean peak current reached an extraordinary 96.1 kA, significantly higher than during other periods or for negative cloud-to-ground lightning throughout the thunderstorm's lifetime. The tornado occurred near the peak of positive cloud-to-ground lightning activity. Based on an analysis of the relationship between cloud-to-ground lightning activity and the dynamic and microphysical parameters derived from radar data, it is deduced that the storm's charge structure likely evolved through the following sequence: an initial normal tripolar structure with predominant negative cloud-to-ground lightning, transitioning to an inverted tripolar structure during the dominance of positive cloud-to-ground lightning, followed by an inverted dipolar structure with a temporary increase and predominance of negative cloud-to-ground frequency, and finally returning to a normal tripolar structure characterized by high-frequency, predominantly negative cloud-to-ground lightning. The high peak current of positive cloud-to-ground lightning may be attributed to increased charge density from intense convection and a strong environmental electric field, particularly at lower lightning initiation altitudes."

 The elevated concentration of ammonium (NH4+) in PM2.5 is a significant contributor to haze formation. However, the reduction potential and sources of its precursor ammonia (NH3) remain unclear, particularly in the Sichuan Basin, where limited attention has been given to these issues. Here, daily PM2.5 samples were simultaneously collected from the cities of Chengdu and Chongqing between 1 September to 30 November 2017. The concentration of major water-soluble inorganic ions and the δ15N-NH4+ value in PM2.5 were measured. As a result, no significant difference in NH4+ concentration was observed between Chengdu (4.8 ± 3.4 μg m−3) and Chongqing (4.5 ± 2.7 μg m−3). Although clear differences in the major chemical forms of NH4+ in PM2.5 were identified, the rapid increase in ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) was a key factor in triggering haze formation in both cities. The reduction of NOx emission proved more effective than NH3 in mitigation aerosol pollution in the short term. However, the decrease in NH4NO3 concentrations was more pronounced, particularly on haze days, when both NH3 and NOx reductions were considered concurrently. The Bayesian Mixing Model (MixSIAR) revealed significant differences in the source-resolved structure of NH4+ between Chengdu and Chongqing. Specifically, combustion and volatile sources accounted for 47.7 % and 52.3 % in Chengdu, while they accounted for 65.1 % and 34.9 % in Chongqing. However, combustion emissions remain a major source of NH4+ in PM2.5 during haze days in both cities, contributing over 65 % of NH4+ concentrations. Based on these results, reducing combustion emissions is an effective strategy for mitigating haze pollution in Chengdu and Chongqing."
