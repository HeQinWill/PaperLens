Rodríguez;Daniel Rentsch;Zhimin Qiang;Urs von Gunten,"Ozone Reactions with Olefins and Alkynes: Kinetics, Activation Energies, and Mechanisms","The temperature dependence of the kinetics and the mechanisms of ozone reactions with 19 olefins and 3 alkynes were investigated. The second-order rate constants (kO3) for ozone reactions with olefins were mostly in the range of 103–106 M–1 s–1, with activation energies of 17.4–37.7 kJ mol–1. In comparison, alkynes had lower kO3 (∼102 M–1 s–1) and higher activation energies (36.7–48.1 kJ mol–1). Reactivities of both olefins and alkynes are mainly influenced by inductive effects of substituents, with steric effects observed for cyclic olefins. 2-Buten-1,4-dial (BDA), synthesized with a novel method, is a toxic olefinic oxidation product from phenols. Its cis- and trans-isomers show distinct reactivities with ozone, with kO3 (20 °C) of 3.0 × 103 and 1.2 × 104 M–1 s–1, respectively. Two mols of glyoxal were formed per mol of ozonated BDA, with a slow release of the second mol from an α-hydroxyalkylhydroperoxide intermediate. 2-Ethynylbenzaldehyde reacts with ozone with a stoichiometry of 1:1 and kO3 (20 °C) = 1.6 × 102 M–1 s–1. Ozone attacks the ethynyl group, yielding a carboxyl product (2-carboxybenzaldehyde, 54%), an aldehyde product (phthaldialdehyde), and a dicarbonyl product with a stoichiometric release of H2O2 (21%). This study provides kinetic and mechanistic information for assessing the abatement of olefin- and alkyne-containing micropollutants by ozonation at various temperatures."

However, the impact of fluctuation duration on biogeochemical processes remains unclear. We hypothesized that rates of FeIII reduction and CH4 production are sensitive to the duration of soil oxygenation. To test this, surface soil from the Luquillo Forest, Puerto Rico, was subjected to fluctuating redox conditions with an anoxic interval of 6 days followed by oxic intervals of either 8, 24, or 72 h. Shorter oxic intervals enhanced Fe reduction, while longer oxic intervals enhanced CH4 emissions. As O2 exposure decreased from 72 to 8 h, Fe reduction rates increased from 0.12 ± 0.02 to 0.26 ± 0.05 mmol kg–1 h–1, whereas cumulative CH4 decreased from 44.0 ± 4.7 to 12.7 ± 4.6 μmol kg–1. 13C-amino acid spikes were preferentially incorporated into the DNA of iron reducers (Anaeromyxobacter sp.) in the shorter oxic treatment (8 h vs 24 h), suggesting that Fe reducers are less inhibited by shorter periods of oxidation. Conversely, longer oxygen pulses appear to suppress Fe reducers more than methanogens, leading to increased CH4 emissions. These findings highlight the role of the redox oscillation length in modulating biogeochemical processes and greenhouse gas emissions in soils."

In this study, we elucidate for the first time the role of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in enhancing oxygen activation on manganese oxide (γ-MnO2) surface, thereby facilitating the oxidation of nitric oxide (NO) to nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The theoretical calculation results further demonstrate that the adsorbed SO2 and the formed sulfate can promote the adsorption of O2 and the reactivity of surface reactive oxygen species toward NO oxidation on γ-MnO2 (110) surface, respectively. During SO2 with O2 reaction, the formation of surface sulfate and surface-active oxygen atoms serves as new active sites to facilitate the oxidation of NO to NO2. Comparative analysis of the energy profiles reveals that NO oxidation with SO2 can release more heat energy than that without SO2, indicating enhanced thermodynamic accessibility in the presence of SO2. Therefore, a novel mechanism for the sulfate-mediated activation of O2 is proposed, which sheds light on the synergistic effects of multiple pollutants in heterogeneous reactions and is significant for understanding NO oxidation both in the atmosphere and in exhaust treatment."

Deaths Attributable to Unsafe Sanitation in Rural areas (DAUSRs) are influenced by demographic factors, disease mortality rates, and environmental sanitation conditions. However, most studies have been limited in scope and scale and lack a comprehensive evaluation framework for global DAUSRs. Therefore, this study estimated the global DAUSRs from 2000 to 2030, using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) and the World Health Organization (WHO). We employed methods such as comparable risk assessment, Bayesian age (period) models, and AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. Changes in the DAUSRs and their influencing factors were evaluated by applying a decomposition method to assess the impact of population dynamics, sanitation conditions, age structure, and disease mortality rates. The results indicated that despite improvements in rural sanitation, 12.2% of rural populations will still lack access to sanitary toilets in 2030, with an estimated 243,000 deaths (CI: 147,000–441,000) due to unsafe rural sanitation environments. This outcome highlights the need for better rural sanitation governance to provide for demographic shifts, such as aging and declining fertility rates, which are key drivers of DAUSRs. Regions such as Africa and Southeast Asia are at a higher risk with higher diarrhea-related mortality rates in rural areas. We suggest comprehensive measures, including enhancing rural medical facilities, improving sanitation infrastructure, and focusing on vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and children. These measures could inform global rural environmental and public health policies."

The source of the sedimentary materials that formed the plateau, as well as the mechanism for the red clay/loess transition, are yet unexplained. This study attributes this transition to changes in groundwater temperature. Isotopic analyses, including δ18O‐δ2H, 3H in water bodies, and Pb isotopes in soil, reveal that the LP is predominantly recharged by deep‐circulating groundwater from the Tibetan Plateau. During soil formation, groundwater traversing the lithosphere reached supercritical temperatures, extracting and transporting mineral elements that precipitated to form features characteristic of the red clay layer, such as dolomite and iron‐manganese deposits. This process persisted until approximately 2.6 Ma, when groundwater temperatures dropped below supercritical levels, initiating the accumulation of loess."

In Antarctica, they manifest primarily as a muted and phase‐shifted temperature signal, but recent studies suggest an additional in‐phase component. Here, we analyze the Southern Hemisphere (SH) response to spontaneous DO‐type oscillations in a general circulation model. The dominant Antarctic temperature mode is phase‐shifted compared to Greenland temperature variations and consistent with the oceanic pathway described by the bipolar seesaw model. However, the leading SH atmospheric circulation mode varies synchronously with Greenland temperatures. A westward‐shifted Walker circulation and strengthened Hadley cell during Greenland temperature maxima cause zonally heterogeneous jet stream anomalies differing from the Southern Annular Mode pattern. Comparison of simulated δ18 ${\delta }^{18}$O with speleothems and ice cores indicates a good agreement in the tropics and SH mid‐latitudes but deviations in Antarctica warrant further research."

Subsurface released methane is reactively transported toward ground surface with a portion converted to carbon dioxide by soil microbes. Currently, the extent to which fugitive CH4 oxidation occurs, including microbial taxa responsible and controlling parameters are poorly understood. Here, we examined fugitive CH4 leakage at a legacy well in the Montney region of British Columbia, Canada and find up to 90% is oxidized at rates as high as 230 g of CH4/m2 of soils/day during summer. Meanwhile, a profound difference in microbiome between soils at the wellhead and background was observed, while modeling suggests that prevailing seasonal temperature will moderate CH4 oxidation extent. Overall, we find that filtration of fugitive CH4 through natural soils can significantly reduce emissions of CH4 and mitigate climate impacts from such sources."

However, our understanding of CH4 production and emission from these important carbon sinks is limited. Here we conducted biogeochemical experiments to identify methylotrophic methanogenesis as the primary methanogenesis pathway in a tropical seagrass meadow. The production rate constant was 2.2–3.9 d−1, significantly higher than those in temperate meadows (<0.02 d−1). The CH4 emission rate from the meadow was 835 ± 124 μmol m−2 d−1. A global meta‐analysis further revealed the CH4 emission rate in tropical seagrass meadows is approximately 8 times higher than temperate meadows. Global seagrass meadows emit 0.3 Tg CH4 yr−1, with over 90% from tropical meadows and resulting in an 8.6% reduction of the seagrass carbon burial on a 20‐year time horizon. These findings highlight the role of tropical seagrass meadows as CH4 sources, which can offset the benefits of seagrass carbon sequestration."

Previous studies have indicated that the SSS in the western tropical Pacific (WTP) Ocean exhibits significant decadal variability, which plays an important role in shaping tropical climate. Here we find that the amplitude of SSS decadal variability in the WTP has been intensified significantly since the early 1950s. A comprehensive analysis of the salinity budget indicates that the amplifying of SSS decadal variability in the WTP is primarily attributed to changes in both the freshwater flux and ocean dynamics. During the past decades, surface currents in the WTP get stronger and result in enhanced salinity advection. In addition, the amplitude of decadal variability of freshwater flux is increased as well due to anomalous atmospheric circulation associated with the Victoria mode."

Here, 14 years of unique spaceborne‐radar observations over the Greenland Ice Sheet provide an observational constraint on increased rain occurrence in a warming climate. Combining these satellite‐based precipitation observations with near‐surface temperature reveals the spatial and temporal distribution of modern (2006–2020) snow and rain. This distribution serves as the foundation for determining the increase in Greenland rain due to atmospheric warming alone. Rain doubles under 2.3°C of local near‐surface warming. With 10.7°C of warming, half of all precipitation observations become rain. Projected 21st century warming would lead to a rain‐dominated precipitation record at low elevations with rain possible anywhere on the ice sheet.

Here, we report the inverse melting of vortices in an amorphous Re6Zr thin film with moderate vortex pinning under the application of a magnetic field. By imaging the vortex state using a scanning tunnelling microscope, we show that at low fields and temperatures, the vortices form a “pinned liquid”, that is characterised by low mobility of the vortices and vortex density that is spatially inhomogeneous. As the temperature or magnetic field is increased, the vortices get ordered, eventually forming a nearly perfect vortex solid before melting again into a liquid.

Here the authors show that in response to bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid during cholestasis, endothelial Myc activation triggers P-selectin expression, promoting neutrophil infiltration and liver damage. 
 Cholestatic liver diseases are characterized by excessive bile acid accumulation in the liver. Endothelial cells (ECs) shape the local microenvironment in both normal conditions and liver injury, yet their role in cholestasis is unclear. Through a comparative analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data from various murine models of liver injury, we identify distinctive Myc activation within ECs during obstructive cholestasis resulting from bile duct ligation (BDL). Myc overexpression in ECs significantly upregulates P-selectin, increasing neutrophil infiltration and worsening cholestatic liver injury. This process occurs through the FXR, activated by chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and its conjugate TCDCA. Inhibiting P-selectin with PSI-697 reduces neutrophil recruitment and alleviates injury. Cholestatic patient liver samples also show elevated Myc and P-selectin in ECs, along with increased neutrophils. The findings identify ECs as key drivers of cholestatic liver injury through a Myc-driven program and suggest that targeting the CDCA/FXR/Myc/P-selectin axis may offer a therapeutic approach.

Here the authors report a reproducible method to fabricate high-impedance granular Al resonators, followed by integration with quantum dot devices, achieving record hole-photon coupling strength. 
 High kinetic inductance superconductors are gaining increasing interest for the realisation of qubits, amplifiers and detectors. Moreover, thanks to their high impedance, quantum buses made of such materials enable large zero-point fluctuations of the voltage, boosting the coupling rates to spin and charge qubits. However, fully exploiting the potential of disordered or granular superconductors is challenging, as their inductance and, therefore, impedance at high values are difficult to control. Here, we report a reproducible fabrication of granular aluminium resonators by developing a wireless ohmmeter, which allows in situ measurements during film deposition and, therefore, control of the kinetic inductance of granular aluminium films. Reproducible fabrication of circuits with impedances (inductances) exceeding 13 kΩ (1 nH per square) is now possible. By integrating a 7.9 kΩ resonator with a germanium double quantum dot, we demonstrate strong charge-photon coupling with a rate of gc/2π = 566 ± 2 MHz. This broadly applicable method opens the path for novel qubits and high-fidelity, long-distance two-qubit gates.

 The foundation model, trained on extensive and diverse datasets, has shown strong performance across numerous downstream tasks.

Therefore, we propose the Vision Foundation Model General Lightweight (VFMGL) framework, which facilitates the decentralized construction of expert clinical models for various medical tasks.

A subsequent detailed characterization of parasites devoid of the apicoplast organelle provides unprecedented insights into its constituents, evolution and functions, uncovering new vulnerabilities. 
 The apicoplast, a relic plastid organelle derived from secondary endosymbiosis, is crucial for many medically relevant Apicomplexa. While it no longer performs photosynthesis, the organelle retains several essential metabolic pathways. In this study, we examine the four primary metabolic pathways in the Toxoplasma gondii apicoplast, along with an accessory pathway, and identify conditions that can bypass these. Contrary to the prevailing view that the apicoplast is indispensable for T. gondii, we demonstrate that bypassing all pathways renders the apicoplast non-essential. We further show that T. gondii lacking an apicoplast (T. gondii−Apico) can be maintained indefinitely in culture, establishing a unique model to study the functions of this organelle. Through comprehensive metabolomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses of T. gondii−Apico we uncover significant adaptation mechanisms following loss of the organelle and identify numerous putative apicoplast proteins revealed by their decreased abundance in T. gondii−Apico. Moreover, T. gondii−Apico parasites exhibit reduced sensitivity to apicoplast targeting compounds, providing a valuable tool for discovering new drugs acting on the organelle. The capability to culture T. gondii without its plastid offers new avenues for exploring apicoplast biology and developing novel therapeutic strategies against apicomplexan parasites.

 Known fetal haemoglobin (HbF)-modulating loci explain 10–24% variation of HbF level in Africans with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), compared to 50% among Europeans. Here, we report fourteen candidate loci from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of HbF level in patients with SCD from Cameroon, Tanzania, and the United States of America. We present results of cell-based experiments for FLT1 candidate, demonstrating expression in early haematopoiesis and a possible involvement in hypoxia associated HbF induction. Our study employed genotyping arrays that capture a broad range of African and non-African genetic variation and replicated known loci (BCL11A and HBS1L-MYB). We estimated the heritability of HbF level in SCD at 94%, higher than estimated in unselected Europeans, and suggesting a robust capture of HbF-associated loci by these arrays. Our approach, which involved genotype imputation against six reference haplotype panels and association analysis with each of the panels, proved superior over selecting a best-performing panel, evidenced by a substantial proportion of panel-specific (up to 18%) and a low proportion of shared (28%) imputed variants across the panels.

 Prenatal exposure to metals has been associated with impaired neurodevelopment in children, but the detailed molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Based on the Wuhan Healthy Baby Cohort, China (N = 1088), eleven metals were measured in maternal urine during early pregnancy (13.1 ± 1.1 weeks) and metabolomics profiling was conducted in cord blood. Neurodevelopment was evaluated using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development in 2-year-old children to obtain the mental development index (MDI) and psychomotor development index (PDI). After false discovery rate correction, higher maternal urinary levels of manganese, nickel, aluminum, rubidium, gallium, and the summary score of metals were only significantly associated with lower MDI scores. The weighted quantile sum index of the metal mixture showed a significant inverse association with MDI and PDI scores, with aluminum contributing the most to the associations. Histidine, beta-alanine, purine, and pyrimidine metabolism significantly mediated the above associations, suggesting that disturbances in amino acids, neurotransmitter and neuroendocrine metabolism may be important mediators in contributing to impaired neurodevelopment of children.

Here, we perform simulations to reconstruct the EAMS circulation on the basis of sea levels from −90 to 0 m of the present, using a high-resolution regional ocean circulation model under present-day fixed surface and lateral boundary conditions. Our results show that the EAMS circulation underwent twice abrupt changes: a rapid initiation of its modern structure when sea level rise exceeded −40 m, followed by a temporary overshoot of the Japan-Sea throughflows at −5 m. These nonlinear processes are caused by the opening of the Soya Strait and thus formation of the modern EAMS-circulation structure, and a transient absence of the circulation resembling a Kuroshio Large Meander following around-island integral constraint, respectively. Conceptually, our findings introduce the around-island integral constraint on abrupt shift in the global marginal-sea circulation during the last deglaciation."

 Observational records during the past several decades show a marked increase in boreal winter extreme US hydroclimate events, with extreme floods and droughts becoming more common. Coincidentally, El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a key driver of US precipitation and associated extreme hydroclimate on interannual time scales, has also increased in amplitude and is projected to continue increasing throughout the 21st century. This study examines future changes in ENSO and its impacts on the US winter extreme hydroclimate events (e.g., drought and flood) by using a large ensemble simulation. Results in this study show that both the amplitude of ENSO and ENSO-induced atmospheric teleconnections are projected to strengthen, leading to a significant increase in US precipitation variability and extreme hydroclimate events, albeit with notable regional differences. Signal-to-noise ratio analysis shows that the ENSO signal explains a significantly increased fraction of the total variance in US winter precipitation compared to non-ENSO factors (i.e., noise), suggesting a growing role of ENSO in future US extreme hydroclimate events. Further analysis shows that while both the increase in ENSO amplitude and the atmospheric response to ENSO have a similar impact on the hydroclimate over the Southeast and Southwest US, the amplification of the atmospheric response to ENSO plays a more dominant role in the Northeast US."

 Soil moisture is coupled with vegetation and atmosphere, influencing global cycling of water, carbon, and energy. However, it remains unclear how soil moisture-atmosphere interactions affect land-atmosphere carbon and water exchanges simultaneously. Using Earth system model experiments, we show widespread carbon-water trade-offs between net ecosystem production and precipitation-minus-evapotranspiration driven by soil moisture dynamics. Soil moisture positively controls net ecosystem production and negatively affects precipitation-minus-evapotranspiration, through direct soil water stress and indirect soil moisture-atmosphere feedbacks. While soil moisture variability magnifies the interannual variability of net ecosystem production, it moderates that of precipitation-minus-evapotranspiration over land. These opposing effects lead to a pronounced carbon-water trade-off, which originates from the interplay between carbon acquisition through photosynthesis and water extraction through evapotranspiration. This trade-off is projected to intensify in a warming and drying future, as soil moisture increasingly regulates carbon and water exchanges, posing a serious challenge to sustaining both terrestrial carbon sink and water supply.

 Rivers are crucial to biogeochemical cycles, connecting terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric systems. However, their ecosystems are increasingly threatened by extreme weather events. Here we used the environmental DNA approach to assess the impact of extreme drought-heatwave events on the aquatic plankton communities of the Yangtze River. We showed that an extreme drought-heatwave event reduced the α diversity of communities, increased their β diversity, and simultaneously simplified and destabilized community network structure. This event also shifted the dominant algae taxa from Bacillariophyta to Cyanobacteria, accompanied by increases in organic carbon and labile organic carbon contents. Globally, temperature rises during this extreme drought-heatwave event are more pronounced in high-latitude regions, likely amplifying impacts on river ecosystem biodiversity and stability.

 Basal melting of Antarctic ice shelves is primarily driven by heat delivery from warm Circumpolar Deep Water. Here we classify near-shelf water masses in an eddy-resolving numerical model of the Southern Ocean to develop a unified view of warm water intrusion onto the Antarctic continental shelf. We identify four regimes on seasonal timescales. In regime 1 (East Antarctica), heat intrusions are driven by easterly winds via Ekman dynamics. In regime 2 (West Antarctica), intrusion is primarily determined by the strength of a shelf-break undercurrent. In regime 3, the warm water cycle on the shelf is in antiphase with dense shelf water production (Adélie Coast). Finally, in regime 4 (Weddell and Ross seas), shelf-ward warm water inflow occurs along the western edge of canyons during periods of dense shelf water outflow.

 The increasing frequency of extreme hot events poses significant societal and scientific challenges due to their adverse impacts on human and natural systems, compounded by their unpredictable nature. Climate models are essential for investigating root causes and anticipating long-term changes, yet their accuracy is limited by inherent uncertainties and errors. While observational constraint theories offer promise in addressing model issues, they often rely on empirical region-specific relationships. Here, we show that future changes in hot extremes and their uneven spread critically depend on historical thermal distributions, with variability playing a key role. We develop a universal analytical approach that combines observations with model outcomes, aiming for more reliable projections. Results reveal that hot event probabilities may grow faster than models imply across much of the global land. In vulnerable regions, increases could exceed model predictions by nearly twofold, even at low global warming levels.

 Understanding if earthquakes of different sizes start in the same way and whether the growth process of the rupture of large earthquakes is predictable are fundamental questions in earthquake physics. Recent studies indicate the onsets of seismic waves from small and large earthquakes exhibit similar characteristics, suggesting that an earthquake’s onset does not dictate its final size. However, the factors controlling this process remain unclear. A systematic comparison of 24 years of high-sensitivity seismograph records using cross-correlation for ~75,000 events reveals 125 extremely similar and 1939 similar pairs of co-located large and small earthquakes. An extremely high similarity is observed for pairs of earthquakes occurring on simple faults (44 of 55 large events), whereas large earthquakes occurring on complex faults have a low probability of cascading rupture. Estimating the probability of cascading rupture based primarily on fault geometry can improve the predictability of future earthquakes with a more quantitative size estimation.

Combined with other regional records, we demonstrate that the Westerlies were poleward of their current position during the Early Holocene.

 The emission, transmission, and secondary generation of atmospheric pollutants occur not only in proximity to the ground but also at elevated altitudes. Vertical distribution plays a pivotal role in understanding the intricate mechanisms that govern atmospheric pollutants. Although ground-based remote sensing offers valuable insights into vertical pollutant profiles, it is limited to obtaining vertical profiles at specific locations, which cannot capture the spatially continuous distribution of vertical profiles at the city scale. Thus, these methods cannot fully support the understanding of high-altitude transport and vertical exchange of atmospheric pollutants. This study proposes a multimodal intermediate fusion (MIF) architecture based on a residual network. Using inputs such as satellite data and meteorological parameters tied to profiles retrieved by multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscope (MAX-DOAS), we reconstruct the daytime high spatial resolution (1 × 1 × 0.1 km) and temporal resolution (15 min) NO2 spatiotemporal distribution. The mean correlation between MIF reconstructions and ground-based in situ observations from the China National Environmental Monitoring Center reaches 0.813, and the correlation with TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 data reaches 0.750–0.796 in the different distance groups. The MIF performance significantly exceeds that of the WRF-Chem model in terms of resolution and accuracy. The full-coverage high-resolution 3D NO2 distribution allows us to analyze the distribution of NO2 and estimate its transport, revealing an annual net output of 0.780 Gg of NO2 from Hefei's urban areas. The vertical transport at high altitudes in urban areas is 28.2 % higher than that in the suburban regions. Notably, the annual high-altitude NO2 transport from 8:00 to 16:00 local time constitutes approximately 23.7 % of the annual NOX emissions in the Hefei urban area. During pollution events, the MIF reconstructions can identify two typical processes: 1) transport from elevated altitudes to ground level, and 2) external transport from the urban surface to high altitudes and then transport to suburban areas from elevated altitudes, ultimately reaching the suburban surface. The 3D NO2 distribution reconstructed by MIF may help understand the impact of high-altitude transport and the vertical exchange of pollutants on atmospheric pollution and can serve as a scientific basis for air pollution control policies."

 Accurate retrieval of sea surface wind speed is crucial for ecological research and marine resource development. The advent of satellite technology provides a feasible approach for global wind speed retrieval. As a photon-counting lidar, ICESat-2 provides unparalleled details of the sea surface and has the potential for sea surface wind speed retrieval. To facilitate the retrieval of sea surface wind speed from ICESat-2, a vertical ocean signal distribution model of ICESat-2 was established, and then training samples were collected by changing the parameters and inputted into the back propagation neural network to fit the relationship between the ICESat-2 vertical distribution signal and the sea surface wind speed. The model considered both environmental factors (solar noise, atmospheric absorption, sea surface reflection, water backscattering, etc.) and hardware characteristics (the spatial and temporal distribution of laser energy, dead time, and dark noise of the detectors, etc.). The validation against MERRA-2 data revealed that the RMSE is 1.57 m/s for nighttime and 1.89 m/s for daytime, while buoy comparisons showed RMSE values of 1.53 m/s for nighttime and 1.82 m/s for daytime. Additionally, comparisons of global monthly mean results also agree well, underscoring the capability of ICESat-2 in sea surface wind speed retrieval."

 Unmixing optical properties (OP) of land covers from coarse spatial resolution images is crucial for microclimate and energy balance studies. We propose the Unmixing Spectral method using Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model (US-DART), a novel approach for unmixing endmember OP in the shortwave domain from mono- or multispectral remotely sensed images. US-DART comprises four modules: pure pixel selection, linear spectral mixture analysis, gradient iterations, and spectral correlation. US-DART requires a surface reflectance image, a 3D mock-up with facets’ group information, and standard DART parameters (e.g., spatial resolution and skylight ratio) as inputs, producing an OP map for each scene element. The accuracy of US-DART is evaluated using two types of scenes (vegetation and urban) and images (Sentinel-2 surface reflectance and DART-simulated pseudo-satellite images). Results demonstrate a median relative error of approximately 0.1 % for pixel reflectance, with higher accuracy for opaque surfaces compared to translucent materials. Excluding co-registration errors and sensor noise, the median relative error of OP is typically around 1 % for opaque elements and 1–5 % for translucent elements with an accurate a priori “reflectance-transmittance” ratio. US-DART enhances our ability to derive detailed OP from coarse-resolution imagery, potentially enabling more accurate modeling of spatial resolution conversions, and energy dynamics, including albedo and shortwave radiation balance, across diverse environments."

Hardiman,Understanding the effects of spatial scaling on the relationship between urban structure and biodiversity,"•LiDAR-derived metrics exhibit scale-dependent relationships with bird diversity. •The effect of building volume on diversity declines as the spatial scale increases. •Canopy structure metrics affect diversity more as the spatial scale increases. 
 Consideration of spatial dependence in heterogeneous urban landscapes is crucial for understanding how urban landscapes shape biodiversity. However, understanding the linkage between urban landscape patterns, both vertically and horizontally, and urban-dwelling bird species at various spatial scales remains an unsolved question. Here, we investigated how patterns of vertical and horizontal urban landscape structure influence urban-dwelling bird species at various spatial scales in the Chicago Region. We utilize a high-density Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) dataset to exam ALS-derived metrics (foliage height diversity, canopy openness, and building volume) in relation to bird diversity.Our results show that LiDAR-derived metrics exhibited significant variation across spatial scales. The negative impact of building volume on bird species is greatest at the smallest scale (slope = -0.24 at 50 m radius), but its effect declined as the scale increased (slope = 0.00 at 500 m radius). Foliage height diversity did not influence bird diversity at small spatial scales but shows a positive effect on bird diversity over 150 m radius (slope = 0.05 to 0.11). Canopy openness changed its sign of slope from negative to positive as the buffer radius increased (between 150 and 200 m buffer radii), indicating that openness may have different roles depending on the spatial scale. Based on our findings, a buffer radius of 150–200 m was concluded to be the threshold distinguishing local and landscape-level variables in this study.In general, horizontal landscape patterns have a stronger influence on urban biodiversity than vertical structures. However, our findings suggest that enhancing the vertical complexity of canopy structures in existing green spaces could be an effective strategy for sustaining bird diversity in urban areas, particularly where expanding green spaces is not feasible. Our study enhances the understanding of urban biodiversity dynamics and provides practical implications for urban landscape management and planning."

 Satellite video super-resolution (SR) aims to generate high-resolution (HR) frames from multiple low-resolution (LR) frames. To exploit motion cues under complicated motion patterns, most CNN-based methods first perform motion compensation and then aggregate motion cues in aligned frames (features). However, due to the low spatial resolution of satellite videos, the moving scales are usually subtle and difficult to be captured in the spatial domain. Furthermore, various scales of moving objects challenge current satellite video SR methods in motion estimation and compensation. To address these challenges for satellite video SR, we propose PhaseVSRnet to convert satellite video frames into the phase domain. By representing the motion information with phase shifts, the subtle motions are enlarged in the phase domain. Specifically, our PhaseVSRnet employs deep complex convolutions to better exploit the inherent correlation of complex-valued decompositions obtained by complex-valued steerable pyramids. Then, we adopt a coarse-to-fine motion compensation mechanism to eliminate phase ambiguity at different levels. Finally, in hierarchical reconstruction stage, we use the multi-scale fusion module to aggregate features from multiple levels and use an upsampling layer to upsample the feature maps for resolution enhancement. With PhaseVSRnet, we effectively address the subtle motions and varying scales of moving objects in satellite videos. We assess its performance on a satellite video SR dataset from Jilin-1 satellites and evaluate its generalization ability on another SR dataset from OVS-1 satellites. The results show that PhaseVSRnet effectively captures motion cues in the phase domain and exhibits strong generalization capability across different satellite sensors in unseen scenarios."

 The apportionment of equivalent black carbon (eBC) to combustion sources from liquid fuels (mainly fossil; eBCLF) and solid fuels (mainly non-fossil; eBCSF) is commonly performed using data from Aethalometer instruments (AE approach). This study evaluates the feasibility of using AE data to determine the absorption Ångström exponents (AAEs) for liquid fuels (AAELF) and solid fuels (AAESF), which are fundamental parameters in the AE approach. AAEs were derived from Aethalometer data as the fit in a logarithmic space of the six absorption coefficients (470–950 nm) versus the corresponding wavelengths. The findings indicate that AAELF can be robustly determined as the 1st percentile (PC1) of AAE values from fits with R2 > 0.99. This R2-filtering was necessary to remove extremely low and noisy-driven AAE values commonly observed under clean atmospheric conditions (i.e., low absorption coefficients). Conversely, AAESF can be obtained from the 99th percentile (PC99) of unfiltered AAE values. To optimize the signal from solid fuel sources, winter data should be used to calculate PC99, whereas summer data should be employed for calculating PC1 to maximize the signal from liquid fuel sources. The derived PC1 (AAELF) and PC99 (AAESF) values ranged from 0.79 to 1.08, and 1.45 to 1.84, respectively. The AAESF values were further compared with those constrained using the signal at mass-to-charge 60 (m/z 60), a tracer for fresh biomass combustion, measured using aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) and aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS) instruments deployed at 16 sites. Overall, the AAESF values obtained from the two methods showed strong agreement, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.78. However, uncertainties in both approaches may vary due to site-specific sources, and in certain environments, such as traffic-dominated sites, neither approach may be fully applicable."

 Understanding the dynamic variations, potential sources and corresponding health risks of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is essential for developing emission reduction strategies to lower their concentrations and associated health risks. Measurements with 2-h resolution of 16 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) priority-controlled PAHs in atmospheric PM2.5 were carried out at the beginning and midterm of the heating season in urban Beijing during 2020. The measurements utilized an enhanced comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography mass spectrometry with aerosol thermal desorption technique. The daily average concentrations of PM2.5-bound PAHs range from 27.3 to 34.8 ng/m3 in November at the beginning of the heating season, while elevated to 47.9–77.8 ng/m3 in December during the midterm of the heating season. The ratio of PAHs to PM2.5 during the midterm of the heating season is four times higher than that at the beginning. This increase was due to the rise in concentrations of naphthalene (NaP), fluorene (FLR), and phenanthrene (PHE), along with the decrease in PM2.5 concentrations in December. The overall diurnal variations exhibit high levels at night and early morning, contrasting with lower levels in the afternoon. However, compared to the beginning of the heating season, the diurnal variations of PAHs during the midterm show more pronounced enhancement and stronger fluctuations. Throughout the observation periods, coal and wood combustion from the local region surrounding Beijing are the primary emission sources of the 16 PAHs, indicating increased combustion emissions in winter due to higher heating demands. High time-resolution measurements captured transient high health risks by 16 PAHs, with the benzo(a)pyrene equivalent concentration (BaPeq) temporarily exceeded 5 ng/m3, which may result in short-term acute or subacute health effects. This study provides novel understanding on the pollution of PAHs in atmospheric PM2.5 during the heating season."

 This study examines the three-dimensional (3D) microphysical and dynamical structure of the lower positive (LP) charge region within a normal tripole charge structure in a supercell thunderstorm that occurred over the Kanto Plain on August 27, 2018. The investigation utilizes hydrometeor classification and 3D wind retrieval data from dual-polarization radars, along with charge polarity classification data from a 3D lightning mapper. Key findings reveal that water-related hydrometeors (inferred as large raindrops, water-coated graupel, and/or water-coated hail) accounted for 52 % of the LP charges. Among these, water-coated hail exhibited a propensity for LP charging approximately 40 times greater than that of other hydrometeors, whereas graupel exhibited a propensity approximately 2.5 times greater. This suggests that radar-inferred graupel is not the most suitable proxy for LP charges in this event. LP charges were distributed from the bounded weak echo region associated with updrafts to the rear convergence zone. Liquid-water-related particles were more prevalent in the updraft region, while graupel and hail were more commonly observed in the downdraft. Based on these findings, the mechanisms underlying LP charge generation were elucidated. The presence of water-related particles in specific differential phase columns accompanying the updraft suggests that the shedding process may contribute to LP charge formation. This assumption aligns with previous hypotheses, supported by laboratory experiments, proposing that the removal of negatively charged liquid water from ice surfaces results in positive charging of ice particles. By correlating polarimetric radar variables with hydrometeor types and kinematic properties on a grid-by-grid basis, this study enhances our understanding of the 3D microphysical characteristics of the LP charge region and may provide important insights into lightning monitoring via radar observations."
