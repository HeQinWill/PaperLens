In this work, we identified and evaluated available databases (DBs) on chemicals in products and articles from the literature using a defined protocol and from European national market surveillance authorities, nongovernmental agencies, and industrial sector groups using questionnaires. This is the first comprehensive review of DBs that provide information about chemicals in products and articles. A majority of these DBs are heterogeneous in terms of scope, ontologies, and data structures. Among the 57 identified DBs, 49 identified specific substances and only 30 reported their concentration in their products. In addition, 35 DBs included hazard information and 27 DBs provided safety information about products or chemicals. The analysis highlights the lack of comprehensive or accessible data on chemicals in products and articles for most categories of products/articles and jurisdictions. The limitations of existing DBs were attributed to scattered regulatory information requirements, a lack of data for unregulated substances, the complexity of supply chain communication, and confidentiality issues. In response to these challenges, we identified opportunities for improving existing information transfer structures and exploring alternative data sources to promote product and article safety and circularity."

Chemical precipitation and Mg electrocoagulation, although often studied and applied for N and P recovery as struvite, suffer from inherent drawbacks. The former generates poorly settling sludge and re-releases natural organic matter, while the latter encounters issues such as active anode passivation and complex struvite deposition. We propose and validate a new magnesite-assisted electrochemical system that achieved 100.0% NH4+ and 66.9% PO43– removal in easily recoverable struvite without suffering from anode passivation. The system’s core lies in the in situ utilization of the local low-pH environment established via water electrolysis by the anode-packed magnesite minerals, providing an affordable, passivation-free, and tunable Mg source. Meanwhile, the cathode emerges in a local high-pH atmosphere, serving as the sole site for high-purity and condensed struvite precipitation and collection. On top of technological development, we validate a co-treatment concept for the recovery of struvite from mixed wastewater, demonstrating potential cost savings of 76.9% and a 22.4% reduction in CO2 emissions. Our work offers a new design for enhanced struvite recovery and outlines a green route for co-managing different waste streams and producing valuable products."

We found the UMC of Lake Superior to be net heterotrophic (primary production < ecosystem respiration) most of the time, suggesting its role as a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere. Heterotrophy was pronounced during cold and transitional days (<14°C) and in nearshore regions (<10 km distance from the shore).

In response, we introduce a novel approach that utilizes deep neural networks (DNN) to reconstruct global three‐dimensional zenith hydrostatic delay (ZHD) and zenith wet delays (ZWD) derived from numerical weather models (NWM). Our method reconstructs NWM‐derived ZHD and ZWD globally up to 14 km above the Earth's surface, with average precision levels of 0.4 and 0.8 mm, respectively.

The similar molar ratios of elements before and after landfall confirm that the source of PM2.5 is associated with the local terrigenous sediment. The ratio of Na+/Cl− in the TC eyewall is approximately 5:1 indicating the existence of chlorine depletion. Meanwhile, the concentration of Cl− and molar ratios like Si/Fe inside the TC eyewall show a rapid increase, and reach a peak in the TC eye, indicating that marine particulate matter invades and presents a treasure‐bowl‐like stepwise aggregation.

Here, we used mercury (Hg) isotopes from pelagic and continental successions at low paleo‐latitudes to track the perturbations of the global carbon (C) cycle and the climatic impact. Our results indicate that small‐scale volcanism promoted marine organic C burial, and the concomitant extreme cooling triggered the waning of wetland ecosystems in North China block at ∼296.2 Ma. Subsequently, the mass‐independent fractionation of odd Hg isotopes (Δ199Hg) and C isotopes synchronously decline in the deep‐marine succession, likely supporting progressive oxidation of terrestrial biomass and airborne release of Hg and C. Lowered C sequestration (as coal swamps) on land and dampened continental weathering limited the drawdown of CO2 emissions from wildfires, initiating deglaciation. Our findings highlight that the climate forcing on terrestrial ecosystems could activate additional C reservoirs, driving Earth into a warmer state."

Ravishankara,Constraining the Acetone Photolysis Quantum Yield: Current Insights and Atmospheric Chemistry Implications,"Acetone photolysis is a potentially important source of hydroperoxyl and hydroxyl radicals (HOx) to the upper troposphere. The extent to which acetone photolysis is a significant source of HOx in the upper troposphere is unclear in part because of scarce measurements of the acetone photolysis quantum yield (Φacetone) in the actinic region (i.e., λ > 300 nm). Past measurements of the Φacetone have derived temperature‐ and pressure‐dependent parameterizations that lead to significantly different conclusions about the importance of acetone to HOx formation in the upper troposphere. Here, we focus on previously published data to derive the recommended Φacetone for atmospheric chemical modeling. Using Stern‐Volmer analyses, we determine temperature‐ and pressure‐dependent Φacetone using updated measurements of fundamental acetone photolysis parameters. We also use simulations of the Φacetone produced from recent photophysical modeling to derive temperature‐ and pressure‐dependent parameterizations of the Φacetone. In contrast to the current Φacetone parameterization used in atmospheric chemical modeling, our parameterization reflects a predicted nonzero Φacetone in the wavelength region above 320 nm. Despite the increased Φacetone values in the higher wavelength region of the acetone photolysis action spectrum, the modeled effect on HOx production is not significantly different from HOx produced using the current recommended Φacetone parameterization. Uncertainties in the acetone photolysis mechanism remain; thus, more direct temperature‐ and pressure‐dependent measurements of Φacetone are warranted."

Dust sample reflectance, averaged over the wavelength range of 0.35–2.50 μm, varied by a factor of 1.9 (range, 0.2300–0.4444) and was suppressed mainly by three components: (a) carbonaceous matter measured as total organic carbon (1.6–22.5 wt. %) including inferred black carbon, natural organic matter, and carbon‐based synthetic, black road‐tire‐wear particles, (b) dark rock and mineral particles, indicated by amounts of magnetite (0.11–0.37 wt. %) as their proxy, and (c) ferric oxide minerals identified by reflectance spectroscopy and magnetic properties. Fundamental compositional differences were associated with different iron oxide groups defined by dominant hematite, goethite, or magnetite. These differences in iron oxide mineralogy are attributed to temporally varying source‐area contributions implying strong interannual changes in regional source behavior, dust‐storm frequency, and (or) transport tracks. Observations of dust‐storm activity in the western U.S. and particle‐size averages for all samples (median, 25 μm) indicated that regional dust from deserts dominated mineral‐dust masses.

 The self-assembly of small molecules through non-covalent interactions is an emerging and promising strategy for building dynamic, stable, and large-scale structures. One remaining challenge is making the non-covalent interactions occur in the ideal positions to generate strength comparable to that of covalent bonds. This work shows that small molecule YAWF can self-assemble into a liquid-crystal hydrogel (LCH), the mechanical properties of which could be controlled by water. LCH can be used to construct stable solid threads with a length of over 1 meter by applying an external force on 2 µL of gel solution followed by water-regulated crystallization. These solid threads can support 250 times their weight. Cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) analysis unravels the three-dimensional structure of the liquid-crystal fiber (elongated helix with C2 symmetry) at an atomic resolution. The multiscale mechanics of this material depend on the specificity of the molecular structure, and the water-controlled hierarchical and sophisticated self-assembly.

The authors predict that a decline in temperature seasonality will significantly slow or reduce organic carbon burial in lake sediments, leading to carbon emissions and amplified global warming. 
 Organic carbon burial (OCB) in lakes, a critical component of the global carbon cycle, surpasses that in oceans, yet its response to global warming and associated feedbacks remains poorly understood. Using a well-dated biomarker sequence from the southern Tibetan Plateau and a comprehensive analysis of Holocene total organic carbon variations in lakes across the region, here we demonstrate that lake OCB significantly declined throughout the Holocene, closely linked to changes in temperature seasonality. Process-based land surface model simulations clarified the key impact of temperature seasonality on OCB in lakes: increased seasonality in the early Holocene saw warmer summers enhancing ecosystem productivity and organic matter deposition, while cooler winters improved organic matter preservation. The Tibetan Plateau’s heightened sensitivity to climate and ecosystem dynamics amplifies these effects. With declining temperature seasonality, we predict a significant slowdown or reduction in OCB across these lake sediments, leading to carbon emissions and amplified global warming.

Here, the authors explore how composition and structure of protein aggregates affect dormancy and exit from this state. 
 Recalcitrant bacterial infections can be caused by various types of dormant bacteria, including persisters and viable but nonculturable (VBNC) cells. Despite their clinical importance, we know fairly little about bacterial dormancy development and recovery. Previously, we established a correlation between protein aggregation and dormancy in Escherichia coli. Here, we present further support for a direct relationship between both. Our experiments demonstrate that aggregates progressively sequester proteins involved in energy production, thereby likely causing ATP depletion and dormancy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that structural features of protein aggregates determine the cell’s ability to exit dormancy and resume growth. Proteins were shown to first assemble in liquid-like condensates that solidify over time. This liquid-to-solid phase transition impedes aggregate dissolution, thereby preventing growth resumption. Our data support a model in which aggregate structure, rather than cellular activity, marks the transition from the persister to the VBNC state.

 The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 under pressure has drawn great attention. However, consensus has not been reached on its pairing symmetry in theory. By combining density-functional-theory (DFT), maximally-localized-Wannier-function, and linearized gap equation with random-phase-approximation, we find that the pairing symmetry of La3Ni2O7 is dxy, if its DFT band structure is accurately reproduced by a downfolded bilayer two-orbital model. More importantly, we reveal that the pairing symmetry of La3Ni2O7 sensitively depends on the crystal field splitting between two Ni-eg orbitals. A slight increase in Ni-eg crystal field splitting alters the pairing symmetry from dxy to s±. Such a transition is associated with the change in inverse Fermi velocity and susceptibility, while the shape of Fermi surface remains almost unchanged.

 Directly generating material structures with optimal properties is a long-standing goal in material design. Traditional generative models often struggle to efficiently explore the global chemical space, limiting their utility to localized space. Here, we present a framework named Material Generation with Efficient Global Chemical Space Search (MAGECS) that addresses this challenge by integrating the bird swarm algorithm and supervised graph neural networks, enabling effective navigation of generative models in the immense chemical space towards materials with target properties. Applied to the design of alloy electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction (CO2RR), MAGECS generates over 250,000 structures, achieving a 2.5-fold increase in high-activity structures (35%) compared to random generation. Five predicted alloys— CuAl, AlPd, Sn2Pd5, Sn9Pd7, and CuAlSe2 are synthesized and characterized, with two showing around 90% Faraday efficiency for CO2RR. This work highlights the potential of MAGECS to revolutionize functional material development, paving the way for fully automated, artificial intelligence-driven material design.

However, their physically-based retrieval at the individual tree level has remained challenging due to the complex interactions of scattering and absorption within the irregularly shaped tree crowns, as well as multiple scattering among neighboring trees, particularly in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum. In this study, we proposed a tree-specific retrieval strategy that leverages unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery and corresponding photogrammetric point clouds to establish a tree-specific spatial adjacency constraint within the three-dimensional (3D) RTM-based inversion procedure for each individual tree. Unlike previous approaches that relied exclusively on pixel-level information from the region of interest, the proposed method fully accounted for the multiple scattering from adjacent trees and explicitly incorporates the irregularity of tree crown shapes. In the RTM-based prediction of the spectral reflectance of a focal tree (i.e., the target tree), the structures of adjacent trees were integrated alongside the focal tree, thereby forming a spatial adjacency constraint. This ensures that the scattering regime of the focal tree in the simulated scenario aligns with that of the actual scenario. The proposed method was assessed using both real UAV data and synthetic datasets. The results showed that tree-level retrieval under the adjacency constraint was highly consistent with reference (RRMSE of less than 0.22), whereas retrieval without the adjacency constraint exhibited substantial mis-estimation, particularly for FAVD (RRMSE of up to 0.44). Although the multiple scattering from adjacent trees was primarily influenced by the illumination geometry and tree canopy cover (TCC), sensitivity analysis of the sun zenith angle (SZA) and TCC revealed that retrieval accuracy slightly improved with a decreasing SZA and an increasing TCC. This improvement can be attributed to the enhanced treatment of multiple scattering under these conditions. These findings underscore the effectiveness of the tree-specific retrieval strategy for accurately estimating plant functional traits across forest stands. Moreover, they suggest the potential for monitoring functional diversity and long-term ecosystem process at the forest landscape scale through the use of functional traits."

10.1016/j.jag.2025.104369,False,International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,这篇论文主要研究的是黄河水质变化，特别是水体颜色变化与泥沙含量、植被恢复之间的关系。研究利用Landsat卫星数据，通过改进的色调角反演模型，分析了1985年至2023年黄河水色的长期动态变化。结果表明，黄河水色整体呈变绿趋势，这与泥沙负荷减少和植被增加有关，体现了水质改善和生态恢复的积极信号。该研究与大气环境遥感技术关系不大，侧重于水环境遥感和水质监测。,"['water quality', 'sediment load', 'vegetation', 'Landsat', 'remote sensing', 'Yellow River']",Ke Xia;Xintao Li;Taixia Wu;Shudong Wang;Hongzhao Tang;Yingying Yang,Reduced sediment load and vegetation restoration leading to clearer water color in the Yellow River: Evidence from 38 years of Landsat observations,"•The MRE of the improved FUI model was below 3.1 %. •The annual mean α change rate in YR was −0.18 ± 0.37°/yr. •Over the past 38 years, 86.47 % of river segments showed a decrease in hue angle. •The shift of YR water color toward green indicated an improvement in water quality. •Sediment load and vegetation were key factors influencing water color changes. 
 The Yellow River (YR), the fifth largest river in the world, plays a crucial role in regional development, making water quality assessment essential. Remote sensing provides a rapid and convenient means of observation, but water quality inversion models are often limited by the complex optical properties of inland waters and the availability of limited in-situ samples. The Forel-Ule color index (FUI), combined with satellite data, is effective for large-scale, comprehensive water quality assessments. However, the long-term water color dynamics of YR and its response to environmental changes have not been systematically studied. This study developed an improved hue angle (α, FUI conversion parameter) inversion model using Landsat data and assessed YR’s water color dynamics from 1985 to 2023. The results showed that YR’s FUI was generally high (mean FUI: 16.84 ± 1.85), with notable seasonal variation and spatial distribution patterns significantly influenced by dam construction and environmental features. Over the past 38 years, 86.47 % of river sections exhibited a declining α trend, particularly in the Loess Plateau. Reduced sediment load and increased vegetation, driven by engineering measures and the “Grain for Green” policy, were the primary factors behind long-term water color changes. Overall, the shift of YR water color towards greener hues was a positive signal, indicating improvements in water quality and ecosystem recovery. This study is significant for a deeper understanding of YR’s water quality changes and for informing watershed ecological restoration and management strategies."
