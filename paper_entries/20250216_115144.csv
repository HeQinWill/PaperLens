Advanced oxidation processes, such as UV photolysis, serve as effective strategies to remove OMPs. However, these often yield unknown transformation products (TPs). High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)-based non-target analysis (NTA) is commonly used to screen large numbers of chemicals but faces specific challenges such as low concentrations of compounds of interest, lack of reference standards, and the need for sophisticated data analysis workflows when used for TP identification. This article describes comprehensive workflows to study UV photolysis-related processes and the resulting TPs, by combining an automated photodegradation setup and HRMS and advanced NTA approaches. Four pharmaceuticals were successfully degraded in a case study, and 38 NTA features were effectively prioritized from complex sample matrices and identified as TPs through complementary approaches developed in this work. The identified TPs were structurally diverse and mostly novel. Semi-quantitation suggested that the TPs explained a relevant part of the parent removal. The developed workflows are a step toward systematic comprehensive analysis of transformation processes in water and beyond. The openly available data-processing tools and data enhance transformation data repositories and algorithms and support NTA studies in general."

In this study, we aimed to explore environmental surveillance (ES) in a non-sewered setting as a complement to syndromic surveillance in Maputo, Mozambique. Water samples were collected from nine points along the Infulene River (n = 66) in Maputo, Mozambique from February to September 2023. The presence of arboviruses (Dengue (DENV), Chikungunya (CHIKV), West Nile (WNV), and Usutu (USUV) virus) was determined by RT-qPCR. For the specific detection of CHIKV, two RT-qPCR assays were used: the Nsp1, targeting the non-structural protein 1 gene (nsP1) and the E1, targeting the E1 envelope protein gene (E1). DENV was detected in 82% (54/66) of the samples, with a median viral RNA load of 2.7 × 10–2 (2.2 × 105 copies/L (cp/L)), while CHIKV was detectable in 98% (65/66) of the samples, with a median viral RNA load of 4.8 × 10–2 (2.2 × 105 cp/L) for the nsP1 gene and 8.0 × 10–2 for the E1 gene (4.8 × 105 cp/L), and USUV was detected in 6% (4/66) of the samples at a median viral RNA load of 4.1 × 10–7 (0 cP/L), with viral RNA load in positive samples varying between 1.8 × 10–3 (7.1 × 102 cp/L) and 4.95 × 10–2 (2.1 × 103 cp/L). WNV was not detected throughout the study. The prevalence and concentration varied across sampling dates. Our study demonstrated the potential of ES as a tool for assessing the circulation of arboviruses in Mozambique, where a sewered system is unavailable. Consequently, ES could be expanded from polio surveillance to include other targets in LEDCs."

With increasing electrification and deepening renewable penetration, GIS installations and SF6 emissions are expected to rise. This work provides the first comprehensive analysis of the social economic viability of eliminating SF6 in high-voltage GIS equipment. We develop a flexible and scalable benefit-cost analysis framework to assess the net social benefits of SF6 replacement strategies. Using data from the Chinese power industry, we find that the social cost of carbon and firms’ compliance with SF6 standards are critical factors. Although high-level policies to eradicate SF6 in GIS are generally beneficial, net benefits can vary significantly across local implementation realities. Nonetheless, investing in SF6 alternatives is highly cost-effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions compared with other green technologies like wind and solar power."

However, these previous studies targeted only a limited number of whale species. In this study, we conducted screening and quantitative analyses to comprehensively identify OHCs accumulated in 48 adult male blubber samples of 11 whale species and to elucidate species-specific accumulation profiles. A total of 313 OHCs were detected in the blubber samples. Quantification and semiquantification results for anthropogenic OHCs and halogenated natural products (HNPs) showed compound- and species-specific accumulation patterns. Polychlorinated terphenyls and Cl5–7-substituted homologues of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylenes accumulated significantly in coastal cetaceans, whereas hexachlorocyclohexanes and hexachlorobenzene were more prominent in cold-water species, suggesting the influence of the mobility of these compounds from coastal sources. In addition, cluster analysis revealed specific HNP accumulation profiles for different habitats. Therefore, the HNP accumulation profile in each species can be a useful indicator of their habitat and migration patterns as the profile may reflect interspecies differences in exposure associated with their habitat-specific preys."

This study focuses on the West Antarctic Peninsula, a region experiencing rapid climate change, to examine shifts in seasonal carbon uptake. Using 20 years of in situ air‐sea CO2 flux and satellite‐derived Chlorophyll‐a, we observe that the seasonal cycles of both air‐sea CO2 flux and Chlorophyll‐a intensify poleward. The amplitude of the seasonal cycle of the non‐thermal component of surface ocean pCO2 increases with increasing latitude, while the amplitude of the thermal component remains relatively stable. Pronounced biological uptake occurs over the shelf in austral summer despite reduced CO2 solubility in warmer waters, which typically limits carbon uptake through physical processes. These findings underscore the prominence of biological mechanisms in regulating carbon fluxes in this rapidly changing region."

Understanding the evolution of Arctic‐Boreal lakes is critical to predicting climate feedbacks and monitoring ecosystems; however, previous research has found diverging lake area responses to permafrost thaw. Here, we demonstrate that permafrost controls on lake distribution are substantially modified by glacial history and geologic substrate texture. We present the new Alaska Lake and Pond Occurrence Data set (ALPOD), which shows a positive association between lake area and permafrost extent in unglaciated regions with fine substrate, but a negative relationship in postglacial areas. These spatial patterns indicate that thaw‐driven lake area declines are concentrated in unglaciated regions, which we corroborate by showing that most documented decadal‐scale lake area decreases occurred in unglaciated study sites. Overall, these findings provide potential mechanisms to explain previous disagreements in lake area trends and help constrain predictions of surface water change under further warming."

During these flybys, the radio link connecting the Juno spacecraft to Earth observing stations of NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) propagated through the Alfvén wing, a magnetospheric feature in which plasma is produced between Io and Jupiter. The radio link is sensitive to the elevated electron densities in the Alfvén wing. A direct measurement of the total electron content was made by a linear combination of Juno's X‐band and Ka‐band downlink frequencies. Two different approaches were used in inverting the measurements into electron densities which assume different electron density distributions within the Alfvén wing. The maximum electron densities estimated in the Alfvén wing were 20,500–27,000 cm−3 on I57, in the northern Alfvén wing, and 15,300–31,000 cm−3 on I58, in the southern Alfvén wing."

Despite their statistical definition, ExEvEs are shown to have a physical basis, also evident in their onset and termination.

While statistical‐dynamical methods like Linear Inverse Modeling have been successful at making forecasts, they often rely on assumptions that can be hard to satisfy given the nonlinear dynamics of the climate. Here, we train convolutional autoencoders with a dynamical propagator in the latent space to generate forecasts of SSH anomalies. Learning a nonlinear dimensionality reduction and the prediction timestepping together results in a propagator that produces better predictions for daily‐ and monthly‐averaged SSH in the North Pacific and Atlantic than if the dimensionality reduction and dynamics are learned separately. The reconstruction skill of the model highlights regions in which better representation results in improved predictions: in particular, the tropics for North Pacific daily SSH predictions and the Caribbean Current for the North Atlantic."

Here we investigate the wet troposphere in Australian coastal regions during SWOT's 3‐month calibration phase. Using a high‐resolution atmospheric model and a novel in situ array of GNSS observations, we find the SWOT error budget for wet troposphere is regularly exceeded, with signal magnitudes up to double the error budget at small scales. We also find centimeter level biases in radiometer derived delays within ∼50 km of the coast.

Using the dense seismic array data, we detected and located ∼1,800 microseismic events (MSEs) and developed a high‐resolution tomographic P‐wave velocity model. We observed substantially increased microseismicity during shutdown. Most MSEs occurred on pre‐existing normal faults, which are contained within extremely low‐velocity zones that are likely damaged, fluid‐filled, and hydraulically connected to nearby production wells. Hydrologic data show rapid fluid pressure increases of <60 kPa following the shutdown.

The response is deepest and most pronounced over the Northern Hemisphere (NH) WBCs, where it is associated with significant changes in upper tropospheric vertical motion, condensational heating and geopotential heights. The response is relatively shallow over the Southern Hemisphere (SH) WBCs.

 Solid-state batteries, in which solid electrolytes (SEs) replace their liquid alternatives, promise high energy density and safety. However, understanding the relation between SE composition and properties, stemming from intricate interactions among constituent sublattices that involve non-local electronic and nuclear dynamics, remains a critical and unsolved challenge. Here, we evaluate electronic structure methods and demonstrate that a density-functional approach incorporating non-local and many-body effects in exchange-correlation interactions provides predictive results for the local structure and diffusion properties of SEs. Focusing on argyrodite SEs (Li6±xM1±yS5±zXn, LMSX; M = P, Ge, Si, Sn; X = Cl, Br, I), we explore their compositional landscape as a test case. The employed HSE06+MBDNL method unveils how the S/X site disorder dictates the diffusion of lithium by controlling the number and length of the diffusion pathways. Additionally, non-local exchange and van der Waals interactions precisely modulate the coupling between the framework lattice and mobile lithium ions, thereby influencing the migration barrier. Consequently, the interplay of non-local electronic interactions in the predictive design of Li-solid electrolytes – and likely many other functional materials – is emphasized.

Hrncir et al. show that Sox9 is required for the morphogenesis of small intrahepatic bile ductules in mice, highlighting distinct genetic requirements that drive bile duct heterogeneity. 
 Intrahepatic bile duct (IHBD) development produces a morphologically heterogeneous network of large “ducts” and small “ductules” by adulthood. IHBD formation is closely linked to developmental specification of biliary epithelial cells (BECs) starting as early as E13.5, but mechanisms regulating differential IHBD morphology remain poorly understood. Here, we show that duct and ductule development has distinct genetic requirements, with Sox9 required to form the developmental precursors to peripheral ductules in adult livers. By optimizing large-volume IHBD imaging, we find that IHBDs emerge as a homogeneous webbed structure by E15.5 and undergo morphological maturation through 2 weeks of age. Developmental knockout of Sox9 leads to decreased postnatal branching morphogenesis, resulting in adult IHBDs with normal ducts but significantly fewer ductules. In the absence of Sox9, BECs fail to mature and exhibit elevated TGF-β signaling and Activin A. Exogenous Activin A is sufficient to induce developmental gene expression and morphological defects in wild-type BEC organoids, while early postnatal inhibition of Activin A in vivo rescues IHBD morphogenesis in the absence of Sox9. Our data demonstrate that proper IHBD architecture relies on inhibition of Activin A by Sox9 to promote ductule morphogenesis, defining regulatory mechanisms underlying morphological heterogeneity.

Here they show that injecting high levels of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) disrupts ovarian function and the maintenance of pregnancy in female domestic cats, suggesting that AMH gene therapy could be used for feline fertility control. 
 For female domestic cats, ovariohysterectomy is the only method of inducing permanent infertility. However, hundreds-of-millions of free-roaming cats globally highlight the necessity for alternative contraceptive approaches. One strategy involves a single injection of vector delivering a fertility-inhibiting protein for lifetime contraception. Recent studies in mice and cats have identified anti-Müllerian hormone as an excellent candidate for this type of contraception. Here, we leverage our recent characterization of the molecular mechanisms underlying human anti-Müllerian hormone synthesis and activity, to generate potent feline anti-Müllerian hormone analogs. Single intramuscular delivery of these analogs to female cats using an adeno-associated viral vector leads to a greater than 1000-fold increase in feline anti-Müllerian hormone levels, which are sustained for 9 months. High serum anti-Müllerian hormone is associated with abnormal estrus cyclicity, non-follicular ovarian cyst formation, and a progressive decline in antral follicle numbers, however, the few surviving large follicles continue to ovulate. Unlike previous studies, supraphysiologic levels of anti-Müllerian hormone do not block conception, although they are incompatible with the maintenance of pregnancy. Our findings highlight the complexity of the effects of anti-Müllerian hormone on ovarian physiology but confirm that this growth factor is a candidate for fertility control in free-roaming cats. Domestic cats are sterilized via ovariohysterectomy, but this procedure is not feasible for the larger population of free-roaming cats.

 Interleukin-36 receptor (IL-36R), belonging to the IL-1 receptor family, is crucial for host defense and tissue repair. Targeting cytokine receptors with low molecular weight (LMW) compounds remains challenging due to their interaction with the large surface area of cytokine. In this study, two encoded library technologies are used to identify LMW molecules binding to IL-36R’s extracellular domain. The mRNA-based display technique identifies 36R-P138, a macrocyclic peptide blocking IL-36R signaling. Importantly, its optimized analog (36R-P192) also effectively suppresses expression of marker genes induced by IL-36 in human skin biopsies. DNA encoded libraries (DEL) screening delivers 36R-D481, a high affinity LMW IL-36R binder, effectively inhibiting IL-36 signaling. X-ray crystallography analysis reveals that both the cyclic peptide and DEL-compound bind to the IL-36R’s D1 domain, potentially disrupting IL-36 cytokine binding. This study demonstrates that it is possible to target a cytokine receptor within the IL-1 receptor family using a small molecule ( < 1000 Da).

Here, authors introduce “Native Fold Delay”, integrating protein topology with translation kinetics to quantify the resulting delays in co-translational folding which may result in protein aggregation. 
 Because of vectorial protein translation, residues that interact in the native protein structure but are distantly separated in the primary sequence are unavailable simultaneously. Instead, there is a temporal delay during which the N-terminal interaction partner is unsatisfied and potentially vulnerable to non-native interactions. We introduce “Native Fold Delay” (NFD), a metric that integrates protein topology with translation kinetics to quantify such delays. We found that many proteins exhibit residues with NFDs in the range of tens of seconds. These residues, predominantly in well-structured, buried regions, often coincide with aggregation-prone regions. NFD correlates with co-translational engagement by the yeast Hsp70 chaperone Ssb, suggesting that native fold-delayed regions have a propensity to misfold. Supporting this, we show that proteins with long NFDs are more frequently co-translationally ubiquitinated and prone to aggregate upon Ssb deletion. During vectorial protein translation, native interactions are temporarily unsatisfied.

 Active metasurfaces have recently emerged as compact, lightweight, and efficient platforms for dynamic control of electromagnetic fields and optical responses. However, the complexities associated with their post-fabrication tunability significantly hinder their widespread applications, especially for the mid-infrared range due to material scarcity and design intricacy. Here, we experimentally demonstrate highly dynamic, pixelated modulations of coherent mid-infrared emission based on an electrically programmable plasmonic metasurface integrated with graphene field-effect transistors (Gr-FETs). The ultrabroad infrared transparency of graphene allows for customized control over plasmonic meta-atoms, thus achieving coherent mid-infrared states across a broad range of wavelengths, directions, and polarizations. The spatial temperature modulation generated by Gr-FETs is effectively synergized with the emissivity control by the localized surface plasmon polaritons and quasi-bound states in the continuum from gold nanoantennas. This integrated temperature-emissivity modulation of metasurfaces is systematically extended to form a pixelated 2D array with low crosstalk, envisioning advanced approaches toward scalable 2D electrical wiring for densely packed, independently addressable pixels.

The present study performs the first quantitative assessment of the contributions of Mongolian cyclones to springtime dust activity in East Asia, based on multiple reanalyses and observational datasets for 2001–2022. Atmospheric depressions dominate dust activities in Northern China, explaining ~90–92% of the total dust emissions in the Gobi Desert and ~88–93% of the dust aerosol optical depth (τ) downwind, depending on the dataset. Mongolian cyclones, defined as long-living and mobile atmospheric depressions, explain almost half (~34–47%) of the Gobi’s total dust emissions and τ downwind, and are the primary driver of high-impact dust storms.

 The expansion of ocean oxygenation during the Paleoproterozoic Lomagundi carbon isotope excursion remains highly debated. Here, we present iron isotope data for the coeval marine Francevillian Group strata. The data scatter from heavy to light iron isotope composition, with predominantly minimal isotope fractionation. The latter reflects complete oxidation and quantitative removal of dissolved iron from seawater, followed by complete reduction of oxidized iron in the sediments. Conversely, heavy and light iron isotope compositions are linked to equilibrium and kinetic isotopic effects, respectively during diagenesis. We propose that the oxygenation of the Paleoproterozoic oceans, at least below the shelf break, was responsible for the complete oxidation and quantitative removal of iron at depth, leaving behind a depleted marine iron reservoir during the Lomagundi Event. Oxidizing conditions to significantly build up a pool of oxyanions stable at much higher redox potential, such as nitrate, were only reached in the photic zone.

 Climate change impacts fresh submarine groundwater discharge on the Korean Peninsula, increasing the vulnerability of coastal regions to environmental degradation and economic consequences. Here, we provide regional estimates of fresh submarine groundwater discharge along the entire coast using established water balance methods. Our findings reveal that the western and southern coasts of the southern Korean Peninsula exhibit higher fresh submarine groundwater discharge rates due to greater net precipitation compared to the northern Korean Peninsula. Differences in drainage length between the east and west coasts, along with substantial tidal flats, significantly influence submarine groundwater discharge rates. Climate change drives variations in fresh submarine groundwater discharge, with rising trends in the southern Korean Peninsula during spring and winter, while the northern coastal watersheds show consistent increases across all seasons. Coastal vulnerability to offshore contamination from land use development affects 15% of the coastline. Notably, between 1990 and 2020, the risk in the southern Korean Peninsula’s coastal catchments increased by 38%.

 Renewable energy resources are widely available, yet they are unevenly distributed globally. In a renewable future, countries lacking high-quality renewable resources may choose to import energy from other countries. To assess the resource-dependent and techno-economic basis for global renewable energy trade and identify potential importers and exporters, this study introduces two new metrics: Renewable Export Cost Index (Cost Index) and Renewable Export Volume Index (Volume Index). These metrics are computed based on regional resource potential, domestic energy demand and varying financial costs across countries, without the need for any energy system modeling. By applying these two metrics to 165 countries/regions, we identify countries with significant potential for exporting renewable energy (e.g., the US, China) and those that lack the domestic resources to satisfy demand (e.g., South Korea, Japan). The Cost Index and Volume Index are validated through a separate analysis, employing a comprehensive energy system model for each country/region.

 Land surface temperature (LST) from satellite images contains meaningful signatures of geothermal heat flux (GHF) for geothermal exploration. However, the signal is mixed with solar radiation dominated features, making it difficult to identify GHF anomaly. Here we propose a novel method to tackle this problem that removes the time variant solar component based on principles of energy balance. Through an iteration process examining multiple LST maps from different seasons, the temporally invariant GHF component can be revealed. We tested this method by examining the Mount Meager Volcanic Complex area in British Columbia, Canada where data of known geothermal prospects are publicly accessible for validation. Seventy-two Landsat-8 cloud-free LST maps acquired in the last 10 years, were employed to extract the GHF component. Four high GHF anomalies are identified and two are consistent with areas of known hot spring swarms that occur above identified geothermal prospects. A third anomaly is spatially coincident with an active landslide site where warm seeps from the sliding surface and faults/fractures within the moving land mass are responsible for the anomalies. The anomalies in the fourth one are predominately anthropogenic, related to heat emission from hydropower facilities.

 Total Suspended Particles (TSP) is an important indicator of air quality, yet traditional prediction models lack comprehensive consideration of spatio-temporal interactions of different meteorological and air pollution phenomena. To address these limitations, this study introduces an explainable (X) deep hybrid (H) network, integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BGRU), for hourly TSP concentration prediction. The model was trained and evaluated using meteorological and air quality data from Canon Hill, Australia. By combining CNN’s spatial feature extraction capabilities with BGRU’s temporal dependencies, the model effectively captures complex spatial–temporal patterns in the data. The X-H-CBGRU model outperforms fifteen competing benchmark models such as deep neural network, extreme learning machine, multilayer perceptron, support vector regression, random forest regression, light gradient boosting, gradient boosting regression, long short-term memory network, as well as their hybrid CNN counterparts in terms of the accuracy evidenced by a lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE ≈6.302μg/m3) and higher Correlation Coefficient (r ≈0.91) compared to other models. Moreover, the model demonstrates strong probabilistic performance with a high Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP ≈0.98) and low Prediction Interval Normalized Average Width (PINAW ≈0.18), indicating its reliable prediction intervals. To enhance model interpretability, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) methods were employed, revealing PM10 concentration, relative humidity, air temperature, and wind speed as key predictors of TSP concentrations. The Diebold–Mariano statistical test further confirmed the model’s superior performance. This study contributes towards advancing TSP prediction by providing a robust, accurate, and interpretable model which has particular importance in locations such as mining regions.

 The return-stroke peak current is an important parameter provided by the lightning location system and plays an important role in atmospheric electricity. In this paper, a new method combining classical estimation methods and semi-supervised learning techniques is proposed for more accurate remote estimation of return-stroke peak currents.

The results show a 22 % improvement in the mean value of the corrected estimated peak current, an improvement in the coefficient of determination from 0.8362 to 0.9178 and a reduction in the root mean square error from 21.51 % to 10.67 % with respect to the peak current calculated using empirical equation derived from rocket-triggered lightning and the electric field at close range.
