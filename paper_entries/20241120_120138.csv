10.1088/1748-9326/ad78ed,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇研究论文主要关注的是北太平洋垃圾带中塑料污染的积累和变化，特别是塑料碎片的增加速度快于较大塑料制品的现象。研究使用了拖网调查和航拍图像等方法，建立了质量平衡模型，分析了塑料碎片的来源。该研究与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等，并没有直接关系。研究对象是海洋中的塑料污染，而不是大气中的成分。,[],Laurent Lebreton;Robin de Vries;Yannick Pham;Helen Wolter;Marjolein van Vulpen;Peter Puskic;Bruno Sainte-Rose;Sarah-Jeanne Royer;Matthias Egger,Seven years into the North Pacific garbage patch: legacy plastic fragments rising disproportionally faster than larger floating objects,"The North Pacific garbage patch has accumulated floating plastic pollution for several decades. The Ocean Cleanup, a not-for-profit organization that works to retrieve this floating plastic, has conducted systematic surveys in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre since 2015. The dataset, now spanning seven years, includes the deployment of trawls of varying sizes and the collection of aerial imagery. Here, we report a synthesis of these measurements and highlight an unexpected rise in mass concentration of plastic fragments (0.5–50 mm, from 2.9 kg km−2 in 2015 to 14.2 kg km−2 in 2022), increasing at a faster rate than that of larger items (>50 mm). With a mass balance model, we show that a substantial fraction of this material (74%–96%) is new to the region and does not result from the degradation of larger items that were already present in these waters seven years ago. Instead, we hypothesise it is the signature of the degradation and transport processes of legacy floating plastic pollution left accumulated in the global marine environment for the past decades."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad7b5e,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注长江流域1961年以来复合高温干旱事件的评估和预评估。研究使用改进的强度-面积-持续时间技术和风险评估方法，系统识别并评估了该流域的区域复合高温干旱事件，并利用中国气象局第三代气候模式预测系统(CPSv3-S2S) 评估了其亚季节预报能力。虽然研究与大气环境相关，因为它分析了温度和降水等气象数据，但它并非直接关注大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等。论文的重点在于复合高温干旱事件的时空特征、风险评估以及基于数值预报的预警能力，而非具体的遥感技术应用。,"['Temperature', 'Humidity', 'Precipitation', 'Drought', 'Hydropower', 'Satellite remote sensing (potentially, not explicitly mentioned)']",Mei Mei;Ying-Xian Zhang;Guo-Fu Wang,Assessment and pre-assessment of compound hot and drought events over Yangtze River Basin,"The severe compound hot and drought event (CHDE) in 2022 had serious impacts on water resources, agriculture, power supply, and ecosystems in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB). In this paper, we asked, have similar spatiotemporally overlapping compound events, like the one observed in 2022, occurred historically in the basin? And, if so, how can we pre-assess the impacts of such potential events on subseasonal timescales? To address these questions, regional CHDEs in the YRB since 1961 were systematically identified and comprehensively assessed using a modified intensity–area–duration technique and hazard assessment methods. Additionally, the subseasonal pre-assessment capability for CHDEs in the YRB using the China Meteorological Administration’s third-generation climate model prediction system (CPSv3-S2S) was demonstrated. A total of 140 CHDEs occurred during 1961–2022, with the 21st century showing a remarkably high risk of such events. Among these, 2022 was the most intense year, with the event from July 26th to August 30th being unprecedented in severity. CPSv3-S2S effectively forecast this event’s occurrence within a 1–25 lead days, particularly in pre-assessing its extensively impacted area and high-hazard centers in the upper and middle reaches of the main river course. This pre-assessment method serves as a valuable reference in decision-making to anticipate and mitigate the risks of hydropower supply shortages and heightened electricity demand during extremely high temperatures in upstream areas."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad7ee2,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇研究论文分析了2018年东亚极端热浪事件，特别是韩国创纪录高温的原因。研究发现，太平洋-日本型(PJ)、环球遥相关型(CGT)和北极涛动(AO)这三种大气环流模式在2018年均处于强正位相，对韩国热浪的发生有显著影响。论文利用多元线性回归模型定量评估了这三种模式对热浪的影响程度，发现它们能够解释热浪日数时间序列51%的年际尺度变率。研究结果表明，这三种大气模式的叠加可能是导致2018年韩国极端热浪事件的主要原因，并提示未来如果这三种模式同时出现强正位相，则可能再次发生类似的极端高温事件。该研究主要关注大气环流模式的相互作用及其对极端天气事件的影响，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）关系不大。,"['atmospheric teleconnections', 'heatwave', 'climate patterns', 'Pacific-Japan pattern', 'Arctic Oscillation', 'Circum-global teleconnection pattern', 'meteorological indices']",Hyerin Kim;Nakbin Choi;Myong-In Lee;Sunlae Tak;Dong-Hyun Cha;Seung-Ki Min,Causes on the 2018 record-breaking heatwave in South Korea: compound impacts from recurrent large-scale atmospheric teleconnections,"This study analyzed the causes of the extreme heatwave in East Asia in 2018, which brought a record-breaking event in South Korea in terms of the number of hot days and the intensity in history. Long-lasting atmospheric patterns were observed during the 2018 heatwave, and the patterns were similar to those known as the Pacific–Japan (PJ), circum-global teleconnection (CGT), and Arctic Oscillation (AO) patterns identified in a previous study. In 2018, all three patterns appeared to exhibit a strong positive phase. In particular, the PJ and AO Indices showed the highest values within the analysis period, having a major impact on the heatwave. According to a quantitative analysis through multi-linear regression (MLR) of how much each of the three patterns affects the heatwave, all three patterns of PJ, CGT, and AO have significant effects on the heatwave in Korea. The statistically reconstructed heatwave days (HWD) time series with the three indices by MLR account for 51% of the total variability at the interannual timescale. Especially in 2018, most of the occurred HWD could be restored using the three indices. Also, in 1994, when the three indices had a high peak, the number of HWDs was the second-longest ever, while in 1993, when all three indices had a low peak, the heatwave was the lowest. This study quantitatively examined whether the large-scale extreme heatwave in 2018 greatly increased because of PJ, CGT, and AO. This study suggests that extreme heatwave can occur again if three apparently independent atmospheric patterns appear at once in the future."

The rapid greening in China in the past two decades, which contributed the most to global greening, may influence clouds in the region. However, due to the influence of a rapid concomitant decline in aerosol levels in China and of global warming, such influence of vegetation change is yet to be clarified. By utilizing observation data from satellite, we explored the impact of vegetation change on summertime low-level cloud cover in China from 2003 to 2022. After excluding the influence of changing aerosol and temperature on clouds, we revealed a significant positive correlation between vegetation changes and low-level cloud cover. Moreover, we explored the underlying mechanisms through which vegetation exerts its influence on clouds. We found that such influence is mediated through enhancing surface water vapor content by vegetation as well as altering net surface radiation and sensible heat flux."

Yet, the interaction and relative importance of these factors for conservation planning performance is unknown. Here, we assess the importance of considering landholder preferences and climate change for prioritising locations for conservation tenders to recruit landholders for conservation covenants. To achieve this we develop a planning framework that accounts for the tender process to optimise investment across regions and apply it to koala-focused tenders in New South Wales, Australia, exploring four planning approaches that consider or are ignorant to landholder preferences or climate change. We find that optimal investments depend more on landholder preferences than climate change, and when landholder preferences are ignored, there is little benefit in accounting for climate change.

10.1088/1748-9326/ad8ede,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要研究的是气候变化（特别是气温日变化和降雨模式变化）对全球农业生产力的影响。它关注的是气温日变化对农业总要素生产力（TFP）的直接和间接影响，以及降雨（包括极端降雨事件）的调节作用。研究发现，气温日变化对农业生产力有负面影响，并且这种影响在不同收入水平的国家之间存在差异。低收入国家对气温变化和降雨变化更为敏感。该研究使用了1961年至2018年的数据，但并没有直接使用大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析等数据。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,"['temperature', 'rainfall', 'climate change', 'agricultural productivity']",Zhixiao Zou;Chaohui Li;Xudong Wu;Zheng Meng;Changxiu Cheng,The effect of day-to-day temperature variability on agricultural productivity,"With rising extreme weather events due to climate change, the impact on agricultural production has become increasingly severe. Yet, there has been a significant gap in research that assesses the influence of day-to-day temperature variability on agricultural productivity on a global scale. Our study addresses this gap by exploring the effects of day-to-day temperature variability and the change of rainfall patterns on agricultural productivity worldwide from 1961 to 2018. The results reveal that day-to-day temperature variability not only has a direct, negative impact on agricultural total factor productivity (TFP), but also influences it by modulating the effects of monthly average temperatures and wet days. One unit increase of day-to-day temperature variability leads to a 2% decrease in TFP. Day-to-day temperature variability neutralizes the impact of monthly average temperature on TFP, while exacerbating the impact of wet days on TFP. Furthermore, extreme rainfall events result in a consistent negative marginal effect across all countries/seasons/rainfall intervals. This study also identifies differentiated impacts across countries with varying income levels. Low-income regions’ TFP demonstrates markedly significant sensitivities to both monthly average temperatures and daily temperature fluctuations, which means less resilient. Furthermore, the impacts of general and extreme rainfall are comparatively less pronounced in high-income countries, indicating higher resilience to climate variability in these regions and a relative vulnerability to extreme weather events in low-income regions. Our findings illuminate the intricate and multifaceted role that daily temperature variability plays in agricultural productivity, providing a theoretical basis for understanding the heterogeneous impacts of climate change on agriculture and contributing insights into the broader discourse on climate resilience and agricultural sustainability."

In dimictic lakes, climate change has extended the duration of summer thermal stratification and reduced the length of the ice season. These changes are relatively straightforward to evaluate in smaller, inland lakes. However, in large lakes, such as the North American Great Lakes, temporally intermittent and spatially heterogeneous ice cover, and spatial thermal heterogeneity limit the utility of simple ice on–off or mixing classifications; therefore, assessing how climate change is impacting winter conditions in large lakes is challenging. Here, we use in-situ and satellite-derived surface water temperature observations from the North American Great Lakes to overcome these limitations and show that warming air temperatures are driving reductions in the number of winter days, collectively those with either ice cover or inverse thermal stratification, in favor of increases in isothermal conditions for the period 1995–2023. We find that on average the Great Lakes are experiencing a loss of 14 winter days per decade. Our results demonstrate how climate change has yielded disproportionate changes in the annual thermal cycle and mixing conditions of Earth’s largest freshwater system and signals the potential for fundamental ecosystem shifts due to a loss of winter."

Landslide impact on communities can be reduced using efficient early warning systems to plan mitigation measures and protect elements at risk. This manuscript presents an innovative geophysical approach to monitoring landslide dynamics, which combines electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and low-frequency distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), and was deployed on a slope representative of many landslides in clay rich lowland slopes. ERT is used to create detailed, dynamic moisture maps that highlight zones of moisture accumulation leading to slope instability. The link between ERT derived soil moisture and the subsequent initiation of slope deformation is confirmed by low-frequency DAS measurements, which were collocated with the ERT measurements and provide changes in strain at unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. Auxiliary hydrological and slope displacement data support the geophysical interpretation. By revealing critical zones prone to failure, this combined ERT and DAS monitoring approach sheds new light on landslide mechanisms. This study demonstrates the advantage of including subsurface geophysical monitoring techniques to improve landslide early warning approaches, and highlights the importance of relying on observations from different sources to build effective landslide risk management strategies."

These initiatives are generally limited by a lack of relevant data on forest carbon stocks and fluxes past-to-future. Previously, we developed a new forest carbon modeling system that combined high-resolution remote sensing, field data, and ecological modeling to estimate contemporary above-ground forest carbon stocks, and projected future forest carbon sequestration potential for the state of Maryland. Here we extended this work to provide a consistent geospatial approach for monitoring changes in forest carbon stocks over time. Utilizing the same data and modeling system developed previously for planning, we integrated historical input data on weather and disturbance to reconstruct the history of vegetation dynamics and forest above-ground carbon stocks annually over the period 1984–2016 at 30 m resolution and provided an extension to 2023. Statewide, forested land had an average annual net above ground carbon sink of 1.37 TgC yr−1, comparable to prior estimates. However, unlike the prior estimates, there was considerable variation around this mean. The statewide net above ground flux ranged interannually from −0.65 to 2.77 Tg C yr−1. At the county scale, the average annual net above ground flux ranged spatially from 0.01 to 0.13 Tg C yr−1 and spatiotemporally from −0.43 to 0.24 Tg C yr−1. Attribution analyses indicate the primary importance of persistent and regrowing forests, vegetation structure, local disturbance, and rising CO2 to the mean flux, and the primary importance of weather to the large-scale interannual variability. These results have important implications for state climate mitigation planning, reporting and assessment. With this approach, it is now possible to monitor changes in forest carbon stocks spatiotemporally over policy relevant domains with a consistent framework that is also enabled for future planning."

In this study, the major atmospheric influential factors and the precursory signal of heavy rainfall in 2021 are investigated using the correlation, regression, power spectrum, and filtering methods, the quasi-geostrophic velocity equation, observational data and numerical simulation of a linear baroclinic model (LBM). The results show that the extremity of a quasi-barotropic high anomaly over Northeast Asia (NEA) contributes to the deep anomalous upward motion within SENC by inducing positive vorticity and temperature advections. On the other hand, the anomalous southeasterly flow at the southwestern flank of the NEA high anomaly transports sufficient moisture to SENC in the lower troposphere. The local deep upward motion combined with the lower-tropospheric moisture convergence directly leads to the occurrence of this extreme rainfall event. Further analysis shows that the intensification of the NEA high in July 2021 is closely tied to the westward migration of atmospheric disturbance originating from the vicinity of Northeast Pacific-North America, which could be supported by numerical simulation in LBM. The variation of the geopotential height anomaly over Northeast Pacific-North America precedes that of the NEA high by two weeks, which is likely to provide a potential source of predictability for the extreme rainfall in SENC."

The research highlights the critical role of PNA-related North Pacific circulation anomalies, which shift northwestward during multi-year events and reach their peak intensity in the second year. Multiple dynamical diagnostic methods are employed to elucidate the reasons behind the diverse subtropical circulation responses. Differences in the anomalous tropical heat sources influence the formation of Rossby wave sources through adjustments in divergent wind anomalies, subsequently modulating the position and intensity of the PNA patterns. Additionally, variations in the meridional range of sea surface temperature anomalies affect the edge of tropospheric temperature through moist-adiabatic adjustment, leading to distinct subtropical jet stream responses. This, in turn, modifies the position of North Pacific circulation anomalies through the advection of anomalous kinetic energy. Furthermore, synoptic-scale transient eddies act as a feedback mechanism, helping to maintain and intensify these diverse atmospheric anomalies."

To examine the influence of ICV on East Asian surface temperature in the near future, we mainly analyzed the data sets obtained from Max Planck Institute Grand Ensemble model simulations under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario. It is found that the ICV associated with the so-called Warm Arctic-Cold Eurasian (WACE)-like pattern contributes to the near-future warming rate of East Asian surface temperature. Similar results are also obtained from large ensemble model simulations participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 5–8.5 scenario. This implies that the near-term warming rate in East Asia could vary depending on how the climate model simulates the WACE-like pattern, indicating that the ability to accurately simulate ICV in climate models is crucial for future climate mitigation and adaptation policies."

They are expected to alter their behaviour under climate change, affecting the warming generated by greenhouse gases. This paper proposes a new method to estimate their overall effect on this warming by simulating a climate where clouds are transparent. Results show that with the model used, clouds have a stabilising effect on climate. 
 Clouds affect the sensitivity of the climate system by changing their distribution, height, and optical properties under climate change. Although the precise magnitude remains uncertain, the direct cloud response to an external forcing is known to be destabilising. Additionally, clouds have a masking effect on CO2 forcing and can influence other feedback mechanisms such as the surface albedo feedback. To understand the overall impact of clouds, we compute how much the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) to a doubling of CO2 changes when clouds are made transparent to radiation in an Earth system model (MPI-ESM1.2, the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth System Model version 1.2). In practice, to stabilise the model climate at near-preindustrial temperatures, the solar constant was reduced by 8.8 %. Our experiments reveal that clouds exert a stabilising influence on the model, with a clear-sky ECS of 4.29 K, which is higher than the corresponding full-sky ECS of 2.84 K, contrasting with their direct destabilising effect. Detailed partial radiative perturbation diagnostics show that beyond directly amplifying warming by themselves, clouds also strengthen the negative lapse rate and positive water vapour feedbacks, while strongly damping the positive albedo feedback. These findings highlight the complex role of clouds in modulating climate sensitivity."

Roll circulations evolve, forming cloud streets. We investigate the initial circulation and cloud development using high-resolution airborne measurements. We compute the distance an air mass traveled over water (fetch) from back trajectories. Cloud streets form at 15 km fetch, cloud cover strongly increases at around 20 km, and precipitation forms at around 30 km. 
 Marine cold-air outbreaks (MCAOs) strongly affect the Arctic water cycle and, thus, climate through large-scale air mass transformations. The description of air mass transformations is still challenging, partly because previous observations do not resolve fine scales, particularly for the initial development of an MCAO, and due to a lack of information about the thermodynamical evolution starting over sea ice and continuing over open ocean and associated cloud microphysical properties. Therefore, we focus on the crucial initial development within the first 200 km over open water for two case studies in April 2022 during the HALO-(AC)3 campaign (named after the High Altitude and Long Range Research Aircraft and Transregional Collaborative Research Centre ArctiC Amplification: Climate Relevant Atmospheric and SurfaCe Processes and Feedback Mechanisms (AC)3). The two events, just 3 d apart, belong to a particularly long-lasting MCAO and occurred under relatively similar thermodynamic conditions. Even though both events were stronger than the climatological 75th percentile of that period, the first event was characterized by colder air masses from the central Arctic which led to an MCAO index twice as high compared to that of the second event.The evolution and structure were assessed by flight legs crossing the Fram Strait multiple times at the same location, sampling perpendicularly to the cloud streets. Airborne remote sensing and in situ measurements were used to build statistical descriptions of the boundary layer, dynamics, clouds, and precipitation. For this purpose, we established a novel approach based solely on radar reflectivity measurements to detect roll circulation that forms cloud streets. The two cases exhibit different properties of clouds, riming, and roll circulations, though the width of the roll circulation is similar. For the stronger event, cloud tops are higher; more liquid-topped clouds exist; the liquid water path, mean radar reflectivity, precipitation rate, and precipitation occurrence have increased; and riming is active. The variability in rime mass has the same horizontal scale as the roll circulation, implying the importance of roll circulation on cloud microphysics and precipitation.Boundary layer and cloud properties evolve with distance over open water, as seen by, e.g., cloud top height rising. In general, cloud streets form after traveling 15 km over open water. After 20 km, this formation enhances cloud cover to just below 100 %. After around 30 km, precipitation forms, though for the weaker event, the development of precipitation is shifted to larger distances.

 Coastal environments provide an ideal setting for investigating the intermixing processes between terrestrial and marine aerosols. In this study, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) samples categorized into terrestrial, marine, and mixed air masses were collected from a coastal location in northern China. The chemical and biological constituents, including water-soluble ions (WSIs), metallic elements, and bacterial and fungal aerosols, were investigated from January to March 2018, encompassing both the winter heating and spring dust seasons. Terrestrial air masses constituted 59.94 % of the total air masses throughout the sampling period, with a significant increase during severe haze pollution (up to 90 %). These air masses exhibited a higher concentration of PM2.5 (240 µg m−3) and carried more water-soluble ions and metal elements. The terrestrial air mass also contained a larger number of animal parasites or symbionts, as well as human pathogens from anthropogenic emissions, such as Staphylococcus, Deinococcus, Sphingomonas, Lactobacillus, Cladosporium, and Malassezia. Conversely, a significant quantity of saprophytic bacteria such as hydrocarbon-degrading and gut bacteria from the genera Comamonas, Streptococcus, Novosphingobium, and Aerococcus and the saprophytic fungus Aspergillus were the most abundant species in the marine air mass samples. The mixed air mass elucidates the intermixing process of terrestrial and marine sources, a result of microorganisms originating from both anthropogenic and terrestrial emissions, which includes pathogenic microorganisms from hospitals and sewage treatment plants, and a multitude of soil bacteria. A stronger correlation was noted between microorganisms and continental elements in both terrestrial and mixed air mass samples, specifically K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ derived from soil dust. Marine air masses exhibited a significant correlation with sea salt ions, specifically Na+. In the mixed air mass sample, a fusion of marine and terrestrial microorganisms is characterized by alterations in the ratio of pathogenic to saprophytic microorganisms when compared to samples derived from either terrestrial or marine sources. This study on the constituents and amalgamation of bioaerosols over the coastal atmosphere encompassing distinct air masses is crucial to understand the transport, intermixing processes, and health implications of terrestrial and marine air masses."

During the mountain breeze phase, high-rise buildings with lower sky view factors (SVFs) had a pronounced effect on the ΔCUHII. During the valley breeze phase, high-rise buildings exerted a dual influence on the ΔCUHII. 
 Against the background of global warming and rapid urbanization, heat waves (HWs) have become increasingly prevalent, amplifying canopy urban heat island intensity (CUHII). The megacity of Beijing, characterized by rapid urbanization, frequent high-temperature events, and exceptionally complex terrain, presents a unique case to study the synergies between HWs and canopy urban heat islands (CUHIs). However, research exploring the formation mechanisms of the amplified CUHII (ΔCUHII) during HW periods in the megacity of Beijing from the perspectives of mountain–valley breeze and urban morphology remains scarce. This study found that compared to non-heat-wave (NHW) periods, the average daily CUHII during HW periods significantly increased by 59.33 %. On the urban scale, the wind direction reversal of the mountain–valley breeze might contribute to the north–south asymmetry in the ΔCUHII. On the street scale, wind speed was inversely proportional to the ΔCUHII. In addition, the ΔCUHII was closely related to urban morphology, particularly the three-dimensional indicators of buildings. During the mountain breeze phase, high-rise buildings with lower sky view factors (SVFs) had a more pronounced effect on amplifying CUHII compared to low-rise buildings with higher SVFs. Conversely, during the valley breeze phase, high-rise buildings exerted a dual influence on amplifying CUHII. Our findings provide scientific insights into the driving mechanisms of urban overheating and contribute to mitigating the escalating risks associated with urban excess warming."

Samset;Detlef van Vuuren;Sönke Zaehle,The need for carbon-emissions-driven climate projections in CMIP7,"We discuss how, in order to provide more relevant guidance for climate policy, coordinated climate experiments should adopt a greater focus on simulations where Earth system models are provided with carbon emissions from fossil fuels together with land use change instructions, rather than past approaches that have largely focused on experiments with prescribed atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. We discuss how these goals might be achieved in coordinated climate modeling experiments. 
 Previous phases of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) have primarily focused on simulations driven by atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs), for both idealized model experiments and climate projections of different emissions scenarios. We argue that although this approach was practical to allow parallel development of Earth system model simulations and detailed socioeconomic futures, carbon cycle uncertainty as represented by diverse, process-resolving Earth system models (ESMs) is not manifested in the scenario outcomes, thus omitting a dominant source of uncertainty in meeting the Paris Agreement. Mitigation policy is defined in terms of human activity (including emissions), with strategies varying in their timing of net-zero emissions, the balance of mitigation effort between short-lived and long-lived climate forcers, their reliance on land use strategy, and the extent and timing of carbon removals. To explore the response to these drivers, ESMs need to explicitly represent complete cycles of major GHGs, including natural processes and anthropogenic influences. Carbon removal and sequestration strategies, which rely on proposed human management of natural systems, are currently calculated in integrated assessment models (IAMs) during scenario development with only the net carbon emissions passed to the ESM. However, proper accounting of the coupled system impacts of and feedback on such interventions requires explicit process representation in ESMs to build self-consistent physical representations of their potential effectiveness and risks under climate change. We propose that CMIP7 efforts prioritize simulations driven by CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use and projected deployment of carbon dioxide removal technologies, as well as land use and management, using the process resolution allowed by state-of-the-art ESMs to resolve carbon–climate feedbacks. Post-CMIP7 ambitions should aim to incorporate modeling of non-CO2 GHGs (in particular, sources and sinks of methane and nitrous oxide) and process-based representation of carbon removal options. These developments will allow three primary benefits: (1) resources to be allocated to policy-relevant climate projections and better real-time information related to the detectability and verification of emissions reductions and their relationship to expected near-term climate impacts, (2) scenario modeling of the range of possible future climate states including Earth system processes and feedbacks that are increasingly well-represented in ESMs, and (3) optimal utilization of the strengths of ESMs in the wider context of climate modeling infrastructure (which includes simple climate models, machine learning approaches and kilometer-scale climate models)."

The end result is highly dependent on the method used. We show that, to avoid discontinuities in the time series, one needs to exclude data in the calibration range to also activate the extrapolation functionality in that time period. 
 Quantile mapping is a method often used for the bias adjustment of climate model data toward a reference, i.e. to construct a transformation of the model's distribution to that of the reference. The main moments of the distributions are typically well transformed by quantile mapping, but statistical uncertainty increases towards the extreme tails, making robust transformations challenging. Because of the limited data at the extreme tails, an empirical quantile mapping also needs to make some estimation or fit a parameterised function for data beyond the calibration data range. Here, the MIdAS bias adjustment platform is employed to explore different methods for handling the extreme tail; these approaches are evaluated using an indicator of extreme precipitation – the maximum daily precipitation amount per year. Different methodologies are evaluated for a large ensemble of regional climate model projections over Scandinavia. The sensitivity of the empirical quantile mapping to the tails of the distribution is demonstrated, and it is found that the behaviour is significantly different within and outside of the calibration period, causing severe issues with the temporal consistency of the time series. The sensitivity is identified to be due to differences in the activated features of the bias adjustment within the calibration period (where the empirical transfer function is applied) and outside of that period (where the extrapolation method is likely applied). This means that the bias adjustment method is, in a sense, different between different time periods. Furthermore, finding a robust parameterisation for the tail is not straightforward. We identify a two-step solution that works well for this problem: 
We refer to the first step as “Murder your darlings”. By excluding data from the tail data in the calibration period, the extrapolation feature is activated for all time periods, even the calibration period.
In the second step, applying an outlier-insensitive method for linear regression works well for finding an extrapolation parameterisation for the tail."

RAL3 has more realistic precipitation distributions and improved representation of clouds and visibility. 
 The third version of the Regional Atmosphere and Land (RAL3) science configuration is documented. Developed through international partnership, RAL configurations define settings for the Unified Model atmosphere and Joint UK Land Environment Simulator when applied across timescales with kilometre and sub-km scale model grids. The RAL3 configuration represents a major advance compared to previous versions by delivering a common science definition suitable for application to tropical and mid-latitude regions. Developments within RAL3 include the introduction of a double-moment microphysics scheme and a bi-modal cloud scheme, replacing use of a single-moment scheme and different cloud schemes for mid-latitudes and tropics in previous versions. Updates have been implemented to the boundary layer scheme and a consolidation of land model settings to be more consistent with Global Atmosphere and Land (GAL) science configurations. Physics developments aimed to address priorities for model performance improvement identified by users. This paper documents the RAL3 science configuration, including a series of iterative revisions delivered since its first release, and their characteristics. Evidence is provided from the variety of assessments of RAL3, relative to the previous version (RAL2). Collaborative development and evaluation across organisations has enabled evaluation across a range of domains, grid-spacing and timescales. The analysis indicates more realistic precipitation distributions; improved representation of clouds and of visibility; a continued trend to more realistic representation of convection; and reduced near-surface wind speeds, but a persistent cold temperature bias. Overall the convective-scale verification scores and climatological model distributions relative to observations improve for the majority of variables. Ensemble results show improvements to the spread-error relationship. User feedback from subjective assessment activities has also been positive. Differences between RAL3 revisions and RAL2 are further illustrated through process-based analysis of a convective system over the UK. The latest RAL3 configuration (RAL3.3) is therefore recommended for research, operational numerical weather prediction and climate production at km and sub-km scales."

This study presents DECIPHeR-GW v1, which links surface and groundwater systems to improve predictions of streamflow and groundwater levels. Tested across England and Wales, DECIPHeR-GW shows high accuracy, especially in south east England, making it a valuable tool for large-scale water management. 
 Groundwater is a crucial part of the hydrologic cycle and the largest accessible freshwater source for humans and ecosystems. However, most hydrological models lack explicit representation of surface-groundwater interactions, leading to poor prediction performance in groundwater-dominated catchments. This study presents DECIPHeR-GW v1, a new surface-groundwater hydrological model that couples a Hydrological Response Units (HRU)-based hydrological model and a two-dimensional gridded groundwater model. By using a two-way coupling method, the groundwater model component receives recharge from HRUs, simulates surface-groundwater interactions, and returns groundwater levels and groundwater discharges to HRUs, where river routing is then performed. These interactions are happening at each time step in our new surface-groundwater model. Depending on the storage capacity of the surface water model component and the position of the modelled groundwater level, three scenarios are developed to derive recharge and capture surface-groundwater interactions dynamically. Our new coupled model was calibrated and evaluated against daily flow timeseries from 669 catchments and groundwater level data from 1804 wells across England and Wales. The model provides streamflow simulation with a median KGE of 0.83 across various catchment characteristics, with high performance particularly for the drier chalk catchments in southeast England, where the average KGE increased from 0.49 in the benchmark DECIPHeR model to 0.7. Furthermore, our model reproduces temporal patterns of the groundwater level timeseries, with more than half of the wells achieving a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.6 or higher when comparing simulations to observations. Overall, this new DECIPHeR-GW model demonstrates remarkable accuracy and computational efficiency in reproducing streamflow and groundwater levels, making it a valuable tool for addressing water resources and management issues over large domains."

Herein, the characterization of the redox transformation and methylation of As by Methanosarcina acetivorans, a model methanogenic archaeon, is reported. M. acetivorans was demonstrated to mediate As(V) reduction via a cytoplasmic As reductase (ArsC) in the exponential phase of methanogenic growth and to methylate As(III) via a cytoplasmic As(III) methyltransferase (ArsM) in the stationary phase. Characterization of the ArsC-catalyzed As(V) reduction and the ArsM-catalyzed As(III) methylation showed that a thioredoxin (Trx) encoded by MA4683 was preferentially utilized as a physiological electron donor for ArsC and ArsM, providing a redox link between methanogenesis and As transformation. The structures of ArsC and ArsM complexed with Trx were modeled using AlphaFold-Multimer. Site-directed mutagenesis of key cysteine residues at the interaction sites of the complexes indicated that the archaeal ArsC and ArsM employ evolutionarily distinct disulfide bonds for interacting with Trx compared to those used by bacterial ArsC or eukaryotic ArsM.

However, knowledge of the interactions of different indoor pollutants is limited. We investigated physicochemical properties of SOA generated from typical indoor chemistry of the O3/α-pinene reaction with and without the presence of particles and gases from a burning candle. Ozonolysis of α-pinene in the presence of candle gaseous emissions yielded a considerably lower particle number, larger particle sizes, and lower particle oxygen-to-carbon ratio compared with experiments without candle emissions. More nitrogen-containing organic compounds were observed in the aerosol phase with candle emissions. Furthermore, concentrations of some typical particle-phase products from the O3/α-pinene reaction (i.e., terebic acid, cis-pinic acid, and 3-methyl-1,2,3-butanetricarboxylic acid) were less abundant in the presence of candle emissions. The predicted volatility of particulate organic compounds was higher in experiments with candle emissions.

Each stage has different crystalline structures and forms by aligned attachment of nanoscale precursors on the preceding surface. Crystal lattice analyses confirm the crystalline development, from the short-range order of the Mn oxide film to the long-range order of the nanorods. Also, the heterogeneous nucleation observed in this work produced groutellite-like tunnel structures of Mn oxide on quartz.

The Late Miocene Biogenic Bloom (LMBB), marked by notable increases in biogenic components in marine sediments, provides insights into the response of the biological pump to climate change. However, understanding the timing, distribution, and cause of the LMBB remains limited. We use marine barite, a refractory mineral precipitating from the water column associated with carbon export, and other proxies to reconstruct productivity in the equatorial Indian Ocean and equatorial western Atlantic between 12 and 5 Ma. Multi‐proxy records reveal the onset of the LMBB in the equatorial Indian Ocean at ∼9 Ma, primarily driven by more vigorous upwelling during global cooling. We suggest that the steepened meridional temperature gradient and the Antarctic ice sheet expansion have strengthened ocean overturning, facilitating nutrient supply and biogenic bloom in upwelling regions."

Atmospheric blocking is a key dynamical phenomenon in the mid‐ and high latitudes, able to drive day‐to‐day weather changes and meteorological extremes such as heatwaves, droughts and cold waves. Current global circulation models struggle to fully capture observed blocking frequencies, likely because of their coarse horizontal resolution. Here we use convection permitting, nested idealized model simulations for quantifying changes in blocking frequency and Rossby wave breaking compared to a coarser resolution reference. We find an increase in blocking frequency poleward and downstream of the area with increased resolution, while the exact regions depend on the blocking index. These changes are probably due to a more accurate representation of small‐scale processes such as diabatic heating, which affect Rossby wave breaking and blocking formation downstream. Our results thus suggest an improved representation of blocking in the next generation of high‐resolution global climate models."

Here we quantify these requirements to construct a regime diagram for the Galilean satellites. We compute the internal heat fluxes that would sustain a dynamo over the wide ranges of plausible radii for their metallic cores. Below a critical radius, no plausible heat flux will sustain a dynamo. Europa likely sits on the opposite side of this limit than Ganymede and Io.

Global mare distribution is distinctly asymmetrical, with a paucity on the farside, plausibly interpreted to be related to thicker farside low‐density crust inhibiting buoyant magma rise to the surface. Challenging this hypothesis is the presence of the huge, ancient farside South Pole‐Aitken (SPA) basin, site of the thinnest crust and deepest depression observed on the Moon. We hypothesize that an oblique impact stripped the farside crust within the SPA basin, permitting early mare basalt emplacement as cryptomaria due to thin/absent crust. However, removal of the SPA thermally insulating megaregolith/crust accelerated lithosphere thickening beneath the basin. This deepening rheological barrier inhibited buoyant rise of mantle diapirs below SPA, resulting in early abatement of mare basalt extrusions compared to the nearside, and retention of the deep, underfilled SPA impact basin observed today."

The infrared window region (780–1,250 cm−1, 12.8 to 8.0 μm) is of great importance to Earth's climate due to its high transparency and thermal energy. We present here a new investigation of the transparency of this spectral region based on observations by interferometers of downwelling surface radiance at two DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program sites. We focus on the dominant source of absorption in this region, the water vapor continuum, and derive updated values of spectral absorption coefficients for both the self and foreign continua. Our results show that the self continuum is too strong in the previous version of Mlawer‐Tobin_Clough‐Kneizys‐Davies (MT_CKD) water vapor continuum model, a result that is consistent with other recent analyses, while the foreign continuum is too weak in MT_CKD. In general, the weaker self continuum derived in this study results in an overall increase in atmospheric transparency in the window, although in atmospheres with low amounts of water vapor the transparency may slightly decrease due to the increase in foreign continuum absorption. These continuum changes lead to a significant decrease in downwelling longwave flux at the surface for moist atmospheres and a modest increase in outgoing longwave radiation. The increased fraction of surface‐leaving radiation that escapes to space leads to a notable increase (∼5–10%) in climate feedback, implying that climate simulations that use the new infrared window continuum will show somewhat less warming than before. This study also points out the possibly important role that aerosol absorption may play in the longwave radiative budget."

J. Tuckman;Kerry Emanuel,Origins of Extreme CAPE Around the World,"Severe convection, responsible for hazards such as tornadoes, flash floods, and hail, is usually preceded by abundant convective available potential energy (CAPE). In this work, we use a Lagrangian approach to study the buildup of anomalously large values of CAPE from 2012 to 2013 in various regions. Nearly all extreme values of CAPE arise from surface fluxes underneath a layer of convective inhibition (the CIN layer) over several diurnal cycles, but the origin of the CIN layer and the diurnal cycle of surface fluxes differ around the world. In some regions, such as North America and Europe, the air above the boundary layer must be much warmer than usual to form this CIN layer, whereas in other regions, especially the Middle East and central Africa, a CIN layer is common. Additionally, high CAPE occurrences that are over land (those in the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Southeast Asia) tend to lose their CIN layers before the time of maximum CAPE due to large diurnal cycles of sensible heating, whereas those that occur over coastal waters (in the Middle East, Northern Australia, South Asia, and the Mediterranean) usually retain substantial convective inhibition. Uniquely, CAPE in Southeast Australia often builds up due to cooling aloft rather than to boundary layer warming. These results show that one hoping to understand or predict CAPE patterns must understand a variety of mechanisms acting in different regions."

These storms transport tropospheric air containing trace gases, ice particles, and aerosols into the UTLS, which can affect chemical and radiative processes over a large region. Because overshooting storms necessarily have strong updrafts, there is a marked correlation between overshooting and the occurrence of severe weather at the surface. Heat released by these storms also helps to drive the North American Monsoon Anticyclone (NAMA) in the UTLS, which partially confines air injected into the stratosphere by overshooting storms. In support of the Dynamics and Chemistry of the Summer Stratosphere (DCOTSS) project, this study is a climatological analysis of the environmental factors that affect the occurrence of deep and overshooting storms. Using hourly analyses of overshooting storms based on GridRad radar data and ERA5 reanalyzes, we focus on the roles of convective available potential energy (CAPE), convective inhibition (CIN), jet location, and other relevant dynamical and thermodynamic variables. The results show that northward intrusion of airmasses containing moist high CAPE air from the Gulf of Mexico into the central plains plays a major role in producing the conditions necessary for overshooting storms with other factors playing secondary roles."

For instance, in Ho Chi Minh City, the construction of a large‐scale ring‐dike has mitigated negative effects from storm surges, yet damage is still frequently caused by high‐intensity rainfalls leading to nuisance flooding, which is responsible for the highest proportion of flood losses in the city today. Because sustainable flood risk management requires detailed spatial information, we analyze the local risk and its components based on a chain of novel models previously calibrated and validated for Ho Chi Minh City. Furthermore, we assess the effectiveness of two decentralized adaptation options, namely private precautionary measures and rainwater retention, for mitigating pluvial flooding. Our integrated risk assessment reveals that the approaches are complementary, which is a major advantage for their implementation. Implementation of both approaches has the potential to reduce the expected annual damage and the number of annually affected households by 16% and 56%, respectively. This is also reflected in a significant reduction of annual losses per household, which we propose as an additional, people‐centered indicator of flood risk. Moreover, these measures are well‐suited to strengthen citizen participation in risk reduction beyond top‐down protection schemes. Complementing the ring‐dike with decentralized adaptation options can therefore be seen as an effective and generic strategy to alleviate the impacts of nuisance flooding in coastal megacities, such as Ho Chi Minh City, and should be incentivized by decision‐makers. Aside from hydrological and metocean site conditions, both the methodology and findings of this study are transferrable to any coastal megacity facing similar challenges."

 Climate change and disturbance threaten forested ecosystems across the globe. Our ability to predict the future distribution of forests requires understanding the limiting factors for regeneration. Forest canopies buffer against near-surface air temperature and vapour pressure deficit extremes, and ongoing losses of forest canopy from disturbances such as wildfire can exacerbate climate constraints on natural regeneration. Here we combine experimental, empirical and simulation-based evidence to show that soil surface temperatures constrain the low-elevation extent of forests in the western United States. Simulated potential soil surface temperatures predict the position of the low-elevation forest treeline, exhibiting temperature thresholds consistent with field and laboratory studies. High-resolution historical and future surface temperature maps show that 107,000–238,000 km2 (13–20%) of currently forested area exceeds the critical thermal threshold for forest regeneration and this area is projected to more than double by 2050. Soil surface temperature is an important physical control on seedling survival at low elevations that will likely be an increasing constraint on the extent of western United States forests as the climate warms.

 Point defects in crystalline solids behave as optically addressable individual quantum systems when present in sufficiently low concentrations. In two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, such quantum defects hold potential as versatile single photon sources. Here, we report the synthesis and optical properties of Nb-doped monolayer WS2 in the dilute limit where the average spacing between individual dopants exceeds the optical diffraction limit, allowing the emission spectrum to be studied at the single-dopant level. We show that these individual dopants exhibit common features of quantum emitters, including narrow emission lines (with linewidths <1 meV), strong spatial confinement, and photon antibunching. These emitters consistently occur within a narrow spectral range across multiple samples, distinct from common quantum emitters in van der Waals (vdW) materials that show large ensemble broadening. Analysis of the Zeeman splitting reveals that they can be attributed to bound exciton complexes comprising dark excitons and negatively charged Nb.

 Organismal communities associated with coral reefs, particularly invertebrates and microbes, play crucial roles in ecosystem maintenance and coral health. Here, we characterized the organismal composition of a healthy, non-urbanized reef (Site A) and a degraded, urbanized reef (Site B) in the Gulf of Eilat/Aqaba, Red Sea to assess its impact on coral health and physiology. Biomimetically designed terracotta tiles were conditioned for 6 months at both sites, then reciprocally transplanted, and scleractinian coral species, Acropora eurystoma and Stylophora pistillata, were attached for an additional 6 months. After 12 months, tiles from Site A transplanted to Site B exhibited greater invertebrate richness and diversity than Site B’s original tiles (via Cytochrome c. Oxidase subunit I metabarcoding). Key bacteria from the healthy reef were more prevalent on Site A tiles and on the tiles transplanted to Site B (via 16S rRNA gene sequencing). Corals originally from Site B attached to transplanted healthy tiles (Site A) showed higher photochemical capacity, increased endosymbionts, and reduced physiological stress, measured by total antioxidant capacity and an integrated biomarker response. Our findings demonstrate the successful transfer of organismal communities between reefs, highlighting the potential benefits of healthy reef-associated invertebrates and microbes on coral physiology and their implications for reef restoration strategies.

 Communities and individuals are turning to courts to hold governments and high-emitting firms to account for the adverse consequences of climate change. Such litigation is part of a broader trend in which stakeholders are increasingly scrutinizing firms for their sustainability practices. For firms, rising climate litigation risk may exacerbate wider sustainability risks. Here we construct a comprehensive database of filings and decisions relating to 108 climate lawsuits against US- and European-listed firms between 2005 and 2021. We show that firms experience, on average, a 0.41% fall in stock returns following a climate-related filing or an unfavourable court decision. Cases filed against Carbon Majors, primarily the world’s largest fossil fuel producers, saw the largest stock market responses, with returns reducing by 0.57% and 1.50% following filings and unfavourable decisions, respectively. Markets respond more to ‘novel’ climate litigation involving new legal arguments or jurisdictions. Our findings suggest that climate litigation provides a way for stakeholders to challenge actual and perceived weaknesses in the sustainability practices of firms.

 Environmental policy in the United States is heavily influenced by civil litigation, which is used by government, environmental groups and industry to shape environmental protections. These disputes impact national and global environmental policy, but there is limited knowledge about outcomes for pro- and anti-regulatory plaintiffs or which areas of environmental policy are focused on by different plaintiffs. Drawing on 25,775 environmental civil suits and 4,142 judicial decisions filed in federal district courts between 1988 and 2022, we show that pro-regulatory plaintiffs tend to have a higher win rate than anti-regulatory ones, that federal enforcement litigation focuses overwhelmingly on pollution and waste-related conflicts, that environmental advocacy groups focus heavily on conservation-related conflicts and that climate and environmental justice-related themes are rarely discussed in environmental legal decisions. The inequality in legal advocacy that we document may help to explain areas of strength and weakness in US environmental policy, with implications for environmental justice and global sustainability.

This study presents a catalyst- and hydrogen-free temperature-gradient thermolysis strategy to achieve this goal. 
 Escalating global plastic pollution and the depletion of fossil-based resources underscore the urgent need for innovative end-of-life plastic management strategies in the context of a circular economy. Thermolysis is capable of upcycling end-of-life plastics to intermediate molecules suitable for downstream conversion to eventually high-value chemicals, but tuning the molar mass distribution of the products is challenging. Here we report a temperature-gradient thermolysis strategy for the conversion of polyethylene and polypropylene into hydrocarbons with tunable molar mass distributions. The whole thermolysis process is catalyst- and hydrogen-free. The thermolysis of polyethylene and polyethylene/polypropylene mixtures with tailored temperature gradients generated oil with an average chain length of ~C14. The oil featured a high concentration of synthetically useful α-olefins. Computational fluid dynamics simulations revealed that regulating the reactor wall temperature was the key to tuning the hydrocarbon distributions. Subsequent oxidation of the obtained α-olefins by sulfuric acid and neutralization by potassium hydroxide afforded sulfate detergents with excellent foaming behaviour and emulsifying capacity and low critical micelle concentration. Overall, this work provides a viable approach to producing value-added chemicals from end-of-life plastics, improving the circularity of the anthropogenic carbon cycle.

 Over the last four decades (1980–2020), the summer westerlies that prevail in South Asia along the monsoon trough region have weakened by about 25% based on multiple reanalysis datasets. Trends in a range of climate model simulations suggest that the weakening is driven by multiple anthropogenic forcings. Over the period, sea-level pressure has increased by 0.6–1.0 hPa over South Asia’s northwestern regions, induced by cooling due to aerosol emission and changes in land use and land cover, and has decreased over the Arabian Peninsula mainly due to warming by greenhouse gases. These changes in temperature and pressure act to weaken the regional pressure gradient, deflecting the subtropical westerlies from South Asia toward the Arabian Peninsula and weakening the winds in the monsoon trough and its adjacent region. The slowing down of winds appears to result in an anomalous moisture loading and increase in rainfall over the semi-arid northwestern South Asia. This weakening and its associated changes in regional climate are highly relevant to policymaking across South Asia."

 Assessing mitigation strategies for aviation is a critical issue for the aviation stakeholders, while the debate continues on the most appropriate CO2-equivalence metrics to address non-CO2 effects. Here, we propose two lightweight climate models that can be parameterised to assess these strategies and move beyond the CO2-equivalence metrics debate. A first approach relies on the use of the GWP* method, while a second one uses the FaIR climate emulator. These lightweight models, which should be considered as a new family of climate models for aviation that facilitate parametric studies, provide a straightforward and consistent means of evaluating mitigation strategies at the temperature level, although they are still limited for informing policymakers due to the significant uncertainties involved. They bypass the need for CO2-equivalence metrics for comparing strategies. The latter should rather be used for other applications, such as policy mechanisms to encourage the emergence of strategies, as they are not suitable for assessing temperature changes from aviation. The debate on the choice of CO2-equivalence metrics could then focus on methodological and ethical criteria. However, this paper demonstrates that the higher the traffic, the more appropriate it is to choose CO2-equivalence metrics with high values for consistency with temperature estimates.

 In California’s San Joaquin Valley, groundwater overdraft has caused dramatic and continued land subsidence during two main periods, 1925–1970 (“the historic period”) and post-2006. The impacts of the subsidence are severe, with modified flood risks, damaged aqueducts, and permanently altered aquifer dynamics. However, we do not have a complete record of the post-2006 subsidence due to a 2011–2015 gap in Valley-wide observations, and this makes it difficult to develop an appropriate management response. Here, we used satellite geodetic subsidence measurements to quantify the Valley-wide subsidence volume during 2006–2022. We found a total subsidence volume of 14 km3 over the 16 years, the same as was measured during 24 years of monitoring in the historic period. Considering the extraordinary 2006–2022 Valley-wide subsidence, we make high-level recommendations for subsidence mitigation, highlighting the importance of focusing groundwater overdraft reductions on the deeper aquifers where subsidence originates, and on localities where subsidence impacts are greatest.

 Parameterisation schemes within General Circulation Models are required to capture cloud processes and precipitation formation but exhibit long-standing known biases. Here, we develop a hybrid approach that tackles these biases by embedding a Multi-Output Gaussian Process trained to predict high resolution variability within each climate model grid box. The trained multi-output Gaussian Process model is coupled in-situ with a simplified Atmospheric General Circulation Model named SPEEDY. The temperature and specific humidity profiles of SPEEDY are perturbed at fixed intervals according to the variability predicted from the Gaussian Process. Ten-year predictions are generated for both control and machine learning hybrid models. The hybrid model reduces the global precipitation area-weighted root-mean squared error by up to 17% and over the tropics by up to 20%. Hybrid techniques have been known to introduce non-physical states therefore physical quantities are explored to ensure that climatic drift is not observed. Furthermore, to understand the drivers of the precipitation improvements the changes to thermodynamic profiles and the distribution of lifted index values are investigated.

 Explaining tropical tree cover distribution in areas of intermediate rainfall is challenging, with fire’s role in limiting tree cover particularly controversial. We use a novel Bayesian approach to provide observational constraints on the strength of the influence of humans, fire, rainfall seasonality, heat stress, and wind throw on tropical tree cover. Rainfall has the largest relative impact on tree cover (11.6–39.6%), followed by direct human pressures (29.8–36.8%), heat stress (10.5–23.3%) and rainfall seasonality (6.3–22.8%). Fire has a smaller impact (0.2–3.2%) than other stresses, increasing to 0.3–5.2% when excluding human influence. However, we found a potential vulnerability of eastern Amazon and Indonesian forests to fire, with up to 2% forest loss for a 1% increase in burnt area. Our results suggest that vegetation models should focus on fire development for emerging fire regimes in tropical forests and revisit the linkages between rainfall, non-fire disturbances, land use and broad-scale vegetation distributions.

 Satellite-based measurements have emerged as an effective method for the top-down estimates of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Changes in the column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of CO2 (XCO2) in the atmosphere reflect contributions from both human activities and natural processes, posing challenges in accurately extracting anthropogenic XCO2 signals and quantifying urban CO2 emissions. Here, we introduce a novel method based on spatial autocorrelation to directly identify anthropogenic XCO2 signals from satellite measurements of Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2). These signals serve as constraints for atmospheric transport model simulations, enabling the verification of emission inventory over urban areas. Utilizing 35 OCO-2 overpasses over the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration, we demonstrate the effectiveness of local Moran's I statistics in detecting localized anthropogenic XCO2 enhancements. The results show an average XCO2 increase of 1.36–4.41 ppm in proximity to major cities and areas with intensive industrial activity. A case study near Nanjing, based on eight overpasses, reveals XCO2 enhancements with peaks ranging from 2.26 to 4.72 ppm. To establish the relationship between these XCO2 enhancements and CO2 emissions, we conducted WRF-Chem simulations driven by emissions from the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR). Discrepancies between observed and simulated XCO2 enhancements were primarily attributed to uncertainties in the prior emissions, the calculation of urban XCO2 enhancements from OCO-2 data, and complex atmospheric transport dynamics. From our estimates, the daily CO2 emissions in Nanjing is 0.65 ± 0.15 MtCO2/day, which is different from the EDGAR inventory by −10.5 % to 77.3 % (i.e., 0.17 ± 0.14 MtCO2 /day). Error analysis suggests an uncertainty in CO2 emission estimates associated with XCO2 enhancement and wind speed ranging from 16 % to 32 % (i.e., 0.08–0.15 MtCO2/day). This study proposes an objective approach to assess urban CO2 emissions, leveraging satellite XCO2 observations to improve accuracy and reliability in emission inventories."

 This paper analyzes the four severe cooling events in Changchun, Northeast China, in January for selected years. The events in the absence of sudden stratospheric warmings were chosen. This excludes the possible effects of warm stratospheric anomalies in the polar vortex region, which may affect midlatitudes. The meridional profiles and maps for the coldest and warmest days of January are compared using the temperature and ozone data from observations and reanalysis. Based on the vertical temperature structure compared to the coldest–warmest days, the lower stratosphere–surface thermal coupling was analyzed, which has not been studied previously. It has been shown that (i) temperature increase by 5–10 °C in the lower stratosphere, (ii) lowering the tropopause by about 2–3 km, (iii) pushing the cold midtropospheric layer from climatological about 3 km to the surface with formation of the midlatitude temperature minimum, and (iv) a decrease in surface temperature in Changchun by 15–24 °C, concurrently occurred on the coldest days compared to the warmest days. Cold air in the region of the midlatitude minimum temperature, merging with the cold air of higher latitudes, contributes to the formation of the cold air outbreak pattern. The main elements of stratospheric and tropospheric dynamics (quasi-stationary and traveling planetary waves, zonally asymmetric Brewer–Dobson circulation, deformation of the tropopause and tropospheric isotherms) involved in extreme cooling events are analyzed. Because of the positive correlation between total ozone and temperature in the lower stratosphere, extremely high total ozone over the midlatitude region may serve as an indicator of warm stratospheric anomaly and possible downward thermal forcing."

 Bromine radicals released from sea ice, snow, and marine sources play a critical role in the atmospheric chemistry of polar regions. The Chemical and Mesoscale Mechanisms of Polar Cell Aerosol Nucleation (CAMMPCAN) ship campaign conducted in coastal East Antarctica over two 6-month periods in 2017–18 and 2018–19 provides a unique dataset to identify the environmental drivers of bromine variability in Antarctic spring and summer. In this study, we used CAMMPCAN chemical and meteorological observations combined with reanalysis data from the Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) and satellite-based sea ice data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center to select variables that showed statistically significant correlation with bromine monoxide (BrO) partial columns measured during CAMMPCAN. We then used those variables in principal component analysis and subsequent principal component regression to identify dominant modes of Antarctic environmental variability and their impacts on lower tropospheric BrO. Comparing our three dominant Antarctic principal components to those from a similar analysis conducted previously for the Arctic (Swanson et al., 2020), we found only one mode with clear overlap, representing a vertical mixing mode in which low-pressure systems mix BrO and its precursors into the lower troposphere. We also identified an Antarctic mode describing conditions favourable for blowing snow, similar to the combined effect of two modes from the Arctic analysis but more clearly disambiguated here due to the inclusion of sea ice data in our analysis. The third Antarctic mode, attributed to an ocean source (biological activity and/or sea salt aerosol), was particularly important in summer. The principal component regression model developed from these modes showed moderate skill in predicting BrO partial columns in the lowest 2 km of the troposphere (R = 0.51), a significant improvement over the Arctic-based regression model (R = 0.08). Neither model could reproduce the observed variability in BrO in the lowest 200 m. Finally, we applied the same analysis to coincident CAMMPCAN observations of gaseous elemental mercury and found regression of our three dominant modes could explain nearly 50% of observed mercury variability (R = 0.69). Our results reinforce the importance of sea ice and ocean processes in bromine cycling in coastal East Antarctica and highlight the need to consider Antarctic-specific processes in mechanistic models of atmospheric bromine chemistry."

Santos,Analysis of tropospheric ozone concentration and their predictors in mainland Portugal,"•Atmospheric patterns associated with high and low tropospheric ozone concentration. •Identification of the main ozone predictors. •Relation of high ozone concentration in the atmosphere and extreme events, as heat waves and wildfires. 
 Tropospheric ozone is a secondary air pollutant with a photochemical origin, commonly resulting from nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds in the presence of short-wave radiation. Portugal has high solar radiation exposure and, consequently, near-surface ozone levels tend to reach, or even exceed, the threshold defined by the European Union air quality warning system during summer. Furthermore, episodes with high radiation, temperature, and ozone concentration values are expected to increase owing to more recurrent and persistent heatwaves and wildfires driven by climate change. Exposure to high ozone concentrations has negative effects on human health and vegetation. The present study aims to understand the atmospheric patterns associated with high ozone levels and identify the main ozone precursors on mainland Portugal. The analysis was carried out for daily ozone concentrations averaged between 0900 and 2100 UTC, from 2004 to 2022. A stepwise regression analysis was applied to the potential predictors: fire radiative power, thermal amplitude, maximum temperature, boundary layer height, NO2 concentration, radiation, and time of the year. The obtained model shows high accuracy and robustness, even when tested with the Monte Carlo method, and indicates that the predictors have a joint and different contribution to ozone formation across the Portuguese regions. The variables that have greater coefficients as a response from the stepwise regression model were temperature and fire radiative power, with fire radiative power being more significant for Norte and Centro regions, which are the most affected by wildfires. Radiation and temperature are more relevant in the Alentejo and Sul regions, where radiation and temperatures are climatologically higher."

 Secondary ice production (SIP) leads to the formation of new ice particles from preexisting ones. Besides generating ice crystals, SIP can also influence cloud characteristics, including convection, precipitation, and even radiative properties. This study examines the effect of ice crystal formation by Hallett-Mossop, fragmentation of freezing drops, and fragmentation due to ice–ice collision processes in an idealized deep convective cloud observed during the HAIC/HIWC campaign, using the 3D bin microphysics scheme DESCAM. Our results indicate that heterogeneous ice nucleation and fragmentation of freezing drops play a role during the early formation of the cloud while after that, Hallett-Mossop and ice-ice breakup processes dominate, representing 17.6 % and 81.5 % of the ice crystal production, for temperatures warmer than −30°C. For temperatures colder than −30°C, homogeneous and heterogeneous ice nucleation processes are the main contributors to ice crystal formation. The impact of each SIP process on particle size distributions is analyzed by tracking air parcel trajectories. This study also shows the effect of SIP processes on cloud development. Implementing SIP results in a decrease in cloud top altitude by around 1.5 km. Our analysis shows that this effect is caused by increased latent heat released below 11 km, resulting from a stronger vapor deposition on more numerous ice crystals. This enhances convection at lower levels but inhibits it above. Furthermore, incorporating SIP leads to 15 % decrease in total precipitation amount and 25 % reduction of intense rainfall (accumulated precipitation over 40 mm). Hence, our study emphasizes the importance of SIP mechanisms in cloud development and precipitation."

 A realistic three-dimensionnal large-eddy simulation is performed for the study of turbulent transport of sea spray aerosol in the coastal region of Le Croisic, France. A new transport model for the aerosol is implemented in the ARPS code. Simulation results are compared with field measurements, both for the mean wind field and aerosol concentration. The numerical results fit well with the observations. The mean vertical concentration profile takes an exponential shape when the data is averaged over sufficiently long timeframe, whereas the 15-min averaged profiles vary and deviate from the theory. The transport of the aerosols is analyzed in relation to the sea-land transition and the changes in thermal stability of the atmosphere during the diurnal cycle. Turbulence is found to play an important role in the mixing of aerosols in the unstable surface layer. The turbulent vertical transport of aerosols is enhanced through convective cells over the land during the day, whereas, at night, aerosols remain trapped near the surface and are transported over appreciable horizontal distances under quasi-neutral or stable thermal conditions."

 Tropical cyclogenesis is a complex phenomenon, involving processes across multiple scales, with various theories proposed to explain its mechanisms. This paper provides an up-to-date summary of the established physical mechanisms and controlling factors of cyclogenesis. Understanding the nature of tropical cyclone formation is necessary to improve tropical cyclone forecasts and inform tropical cyclone mitigation strategies targeting early-stage intervention. Despite the disparities among theories, the critical role of persistent, intensified convection in tropical cyclone initiation is universally acknowledged. Therefore, our hypothesis is that interrupting convective development using aerosol injection is a potential strategy for mitigating tropical cyclone formation. Targetted injection of coarse and fine aerosols at the formation stage are two proposed potential approaches for mitigating tropical cyclones. These methods have completely different microphysical effects but each may ultimately interfere with the formation of the nascent cyclone. These potential interventions open new areas of further research, which are important and necessary to establish a solid scientific foundation for cyclogenesis mitigation."
