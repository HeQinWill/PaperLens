10.5194/essd-17-579-2025,True,Earth System Science Data,这篇论文介绍了利用NASA/NOAA可见红外成像辐射仪套件（VIIRS）上的日夜波段（DNB）数据，创建全球首个综合性海域灯光分布图。该研究通过整合VIIRS船舶探测（VBD）数据和VIIRS无云夜间灯光（VNL）数据，克服了单一数据源的局限性，实现了对各种海上灯光结构（如渔场、平台、锚地、气体火炬、航运路线等）的全面绘制。研究成果可以用于改进对渔业活动、海上光污染以及锚地供应链中断的理解，从而促进更可持续和高效的实践。其核心方法是利用DNB传感器对夜间灯光进行探测和分析，并通过算法去除生物质燃烧等干扰因素。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是利用卫星观测进行夜间灯光监测，这属于大气成分分析（光污染）的范畴。,"['Satellite observations', 'Nighttime light', 'VIIRS', 'DNB', 'Airglow', 'Light pollution', 'Fishing activities monitoring', 'Offshore platforms monitoring']",Christopher D.

The empty sea provides a dark and uniform canvas upon which light detections can be aggregated for extended periods to reveal human lighting structures. The form of the structures only becomes apparent when data from 1 or more years are accumulated. Identifiable structures include fishing grounds, platforms, gas flares, anchorages, and transportation routes. 
 We present the first comprehensive multiyear global mapping of offshore lighting structures derived from low-light imaging satellite observations collected at night. The sensor is the day–night band (DNB) flown as part of the NASA/NOAA Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The product merges two operational nighttime light products: VIIRS boat detection (VBD) data and VIIRS cloud-free nighttime light (VNL) data. The two products are spatially complementary, making it possible to fill gaps through a merger. Both product sets have an average DNB radiance layer, and the merger involves preserving the higher of the two average radiances. A wide range of lighting structures is present, i.e., fishing grounds, platforms, anchorages, gas flares, transit routes, and the glow surrounding bright lighting onshore. The richness of the numbers and types of offshore lighting structures can be traced back to the DNB spike detector at the core of the VBD algorithm. The VNL algorithm uses outlier removal to filter out biomass burning, an essential process for mapping electric lighting onshore. The outlier removal drops about 80 % of the offshore lighting detections. We expect that the new product will lead to an improved understanding of fishing grounds, offshore light pollution, and supply chain disruptions at anchorages, thereby aiding in the development of more sustainable and efficient practices.

Batch experiments show that FeS and Fe0 contents determine the kinetics and longevity of As removal by S-mZVI, respectively. The Fe0/FeS galvanic cell accelerates the consumption of Fe0 by dissolved oxygen (DO) while preserving FeS to preferentially remove As as sulfide, which is protected from oxidation by Fe0. In column studies, mZVI and S0 were mixed in sand to form S-mZVI in situ. Results of sequential extraction of reacted S-mZVI particles from different column zones and run stages further indicate that As formed as sulfide by S-mZVI, which was then oxidized by DO after Fe0 depletion to form As-iron (hydr)oxides. X-ray absorption near-edge structure characterization confirmed that As sulfide is mainly in the form of realgar (As4S4). S-mZVI (2 wt % of column sand) reduces total As from 2 mg/L to 10 μg/L, up to 300 bed volumes, with a residence time of 70 min.

Major chemical companies in the Pierre-Bénite area have used PFAS in the production of fluoropolymers and fluorotelomers, with effluents discharged into the Rhône River. This together with other contamination sources, such as firefighting foam use at a vicinal harbor oil depot, likely resulted in a complex PFAS signature. This study investigated PFAS contamination in various water sources in southern Lyon, including ponds, rivers, factory channels, wells, springs, and tap water. Out of 47 samples, 22 had a Σ77PFAS above 100 ng/L (maximum: ∼700 ng/L), and 67% of the tap water samples exceeded the European guideline of 100 ng/L for Σ20PFAS. Target PFAS profiles were dominated by perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (particularly C4 to C8), in agreement with their historical or current industrial usage. Suspect screening also revealed the occurrence of electrochemical fluorination precursors such as N-sulfopropyldimethylammoniopropyl perfluorohexanesulfonamido acetic acid (N-SPAmP-FHxSAA) and bistriflimide (used in the composition of ionic liquids).

However, efforts to increase tree cover across cities have neglected to account for the trees' health and function, which are known to control their associated environmental benefits but have been difficult to assess at scales relevant for management. Here, we use remotely sensed, high resolution canopy temperature as a proxy for tree health and function and evaluate its relation to the built environment across Minneapolis‐St. Paul (MSP) using machine learning analyses. We develop a new index that incorporates information on urban trees' health and function, in addition to their presence. This index, when applied across MSP, suggests that canopy benefits may not be distributed equally even in neighborhoods with similar canopy cover. Furthermore, accounting for tree health and function can yield more effective and equitable benefits by guiding the location and magnitude of intervention for urban tree management."

Although the ophiolite is continuous and of similar age across the region, the eastern and western segments display distinct geological contrasts. To investigate the deep structural mechanisms underlying these surface variations, we applied teleseismic traveltime tomography using an advanced eikonal solver and a matrix‐free adjoint‐state approach on data from a dense seismic array. Our 3D upper mantle P‐wave model reveals a significant velocity contrast, with positive anomalies in the west and negative anomalies in the east, separated by a prominent fault zone. We propose that the continental lithosphere beneath northeastern Arabia underwent thinning during the Permian breakup of Pangaea. This pre‐obduction lithospheric segmentation likely influenced the subduction dynamics associated with the ophiolite obduction process. Additionally, early Cenozoic thermal activity may have further amplified lithospheric thinning, contributing to the observed structural variations."

However, the observational evidence of wave‐particle interaction connecting PSWs and GUs is absent. In this letter, we demonstrate GUs are driven by pitch‐angle scattering of time domain structures modulated by the PSWs, based on the conjugated ionospheric and magnetospheric observations. Specifically, ionospheric GUs are lighted by the pitch‐angle scattering of <1 keV thermal electron and ions and energetic ions with energy up to dozens of keV near the plasmapause. Further, the total fluxes during one PSW period and energy of scattered electron and ions determine the size and luminosity of GUs.

10.1029/2024JD042153,False,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文研究了中低层涡旋在热带气旋发生发展中的相对重要性。研究使用辐射敏感性作为工具，通过对比不同太阳辐射条件下的理想化数值实验（包含真实日变化辐射、仅白天和仅夜晚三组实验）来研究这个问题。结果表明，白天辐射条件更有利于中层涡旋发展，因为层状云覆盖范围广，主导辐射加热，并在4-6公里高度产生较大的绝热加热垂直梯度。然而，涡度收支分析表明，较强的中层涡旋无法向下延伸增强低层涡旋。此外，白天太阳辐射增加了低层稳定性，抑制了冷池边缘的对流发展，减弱了平流涡度通量的低层辐合，限制了低层涡度的增强。因此，在仅白天实验中，热带气旋发生发展延迟。该研究表明，通过增强低层平流涡度通量辐合，长波辐射加速热带气旋发生发展，这往往发生在没有太阳辐射的夜间。总的来说，这项研究认为低层涡旋的发展相对于中层涡旋而言，对热带气旋发生发展更为重要。 这项研究主要关注的是热带气旋的动力学过程，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。,"['tropical cyclogenesis', 'vorticity', 'radiation', 'diabatic heating', 'cloud cover', 'solar insolation']",Yusheng Teng;Xiaodong Tang,Relative Importance of Mid‐Level and Low‐Level Vortices in Tropical Cyclogenesis Inferred From Experiments on Sensitivity to Radiation,"The associated dynamics of mid‐level and low‐level vortices and their relative importance in tropical cyclogenesis (TCG) are less studied and understood to date. The issues are studied using the sensitivity of TCG to radiation as a tool. Three groups of idealized full‐physics ensemble experiments with distinct solar insolation conditions are conducted: the control group with real diurnal radiation, the day‐only, and the night‐only groups for comparison. New findings are that the daytime radiative condition is more favorable for mid‐level vorticity development than the nighttime one. This is because stratiform clouds cover a large area and dominate radiative heating, inducing a greater vertical gradient of diabatic heating at altitudes of 4–6 km through increased evaporation cooling most at about 4 km and decrease of latent heat release above about 6 km. However, the vorticity budgets show that the stronger mid‐level vortex cannot extend downward to enhance the low‐level vortex. Moreover, daytime solar radiation increases the low‐level stability and suppresses convective development at the edge of cold pools, weakening low‐level convergence of advective vorticity flux, and limiting low‐level vorticity enhancement. Therefore, TCG is delayed in day‐only experiments compared to others. These results reveal that the acceleration of TCG by longwave radiation is primarily caused by the enhancement of low‐level convergence of advective vorticity flux, which tends to occur at nighttime without solar insolation. The study suggests that the development of low‐level vortex is more important to TCG relative to mid‐level vortex with radiative effects."

The diurnal offshore precipitation propagation begins slowly (3–10 m s−1) near the coast of NWSA (<200 km) but accelerates significantly (∼20 m s−1) and shows an afternoon enhancement far from the coast (>400 km). However, the driving mechanisms behind this long‐distance precipitation propagation remain unclear. Using a new cloud tracking and classification data set, we found that mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are the dominant precipitation contributors in the offshore region of NWSA. Cloud tracking shows that the long‐distance propagation and the afternoon enhancement of diurnal precipitation primarily originate from MCSs initiated in the early morning, either over open oceans or from the coast of Central America. Composite tendency analysis shows that MCSs initiated near the coast of Central America have significant upward cooling and moistening signals starting from the surface before initiation. Further analysis of surface diurnal perturbation fields indicates that the land breeze is the primary driving mechanism for MCS initiation. Conversely, for MCSs initiated over open oceans, a significant downward cooling signal from 400 hPa is observed ∼7 hr before initiation, corresponding to the passage of diurnal gravity waves emitted from the Andes. Additionally, our findings highlight the critical role of lower and mid‐level moisture conditions in MCS initiation, alongside the influence of gravity waves."

 Granzymes are a family of serine proteases mainly expressed by CD8+ T cells, natural killer cells, and innate-like lymphocytes1. Although their primary function is thought to be the induction of cell death in virally infected and tumor cells, accumulating evidence indicates certain granzymes can elicit inflammation by acting on extracellular substrates1. Recently, we found that the majority of tissue CD8+ T cells in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovium and in inflamed organs across other diseases express granzyme K (GZMK)2, a tryptase-like protease with poorly defined function. Here, we show that GZMK can activate the complement cascade by cleaving C2 and C4. The nascent C4b and C2b fragments form a C3 convertase that cleaves C3, enabling assembly of a C5 convertase that cleaves C5. The resulting convertases generate all the effector molecules of the complement cascade: the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, the opsonins C4b and C3b, and the membrane attack complex. In RA synovium, GZMK is enriched in regions with abundant complement activation, and fibroblasts are the major producers of complement proteins that serve as substrates for GZMK-mediated complement activation. Further, Gzmk-deficient mice have less severe arthritis and dermatitis with concomitant decreases in complement activation. Our findings describe the discovery of a previously unidentified mechanism of complement activation that is entirely driven by lymphocyte-derived GZMK. Given the widespread abundance of GZMK-expressing T cells in tissues in chronic inflammatory diseases, GZMK-mediated complement activation is likely to be an important contributor to tissue inflammation in multiple disease contexts."

 Transition metal-catalysed asymmetric nitrene transfer provides a powerful means to access various bioactive N-containing compounds as single enantiomers. However, enantioselective NH transfer that allows concise assembly of unprotected enantioenriched amines remains an enduring challenge. We report here an iron-catalysed stereoselective NH imidation of sulfoxide, which is integrated with photocatalytic racemisation of sulfoxide, enabling a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) strategy for direct and asymmetric synthesis of NH-sulfoximines. This approach is distinct from the existing methods by avoiding protecting group manipulations and/or the use of chiral substrates. Computational studies on the NH imidation reaction suggest the involvement of an iron-aminyl radical intermediate, and its reaction with sulfoxide proceeds through a synchronous nucleophilic addition of sulfoxide to nitrogen center and ligand-to-metal single electron transfer process to form the N–S bond. In addition, the stereoselectivity is primarily dictated by the difference in dispersion interactions of the transition states.

The authors demonstrate that suppressing PrP reduces copper overload and liver damage, offering a potential therapeutic strategy for this fatal inherited disorder. 
 Copper (Cu) is a vitally important micronutrient, whose balance between essential and toxic levels requires a tightly regulated network of proteins. Dysfunction in key components of this network leads to the disruption of Cu homeostasis, resulting in fatal disorders such as Wilson disease, which is caused by mutations in the hepatic Cu efflux transporter ATP7B. Unfortunately, the molecular targets for normalizing Cu homeostasis in Wilson disease remain poorly understood. Here, using genome-wide screening, we identified the cellular prion protein (PrP) as an important mediator of Cu toxicity in WD. Loss of ATP7B stimulates hepatic expression of PrP, which promotes endocytic Cu uptake, leading to toxic Cu overload. Suppression of PrP significantly reduces Cu toxicity in cell and animal models of Wilson disease. These findings highlight the critical regulatory role of PrP in copper metabolism and open new avenues for exploring the therapeutic potential of PrP suppression in Wilson disease. This study reveals that prion protein (PrP) promotes copper toxicity in Wilson disease by facilitating copper endocytosis. The authors demonstrate that suppressing PrP reduces copper overload and liver damage, offering a potential therapeutic strategy for this fatal inherited disorder."

 Genomic heterogeneity has largely been overlooked in single-cell replication timing (scRT) studies. Here, we develop MnM, an efficient machine learning-based tool that allows disentangling scRT profiles from heterogenous samples. We use single-cell copy number data to accurately perform missing value imputation, identify cell replication states, and detect genomic heterogeneity. This allows us to separate somatic copy number alterations from copy number changes resulting from DNA replication. Our methodology brings critical insights into chromosomal aberrations and highlights the ubiquitous aneuploidy process during tumorigenesis. The copy number and scRT profiles obtained by analysing >119,000 high-quality human single cells from different cell lines, patient tumours and patient-derived xenograft samples leads to a multi-sample heterogeneity-resolved scRT atlas. This atlas is an important resource for cancer research and demonstrates that scRT profiles can be used to study replication timing heterogeneity in cancer. Our findings also highlight the importance of studying cancer tissue samples to comprehensively grasp the complexities of DNA replication because cell lines, although convenient, lack dynamic environmental factors.

 Many applications of plasmonic nanoparticles require precise control of their optical properties that are governed by nanoparticle dimensions, shape, morphology and composition. Finding reaction conditions for the synthesis of nanoparticles with targeted characteristics is a time-consuming and resource-intensive trial-and-error process, however closed-loop nanoparticle synthesis enables the accelerated exploration of large chemical spaces without human intervention.

Here, the authors report that high-density dislocations with segregation-modified configurations produced by additive manufacturing increase strength without compromising ductility. 
 Dislocations are the intrinsic origin of crystal plasticity. However, initial high-density dislocations in work-hardened materials are commonly asserted to be detrimental to ductility according to textbook strengthening theory. Inspired by the self-organized critical states of non-equilibrium complex systems in nature, we explored the mechanical response of an additively manufactured medium entropy alloy with segregation-dislocation self-organized structures (SD-SOS). We show here that when initial dislocations are in the form of SD-SOS, the textbook theory that dislocation hardening inevitably sacrifices ductility can be overturned. Our results reveal that the SD-SOS, in addition to providing dislocation sources by emitting dislocations and stacking faults, also dynamically interacts with gliding dislocations to generate sustainable Lomer-Cottrell locks and jogs for dislocation storage. The effective dislocation multiplication and storage capabilities lead to the continuous refinement of planar slip bands, resulting in high ductility in the work-hardened alloy produced by additive manufacturing. These findings set a precedent for optimizing the mechanical behavior of alloys via tuning dislocation configurations.

 The gut microbiome causally contributes to obesity; however, the role of fungi remains understudied. We previously identified three core species of the infant gut mycobiome (Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Malassezia restricta and Candida albicans) that correlated with body mass index, however their causal contributions to obesity development are unknown. Here we show the effects of early-life colonization by these fungal species on metabolic health in gnotobiotic mice fed standard (SD) or high-fat-high-sucrose (HFHS) diets. Each species resulted in bacterial microbiome compositional and functional differences. R. mucilaginosa and M. restricta increased adiposity in mice fed SD, while only R. mucilaginosa exacerbated metabolic disease. In contrast, C. albicans resulted in leanness and resistance to diet-induced obesity. Intestinal nutrient transporter expression was unaffected by the presence of fungi in jejunal enteroids, yet the immune landscape in white adipose tissue was distinctly impacted by each fungal species, suggesting that these phenotypes may be a result of fungal immune regulation.

This process is accompanied by a large uranium isotope fractionation, according to isotopic uranium concentrations obtained from experimental data. 
 Low-oxygen settings and transition zones between strictly anoxic and oxic conditions may have characterised large expanses of Precambrian continental margins, where oxygen-breathing, complex life emerged and diversified. Accurate reconstructions of oxygen levels in such conditions are therefore required, but current geochemical proxies fail in identifying transitional redox conditions. Uranium isotopes are an emerging palaeoredox proxy, as large isotope fractionations are recorded during the reduction of uranium into anoxic sediments. Their potential application to transitional conditions is, however, unclear, because the redox regulating mineralogy of such environments and the associated isotope fractionations are poorly constrained. Here, we explore the mineralogical transformations occurring during the partial oxidation of mackinawite. We show that green rust, a key mineral of Precambrian oceans, forms as a by-product of mackinawite oxidation, along with uraninite and polysulphide.

 Pronounced model-observation discrepancies in the changes of tropical Pacific zonal sea surface temperature gradient during the satellite era imply systematic model deficiencies. However, the relatively short high-quality instrumental record hampers robustly determining the response of tropical Pacific sea surface temperature to greenhouse gas increases. By adopting paleoclimate proxy records along with a series of climate model simulations, here we show that the zonal gradient is likely to decrease under sustained strong forcing. Paleoclimate proxy records indicate an overall increase of the zonal gradient over time, which has been accompanied by global-mean cooling associated with decreasing carbon dioxide concentrations. Model simulations are found to broadly reproduce the distinct contrast between warmer high carbon dioxide climates and the opposite climates, albeit with large inter-model discrepancy. The qualitative agreement among paleoclimate proxy records and modeled representations therefore lends some important credence to the sign of model-projected future tropical Pacific mean state change.

 The proliferation of pelagic Sargassum in the tropical Atlantic since 2011 is causing considerable health and economic concerns as large amounts of this brown alga arrive and accumulate in coastal ecosystems of western Africa and of the greater Caribbean Sea every year. Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the recurrence of Sargassum blooms since 2011 and their year-to-year variability. Among the hypotheses being debated about the origin and nutrient source to support the blooms are either: a) an increase in nutrient supply to the Atlantic Ocean via continental, or atmospheric inputs, or b) long-distance transport of a seed population during the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) event of 2009/2010 and stimulation of blooms in the tropical North Atlantic by nutrient supply primarily due to seasonal vertical mixing of the upper water column. The aim of this study is to address these alternate hypotheses. To this end, interannual numerical simulations (2002-2022) representing the transport, growth, and decay of pelagic Sargassum have been developed at basin scale. Our results confirm the role played by the NAO transport anomaly on the regime shift that occurred in 2010, and the primary role of vertical mixing in the tropical Atlantic as the primary nutrient source for the recurring blooms since 2011.

 Riverine sediment flux on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau follows separate trends in different headwater basins because of complicated pathways under global warming. Here we successfully reconstructed historical sediment fluxes from seven pathways at 25 hydrological stations during 1982 ~ 2022 using a conceptual Multivariate Climate Elasticity Model based on Taylor expansion and revealed the bifurcation in sediment flux trend. Significantly increasing trends occurred at five stations, caused either by elevated runoff from increased precipitation (contributing -10 ~ 50%) or by temperature modifying the underlying surface (-12 ~ 100%). Significantly decreasing trends were found at six stations, primarily owing to vegetation expansion (11 ~ 100%). Combinations of original vegetation condition and increasing rate of precipitation are pivotal for bifurcating the sediment flux trend. In the future, slowly increasing precipitation with greatly increasing temperature or poor original vegetation condition followed by rapid vegetation expansion may decelerate sediment yield, whereas rapidly increasing precipitation may overwhelm the marginal conservation effect of plentiful vegetation.

 Coastal farmlands in the eastern United States of America (USA) are increasingly suffering from rising soil salinity, rendering them unsuitable for economically productive agriculture. Saltwater intrusion (SWI) into the groundwater reservoir or soil salinization can result in land cover modification (e.g. reduced plant growth) or land cover conversion. Two primary examples of such land cover conversion are farmland to marsh or farmland to salt patches with no vegetation growth. However, due to varying spatial granularity of these conversions, it is challenging to quantify these land covers over a large geographic scale. To address this challenge, we evaluated a non-linear spectral unmixing approach with a Random Forest (RF) algorithm to quantify fractional abundance of salt patch and marshes. Using Sentinel-2 imagery from 2022, we generated gridded datasets for salt patches and marshes across the Delmarva Peninsula, and the associated uncertainty. Moreover, we developed two new spectral indices to enhance the spectral unmixing accuracy: the Normalized Difference Salt Patch Index (NDSPI) and the Modified Salt Patch Index (MSPI). We constructed two sets of ten RF models: one for salt patches and the other for marshes, achieving high (>99 %) training and testing accuracies for classification. The consistently high accuracy and low error values across different model runs demonstrate the method's reliability for classifying spectrally similar land cover classes in the mid-Atlantic region and beyond. Validation metrics for sub-pixel fractional abundances in the salt model revealed a moderate R-squared value of 0.50, and a high R-squared value of 0.90 for the marsh model. Our method complements labor-intensive field-based salinity measurements by offering a reproducible method that can be repeated annually and scaled up to cover large geographic regions."

 Changes in urban land cover (ULC) provide critical evidence of urbanization including both urban expansion and internal structural renewal. Existing global urbanization research focused on urban expansion and neglected the dynamic ULC changes occurring inside urban areas. This study addresses this issue by developing a Global Annual Urban Land Cover Fraction (GAULCF) dataset, which encompasses six ULC categories (Non-crop Vegetation-Cropland-Building-Non-build Impervious-Surface-Soil-Water, V-C-B-I-S-W) in global urban areas and measures their dynamics from 2001 to 2020. However, V-C-B-I-S-W six kinds of ULC extraction is much more difficult than classical V-I-S extraction, especially for distinguishing non-crop vegetation and cropland, buildings and non-build impervious. Accordingly, this study proposes a novel deep learning unmixing algorithm, Normalized Non-negative Multi-objective Residual T-ConvLSTM (NNMRT) model, with strong encoding and recognition capacities for extracting GAULCF. GAULCF has undergone rigorous accuracy assessment and third-party validation, whose standard error of regression, root mean square error, and mean absolute error are 0.127, 0.113, and 0.061, respectively. The GAULCF dataset reveals significant global ULC changes over the past 20 years: the impervious surface area nearly doubled, while building areas increased from 124,589 km2 to 206,603 km2; and vegetation and cropland were the predominant land cover types lost to urban expansion.

 Manifold learning is an important technique for dimensionality reduction in hyperspectral images. It maps data from high dimensions to low dimensions to eliminate redundant information. However, the existing manifold learning methods cannot effectively solve the problem of lacking label information and ignore the negative impact of dimensionality reduction on sample division.

The spatial-spectral self-training module is proposed, which learns pseudo-labels by jointly training the spatial and spectral information. This module first locates the spatial neighbors of the labeledit can adapt to different data distributions and feature samples and then sets an adaptive threshold based on the spectral features of labeled samples to filter spatial neighbors, so as to obtain the spatial-spectral neighbors as pseudo-labeled samples. In addition, to divide the sample categories while dimensionality reduction, low-dimensional manifold embedding is constructed and the metric constraint is imposed on the manifolds. Specifically, the Gaussian kernel function based on Mahalanobis distance is used to map the data into a more discriminative low-dimensional manifold embedding. At the same time, the regularized distance metric constraint is imposed on the manifold, so that samples of the same class are clustered and different classes are mutually exclusive. SSMM conducts various forms of experiments on the Houston 2013, Indian Pines, and Washington DC datasets. In the dimensionality reduction experiments, the overall accuracy of SSMM in any dimension is higher than that of other algorithms. In the classification experiments, the KAPPA coefficient of SSMM on the three data sets is improved by 1.41%, 0.61%, and 0.27% respectively. The feature extraction experiments show superior clustering performance. These experimental results demonstrate that SSMM not only effectively solves the problem of insufficient label information, but also significantly improves the classification accuracy of hyperspectral images after dimensionality reduction, which is superior to the existing manifold learning methods."

 Atmospheric aerosols are a major component of the earth's climate system and modulate air quality at local and regional scales. One region that has seen little attention is the South Pacific, despite air quality being of increasing concern for human health in Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs). A review of literature on sources of pollution emissions in the Pacific region reveals that while most of the studies have focused on specific emission events, the annual cycle and long-term variability of the different aerosol types is rarely considered. Hence, this study provides a regional overview of aerosols over the Pacific using two global reanalyses (NASA/MERRA-2 and ECMWF/CAMS) and one satellite-based product (VIIRS). The uncertainties of the different data sources are discussed. The spatio-temporal variability of total Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and different aerosol species is shown and discussed in relation to the pollution sources previously investigated. In general, CAMS exhibits a higher total AOD (0.11) compared to MERRA-2 (0.09), both lower than VIIRS (0.12). Both reanalyses show that sea salt is the predominant aerosol source in the region, whereas sulphates and organic matter aerosols are also significant pollution sources, particularly over the islands in Melanesia. Both reanalyses capture the annual variation of AOD similarly, with higher total AOD levels occurring from September to February (SON and DJF), and lower levels from March to May (MAM). Besides capturing the aerosols seasonal variability, both reanalyses also capture extreme aerosol peaks, which evidence the long-range transport of dust from the Australian outback, black carbon and organic matter from major Australian bushfires, and sulphates from volcanic eruptions. This study serves as a baseline for further air quality assessment in the PICTs, considering that the seasonal variation presented here has not been thoroughly analyzed before but can be expected to play an important role in regional atmospheric and ocean biochemistry as well as potential impacts on human health in the Pacific."

Dinoflagellates play pivotal roles in marine ecosystems, particularly as major contributors of harmful algal blooms. Despite vital roles of cysts in blooming cycles and dinoflagellate ecology, the molecular processes controlling cyst dormancy have largely remained unexplored due to technological difficulties. Using DinoSL as a dinoflagellates-specific mRNA “hook” and SMRT sequencing, we analyzed metatranscriptomes of sediment-buried dinoflagellate cyst assemblages. The data show that most major metabolic and regulatory pathways, except photosynthesis, were transcriptionally active. This suggests the crucial importance of broad metabolic pathways in sustaining cyst viability and germination potential. Further expression analyses of 11 genes (relevant to autophagy and phytohormone gibberellin), lysosome/autolysosome staining, and germination experiments revealed vital roles of autophagy in energy generation, nutrient recycling, and of phytohormones abscisic acid/gibberellin in modulating dormancy/germination of resting cysts. Our findings lay a cornerstone for elucidating the molecular machinery regulating dinoflagellate cyst dormancy."
