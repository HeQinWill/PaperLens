We take advantage of long-duration balloon campaigns from 2019 and 2021 to assess errors in winds between 18 and 20 km in a weather forecast model. Large errors persist: one third of the time, the error is larger than 3.5 m per second. This has implications for research studies that calculate air mass trajectories in this transition region between the troposphere and the stratosphere. 
 Winds in the tropical lower stratosphere raise difficulties for numerical weather prediction models: without geostrophy, winds decouple from temperature and direct observations are scarce. The Strateole 2 project explores the tropical lower stratosphere using superpressure balloons that drift for up to three months between 18 and 21 km altitude. Wind is measured on all flights: eight in the first campaign (2019–2020) and seventeen in the second (2021–2022). These measurements are used to assess errors in the winds of the ERA5 reanalysis for latitudes between 18° S and 10° N. Two additional objectives of this study are to assess errors in modelled balloon trajectories, and to document the dispersion of air below the balloons, in order to facilitate the interpretation of observations made below the balloons. The comparison of measured and reanalyzed winds reveal significant errors, with standard deviations of 3.76 m s−1 for zonal and 3.24 m s−1 for meridional wind. Relative to a previous comparison in 2010, only a modest decrease of 20 % and 10 % is found. Trajectory calculations have very variable skill, with median errors after 24 h of 260 km, but a tenth of the errors larger than 600 km. Factors leading to large errors, such as  initial wind error and latitude are identified. Similarly, trajectory dispersion of air below the balloon is very variable, depending on the initial shear. The persistent errors highlight the need for regular obsevations of winds in the tropical lower stratosphere, and emphasize the need for caution when using trajectory calculations for process studies."

Multisatellite observations and reanalysis data are used to quantify land surface temperature responses to variability in aerosols and fire intensity. These responses display strong spatial heterogeneity, highlighting the interplay between fire, aerosol, and meteorological conditions. 
 The biophysical effects of agricultural residue burning, driven by the excessive release of energy and carbonaceous aerosols, remain poorly quantified at the global scale. Residue-based fires have the potential to modify regional climate by altering land surface temperature (LST), highlighting the need for investigation at regional scale. Here, an observation-driven assessment of spatial variations in LST due to concurrent release of energy and aerosols has been made over northwestern India using multiple satellite and reanalysis-based datasets. Year-specific fire pixel density was used to delineate an intensive fire zone characterized by medium-to-large residue-based fire. Geospatial analysis revealed positive association among FRP (fire radiative power), LST and AOD (aerosol optical depth). Over intensive fire zone, a space-for-time approach revealed significant increase in both ΔLST (0.57 °C; 95 % CI: 0.33–0.81 °C) and ΔAOD (0.13; 95 % CI: 0.08–0.17) due to fire. Random Forest non-linear model was employed to regress potential influence of FRP and AOD on LST having several other variables as confounding factors. FRP consistently emerged as the dominant predictor of LST, followed by planetary boundary layer height and aerosols. An increase in relative feature importance of FRP was noted during days having high fire intensity and positive association with LST. Geographically weighted regression further explained spatial heterogeneity in LST modulation by FRP.  Overall, this analysis provides the first empirical evidence that residue-based fire contributes to changes in land surface temperature. It further highlights that the magnitude of this perturbation is governed by interannual variations in fire intensity and influenced strongly by prevailing meteorological conditions."

 Recently introduced Columnar Vertical Profiles (CVPs) arrange polarimetric radar data collected via plan position indicator (PPI) scans in height vs. time format at a single location. A novel method for polarimetric radar data processing and visualization, path-CVP (pCVP), is introduced. It represents radar data in height vs. location format at the time of a completed radar volume scan. pCVP, an offspring of CVP, is a single-radar-volume time snapshot of the polarimetric radar data along an arbitrary or predefined path with high spatial resolution. Multiple examples from S-band WSR-88D radars in the NEXRAD network demonstrate the potential usage and advantages of the technique. Monitoring and quantifying instantaneous weather conditions with polarimetric radar along motorways, mountain overpasses, and aircraft paths during descent and ascent from the runway, as well as tornado location diagnostics, are potential benefits of the novel technique. However, the increasing distance from the radar and the size of the area used for CVP spatial averaging may need to be adjusted based on user needs."

The generated product exhibits good consistency with existing datasets and provides finer spatial detail compared to global SOC products. This SOCD dataset offers valuable insights into the long-term status of soil health in China and enhances our understanding of the response of soil organic carbon to global warming and human activities. 
 Soil organic carbon (SOC) is an important component of the global carbon cycle and a vital indicator of ecosystem health, playing key roles in agricultural productivity and climate change mitigation. To trace the spatiotemporal dynamics of SOC in China, a high-resolution (1 km) Soil Organic Carbon Density (SOCD) dataset for the 0–20 and 0–100 cm depths spanning the period from 1985 to 2020 is produced in this study. By integrating Landsat archives, topographic and meteorological data, and 11 743 soil profile measurements, we produced the SOCD dataset from 1985–2020 in China using the Random Forest ensemble learning approach. Specially, a climate zoning strategy was developed to account for the significant environmental heterogeneity across China. The validation of our SOCD estimated results with 0–20 cm depth with independent testing samples showed strong agreement with R2=0.63 and RMSE=2.03 (kg C m−2) for 0–20 cm SOCD estimation and R2=0.62 and RMSE=6.16 (kg C m−2) for 0–100 cm. Moreover, our SOCD estimated results with 0–20 cm depth are aligned well with independent samples (R2=0.76, RMSE=1.75 kg C m−2) and Xu's dataset (R2=0.68, RMSE=1.70 kg C m−2). Furthermore, the validation of our SOCD estimated results with 0–100 cm depth with independent measurements from Dong et al. (2024a) showed strong agreement (R2=0.50, RMSE=4.93 kg C m−2). Furthermore, our SOCD product exhibits high consistency with existing global datasets (HWSD, SoilGrids250 m, and GSOCmap), showing the best fit with SoilGrids250 m (R2=0.74, RMSE=1.03 kg C m−2). Comparisons of model predictions to independent datasets from the 1980s, 2000s, and 2010s in China reveal substantial connections and demonstrate strong performance over time. The estimated SOCD products, along with the compiled raw soil profile observations for both 0–20 and 0–100 cm depths, are openly available via Figshare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27290310.v2) (Dong et al., 2024b)."

 In April 2020, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center introduced a Level 2 provisional Aquatic Reflectance (AR) product for the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), marking the initial phase in developing a standardized global product for Landsat-derived surface water measurements. The goal of USGS EROS aquatic product research and development is to prepare for an operational processing architecture for Landsat Collection 3 in the late 2020s that will enable use of quality-controlled data for emerging Landsat aquatic science applications. To achieve this, we released a subset of the Landsat 8/9 provisional AR products (Crawford et al., 2025, https://doi.org/10.5066/P14MBBRM) and examined its general performance through the Science Algorithms to Operations (SATO) framework alongside quantitative assessment using community made inland water data records (GLObal Reflectance community dataset for Imaging and optical sensing of Aquatic environments, GLORIA) and radiometric coastal validation platforms (NASA's Ocean Color component of the Aerosol Robotic Network, AERONET-OC). Variability within the validation datasets indicate that the performance of the Landsat 8/9 provisional AR retrieval is highly context-dependent; errors are minimal in optically simple waters (e.g., clear to moderately turbid coastal waters) but increase considerably in optically complex waters where factors such as elevated levels of turbidity, chlorophyll (Chl a) concentrations, or colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) dominate the water column. Additionally, this paper examines key algorithmic considerations for atmospheric correction, highlighting factors that influence accuracy, scalability, and computational efficiency necessary for collection processing in the operational Landsat Product Generation System (LPGS). This paper is intended to communicate with aquatic scientists, satellite oceanographers, and the broader Earth observation community on the origins, requirements, challenges, successes, and future objectives for operationalizing global AR data products for Landsat satellite missions."

The maps were created from a statistical combination of satellite altimetry, satellite gravimetry, and in situ Argo profiles of temperature/salinity to 2000 m depth. Data are mapped at long wavelengths to reduce contamination from mesoscale eddies. The data are intended for the study of sea level budgets and changes in ocean heat uptake. 
 Argo profiles of temperature/salinity (T/S) at specific times and locations from January 2003 through December 2023 are mapped into monthly maps of steric sea level (SSL), thermosteric sea level (TSL), and Ocean Heat Content (OHC) anomalies at long wavelengths (>1500 km) down to depths of 2000 m. The mapping uses a monthly satellite reference computed from the difference between satellite altimetry and gravimetry, so that in periods where there is not sufficient global Argo coverage (generally before 2007), the satellite estimate is used instead of a mean monthly climatology or zero, as other analysis centers use. Longwave mapping is done to reduce large errors introduced by poor sampling of mesoscale eddies by the Argo floats. We demonstrate that on global- and basin-scales, the longwave mapping does not substantially affect calculations of mean SSL, TSL, or OHC changes. Monthly standard error maps from the mapping are also provided. These maps are intended for users interested in understanding global- and basin-scale sea level budgets, as well as combining with deep ocean measurements to study ocean heat uptake.

Carracedo;Marta Álvarez;Herlé Mercier;Pascale Lherminier;Antón Velo,Two decades of pHT measurements along the  GO-SHIP A25 section in the North Atlantic,"Ocean acidification threatens marine ecosystems and the climate and is commonly assessed through ocean pH measurements. This study provides a new twenty-year dataset of pH measurements from the North Atlantic, derived from the correction and reevaluation of both historical and recent pH measurements affected by methodological bias. This revised dataset enables a more accurate reassessment of pH trends and carbon variables under novel and updated methodological standards. 
 The North Atlantic (NA) GO-SHIP (Global Ship-based Hydrographic Investigation Program) A25 OVIDE-BOCATS (Observatoire de la variabilité interannuele à décennale en Atlantique Nord – Biennial Observation of Carbon, Acidification, Transport and Sedimentation in the North Atlantic) section is a long-term repeat hydrographic transect extending from Portugal to Greenland. Since 2002, physical and biogeochemical measurements have been carried out biennially along the OVIDE-BOCATS section, contributing to a better understanding of water mass properties, mixing, circulation, carbon storage, and climate change impacts such as ocean acidification (OA) in the NA. In particular, the high-precision pH measurements on the total hydrogen ion scale (pHT) from the OVIDE-BOCATS program represent a key milestone in monitoring OA in this particularly climate sensitive region. The method used for pHT determination relies on adding meta-cresol purple (mCP) dye to the seawater sample and spectrophotometrically measuring its absorbances at specific wavelengths. The OVIDE-BOCATS program has used unpurified mCP dye, which impurities have been proven to bias pHT values. Here we quantified the bias induced by these impurities in pHT measurements. We found that measurements carried out using the unpurified mCP dye tend to be, on average, 0.011±0.002 pHT units higher than those obtained using the purified mCP dye, with this difference slightly decreasing at higher pHT values. Moreover, we tested independent methods to correct the effect of impurities in both the historical and recent OVIDE-BOCATS pHT data, demonstrating that the correction is consistent across methods. The long-term pHT dataset has been updated to include newly acquired data and absorbance measurements, and to standardize corrections for mCP dye impurities. This effort results in a twenty-year dataset of pHT corrected for mCP dye impurities, that demonstrates the possibility of a global effort to improve the reliability and coherency of spectrophotometric pHT measurements made with unpurified mCP dye. The corrections applied to our pHT dataset have negligible implications for the OA rates previously reported, but they do affect the depth of the aragonite saturation horizon, implying a shoaling of approximately 150 m. The dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17789895 (Pérez et al., 2025)."

This release now applies the latest retrieval algorithm to both data streams, creating a consistent and unified data stream that is further complemented by a new, high-resolution 6.25 km sampling SSM product. The ASCAT SSM datasets are publicly available from https://hsaf.meteoam.it/User/UserSupport. 
 This article presents the next-generation of the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) surface soil moisture (SSM) dataset, bringing the operational near real-time (NRT) product up to date with the historical offline data record. For years, the offline data record has benefited from successive algorithmic improvements while the NRT product has only received minor updates. This release now applies the latest soil moisture retrieval algorithm and consistent fixed-Earth grid to both data streams, creating a unified dataset and representing a major advancement for the ASCAT SSM NRT product. Furthermore, the standard 12.5 km sampling ASCAT SSM dataset is now complemented by a new high-resolution 6.25 km sampling ASCAT SSM product. This is achieved by customising the spatial resampling process of the ASCAT Level 1B full-resolution backscatter data. A new key development in the change detection algorithm for ASCAT SSM concerns the estimation of the dry and wet backscatter references. Specifically, a moving-window approach is now applied instead of the full time series to mitigate artificial trends caused by long-term land cover changes. Additionally, a new monthly subsurface scattering flag has been added to filter out unreliable SSM measurements where backscatter and soil moisture indicate an inverted relationship."

This dataset captures instantaneous mass changes and can reveal short-term dynamics that standard monthly data products do not provide. This enables prompt detection of rapid events such as flash droughts and floods and offers critical information to support improved monitoring of short-term water and mass variations. 
 We present the globally available dataset of Line-of-sight Gravity Differences (LGD) as a new data product to fill the long-standing gap of investigating sub-monthly surface mass change from the satellite gravimetry along-track perspective. The dataset is generated directly from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-on (GRACE-FO) Level-1B intersatellite ranging observations, positioned conceptually between Level-1B measurements and Level-2 monthly gravity field solutions. Provided as along-track time series, LGD delivers instantaneous, in situ gravity change at satellite altitude, thus ensuring the fidelity of measurements by avoiding the complex preprocessing, regularization, and filtering applied to monthly products. The LGD dataset enables monitoring of sub-monthly terrestrial water storage variability and provides accurate information on timing and magnitude of water mass changes. GRACE-FO’s ground track allows LGD retrievals every 5–6 days in most low and mid latitude regions, while the revisit interval becomes shorter toward higher latitudes. Our LGD data products also contain climatology in the form of along-track gravity variations. We demonstrate its potential through case studies, including along-track diagnosis of flash drought evolution in the southeastern United States and the characterization of sub-monthly hydrological extremes in global hotspots. Results show that the LGD dataset resolves the critical timing (onset, peak, and termination) of hydrological extremes, which is unattainable from monthly products. The LGD dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17766177 (Tang et al., 2025), which is expected to pave the way for advances in sub-monthly hydrological monitoring and can serve as a unique constraint for hydrological and geophysical models, opening new opportunities for Earth system sciences."

We introduce a hybrid physics–AI approach that seamlessly integrates neural networks into a distributed hydrological model to refine water flow dynamics within an implicit numerical scheme. The hybrid models demonstrate strong performance and interpretable results, leading to reliable streamflow simulations for flood modeling. 
 Conceptual hydrological models, traditionally relying on simplified representations of physical processes governed by conservation laws remain widely used in operational hydrology due to their explainability and practical applicability. However, these process-based models inherently face structural uncertainties and a lack of scale-relevant theories – challenges that emerging artificial intelligence (AI) techniques may help address. In parallel, high-resolution models are crucial for predicting extreme events characterized by strong variability and short duration, making spatially distributed hybrid modeling critical in the current context. We introduce a hybrid physics–AI framework that embeds neural networks (NNs) seamlessly into a spatialized, regionalizable, and fully differentiable process-based model via universal differential equations (UDEs). The model integrates a state-dependent NN to refine internal water fluxes and an implicit resolution of the UDE system, followed by kinematic wave routing on a flow direction grid. Spatially distributed parameters are inferred through regionalization mappings including convolutional NNs, and adjoint-based gradients enable end-to-end training of the hybrid system. We implement this framework into the latest release of the smash platform, significantly extending its capabilities to comprehensively evaluate hybrid models at kilometric spatial and hourly temporal resolutions. The results show that hybrid approaches demonstrate consistently strong and stable performance in calibration and various validation scenarios. Additionally, the UDE structure exhibits a hybridization effect that modifies state dynamics and runoff flow, achieving more accurate streamflow simulations for flood modeling."

This study evaluated the effectiveness of a Ca-based recovered nutrient product (RNP) from synthetic swine wastewater using an innovative anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) technology. This study aimed to characterize and compare the dissolution, transformations, and potential bioavailability of P in RNP with conventional P fertilizers (monoammonium phosphate; MAP, triple superphosphate; TSP) in selected soils over time by using short-term laboratory incubation studies in Petri dishes. Soil samples sectioned from the point of application were assessed for pH, total P, resin-extractable P, and selected samples by using X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy. The RNP treatment showed that over 90%, 70%, and 80% of added P remained in the center section in calcareous, neutral, and acid soils, respectively, where the potential plant-available P was greater than the control in all soils and similar to the MAP treatment only in acid soil after 5 weeks of incubation. The hydroxyapatite-like species dominated P speciation in both RNP and RNP-added soils, leading to less solubility. These results underscore the potential of Ca-based RNP as a P source for tested soils, and process modifications could yield a series of viable secondary P sources for agriculture."

During respiration, atmospheric aging of nanoparticles occurs first; nonetheless, the hazard of air-aged TMDCs and the effect of postbiotransformation in the microenvironment following inhalation remain unclear. By mimicking atmospheric conditions and respiratory media, we discovered that air-aged molybdenum disulfide (A-MoS2) and tungsten disulfide (A-WS2) underwent biotransformation in artificial nasal fluids and Gamble’s solution, increasing the hydrophobicity and roughness of the nanosheets. The oxidized products (31.7% in A-MoS2 and 44.5% in A-WS2) were partially converted to sulfidation-state species via thiol-mediated reduction. Both biotransformed and air-aged TMDCs were localized to macrophage lysosomes at approximate concentrations, whereas the lysosomal membrane damage and ferrous ion (Fe2+) release were more significant for biotransformed forms. Transcriptome and lipidomics analyses indicated that ferroprotein degradation and ferroportin1 inhibition also facilitated Fe2+ overload, along with glutathione peroxidase 4 inhibition, lipid acylation, and phospholipid biosynthesis activation, worsening lipid peroxidation (154.3–225.6%). Shapley Additive Explanations substantiated the reduction of oxidized species, 1T-phase stabilization, and increased hydrophobicity as major contributors to ferroptosis aggravation of biotransformed TMDCs.

However, the combined effects of NOx (NOx = NO2 + NO) and SO2 on SOA compositions under complex photochemical conditions remain mechanistically unresolved. Here, we investigated the individual roles of NO2/NO and their combined effects with SO2 on β-myrcene photooxidation. Our results showed that NO2 enhanced the SOA yield and the O:C ratio through oxidant amplification, whereas NO suppressed nucleation and oxidation states of products but facilitated particle size growth via organic nitrate partitioning. SO2 exhibited significant synergistic effects with both NO2 and NO, facilitating particle formation and growth processes. The newly built vacuum ultraviolet free electron laser photoionization aerosol mass spectrometer enabled the observation of a series of new compounds (i.e., organic peroxides, organic nitrate, and organosulfates) and identified new mechanisms of SOA formation.

Magnetic particle (MP)-based approaches have the potential for automating enrichment processing and are considered a convenient alternative. However, automated applications for large-volume samples are hindered by the lack of MPs with satisfactory properties. In this study, we presented a novel large-volume viral enrichment system composed of elaborately prepared MPs and an automated platform. Due to the high magnetic responsiveness, excellent dispersibility, and selective absorption performance of MPs, the system enabled the automatic processing of up to 180 mL of large-volume samples without requiring centrifugation or ultrafiltration. A 0.2 copies/mL experimental sensitivity was achieved in spiked samples, which is 25-fold more sensitive than previous automated studies. The practical applicability has been validated through testing real wastewater samples, demonstrating a 4.5-fold detection accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 monitoring compared with the traditional protocol. Overall, the successful explorations on the designs of MPs address the challenges for automatedly enriching large-volume samples and endow the system with simplicity and efficiency, which offer a novel alternative tool for large-scale epidemiological surveillance."

Through integrated anaerobic/aerobic wastewater treatment system experiments combined with physicochemical characterization, metagenomic sequencing, and molecular dynamics simulations (MD), we elucidated MP-ARG interaction mechanisms from the interfacial to the cellular scale. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene (PE), and polypropylene (PP) MPPIs underwent significant aging during 60 days of exposure, resulting in elemental enrichment (C/O/P), the formation of C═C/C–H/C–O/C–OH functional groups, and elevated oxidation. These transformations enhanced extracellular polymeric substance production (184.81 mg/g MLSS) and selectively enriched antibiotic-resistant bacteria, ARGs, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), promoting horizontal gene transfer. XDLVO theory revealed spontaneous microbial adhesion (ΔGadh = −23.63 mJ/m2) driven by Lifshitz-van der Waals (LW) and acid–base interactions. MD demonstrated direct MP penetration into the membrane via dominant LW forces (−1200 kJ/mol) and increased permeability. Concurrently, compared with sewage water (SW), MPPIs induced a 2.06-fold overproduction of reactive oxygen species, which upregulated genes encoding efflux pumps (acrF, 3.2-fold), outer membrane porins (OmpF, 4.1-fold), and conjugative transfer genes (traF, 3.8-fold).

This study characterized chemical, particulate, and microbial emissions from small and big dogs. Big dogs emitted CO2, NH3, fungi, and bacteria at considerably higher rates than small dogs, whereas their emissions of 1–10 μm particles were similar. With ozone present, all dogs contributed to the formation of nanocluster aerosols (1–3 nm) and ozonized volatile organic compound (VOC) products, likely from human skin oil transfer through petting. With ozone present, nanocluster aerosols (1–3 nm) were observed during dog experiments, likely reflecting ozone reactions with human-derived skin lipids transferred onto dog fur. Relative to a seated adult, big dogs emitted less ozonized products, comparable CO2 and NH3, more >5 μm coarse particles (fewer 2–5 μm particles), 2–4× more bacteria and fungi, and showed compound-specific differences in VOCs: while some species exhibited a strongly elevated dog-to-human ratio (with one up to 15×), others were not pronounced when dogs were present.

This study investigated the effects of NH2-MIL-101(Fe) on As(V) bioaccumulation, trophic transfer, biotransformation, and mitochondrial genotoxicity across generations using a Daphnia magna–Danio rerio (zebrafish) food chain exposure model consisting of a 14 day exposure and a 26 day depuration phase. NH2-MIL-101(Fe) increased total arsenic bioaccumulation in D. magna (15.2-fold) and zebrafish tissues (2.0–18.6-fold at day 14 and 2.6–33.8-fold at day 40), while reducing the biomagnification factor from 0.045 to 0.026. It promoted arsenic uptake, likely via oxidative-stress-mediated upregulation of aqp7 and formation of As(V)-MOF complexes, and enhanced As(V) secondary methylation, associated with as3mt upregulation. Co-exposure increased zebrafish mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage through inducing excessive reactive oxygen species and inhibiting antioxidant enzymes, accompanied by adenosine triphosphate depletion and locomotor decline. The mtDNA damage was transmitted to offspring, demonstrating multigenerational mitochondrial toxicity. These findings reveal that NH2-MIL-101(Fe)–As(V) coexposure increased arsenic burden across trophic levels, particularly in lower trophic levels, and amplifies heritable mitochondrial genotoxicity in aquatic food chains."

We tested the hypothesis that the fluorinated polymers contained in top antireflective coatings (TARCs) can be transformed under oxidizing or reducing conditions to form PFASs measured in fab wastewater. Three TARCs were characterized using combustion ion chromatography and 19F and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to quantify total fluorine and characterize structural features of the fluorinated components. Transformation experiments were conducted under oxidizing and reducing conditions, and products were identified by means of 19F NMR, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and ion chromatography. Under oxidizing conditions, fluorinated components transformed to primarily produce perfluoroalkylcarboxylic acids (PFCAs) when the structure contained nonfluorinated carbon atoms. Under reducing conditions, more highly fluorinated polymers exhibited near-complete defluorination, whereas ultrashort side-chain fluorotelomer-based polymers were more resistant to transformation. Fluorine mass balances demonstrated that most fluorine was recovered as discovered transformation products or as unreacted fluorinated polymer under oxidizing and reducing conditions. These findings help explain the presence of PFCAs in fab wastewater and provide insights on structure-transformation relationships."

We analyze  a decade (2013–2023) of wintertime aerosol mass spectrometry data from urban Nanjing, eastern China, using a developed machine learning framework that disentangles anthropogenic emission-driven changes from meteorology-driven changes. The mean organic aerosol concentrations decreased from 24.6 to 16.5 μg m–3 during the period of 2013–2017. After accounting for meteorological influences, emission controls account for ∼94% of the observed decrease. However, the effectiveness of anthropogenic emission controls on the total organic aerosol was weakened by a factor of approximately 2–8 times in the subsequent emission control phases, particularly with more oxidized secondary organic aerosol showing a minimal further decrease. Machine learning-based attribution analysis reveals that reductions in fossil fuel combustion and traffic-related aromatic precursors explain, on average, ∼50–60% of the long-term variability in secondary organic aerosol, while the meteorological influence plays a minor role. These results provide observationally source-resolved evidence that current measures are reaching diminishing returns and that effective future controls must target overlooked precursors and secondary formation pathways."

Particulate (PM2.5 and PM10) concentrations in fan areas around the stadium peaked ahead of the athletics events and opening and closing ceremonies with PM2.5 concentrations up to 10 times higher than at nearby urban background monitoring stations. For a spectator attending a full day of events at Alexander Stadium, this would represent a 125% increase in their exposure to PM2.5 relative to the urban background. Nonrefractory particulate composition in these periods was dominated by organics. Four factors were identified from Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis of particle composition data recorded using a Quadrupole Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (Q-ACSM): two representing cooking aerosol accounting for 71% of the total PM mass during the athletic sessions demonstrating that cooking sources were responsible for the majority of particulate pollution at the venue.

As the contributions of anthropogenic sources decrease and environmental stressors, such as wildfire, increase, forests are becoming increasingly important diffuse sources and sinks of atmospheric compounds. Indeed, forests impact several air quality programs, yet stressors are modifying these forest-compound interactions. To characterize how forests may impact current and future air quality, we reviewed studies on environmental stressors affecting forest interactions with key air pollutants regulated under the CAA. Long-term temperature trends and changes in precipitation, as well as disturbances such as wildfire, pest outbreaks and drought are among the stressors considered. Overall, increasing stressors on forests are generally worsening air quality. Indeed, the increase in wildfire is one of the main contributors to current declines in air quality. Other effects were bidirectional or there were information gaps, especially in predicting multistressor impacts. Forests are fundamental to life and environmental stressors are shifting their impact on air quality. As a result, it is imperative to understand the benefits and disbenefits of forests to better predict and manage future air quality."

A more comprehensive characterization of its chemical composition is needed for its management and health effects research. We improve estimates of total PM2.5 mass concentration and its chemical composition across North America by developing, optimizing, and applying convolutional neural networks (CNN) with information from satellite-, simulation-, and monitor-based sources to estimate the local bias in monthly geophysical a priori PM2.5 and component concentrations over 2000–2023. Significant long-term agreement is found with traditional 10-fold spatial cross-validation for total PM2.5 (R2 = 0.82), sulfate (R2 = 0.98), nitrate (R2 = 0.93), ammonium (R2 = 0.94), organic matter (R2 = 0.83), black carbon (R2 = 0.78), dust (R2 = 0.71), and seasalt (R2 = 0.37). We introduce Buffered Leave Isolated Sites and Clusters Out (BLISCO) spatial cross-validation to evaluate the model extrapolation ability over remote regions, and find that traditional spatial cross-validation may overestimate performance and underrepresent uncertainty due to the spatial autocorrelation of ground monitors. The use of geophysical information from a chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) significantly increases CNN performance in BLISCO cross-validation, for example, increasing R2 for NO3– (0.51 to 0.81) and NH4+ (0.27 to 0.67). We represent spatial uncertainty for PM2.5 and its components based on the statistical results of BLISCO cross-validation by integrating information from both the spatial distribution of ground observations and the variability in predictors space representation, and find that distance from monitor is a key predictor of uncertainty."

While the acute developmental effects of such DBPs are increasingly documented, their long-term impacts remain understudied. In this study, we investigated the developmental effects of saline primary sewage effluent on the marine polychaete Platynereis dumerilii (located at the bottom of the marine food chain) during a 25-day sub-chronic exposure. Although both non-chlorinated and chlorinated saline sewage effluents exhibited dose-dependent embryotoxic and teratogenic effects across effluent percentages (0%–33%), the chlorinated effluent induced such malformation effects at lower concentrations (1.3%–3.7%) than the non-chlorinated counterparts (4.8%–9.9%), which could be attributed to the presence of halogenated DBPs in the chlorinated sewage effluent. We then focused on 2,6-dihalo-4-nitrophenols, a group of aromatic DBPs that have been reported to exhibit acute developmental toxicity and persist in receiving seawater. Significant reductions in survival (p < 0.10) were observed for the sub-chronic and chronic exposure at environmentally relevant concentrations (3.4–340 nmol/L; equivalent to 1–100 μg/L as 2,6-dibromo-4-nitrophenol (DBNP)). Especially, the one-year chronic exposure to DBNP revealed significant concentration-dependent responses. Both survival rate and average body length of the polychaete were significantly decreased, and the overall maturation was delayed. Compared to seawater control with a natural balance gender, female-biased sex ratios (1.4–2.2) were observed in the worms exposed to 3.4–340 nmol/L of DBNP. This bias might result from the higher surface-area-to-volume ratio of male polychaete and the stronger binding affinity of DBNP toward the androgen receptor. This study is the first of its type that systematically recorded the long-term adverse effects of chlorinated saline sewage effluents and halogenated aromatic DBPs─at environmentally relevant concentrations─on the marine polychaete."

Prediction accuracy is high with an average root mean squared error (RMSE) of 8 m/s. We find that some poorly predicted profiles nonetheless reproduce the original waveforms with high accuracy, indicating a nonuniqueness between atmospheric conditions and recorded waveforms. Unlike traditional physics‐based inversions that rely on array deployments, our ML model can analyze single‐channel data and, once trained, makes predictions within milliseconds. Given the performance on synthetic data, future tests should include real‐world data to further assess the benefits of ML‐based frameworks for infrasound analysis."

Based on reanalysis data and numerical experiments, this study investigates the potential influence of the summer northeastern Arctic Sea ice concentration (NEASIC) on the interannual variation of September CHDEs in the SC. Results demonstrate that positive NEASIC anomalies during summer trigger a quasi‐barotropic Rossby wave train, originating over the Greenland Sea, arching across the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean–Caspian region, and extending into East Asia. This wave dynamically drives a northward‐shifted and intensified East Asian subtropical jet and anomalous anticyclonic circulation over SC. The resulting subsidence induces moisture flux divergence, suppresses cloud cover, and enhances surface radiative forcing, explaining about 28.4% of the CHDEs variability per interquartile NEASIC increase. This mechanism enhances predictive frameworks for subtropical compound extremes, emphasizing the role of NEASIC in regional climate resilience strategies."

We found that there was both spatial and temporal heterogeneity in surface sediment cover across Lake Fryxell, Lake Hoare, and Lake Bonney, with each lake showing consistent “hot spots” of sediment through time. Results show that higher surface sediment abundance was correlated with thinner lake ice across the study lakes. These findings show that small changes in ice surface reflectance exert a strong control on thickness independent of broader climatic conditions."

Here, we evaluate two such models—the hybrid Neural General Circulation Model (NGCM) and purely data‐driven Deep Learning Earth System Model (DLESyM)—against a conventional high‐resolution land–atmosphere model (HiRAM) in simulating land heatwaves and coldwaves. All models are forced with observed sea surface temperatures and sea ice over 1900–2020, focusing on the out‐of‐sample period (1900–1960). Both DL models generalize successfully to unseen climate conditions, broadly reproducing the frequency and spatial patterns of heatwave and coldwave events during 1900–1960 with skill comparable to HiRAM.

Previous work estimated its surface age to be between 200 and 1000 Myr. This estimate, however, is based on crater scaling laws for water and sand, which are not representative of the composition of Titan's icy surface. Titan's surface is likely composed of water ice, methane clathrates, or a combination of both. Here, we perform impact simulations for impactors of various sizes that strike an icy target with a 0–15 km thick methane clathrate cap layer. We derive new crater scaling laws based on our numerical results, and find that Titan's surface age is 300–340 Myr, assuming heliocentric impactors and surface clathrates. This age, which represents the crater retention age, indicates a relatively youthful surface, suggesting that active endogenic and/or exogenic processes have recently reshaped Titan's surface."

However, its direct and quantitative impact on controlling outer belt electron lifetimes has never been directly assessed. Using simultaneous observations of IBs from low‐altitude satellites and in situ electron fluxes from equatorial satellites, we report IBs intruding into the outer belt (reaching L ∼ 4.5), closely synchronized with sharp flux radial gradients near IBs, caused by significant electron loss outside IBs during a 4‐day storm recovery period. By combining observations with simulations, we provide the first direct and quantitative evidence that FLCS‐induced electron loss outside the IB dominantly controls the outer belt electron lifetimes. Our findings reveal that this simple yet fundamental physical process, which has been historically neglected in global radiation belt models, can explain the outer electron belt configuration."

Linking sediment dynamics and river lateral mobility requires monitoring sustained changes in both water and sediment—the active channel (AC)—to avoid stage‐dependent noise. Yet, such monitoring remains rare. We introduce an automated, globally applicable approach that detects and quantifies activation (erosion) and deactivation (vegetation colonization) by tracking multi‐year sustained AC directional shifts from Sentinel‐2 imagery. Applied to the Po River (Italy), this approach captures trajectories across different morphologies, distinguishing lateral mobility, widening, and narrowing from changes caused by stage‐dependent hydrological forcing. Results identify the exposed sediment‐to‐water ratio as a strong predictor of AC dynamicity, with sediment‐rich reaches showing greater instability and responsiveness to hydrological variations. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating sediment areas alongside the water channel improves understanding of river dynamics, with implications for river restoration and risk mitigation."

The extreme flooding in Western North Carolina caused by Tropical Storm Helene in September of 2024 is a recent and devastating example of this trend. Communities of color and low‐income populations are more likely to reside in flood‐prone areas due to structural factors, including residential racial segregation and economic inequality. As such, the adverse health and financial consequences of flood exposure overburden historically marginalized communities, which may have a more limited adaptive capacity to anticipate, respond to, and recover from flood events. Exposure to severe flooding further exacerbates chronic health conditions by impeding access to vital healthcare infrastructure and services. This study examines the spatial patterning of coastal and inland flood risk, neighborhood‐level structural determinants (i.e., racial and economic inequality), and flood‐sensitive health conditions in North Carolina using bivariate local indicators of spatial autocorrelation (LISA) statistics. High‐high clusters capture areas where neighborhoods with high racial or economic inequality surround elevated flood risks. These clusters are distinguished by select sociodemographic characteristics and concentrated in the eastern coastal and western mountainous regions of North Carolina. Cluster locations are priority areas for targeted resource allocation and interventions that strengthen the adaptive capacity of these communities in the context of climate change."

 Gammaherpesvirus is a subfamily of herpesvirus, distinct phylogenetically from alpha- and betaherpesvirus and featured by its oncogenic subtypes, including Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus1. It broadly infects humans and other vertebrate animals and causes various diseases and malignancies2,3. However, no specific antiviral agents are available for each type or the whole family. gB is the common fusion protein vital for herpesvirus infection and an ideal target for broad vaccine development, while the lack of basis for gB as a universal antigen hinders such effort4. Here, we report the molecular basis for broad gB binding and cross-genus virus neutralization by an antibody Fab5 for the first time. This antibody confers effective protection against authentic virus challenges in immune-competent mice, non-human primates, and humanized mice with murine, rhesus, and human gammaherpesvirus. Cryo-EM structures revealed that Fab5 targeted a conservative and vulnerable epitope of gammaherpesvirus gB and antigenically exposed across pre- or post-fusion status. This finding not only demonstrates Fab5 as cross-genus antibody broadly reactive against gammaherpesvirus infection and pathogenesis progression, but offers insights into potential common mechanisms for herpesvirus infection and facilitates the development of broad-spectrum vaccines against the gammaherpesvirus."

 Quantum networks, integrating quantum communication, quantum metrology, and distributed quantum computing, could provide secure and efficient information transfer, high-resolution sensing, and an exponential speed-up in information processing1. Deterministic entanglement distribution over long distances is a prerequisite for scalable quantum networks2–5. However, the exponential photon loss in optical fibres prohibits efficient and deterministic entanglement distribution. Quantum repeaters6, incorporating entanglement swapping4,7,8 and entanglement purification9–11 with quantum memories, offer the most promising means to overcome this limitation in fibre-based quantum networks. Despite numerous pioneering efforts12–25, a critical bottleneck remains, as remote memory-memory entanglement suffers from decoherence more rapidly than it can be established and purified over long distances. Here, we demonstrate memory-memory entanglement between two nodes connected by 10 km of spooled fibre surviving beyond the average entanglement establishment time. This is enabled by the development of long-lived trapped-ion memories, an efficient telecom interface, and a high-visibility single-photon entanglement protocol26,27. As an application, we report a proof-of-principle device-independent quantum key distributio (DI-QKD) demonstration with finite-size analysis over 10 km and a positive key rate over 101 km in the asymptotic limit, with both distances exceeding previous work by more than two orders of magnitude28–30. Our work provides a critical building block for quantum repeaters and marks an important step toward scalable quantum networks."

 Increased supply of the micronutrient iron promotes export production in the iron-limited Southern Ocean, thus acting as a dynamic sink of atmospheric CO2 that has amplified past climate variations. This mechanism is typically considered to be regulated by the amount and solubility of iron delivered by aeolian transport. Here we use sedimentological and geochemical tracers to investigate iron input and carbon uptake in the largest sector of the Southern Ocean Antarctic Zone. Our data show that millennial-scale variations in West Antarctic Ice Sheet dynamics controlled both the supply of particulate iron and lithogenic particle composition (affecting particle solubility) in the Pacific Antarctic Zone over the last 500,000 years. Rather than the total iron input, a higher abundance of chemically more pristine glaciomarine particles (high particle solubility) was critical for providing bioavailable iron, which enhanced export production. High lithogenic iron fluxes are characterized by chemically mature particles (low particle solubility), in particular during phases of pronounced ice loss in West Antarctica. The corresponding export production was low, indicating that this ‘ice-sheet–iron feedback’ is positive during these retreat phases. Accordingly, future West Antarctic Ice Sheet retreat is likely to decrease carbon uptake in the large Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean.

 Earth system feedbacks can amplify greenhouse gas forcing but are difficult to quantify, particularly on land where long palaeoclimate records are scarce. Here we reconstructed warm-season temperatures and vegetation at Lake Baikal, Russia, over the past 8.6 million years. We document gradual late Neogene cooling that was punctuated by an abrupt transition approximately 2.7 million years ago to severe cold temperatures during glacial periods. Forests were replaced by open steppe–tundra ecosystems and permafrost probably extended into South Siberia during these Early Pleistocene cold intervals. Compiled palaeobotanical data suggest this ecosystem turnover occurred throughout the Arctic and subarctic, although the timescale of these changes is less understood. Reconstructed Early Pleistocene glacial temperatures and vegetation resemble Late Pleistocene glacial periods at Lake Baikal, despite much warmer mean global temperatures in the Early Pleistocene. These geologic observations support the view that regional climate can respond nonlinearly to global forcing. We hypothesize that both vegetation albedo and permafrost carbon storage may have played a key role in amplifying glacial–interglacial climate cycles through the last 2.7 million years alongside ocean and ice sheet feedbacks. Proxy records from Lake Baikal show that rapid cooling coincided with Northern Hemisphere ice sheet expansion 2.7 million years ago, a change accompanied by a transition to open steppe ecosystems."

 Paclitaxel and nab-paclitaxel differ in therapeutic efficacy and modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment, yet the molecular basis remains poorly defined. Here, based on a meta-analysis, we first show that treatment with nab-paclitaxel results in a higher overall response rate and pathological complete response compared to paclitaxel in female patients with breast cancer. Notably, TREM2 expression in macrophages is elevated in primary tumors of paclitaxel- but not nab-paclitaxel-treated female patients. In metastatic breast cancer, TREM2+ macrophage infiltration is increased in primary tumors. In breast cancer models in female mice, paclitaxel, but not nab-paclitaxel, promotes lung metastasis by recruiting TREM2+ macrophages to primary tumors. Mechanistically, paclitaxel enhances the ATF3-FGF2 axis in breast cancer cells; secreted FGF2 activates the EGR1-TREM2-EMT cytokine axis in macrophages. Genetic ablation of Trem2 or pharmacologic targeting with antisense oligonucleotides suppress paclitaxel-induced breast cancer lung metastasis in vivo. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that paclitaxel, but not nab-paclitaxel, stimulates TREM2 expression and expands TREM2+ macrophages, suggesting that TREM2 targeting could enhance paclitaxel efficacy while limiting metastasis.

 Antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) play a central role in the pathophysiology of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This single-arm, open-label, phase 2 clinical trial aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the ASC-depleting anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody daratumumab in patients with SLE (NCT04810754). The primary endpoint is the reduction in serum anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody levels at week 12. Key secondary end points include safety, clinical efficacy, and immunologic changes. Ten female patients with active disease and inadequate responses to at least two immunosuppressive drugs have received eight subcutaneous injections of 1800 mg daratumumab weekly, with dexamethasone as premedication (20 mg for first two injections, then 10 mg). By week 12, anti-dsDNA antibody levels have been reduced by a median of 109.6 IU/ml (95% CI 38.1 – 274.5). The treatment resulted in rapid and sustained clinical improvements across all patients and organ domains, reflected by a 100% SRI-4 (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Responder Index-4) response rate at week 12. Hypogammaglobulinemia occurred in 5/10 patients, requiring immunoglobulin substitution. Daratumumab treatment has depleted circulating ASCs, reduced type I interferon activity, and profoundly modulated the T-cell responses.

Here, the authors develop CardiOmicScore to integrate genomics, proteomics and metabolomics and predict six cardiovascular diseases up to 15 years prior to disease onset. 
 Genomics, metabolomics, and proteomics offer complementary insights into cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Leveraging UK Biobank data, we introduce the CardiOmicScore, a multitask deep learning framework, to learn disease-specific proteomic (ProScore) and metabolomic (MetScore) risk scores for the six most common CVDs by profiling 2920 proteins and 168 metabolites. Experiments demonstrate that ProScore and MetScore are strong sole CVD risk predictors (C-index range: 0.69–0.82 for ProScore and 0.64–0.74 for MetScore), and can significantly enhance risk prediction across CVDs up to 15 years prior to disease onset when combined with clinical data, increasing the C-index by 0.005–0.102. These findings suggest that incorporating multiomics profiling into clinical practice can improve personalized risk assessments at early stages. CardiOmicScore also identifies important CVD-related proteins and metabolites, which represent promising data-driven pathways, calling for further external validation, to develop novel biomarkers and targeted therapies, facilitating precision medicine for primary prevention of CVDs. Cardiovascular risk is driven by genes, proteins, and metabolites, yet their combined predictive value is unclear.

ST increased between 1982–1996 and 1998–2012—potentially linked to enhanced chilling accumulation—but this increase is underestimated in phenology models. 
 The leaf-onset date is sensitive to climate warming. It is widely reported that the temperature sensitivity of the leaf-onset date (ST) of deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF) may decrease under dormancy-period warming. However, evidence of how boreal-DBF ST may generally change under dormancy-period warming is still lacking. Here, by analysing climate and satellite data, we find that, between 1982–1996 and 1998–2012, 74% of all 0.5° × 0.5° boreal-DBF-containing grid cells with a rise in boreal-DBF dormancy-period temperature exhibited an increase in boreal-DBF ST. We demonstrate that the observed general increase in boreal-DBF ST is largely attributable to a warming-related enhancement in dormancy-period chilling accumulation. Furthermore, we show that phenology models systematically underestimated the magnitude of the observed change in the mean boreal-DBF ST across all boreal-DBF-containing grid cells by a mean of 85%. This study has implications for improving phenology models and understanding the carbon cycle in boreal regions.

 Extreme heatwaves are intensifying under climate change, yet their prediction remains limited by inadequate representation of land–atmosphere (L–A) interactions. Most deep learning–based weather models rely solely on atmospheric variables, overlooking the influence of land surface conditions on heat extremes. Here, we present an L–A coupled prediction framework for Northern Hemisphere summer that incorporates multi-layer soil moisture (SM) and temperature into atmospheric forecasting. To better capture delayed land surface feedbacks, the model is trained with a multi-step loss. This approach improved the representation of L–A interactions across 1–7 day lead times. Using multi-step loss, the L–A coupled model achieved a 5.9–11.2% improvement in heatwave forecast accuracy relative to the atmosphere-only model, as measured by root mean squared error, whereas single-step loss achieved only 0.4–2.4% improvement. Skill gain was strongest at short leads (~ 3 day) when both SM and circulation predictability were high, and sustained through 7 days by L–A coupling driven by SM predictability. Case studies of recent heatwaves further demonstrated its ability to capture land surface drying and associated temperature extremes. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating L–A coupling with multi-step optimization for advancing data-driven heatwave prediction."

 Clouds significantly influence Earth’s radiative balance with complex changes in response to surface warming. The key drivers of the changes are the sea surface temperature (SST) pattern effect that reshapes cloud distributions, and the beta feedback that scales low-level fraction change to climatological amounts. Cloud radiative feedback remains the largest source of uncertainty in future climate projections, but current constraints are insufficient. Here, we demonstrate that the percentage change in tropical cloud fraction, driven by spatial patterns in SST increase, is linked to cloud height variations. We introduce a proportional warmer-get-higher paradigm and develop a pattern-based analytical framework, identifying three key factors governing cloud feedback: percentage cloud sensitivity to SST, climatological cloud cover, and SST warming patterns relative to the tropical mean. By leveraging recent observations to constrain these factors in two stages, we establish a process-oriented emergent constraint on projected cloud feedback in the 21st century. The first stage substitutes simulated cloud sensitivity and mean cloud cover to correct biases and reduce the spread by half. Then, the second stage attempts to further constrain the SST pattern effect, which explains 79% of the remaining spread in an attribution procedure. This percentage framework yields total, low, middle, and high cloud feedback of 0.49 ± 0.27, 0.33 ± 0.21, 0.09 ± 0.09, and 0.07 ± 0.06 W m-2 K-1 (90% confidence), respectively. It reduces intermodel uncertainty by 59% for cloud feedback and 33% for surface warming, resulting in a climate sensitivity of 4.08 ± 0.97 K."

 Hydrothermal vents release substantial amounts of ancient carbon into the ocean, primarily as carbon dioxide, yet the extent to which this carbon is integrated into marine food webs remains poorly constrained. Here, we present a combination of bulk radiocarbon and stable carbon isotope measurements of particulate organic carbon from water column filters with compound-specific hydrogen and radiocarbon isotope analyses of fatty acids from surface sediments to trace carbon assimilation across benthic and pelagic realms in a low pH, shallow-water hydrothermal system off Taiwan. Isotope correlations indicate that vent-derived carbon dioxide constitutes a substantial fraction of the local microbial and faunal biomass through chemoautotrophic pathways (up to ~30%). Farther from the vents, hydrothermal carbon remains detectable and is incorporated into photoautotrophic biomass in the overlying water column. Notably, ancient carbon content in the standing stock of particulate organic carbon was higher at the lower temperature (“White”) vent, even though fluid and sulfide emissions – and thus potential energy availability – were substantially greater at the higher temperature (“Yellow”) vent. These findings show that physicochemical conditions, including pH and temperature, rather than fluid chemistry alone, control carbon assimilation patterns and ultimately limit the retention of vent-derived carbon in this shallow-water system.

Advanced geochemical and imaging techniques decoded these microbial “time capsules” at unprecedented resolution. 
 Microbialites preserve crucial records of early life and geobiological processes, yet interpreting their formation mechanisms remains challenging. Here we analyze Oligocene oncolites from the Junggar Basin that retain exceptional lipid biomarkers due to limited diagenetic alteration. These spheroidal structures exhibit alternating calcite-rich laminae with Fe-Mn coatings, revealed through petrographic and elemental mapping. Lipid analysis identifies prokaryote-dominated communities, particularly phototrophs and heterotrophs, with carbonate-associated biomarkers indicating continuous microbial activity during growth. The release of saturated fatty acid derivatives through acid treatment further confirms exceptional organic preservation. We demonstrate that oncoid formation involved complex microbial consortia mediating calcification. These deposits correlate with accelerated Tianshan Mountain uplift, which triggered lake shallowing and turbulent conditions that enhanced benthic microbial productivity prior to Central Asian aridification. Our findings establish microbialites as sensitive indicators of coupled tectonic and environmental changes during the Oligocene-Miocene transition.

 Fertilizer application has been recognized as the major driver of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in rivers. However, the intrinsic risk of N2O emissions in responding to nitrogen discharge (i.e., ratios between N2O emissions and dissolved inorganic nitrogen or fertilizer) may vary across rivers but remains unclear. Here we uncover the hidden yet substantial control of riverine N2O emissions by bedrock geology through field observations and global data analyses. We discover lower denitrification but higher N2O production rates in rivers with silicate-dominated bedrocks compared to those with carbonate-dominated bedrocks. On one hand, the larger sediment grain size found in the silicate-dominated rivers shortens porewater residence time for reaction, which diminishes the likelihood of complete denitrification (NO3−$$\to$$N2) but simultaneously increases the potential for N2O production through incomplete denitrification (NO3−$$\to$$N2O). Concurrently, lower sediment total organic carbon and water pH abate N2O reductase and enhance N2O production in silicate-dominated rivers. More importantly, the dissimilarities in N2O production due to bedrock geology are reflected in N₂O emissions risks. By developing a geological factor, we interpret the heterogeneous N2O emission risks in rivers globally. Hence, we highlight the geologically uneven urgency of improving fertilizer management to mitigate N2O emissions. Silicate-dominated rivers exhibit lower denitrification but higher N2O production than carbonate-dominated rivers due to coarser sediments, lower organic carbon, and reduced pH, according to global statistical analyses and field sampling in the Pearl River Basin."

 Mars almost certainly had a considerable amount of water in its past. Recent observations reveal that during southern summer, when the atmosphere is warmer and dustier, water vapor can reach high altitudes without condensing, leading to water loss to space. Here, by combining infrared, visible, and ultraviolet data from multiple Mars orbiters, we identify a new pathway for water loss, observed for the first time to our knowledge during the opposite season. Our findings show that a strong, localized, and short-lived dust storm in Martian Year 37 (August 2023) drove considerable vertical transport of water vapor in the northern summer season. Just days after the storm, enhanced water vapor concentrations were observed at altitudes over 40 km across northern high latitudes, followed by an increase in escaping hydrogen detected at the exobase. These results suggest that water loss on Mars can be triggered by strong local dust storms at any time of year. Observations compiled from several Mars observation missions suggest a significant but short-lived dust storm during the Northern hemisphere summer of Mars Year 37 drove substantial vertical transport of water vapor into the upper atmosphere."

 Chromium (Cr) and its isotopic composition (δ53Cr) are emerging as valuable proxies in both environmental and paleoenvironmental studies, yet their redox behaviour is complicated by the presence of organic ligands. This study performed laboratory-controlled batch dissolution and flow-through column experiments on soils/sediments to examine the effects of low-molecular-weight organic acids on Cr mobility and isotopic fractionation. Our results reveal that citric and oxalic acids can enhance the dissolution of Cr(III) under strongly reducing conditions where relatively high levels of ferrous iron are present, highlighting an overlooked pathway of Cr mobilisation. The Cr isotope variability (δ53Cr = −1.39‰ to +0.11‰) in batch leachates and column effluents is not directly driven by redox changes; the very light δ53Cr signatures likely reflect effects of incongruent dissolution and kinetic isotope fractionation. Ligand-bound Cr(III) can potentially be transported across environmental interfaces with distinct isotopic signature, complementing conventional views of Cr and Cr isotope biogeochemical cycling.

 Atmospheric components are critical for maintaining the radiative balance of the Earth–atmosphere system. Based on long-term observations from the Multi-Filter Rotating Shadowband Radiometer (MFRSR), this study classified clear-sky, thin cloud, and thick cloud conditions and analyzed the effects of aerosols and clouds on diffuse radiation (DR) at the Southern Great Plains (SGP) site under these different sky conditions. The results show that under clear skies, the interannual variability of DR is highly consistent with that of aerosol optical depth (AOD) (r = 0.88), while under cloudy conditions DR is more closely associated with cloud properties such as cloud optical depth (COD) and cloud fraction (CF). Specifically, COD exhibits a positive correlation with DR under thin clouds but a negative correlation under thick clouds. Radiative effect analysis indicates that the aerosol diffuse radiative effect (ADRE) reaches 53 W m−2 under clear skies, decreases to 34 W m−2 under thin clouds, and further shifts to −7 W m−2 under thick clouds, reflecting the nonlinear response of aerosol forcing to different cloud backgrounds. With increasing COD, DR increases initially, then decreases, and eventually stabilizes. The cloud diffuse radiative effect (CDRE) decreases from 113 W m−2 under thin clouds to 82 W m−2 under thick clouds, revealing the shielding effect of cloud thickening on shortwave diffuse radiation. The diffuse radiative effect of water vapor (WVDRE) increases with cloud thickness, whereas that of the ozone diffuse radiative effect (ODRE) remains relatively small and stable. Feature importance analysis further shows that under clear skies, AOD accounts for the largest contribution (64%) to DR variability, with DR gradually increasing as AOD increases, followed by single scattering albedo (SSA) and the Ångström exponent (AE), while under cloudy conditions COD and CF dominate. This study highlights the regulatory role of atmospheric components in DR and provides valuable physical references for improving radiation parameterization and accurately assessing surface diffuse radiation under varying sky conditions."
