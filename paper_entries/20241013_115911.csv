10.5194/gmd-2024-153,False,Geoscientific Model Development Discussions,这篇论文介绍了一种新的计算流体动力学代码，用于模拟大气边界层和对流。该代码使用热力学势来描述湿热力学，并采用半隐式半拉格朗日数值方法。该代码没有使用显式的亚网格方案来表示亚网格尺度的通量，而是依赖于数值方法产生的混合和耗散，即隐式LES。论文重点介绍了该方法的优势和局限性，并展示了其在模拟标准LES测试用例中的性能。该研究主要关注大气边界层和对流的模拟，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。,"['atmospheric boundary layer', 'convection', 'Large-Eddy Simulation (LES)', 'thermodynamics', 'numerical methods', 'implicit LES (ILES)']",John Thuburn,Potential based Thermodynamics with Consistent Conservative Cascade Transport for Implicit Large Eddy Simulation: PTerodaC3TILES version 1.0,"A new computational fluid dynamics code for simulating the atmospheric boundary layer and convection is presented. Moist thermodynamics is formulated via thermodynamic potentials, avoiding inconsistencies that can be introduced with conventional approaches. Numerical methods typical of weather and climate models are used, with no explicit subgrid scheme. Results highlight some advantages (e.g., large time steps) and disadvantages (e.g., weak vertical fluxes near the surface) of this approach. 
 A new computational fluid dynamics code for Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) of the atmospheric boundary layer and convection is presented and made available. A key novelty is that moist thermodynamics is formulated in terms of thermodynamic potentials, ensuring thermodynamic consistency. Despite the apparent complexity of the thermodynamic potential approach, the model's performance demonstrates that it is feasible and effective at reasonable computational cost for three-dimensional simulations. Semi-implicit semi-Lagrangian numerical methods are used; such methods are unusual for simulating boundary layer and convective flows and are more typical of global atmospheric models. Moreover, the model includes no explicit scheme to represent subgrid-scale fluxes of scalars and momentum but relies instead on the mixing and dissipation resulting from the numerical methods used; in other words, it employs Implicit LES (ILES). Sample results from several standard LES test cases show that the model's ability to capture the main aspects of the flows is comparable to other LES models. At the same time, the results highlight limitations of the ILES approach near the bottom boundary and suggest that ILES might need to be augmented in some way, for example, by distributing the convergence of surface fluxes over several model layers. Also, results for a marine stratocumulus case show a significant sensitivity to different options for the numerical methods and parameters used. Further development and application of the code would benefit from a deeper understanding of both the bottom boundary behaviour and the sensitivities to numerics."

The aim of our study was to explore the alterations in the placental transcriptome associated with prenatal phthalate exposure and to further analyze whether the placental–brain axis (PBA) genes play a mediating role in the association between prenatal phthalate exposure and children’s neurodevelopment. We included 172 participants from the Ma’anshan Birth Cohort and collected data on seven phthalate metabolites in urine during pregnancy, placental tissue RNA-seq, and neurodevelopment of offspring. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that aberrant regulation of the placental transcriptome was associated with prenatal phthalate exposure. Exposure to phthalates during pregnancy was found to be associated with neurodevelopmental delay in children aged 6, 18, and 48 months using the multiple linear regression model. Meanwhile, employing mediation analysis, nine PBA genes were identified that mediate the association between exposure to phthalates during pregnancy and the neurodevelopment of children. Our study will provide a basis for potential mechanisms by which prenatal exposure to phthalates affects placental function and children’s neurodevelopment."

Consequently, alternative “replacement” PFASs have been introduced and are prevalent in environmental matrices. Few studies have investigated the molecular effects of both legacy and replacement PFASs under short-term exposures. This study aimed to address this by utilizing transcriptomic sequencing to compare the molecular impacts of exposure to concentrations 0.001–5 mg/L of the legacy PFOS and two of its replacements, PFECHS and FBSA. Using zebrafish embryos, the research assessed apical effects (mortality, morphology, and growth), identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enriched pathways, and determined transcriptomic points of departure (tPoDs) for each compound. Results indicated that PFOS exhibited the highest relative potency, followed by PFECHS and then FBSA. While similarities were observed among the ranked DEGs across all compounds, over-representation analysis revealed slight differences. Notably, PFOS demonstrated the lowest tPoD identified to date. These findings raise concerns regarding the safety of emerging replacement PFASs and challenge assumptions about PFAS toxicity solely resulting from their accumulative potential. As replacement PFASs proliferate in the environment, this study underscores the need for heightened scrutiny of their effects and questions current regulatory thresholds."

Machine learning approaches are presented that use spatially limited high-frequency monitoring and spatially distributed discrete samples to estimate the daily stream-specific conductance across a watershed. We compare the predictive performance of space- and time-unaware Random Forest models and space- and time-aware Recurrent Graph Convolution Neural Network models (KGE: 0.67 and 0.64, respectively) and use explainable artificial intelligence methods to interpret model predictions and understand salinization drivers. These models are applied to the Delaware River Basin, a developed watershed with diverse land uses that experiences anthropogenic salinization from winter deicer applications. These models capture seasonality for the winter first flush of deicers, and the streams with elevated predictions correspond well with indicators of deicer application. This result suggests that these models can be used to identify potential salinity-impaired streams for winter best management practices. Daily salinity predictions are driven primarily by land cover (urbanization) trends that may represent anthropogenic salinization processes and weather at time scales up to three months. Such modeling approaches are likely transferable to other watersheds and can be applied to further understand salinization risks and drivers."

To date, our understanding of these communities remains limited mainly due to the difficulty of observations, calling for complementary innovative tools to better characterize their ecology. We used mercury (Δ199Hg, δ202Hg, Δ201Hg, and Δ200Hg), carbon (δ13C), and nitrogen (δ15N) stable isotope compositions to segregate deep-pelagic species caught on the continental slope of the Bay of Biscay (NE Atlantic) according to their foraging depth and trophic ecology. Decreasing fish Δ199Hg values with corresponding depth estimates from the surface to down to 1,800 m confirmed that mercury isotopes are able to segregate deep species over a large vertical gradient according to their foraging depth. Results from isotopic compositions also identified different mercury sources, likely reflecting different trophic assemblages over the continental slope, in particular, the demersal influence for some species, compared to purely oceanic species. Overall, our results demonstrate how mercury stable isotopes can inform the vertical foraging habitat of little-known species and communities feeding in the deep."

Eagles-Smith,A Meta-Analysis of Mercury Biomagnification in Freshwater Predatory Invertebrates: Community Diversity and Dietary Exposure Drive Variability,"Accurate estimates of methylmercury (MeHg) exposure are valuable to actionably assess risk and protect wildlife and human health. MeHg trophic transfer is a critical driver of risk: MeHg is generally biomagnified by a factor of 8.3 ± 7.5 from one trophic level to the next, averaged across freshwater communities (mean ± standard deviation). This variability can produce disparate risks even where basal MeHg concentrations are similar. Taxonomy may be one driver of this variability: physiologically diverse groups, like vertebrates and invertebrates, may assimilate MeHg differently. To determine whether taxonomy affects trophic transfer efficiency, we conducted a meta-analysis characterizing predatory invertebrate MeHg biomagnification. Our analyses estimated that freshwater predatory invertebrates biomagnify MeHg by factors of 2.1 ± 0.2 to 4.3 ± 0.3, with a 98.9 ± 0.4% posterior probability that factors are below 5 (mean ± standard error). When vertebrates or primary producers were included, a site’s trophic magnification factor was 18.6 ± 6.2 to 54.1 ± 7.7% higher than estimates for invertebrates alone. Biomagnification was inversely correlated to prey MeHg concentration and varied among systematic and functional groups. These data suggest that predatory invertebrates biomagnify MeHg less efficiently than vertebrates and that a community’s diversity and structure determine its biomagnification efficiency. Incorporating organismal variation in trophic transfer estimates may improve the assessment, communication, and management of MeHg risk."

In this study, pathways were used to link effects and toxicants. By pathways evaluated by the concentration-dependent transcriptome, individual effects were extended to molecular mechanisms encompassing 135 pathways corresponding to 6 biological processes. Accordingly, mechanism-based identification of toxicants was achieved by constructing a pathway toxicant database containing 2413 chemical–pathway interactions and identifying pathway active fragments of 72 pathways. The developed method was applied to two different wastewaters, industrial wastewater OB and municipal wastewater HL. Although lethality and teratogenesis were both observed at the individual level, different molecular mechanisms were revealed by pathways, with cardiotoxicity- and genotoxicity-related pathways significantly enriched in OB, and neurotoxicity- and environmental information processing-related pathways significantly enriched in HL. Further suspect and nontargeted screening generated 59 and 86 causative toxicants in OB and HL, respectively, among which 29 toxicants were confirmed, that interacted with over 90% of enriched pathways and contributed over 50% of individual effects. After upgrading treatments based on causative toxicants, consistent removal of toxicants, pathway effects, and individual effects were observed.

The Early Paleozoic paleolatitudinal position of the terranes in the northern Tibetan Plateau is the key to unraveling the evolution of the Proto‐Tethys Ocean. We present the first Late Cambrian paleomagnetic results from the Oulongbuluke terrane (OT), in the northern Tibetan Plateau. The mean paleomagnetic direction for 16 sites is Ds = 196.2°, Is = −36.9° with κs = 31.5, α95 = 6.7°, corresponding to a paleopole at 68.2°S/51.9°E with dp/dm = 4.6°/7.8°.

These terminated in early August coincident with the eruption's end. We compare hydroacoustic data with transmission loss models and eruption photographs to show that coastal explosive activity was poorly recorded by the hydrophone network. Similarly, strong hydroacoustic signals did not correlate with observed activity. These results suggest that acoustic signals were generated by lava flowing up to 100 s of meters offshore.

Cirrus clouds are of great importance to the global climate, with their net radiative forcing strongly dependent on the microphysical properties that are related to the ice‐nucleating regime. However, the influence of long‐range transport of dust on primary ice formation in cirrus clouds is limitedly understood, specifically over the clean remote ocean regions. Here, two case studies show that transpacific Asian dust can impact the ice formation of cirrus clouds over the central Pacific based on Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization and Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR, CloudSat) observations. One case shows a well‐developed horizontally extended cirrus embedded in a pure dust layer, with an average dust‐related ice‐nucleating particle concentration (INPC) of 7 L−1 and 96 L−1 for an ice saturation ratio Si of 1.15 and 1.25, respectively; ice crystal number concentration (ICNC) with diameters >25 and 100 μm (denoted as nice,25 μm and nice,100 μm) are 64 L−1 and 7 L−1, respectively. Another case shows that cirrus clouds with a much smaller horizontal extent appeared in the vicinity of polluted dust, with an average INPC of 42–310 L−1 for the typical higher Si of 1.25–1.35 by considering a tenfold reduction of the ice nucleation efficiency of ice crystals; nice,25 μm and nice,100 μm are 168 L−1 and 20 L−1, respectively. The estimated INPC and ICNC values suggest the dominance of ice formation by dust‐induced heterogeneous nucleation, proving that the long‐range transport of dust toward the upper troposphere and the potential influence on cirrus formation over the central Pacific should be well considered in atmospheric models."

The 1.37 μm channel, known as strong water vapor absorbing, was made polarized in the polarized multi‐angle imager (PMAI) onboard FengYun‐3G satellite. The infight data shown that the new 1.37 μm polarized channel could be used to detect SWCs. The cloudbow is observed around the 140° scattering angle in the 1.37 μm polarization image, with a maximum polarization reflectance of approximately 0.04–0.06. The indicated water clouds with spherical particles in the high‐level altitude could be SWCs. Then, the SWCs detected by 1.37 μm polarized channel is verified using polarized reflectance of other channels, the reflectance difference of channels, and thermal infrared bright temperature. The presence of cloudbow in 1.03 and 1.64 μm channels indicate liquid water cloud. The reflectance difference between 1.03 and 1.64 μm of SWCs agree with characteristic of water cloud. The thermal infrared channels from the imager on the same platform indicate cold cloud with the brightness temperature far below 273.16 K. Therefore, the only use of 1.37 μm polarized channel could perform the identification of SWCs. PMAI provides a powerful tool for monitoring supercooled water clouds."

In this study, we document one such structure, a PMC front, by analyzing PMC images in the northern hemisphere from the Cloud Imaging and Particle Size (CIPS) instrument onboard the aeronomy of ice in the mesosphere (AIM) satellite. A PMC front is defined as a sharp boundary that separates cloudy and mostly clear regions, and where the clouds at the front boundary are brighter than the clouds in the cloudy region. We explore the environment that supports the formation of PMC fronts using near‐coincident temperature and water vapor observations from the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) satellite instrument. A comparison of PMC front locations to near‐coincident temperature profiles reveals the presence of inversion layers at PMC altitudes. The adiabatic and superadiabatic topside lapse rates of these temperature inversions indicate that some of the identified inversion layers may have been formed by gravity wave (GW) dissipation. The structure of the squared buoyancy frequency profiles indicates a stable layer or thermal duct that can be associated with large‐amplitude mesospheric inversion layers (MILs) that extend large distances. These inversion layers may be conducive to horizontal wave propagation. We hypothesize that ducted GWs may be a formation mechanism of PMC fronts."

The proposed model utilizes a coated spheroid to represent melting snow and graupel. It consists of three stages–coating, soaking, and melting–to account for the dielectric and density effects of melting particles. The scattering properties of the melting particles are computed with the Invariant‐Imbedding T‐Matrix (IITM) method, and the results are tabulated as look‐up tables for the radar operator. Regarding the parameterization of bulk optical properties, a flux‐conservation scheme is employed to estimate the size distribution of melting particles. To demonstrate its flexibility and superiority, the single and bulk scattering properties of our multi‐stage melting model are compared against the traditional homogeneous model, which uses the effective medium approximation (EMA). The effectiveness of the multi‐stage melting model has also been assessed by mapping model states in the regional mesoscale model of the China Meteorology Administration (CMA‐MESO) to radar observations. In the microphysics package of CMA‐MESO, the melting process is not explicitly represented, and we assume that melting hydrometeors occur where solid and liquid phases overlap.

Understanding the temporal dynamics of soil microbial biomass is crucial for assessing soil ecosystem functions and services, yet these dynamics are globally uncertain. Here, we compiled a data set of soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) from 1493 studies between 1988 and 2019 to elucidate their temporal trends and potential drivers. Results showed that global MBC and MBN significantly decreased by 0.033 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 and 0.007 Mg N ha−1 yr−1 at 0–30 cm soil depth, between 1988 and 2019, respectively, which might be primarily attributed to the warming of the climate, the increase in global precipitation, and reduction of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock. The rate of decline in MBC and MBN showed a non‐linear trend: following a decline from 1988 to 1999, it slowed down until 2014, likely due to the global warming hiatus. Afterward, the pace of decline increased again from 2015 to 2019. Boreal biomes experienced the largest decrease in soil microbial biomass with the reduction rate of MBC being 4.3 times higher than in temperate biomes, showing a higher sensitivity in boreal biomes to climate change. Grassland ecosystems also exhibited greater reductions, possibly driven by their degradation. These findings shed valuable insights on the long‐term dynamics of soil microbial biomass on a global scale over the last three decades. Furthermore, this study underscores the importance of preserving soil microbial biomass as a key strategy to mitigate the adverse effects of future climate change, thereby sustaining ecosystem health and resilience."

Assessing Neoliberal Promises and Water Markets in Chile,"
Neoliberal approaches to water governance, pioneered in Chile in the 1980s, are reappearing today on the centerstage of the water policy debate. While advocates claim that strong property rights, limits on government authority, and water markets can enhance environmental sustainability, efficiency, neutrality, and equity in the distribution of water rights, limited empirical evidence exists on whether neoliberal policies have delivered on these key promises. In this paper, we combine hydrological analysis with a nationwide data set on government water rights allocations between 1981 and 2021 to determine when and where water has been allocated beyond sustainable limits. We then integrate water market transaction and agricultural data to assess how allocations and scarcity conditions relate to spatial and temporal patterns in irrigation, crop distribution, and water market activity. Our results indicate that 30% of catchments are overallocated, and that continued government allocations of water rights during scarcity exacerbate already‐high inequalities in the distribution of water. We find no evidence that scarcity or water markets induced improvements in numerous efficiency metrics. Overall, our results support growing claims that the neoliberal water model fails to fulfill its key promises, notably to the detriment of nature and marginalized rural communities."

 Li-based all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) are considered feasible candidates for the development of the next generation of high-energy rechargeable batteries.

NTWO is capable of overcoming the limitation of lithium metal as the negative electrode, offering fast-charging capabilities and cycle stability. Physicochemical and electrochemical characterizations of NTWO in combination with the Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl) solid-state electrolyte demonstrate that the formation of LiWS2 at the electrode|electrolyte interphase is the main responsible for the improved battery performance. Indeed, when an NTWO-based negative electrode and LPSCl are coupled with a LiNbO3-coated LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2-based positive electrode, the lab-scale cell is capable of maintaining 80% of discharge capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 45 mA cm−2 at 60 °C and 60 MPa.

 Animals rely on compensatory actions to maintain stability and navigate their environment efficiently. These actions depend on global visual motion cues known as optic-flow. While the optomotor response has been the traditional focus for studying optic-flow compensation in insects, its simplicity has been insufficient to determine the role of the intricate optic-flow processing network involved in visual course control. Here, we reveal a series of course control behaviours in Drosophila and link them to specific neural circuits. We show that bilateral electrical coupling of optic-flow-sensitive neurons in the fly’s lobula plate are required for a proper course control. This electrical interaction works alongside chemical synapses within the HS-H2 network to control the dynamics and direction of turning behaviours.

 Baobab (Adansonia digitata) is a long-lived tree endemic to Africa with economic, ecological, and cultural importance, yet its genomic features are underexplored. Here, we report a chromosome-level reference genome anchored to 42 chromosomes for A. digitata, alongside draft assemblies for a sibling tree, two trees from distinct locations in Africa, and A. za from Madagascar. The baobab genome is uniquely rich in DNA transposons, which make up 33%, while LTR retrotransposons account for 10%. A. digitata experienced whole genome multiplication (WGM) around 30 million years ago (MYA), followed by a second WGM event 3–11 MYA, likely linked to autotetraploidy. Resequencing of 25 trees identify three subpopulations, with gene flow across West Africa distinct from East Africa. Gene enrichment and fixation index (Fst) analyses show baobab retained multiple circadian, flowering, and light-responsive genes, which likely support longevity through the UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) pathway.

 Future changes in solar radiation and rising temperatures will likely reduce global solar photovoltaic potential, but advancing photovoltaic technologies could counteract these effects. We investigate the potential of photovoltaic to satisfy energy demands given climate change and technological development. We find that conventional photovoltaic will require 0.5 to 1.2% of global land area to meet projected energy demands by 2085 without accounting for climate change effects. When considering climate impacts, this requirement increases to 0.7–1.5% of the global land area. However, utilising advanced photovoltaic technologies can reduce this area to 0.3–1.2%, effectively mitigating climate impacts. Regional climate change impacts vary substantially, resulting in photovoltaic potential decreases of up to 3% in Latin America and the Caribbean, and by up to 8% in South Asia.

 Identifying changes in volcanic unrest and tracking eruptive activity are fundamental for volcanic surveillance and monitoring. Magmatic gases, particularly sulphur dioxide (SO2), play a crucial role in influencing eruptive styles, making the monitoring of SO2 emissions essential. Recent advancements in satellite remote sensing technology, including higher spatial resolution and sensitivity, have enhanced our ability to detect SO2 emissions from volcanoes worldwide. However, traditional fixed-threshold algorithms struggle to automatically distinguish volcanic SO2 emissions from non-volcanic sources. Additionally, accurately quantifying SO2 emissions is challenging due to their dependence on plume height, particularly when reaching high altitudes. To address these challenges, we developed an Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm that detects and quantifies volcanic SO2 emissions in near real-time. Our approach utilizes a Random Forest (RF) model, a supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithm, to identify volcanic SO2 emissions and integrates Cloud Top Height (CTH) data to enhance the accuracy of SO2 mass quantification during intense volcanic eruptions. This AI algorithm, fully implemented in Google Earth Engine (GEE), leverages data from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) aboard the Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite to automatically retrieve daily volcanic SO2 plumes and CTH. We validated the model's performance against the Radius classifier, a state-of-the-art tool, and generalized its application across various volcanoes (Etna, Villarrica, Fuego, Pacaya, and Cumbre Vieja) with differing degassing activities, SO2 emission rates, and plume geometries. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed AI approach effectively identifies and quantifies SO2 plumes emitted by different volcanoes, enabling the investigation of SO2 emission time series that reflect magma dynamics."

 Montane cloud forests (MCFs) feature frequent, wind-driven cloud bands (fog and low stratus [FLS]), providing crucial moisture to the ecosystems. Elevated temperatures may displace FLS, impacting MCFs significantly. To evaluate the consequences, quantifying FLS occurrences is vital. In this study, we employed “RANdom forest GEneRator” (Ranger), an advanced machine learning algorithm, to detect diurnal (07:00–17:00) FLS (dFLS) occurrence from 2018 to 2021 in MCFs in northeast Taiwan using 31 variables, including the visible and infrared bands of the Advanced Himawari Imager onboard Himawari-8, pixel solar azimuth and zenith angles, band differences, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and topographic attributes. We applied simple (lumping all data) and three-mode (sunrise/sunset, cloudy and clear sky) models to predict dFLS occurrence. We randomly selected 80 % of the data for model development and the rest for validation by referring to four ground dFLS observation stations across an elevation range of 1151–1811 m a.s.l with 53,358 diurnal time-lapse photographs. We found that it was possible to detect dFLS occurrence in MCFs using both simple and three-mode models regardless of the weather conditions (F1 ≥ 0.864, accuracy ≥ 0.905 and the Matthews correlation coefficient ≥ 0.786); the performance of the simple model was slightly better. The NDVI was more important than other variables in both models. This study demonstrates that Ranger may be able to detect dFLS in MCFs solely using a comprehensive array of satellite features insensitive to varying atmospheric conditions and terrain effects, permitting systematic monitoring of dFLS over vast regions."

 3D mapping provides highly accurate environmental data, which is essential for critical applications such as autonomous driving and urban emergency response. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors, particularly solid-state ones, play a pivotal role in spatial–temporal mapping by providing precise three-dimensional data of the environment, significantly enhancing remote sensing capabilities and adaptability to challenging environments compared to mechanical LiDAR systems. However, the limited field of view results in a sparse point cloud frame with few features, which poses challenges to feature matching, causes pose offset, and hinders spatial–temporal continuity, and further significant obstacle for existing vehicle-mounted mobile mapping methods. To address the above issues, we proposed a novel approach that integrating inertial measurement unit (IMU) with solid-state LiDAR. Specifically, it comprises two key modules: an initial localization mapping module, mitigating the limitations of solid-state LiDAR in positioning and mapping accuracy, and an attitude optimization mapping module utilizing real-time high-frequency IMU data to identify key frames for correcting initial attitudes and generating accurate 3D maps. The effectiveness of the method is validated through extensive experiments in complex community and high-speed urban road scenarios. Furthermore, our approach outperforms than the state-of-the-art techniques in test scenarios, achieving a significant 35% reduction in average absolute pose error and enhancing the robustness of vehicle-mounted mapping."

 Forest fires pose a significant threat to ecosystems, biodiversity, and human settlements, necessitating accurate and timely detection of burned areas for post-fire management. This study focused on the immediate assessment of a recent major forest fire that occurred on March 15, 2024, in southwestern China. We comprehensively utilized high temporal resolution MODIS and Black Marble nighttime light images to monitor the fire’s development and introduced a novel method for detecting burned forest areas using a new Shadow-Enhanced Vegetation Index (SEVI) coupling with a machine learning technique. The SEVI effectively enhances the vegetation index (VI) values on shaded slopes and hence reduces the VI disparity between shaded and sunlit areas, which is critical for accurately extracting fire scars in such terrain. While SEVI primarily identifies burned forest areas, the Random Forest (RF) technique detects all burned areas, including both forested and non-forested regions. Consequently, the total burned area of the Yajiang forest fire was estimated at 23,588 ha, with the burned forest area covering 19,266 ha. The combination of SEVI and RF algorithms provided a comprehensive and efficient tool for identifying burned areas. Additionally, our study employed the Remote Sensing-based Ecological Index (RSEI) to assess the ecological impact of the fire on the region, uncovering an immediate 15 % decline in regional ecological conditions following the fire. The usage of RSEI has the potential to quantitatively understand ecological responses to the fire. The findings achieved in this study underscore the significance of precise fire-burned area extraction techniques for enhancing forest fire management and ecosystem recovery strategies, while also highlighting the broader ecological implications of such events."

 Yellow River is famous for its exceptionally higher suspended sediment concentrations (SSC), displaying significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity across diverse sections. Although SSC monitoring of the Yellow River and some of its tributaries has been achieved using Landsat data, it remains unclear whether the inclusion of higher spatial resolution satellites can expand the spatiotemporal monitoring capabilities for the Yellow River and most of its tributaries. In this study, we employed Sentinel-2 imagery, offering superior spatiotemporal resolution, to develop a higher-accurate SSC model and quantitatively evaluated its potential to improve the spatiotemporal coverage of SSC monitoring compared to Landsat satellites. For the Yellow River in the Loess Plateau, the optimized Sentinel-2 model exhibited superior accuracy, achieving R2 = 0.91, root mean square error of 728.76 mg/L, and unbiased percentage difference of 16.75%. Notably, distinct SSC distribution differences were observed across different rivers, indicating significant spatial heterogeneity (SSC: 0.58 – 3.01 × 105 mg/L). Moreover, Sentinel-2 showed a significant increase in observation frequency and spatial coverage (204.08% and 107.15%, respectively) compared to Landsat. An additional 35.29% increase in observation frequency was achieved through the combined satellite observation method. Furthermore, based on river width statistics, we found that upgrading the spatial resolution from 10 m to 1 m enhanced the coverage of observable river segments in the Loess Plateau by approximately 47.96%, and by about 50.56% globally. This study established a crucial scientific foundation for integrating Sentinel-2 and Landsat, enabling finer-scale monitoring and management of river sediment."

 Understanding the characteristics of the growth zones of live corals and competitive algae, including turf algae and macroalgae, is crucial for assessing the degradation of coral reef ecosystems. However, identifying live corals and competitive algae in multispectral satellite images is challenging because different objects can have similar spectra. To address this, we used two satellite images acquired at different times (Landsat thematic mapper (TM), Landsat operational land imager (OLI), or Sentinel-2 multi-spectral instrument (MSI)) to assess the growth zone characteristics of live corals and competitive algae. This assessment leveraged the seasonal dieback of competitive algae and the relative stability of live-coral growth zones over a short period. Specifically, we developed a normalized red–green difference index (NRGI) to segment live-coral-or-competitive-alga growth zones in satellite images. By comparing the segmentation results from an image captured during a period with few competitive algae and another image captured during a period with lush competitive algae, we estimated the growth zone areas of the live corals and competitive algae. Finally, we calculated the ratio of the competitive-alga growth zone area to the live-coral growth zone area (RCL). Experiments on eight typical coral islands and reefs in the South China Sea (SCS) from 1995 to 2022 revealed that: (1) the identification accuracies of live-coral-or-competitive-alga growth zones reached 80.3 % and 92.6 % during periods with few competitive algae (January to March) and lush competitive algae (April to October), respectively; (2) the RCL was well correlated with the coral-macroalgae encounter rate (an ecological index indicating the pressure of the competitive algae on the live corals) (r = 0.79, P<0.05); and (3) the trends in the growth zones of competitive algae and live corals, along with the RCL, were consistent with major ecological events in the SCS, such as coral bleaching, outbreak of Acanthaster planci, and black band disease. (4) Moreover, a time-lagged correlation was observed between heat stress and the RCL. In summary, the proposed approach is simple, effective, and feasible. The RCL is a valuable indicator of the status of coral reef ecosystems, highlighting the pressure of competitive algae on live corals and the degradation of coral reef ecosystems. This method introduces a novel application of multispectral satellite images for assessing coral reef ecosystems and has significant potential for future coral reef ecosystem monitoring."

 Accurate crop mapping is critical for agricultural decisions and food security. Despite the widespread use of machine learning and deep learning in remote sensing for crop classification, mapping crops in mountainous smallholder farming systems remains challenging. In particular, cloudy and rainy weather limits high-quality satellite imagery, potentially limiting the availability of reliable data for classification. Additionally, the substantial intraclass variability among multiple crops further impedes classification accuracy. In this context, this study sought to resolve these two issues by applying a hybrid approach that combines multisource remote sensing data and deep metric learning. For the first challenge, multisource remote sensing data, including Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 data from the Google Earth Engine, were integrated to provide more comprehensive information on crop growth and differences. To address the second challenge, we proposed a 2D-CNN network enhanced by CBAM attention and an online hard example mining strategy. The network focuses on the channel-spatial information of crop samples and their surrounding pixels while promoting the convergence of similar crop samples within the latent feature space and enhancing the separation among different samples. This process is exemplified through a case study of crop mapping in Jiangjin District, Chongqing city, an area representing the typical mountain smallholder farming systems in Southwest China. Compared to six state-of-the-art methods, RF, SVM, XGBoost, ResNet18, and DMLOHM, our approach achieves the highest performance, with 93.99% overall accuracy, a kappa coefficient of 0.9253, and excellent F1 scores across numerous crop categories. The results of this study provide an effective solution for crop classification in complex mountainous regions and have promising potential for mapping under challenging natural conditions."

 Monitoring the distribution and size of long-living large shrubs, such as junipers, is crucial for assessing the long-term impacts of global change on high-mountain ecosystems. While deep learning models have shown remarkable success in object segmentation, adapting these models to detect shrub species with polymorphic nature remains challenging. In this research, we release a large dataset of individual shrub delineations on freely available satellite imagery and use an instance segmentation model to map all junipers over the treeline for an entire biosphere reserve (Sierra Nevada, Spain). To optimize performance, we introduced a novel dual data construction approach: using photo-interpreted (PI) data for model development and fieldwork (FW) data for validation. To account for the polymorphic nature of junipers during model evaluation, we developed a soft version of the Intersection over Union metric. Finally, we assessed the uncertainty of the resulting map in terms of canopy cover and density of shrubs per size class. Our model achieved an F1-score in shrub delineation of 87.87% on the PI data and 76.86% on the FW data. The R2 and RMSE of the observed versus predicted relationship were 0.63 and 6.67% for canopy cover, and 0.90 and 20.62 for shrub density. The greater density of larger shrubs in lower altitudes and smaller shrubs in higher altitudes observed in the model outputs was also present in the PI and FW data, suggesting an altitudinal uplift in the optimal performance of the species. This study demonstrates that deep learning applied on freely available high-resolution satellite imagery is useful to detect medium to large shrubs of high ecological value at the regional scale, which could be expanded to other high-mountains worldwide and to historical and fothcoming imagery."

 Detailed knowledge of vegetation patterns allows to evaluate mire ecosystems and their dynamics. The use of hyperspectral information has the benefits of exploring spectral characteristics of species and vegetation modelling. Our study employed multi-scale and multi-source hyperspectral imaging with a handheld camera in the field and an UAV (Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle) sensor covering the wavelengths of 400 – 1000 nm. Plot-level spectra acquired with a UAV and field spectra collected at 1 m height were combined to develop a spectral library for Sphagnum moss species. This library was then used to map dominant Sphagnum species in a Finnish Aapa mire complex using the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classifier. Classification performance assessment was supported by calculating a water index from the UAV-information. Additionally, we examined the transferability of site-specific spectral libraries to an aapa mire with similar vegetation. The results showed little spectral variation in the plot spectrum between the sensors. A fusion of species- and plot-level libraries yielded the highest accuracy of 62 %. For both mires, there was a great variation among the class accuracies. Floating mosses had an accuracy of 86 %, followed by lawn-forming Sphagnum balticum with 77 %. For the test site, the latter species was mapped with an accuracy of 59 %. Red moss species achieved low accuracies of 45 % and 38 %, likely due to effects from sub-pixel and mixed-pixel effects of neighbouring graminoid species and the presence of litter. This might have also enhanced the contrast of adjacent pixels contributing to spectral alterations. Water table depth measurements and the water index revealed a hydrological preference for most species, with classification performance notably improving with higher water index values. We recommend collecting on-site hyperspectral information at varying hydrological circumstances to build a comprehensive spectral library for mire vegetation and modelling."

 With rapid economic development and urban growth, Seoul experiences severe air pollution due to fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5), which is detrimental to human health. Although recent studies have extensively focused on estimating daytime PM2.5 concentrations using various types of satellite data, there remains a significant lack of research on nighttime PM2.5 estimations. This study estimated nighttime PM2.5 in Seoul from December 2018 to November 2019 using multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest (RF) models. These models, which incorporated data on radiance, moon illumination fraction, and terrain height from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite covering all moon phases, also utilized meteorological data from the ERA5 reanalysis by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). To address multicollinearity, seasonal models were developed using forward stepwise regression and variance inflation factor analysis. DNB radiance analysis indicates that the high intensity of artificial light sources in Seoul significantly reduces the impact of moonlight, leading to notable changes in the DNB radiation associated with PM2.5 concentrations. Consequently, this study estimated nighttime PM2.5 over Seoul across all moon phases. These estimates were then validated through 10-fold cross-validation. The RF model exhibited superior accuracy, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.65–0.90, compared to MLR, with R2 of 0.15–0.50, reflecting seasonal fluctuations in the model performance. The developed models can be applied to estimate reliable nighttime PM2.5 concentrations in megacities with strong artificial light sources, utilizing a comprehensive dataset from satellite observations for all moon phases. Additionally, our findings can serve as scientific data for establishing environmental policies by providing valuable insights into understanding air pollution primarily caused by PM2.5."

This study investigated alterations in the topographical structure of the brain related to aging and neurodegenerative diseases by analyzing brain gradients derived from structural MRI data across multiple cohorts (n= 7323). The analysis identified distinct gradient patterns in AD, aging, and other neurodegenerative conditions. Gene enrichment analysis indicated that inorganic ion transmembrane transport was the most significant term in normal aging, while chemical synaptic transmission is a common enrichment term across various neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, the findings show that each disorder exhibits unique dysfunctional neurophysiological characteristics. These insights are pivotal for elucidating the distinct biological mechanisms underlying AD, thereby enhancing our understanding of its unique clinical phenotypes in contrast to normal aging and other neurodegenerative disorders."
