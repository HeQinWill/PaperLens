10.5194/acp-25-979-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究的是地衣中冰核颗粒的活性及其对云层性质的影响。研究者在芬兰 boreal forest 中采集了地衣样本，并在实验室中测试了它们的冰核能力。结果表明，地衣中含有大量的冰核颗粒，即使经过过滤，仍然存在显著的冰核活性。这些冰核颗粒很小，可能直接排放到大气中，或与较大的颗粒物结合。研究认为，在积雪覆盖的环境中，地衣可能是重要的生物冰核颗粒来源。该研究与大气环境遥感技术关系不大，因为它主要关注的是地衣这种特定生物来源的冰核颗粒的实验室研究，而非大气成分的遥感监测。,"['Ice nucleating particles', 'Cloud properties', 'Aerosol', 'Biological INPs', 'Lichen']",Ulrike Proske;Michael P. Adams;Grace C. E. Porter;Mark A. Holden;Jaana Bäck;Benjamin J. Murray,Measurement report: The ice-nucleating activity of  lichen sampled in a northern European boreal forest,"Ice-nucleating particles (INPs) aid the freezing of water droplets in clouds and thus modify cloud properties. In a campaign in a Finnish boreal forest, biological INPs were observed, despite many of their potential biological sources being snow-covered. We sampled tree-dwelling lichens that were not covered in snow and tested their ice nucleation ability in the laboratory. We found that the lichen harbours INPs, which may be important in similar snowy environments. 
 Ice-nucleating particles (INPs) facilitate the heterogeneous freezing of cloud droplets and thus modify cloud properties. Hence, it is important to understand the sources of INPs. During the HyICE-2018 campaign, which took place in the boreal forest of Hyytiälä, substantial concentrations of airborne heat-sensitive biological INPs were observed, despite many potential biological sources of INPs being snow-covered. A potential source of INPs that were not covered in snow was lichens that grow on trees; hence, we investigated these lichens as a potential source of biological INPs in this boreal forest environment. INPs derived from lichen sampled during HyICE-2018 are shown to nucleate ice at temperatures as warm as −5 °C with 103 INPs per gram of lichen. Successive filtration to smaller sizes removes some of the most active INPs in suspension, but substantial activity remains, even when filtering to 0.1 µm. The small size of the INPs from lichen means they have the potential to either be emitted directly into the atmosphere or be associated with larger particles, such as lichenous reproductive aerosol types (spores or diaspores). We also show that the INPs from lichens from Hyytiälä are sensitive to heat, which is similar to the INPs sampled from the atmosphere of Hyytiälä and consistent with the presence of ice-active proteins. Adding to previous evidence of lichenous INPs, this study shows that lichens from a European boreal forest in Hyytiälä harbour INPs. This novel finding may be especially important in this snow-covered habitat where few, if any, other biological INP sources are available. The great terrestrial abundance of lichens in Hyytiälä, and around the world, calls for further research to combine their ice-nucleating ability with dispersal studies to evaluate the flux of lichenous INPs into the atmosphere, as well as to what extent these particles reach heights and locations where they might influence cloud properties."
10.5194/acp-25-943-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇研究论文主要关注西北太平洋地区中高层对流层臭氧含量的长期变化。研究利用地面臭氧探空仪观测数据和大气化学气候模式模拟结果，分析了过去三十年臭氧浓度的变化趋势。结果表明，春季和夏季中高层对流层臭氧浓度显著增加，这与平流层和对流层臭氧来源有关。研究通过标记示踪剂的方法，进一步探讨了臭氧增加的驱动因素，发现平流层臭氧的向下输送和对流层臭氧的增加是导致西北太平洋地区中高层对流层臭氧增加的两个关键因素。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它利用了臭氧探空仪（一种遥感技术）进行观测，并结合了大气化学模式模拟结果来分析大气成分变化，最终应用于空气质量监测和气候变化研究。,"['Tropospheric ozone', 'Ozone', 'Ozonesondes', 'Atmospheric chemistry', 'Climate radiative forcing', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Atmospheric composition analysis', 'Model simulation']",Xiaodan Ma;Jianping Huang;Michaela I. Hegglin;Patrick Jöckel;Tianliang Zhao,Causes of growing middle-to-upper tropospheric ozone over the northwest Pacific region,"Our research explored changes in ozone levels in the northwest Pacific region over 30 years, revealing a significant increase in the middle-to-upper troposphere, especially during spring and summer. This rise is influenced by both stratospheric and tropospheric sources, which affect climate and air quality in East Asia. This work underscores the need for continued study to understand underlying mechanisms. 
 Long-term ozone (O3) changes in the middle-to-upper troposphere are critical to climate radiative forcing and tropospheric O3 pollution. Yet, these changes remain poorly quantified through observations in East Asia. Concerns also persist regarding the data quality of the ozonesondes available at the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC) for this region. This study aims to address these gaps by analyzing O3 soundings at four sites along the northwestern Pacific coastal region over the past 3 decades and by assessing their consistency with an atmospheric chemistry–climate model simulation. Utilizing the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Hamburg (ECHAM)/Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy) Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) nudged simulations, it is demonstrated that trends between model and ozonesonde measurements are overall consistent, thereby gaining confidence in the model's ability to simulate O3 trends and confirming the utility of potentially imperfect observational data. A notable increase in O3 mixing ratio around 0.29–0.82 ppb a−1 extending from the middle troposphere to the upper troposphere is observed in both observations and model simulations between 1990 and 2020, primarily during spring and summer. The timing of these O3 tongues is delayed when moving from south to north along the measurement sites, transitioning from late spring to summer. Investigation into the drivers of these trends using tagged model tracers reveals that O3 of stratospheric origin (O3S) dominates the absolute O3 mixing ratios over the middle-to-upper troposphere in the subtropics, contributing to the observed O3 increases by up to 96 % (40 %) during winter (summer), whereas O3 of tropospheric origin (O3T) governs the absolute value throughout the tropical troposphere and contributes generally much more than 60 % to the positive O3 changes, especially during summer and autumn. During winter and spring, a decrease in O3S is partly counterbalanced by an increase in O3T in the tropical troposphere. This study highlights that the enhanced downward transport of stratospheric O3 into the troposphere in the subtropics and a surge of tropospheric O3 in the tropics are the two key factors driving the enhancement of O3 in the middle-to-upper troposphere along the northwest Pacific region."

This work analyses a March 2021 dust event using a modelling strategy incorporating desert dust. Results show that considering desert dust cuts errors in solar radiation estimates by 75 % and reduces surface solar radiation by 18 %. This highlights the importance of incorporating dust aerosols into solar forecasting for better accuracy. 
 The anticipated increase in solar energy production in West Africa requires high-quality solar irradiance estimates, which are affected by meteorological conditions and in particular the presence of desert dust aerosols. This study examines the impact of incorporating desert dust into solar irradiance and surface temperature estimations. The research focuses on a case study of a dust event in March 2021, which is characteristic of the dry season in West Africa. Significant desert aerosol emissions at the Bodélé Depression are associated with a Harmattan flow that transports the plume westwards. Simulations of this dust event were conducted using the meteorological Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model alone, as well as coupling it with the CHIMERE chemistry transport model, using three different datasets for the dust aerosol initial and boundary conditions (CAMS, GOCART, and MERRA-2). Results show that considering desert dust reduces estimation errors in global horizontal irradiance (GHI) by about 75 %. The dust plume caused an average of 18 % reduction in surface solar irradiance during the event. Additionally, the simulations indicated a positive bias in aerosol optical depth (AOD) and PM10 surface concentrations. The choice of dataset for initial and boundary conditions minimally influenced GHI, surface temperature, and AOD estimates, whereas PM10 concentrations and aerosol size distribution were significantly affected. This study underscores the importance of incorporating dust aerosols into solar forecasting for better accuracy."

Thomas;Hayley S. Glicker;Alex B. Guenther;Roger Seco;Oscar Vega Bustillos;Julio Tota;Rodrigo A. F. Souza;James N. Smith,Seasonal investigation of ultrafine-particle organic composition in an eastern Amazonian rainforest,"We present measurements of the organic composition of ultrafine particles collected from the eastern Amazon, an understudied region that is subjected to increasing human influence. We find that while isoprene chemistry is likely significant for ultrafine-particle growth throughout the year, compounds related to other sources, such as biological-spore emissions and biomass burning, exhibit striking seasonal differences, implying extensive variation in regional ultrafine-particle sources. 
 Reports on the composition of ultrafine particles (<100 nm in diameter) in the Amazon are scarce, due in part to the fact that new-particle formation has rarely been observed near ground level.  Ultrafine particles near the surface have nevertheless been observed, leaving open questions regarding the sources and chemistry of their formation and growth, particularly as these vary across seasons.  Here, we present measurements of the composition of ultrafine particles collected in the Tapajós National Forest (2.857° S, 54.959° W) during three different seasonal periods: 10–30 September 2016 (SEP), 18 November–23 December 2016 (DEC), and 22 May–21 June 2017 (JUN).  Size-selected (5–70 nm) particles were collected daily (for 22 h each day) using an offline sampler.  Samples collected during the three time periods were compiled and analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled with Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry.  Our findings suggest a sustained influence of isoprene organosulfate chemistry on ultrafine particles from the different periods.  We present chemical evidence that indicates that biological-spore fragmentation impacted ultrafine-particle composition during the late wet season (JUN), while chemical markers for biomass burning and secondary chemistry peaked during the dry season (SEP and DEC).  Higher oxidation states and degrees of unsaturation were observed for organics in the dry season (SEP and DEC), suggesting greater extents of aerosol aging. Finally, applying a volatility parameterization to the observed compounds suggests that organic sulfur species are likely key drivers of new-particle growth in the region due to their low volatility compared to other species."
10.5194/acp-25-1023-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了韩国空气质量改善停滞的现象，即使PM2.5的质量浓度持续下降，能见度却没有改善。研究发现，空气中颗粒物的尺寸变小，导致光散射效率增加，从而降低能见度。文章利用了韩国首尔和蔚山2015年至2020年的PM2.5数据和日本环境研究所提供的激光雷达数据，分析了PM2.5的质量消光效率(MEE)、Ångström指数以及相对湿度和绝对湿度的变化趋势。结果表明，MEE在首尔和蔚山均呈上升趋势，Ångström指数也呈上升趋势，这都表明颗粒物尺寸变小。虽然相对湿度和绝对湿度的变化趋势不显著，但研究认为颗粒物尺寸的减小是导致能见度改善有限的主要原因。文章最后指出，由于缺乏长期成分数据，需要进一步研究来准确确定MEE增加的原因。总的来说，该研究利用地面观测数据和激光雷达数据，结合气象数据，分析了影响空气质量和能见度的因素，与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['Particulate matter (PM2.5)', 'Atmospheric visibility', 'Light extinction', 'Ångström exponent', 'Lidar', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Aerosol optical depth']",Sohee Joo;Juseon Shin;Matthias Tesche;Naghmeh Dehkhoda;Taegyeong Kim;Youngmin Noh,Increased number concentrations of small particles explain perceived stagnation in air quality over Korea,"In our study, we investigated why, in northeast Asia, visibility has not improved even though air pollution levels have decreased. By examining trends in Seoul and Ulsan, we found that the particles in the air are getting smaller, which scatters light more effectively and reduces how far we can see. Our findings suggest that changes in particle properties adversely affected public perception of air quality improvement even though the PM2.5 mass concentration is continuously decreasing. 
 The atmospheric visibility in South Korea has not improved despite decreasing mass concentrations of particulate matter (PM)2.5. Since visibility is influenced by particle size and composition as well as meteorological factors, light detection and ranging (lidar) data provided by the National Institute for Environmental Studies in Japan and PM2.5 measurements retrieved from AirKorea are used to determine the trends in PM2.5 mass extinction efficiency (MEE) in Seoul and Ulsan, South Korea, from 2015 to 2020. Moreover, the monthly trends in the Ångström exponent and relative and absolute humidity are determined to identify the factors influencing PM2.5 MEE. The monthly average PM2.5 MEE exhibits an increasing trend in Seoul (+0.04 m2 g−1 per month) and Ulsan (+0.07 m2 g−1 per month). Relative humidity increases by +0.070 % and +0.095 % per month in Seoul and Ulsan, respectively, and absolute humidity increases by +0.029 and +0.010 g m−3 per month, respectively. However, the trends in these variables are not statistically significant. The Ångström exponent increases by +0.005 and +0.011 per month in Seoul and Ulsan, respectively, indicating that the MEE increases as the size of the particles becomes smaller each year. However, due to limitations when obtaining long-term composition data in this study, further research is needed to accurately determine the causes of the increase in PM2.5 MEE. Such an increase in PM2.5 MEE may have limited the improvements in visibility and adversely affected public perception of air quality improvement even though the PM2.5 mass concentration in South Korea is continuously decreasing."

This study revealed the impact of introducing BEVs on the decrease in the UHI effect and the impact of BEVs on the formation of tropospheric ozone and fine particulate matter in the Greater Tokyo Area of Japan. 
 Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are considered a solution for global warming and air pollution, and several countries have announced they will shift to BEVs in the 2030s. Even though previous studies have shown the effects of reducing vehicular emissions on the formation of tropospheric ozone (O3), no studies have evaluated the effect of decreasing anthropogenic heat, which is expected to mitigate urban heat island (UHI) effect, on air quality issues. We used a numerical weather prediction to estimate changes in the UHI effect in the Greater Tokyo Area (GTA) of Japan by introducing BEVs. The results indicated that the introduction of BEVs would lead to a maximum local temperature decrease of 0.25 °C in the GTA. The effects of introducing BEVs on O3 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) were estimated using a regional chemical transport model. The results indicated that mitigating the UHI effect would lead to a reduction in ground-level O3 formation. This is due to the increased NO titration effect caused by the lowered planetary boundary layer height and due to the degradation of photochemistry related to O3 formation caused by a decrease in temperature and biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). The mitigation of UHI would result in enhanced particle coagulation, with an increase in ground-level PM2.5. Furthermore, a decrease in BVOC emissions would result in increased PM2.5 owing to enhancement of the OH + SO2 reaction. A total of 175 and 77 annual premature deaths would be prevented from changes in O3 and PM2.5, respectively."

A separation and quantification method combining the Gaussian plume model and the integrated mass enhancement method is proposed. A modern parameter estimation technique is introduced to separate the overlapping plumes from satellite observations. The proposed method is evaluated with synthesized observations and real satellite observations. 
 Quantifying facility-level methane emission rates using satellites with fine spatial resolution has recently gained significant attention. However, the prevailing quantification algorithms usually require the methane column plume from a solitary point source as input. Such approaches are challenged with overlapping plumes from multiple point sources. To address these challenges, we propose a separation approach based on a heuristic optimization and the multi-source Gaussian plume model to separate the overlapping plumes. Subsequently, the integrated mass enhancement (IME) model is applied to accurately quantify emission rates. To validate the proposed method, observation system simulation experiments (OSSEs) of various scenarios are performed. The result shows that plume overlapping exacerbates the quantifying error of the IME method when applied without such a separation approach, where the quantification mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) increased from 0.15 to 0.83, and it is affected by factors such as source intervals, wind direction, and interference emission rates. By contrast, the application of the proposed separation method together with the IME quantification approach mitigates this interference, reducing the quantification MAPE from 0.83 to 0.38. Moreover, the proposed method also outperforms the direct use of multi-source Gaussian plume fitting for the quantification, with a MAPE of 0.45. Our separation method separates overlapping plumes from multiple sources into distinct, single-source observations, enabling the IME algorithm – a high-precision quantification approach for fine-spatial-resolution plume images – to handle multi-source scenarios effectively. This method can help future spaceborne carbon inventory activities for spatially clustering carbon-emitting facilities."

Gabriel;Shiqi Xu;Mengistu Wolde,Comparative experimental validation of microwave hyperspectral atmospheric soundings in clear-sky conditions,"This study evaluates and compares a new microwave hyperspectrometer with an infrared hyperspectrometer for clear-sky temperature and water vapor retrievals. The analysis reveals that the information content of the infrared hyperspectrometer exceeds that of the microwave hyperspectrometer and provides higher vertical resolution in ground-based zenith measurements. Leveraging the ground–airborne synergy between the two instruments yielded optimal sounding results. 
 Accurate observations of atmospheric temperature and water vapor profiles are essential for weather forecasting and climate change detection. Hyperspectral radiance measurements afford a useful means to retrieve these thermodynamic variable fields by harnessing the rich information contained in the electromagnetic wave spectrum of the atmospheric radiation. In contrast to infrared radiometry, microwave radiometry can penetrate clouds, making it a valuable tool for all-sky thermodynamic retrievals. Recent advancements have led to the fabrication of a hyperspectral microwave radiometer: the High Spectral Resolution Airborne Microwave Sounder (HiSRAMS). This study utilizes HiSRAMS to retrieve atmospheric temperature and water vapor profiles under clear-sky conditions; this is an initial assessment of one of the first hyperspectral microwave radiometers, comparing the results to those from an infrared hyperspectrometer, the Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI). HiSRAMS and AERI measurements under different viewing geometries have been acquired and compared for atmospheric retrieval. When both instruments are placed on the ground to acquire zenith-pointing measurements, the infrared hyperspectral measurements exhibit higher information content and greater vertical resolution for temperature and water vapor retrievals than the microwave hyperspectral measurements. A synergistic fusion of HiSRAMS and AERI measurements from the air and ground is tested. This “sandwich” sounding of the atmosphere takes advantage of the complementary information contents of the two instruments and is found to notably improve retrieval accuracy."

The method is crucial for investigating the occurrence of precipitation and significantly improves the Cloudnet target classification scheme for measurements over the Barbados Cloud Observatory (BCO). A first-ever analysis of the Cloudnet product including the new ""haze echo"" target over 2 years at the BCO is presented. 
 The highly sensitive Ka-band cloud radar at the Barbados Cloud Observatory (BCO) frequently reveals radar reflectivity signals below −50 dBZ within the convective sub-cloud layer. These so-called haze echoes are signals from hygroscopically grown sea salt aerosols. Within the Cloudnet target classification scheme, haze echoes are generally misclassified as precipitation (target class: “drizzle or rain”). We present a technique to discriminate between “drizzle or rain” and sea salt aerosols in Cloudnet that is applicable to marine Cloudnet sites. The method is based on deriving heuristic probability functions utilizing a combination of cloud radar reflectivity factor, radar mean Doppler velocity, and the ceilometer attenuated backscatter coefficient. The method is crucial for investigating the occurrence of precipitation and significantly improves the Cloudnet target classification scheme for measurements at the BCO. The results are validated against the amount of precipitation detected by the Virga-Sniffer tool. We analyze data for measurements at BCO covering 2 years (July 2021–July 2023). A first-ever statistical analysis of the Cloudnet target classification product including the new “haze echo” target over 2 years at the BCO is presented. In the atmospheric column above the BCO, “drizzle or rain” is  on average more frequent during the dry season compared to the wet season due to the higher occurrence of warm clouds contributing to the amount of precipitation. Haze echoes are identified about 4 times more often during the dry season compared to the wet season. The frequency of occurrence of “drizzle or rain” in Cloudnet caused by misclassified haze echoes is overestimated by up to 16 %. Supported by the Cloudnet statistics and the results obtained from the Virga-Sniffer tool, 48 % of detected warm clouds in the dry and wet season precipitate. The proportion of precipitation evaporating fully before reaching the ground (virga) is higher during the dry season."

 This study presents the development and performance evaluation of an ozone differential absorption lidar system. The system could effectively obtain vertical profiles of lower-tropospheric ozone in an altitude range of 0.3 to 4 km with high spatiotemporal resolutions. The system emits three laser beams at wavelengths of 276, 287 and 299 nm by using the stimulated Raman effect of carbon dioxide (CO2). A 250 mm telescope and a grating spectrometer are used to collect and separate the backscattering signals at the three wavelengths. Considering the influences of aerosol interference and statistical error, a wavelength pair of 276–287 nm is used for the altitude below 600 m and a wavelength pair of 287–299 nm is used for the altitude above 600 m to invert ozone concentration. We also evaluated the errors caused by the uncertainty of the wavelength index. The developed ozone lidar was deployed in a field campaign that was conducted to measure the vertical profiles of ozone using a tethered balloon platform.

We used 1–10 nm particles with different compositions, including metal particles, organic particles generated in the laboratory, and atmospheric particles collected in Helsinki and Hyytiälä. A noticeable difference among the calibration curves was observed. Atmospheric particles from Hyytiälä required higher diethylene glycol (DEG) supersaturation to be activated compared to metal particles (standard calibration particles) and other types of particles. This suggests that chemical composition differences introduce measurement uncertainties and highlights the importance of in situ calibration. The size resolution of PSM 2.0 was characterized using metal particles. The maximum size resolution was observed at 2–3 nm. PSM 2.0 was then operated in Hyytiälä for ambient particle measurements in parallel with a Half Mini differential mobility particle sizer (DMPS). During new particle formation (NPF) events, comparable total particle concentrations were observed between the Half Mini DMPS and PSM 2.0 based on Hyytiälä atmospheric particle calibration. Meanwhile, applying the calibration with metal particles to atmospheric measurements caused an overestimation of 3–10 nm particles. In terms of the particle size distributions, similar patterns were observed between the DMPS and PSM when using the calibration of Hyytiälä atmospheric particles. In summary, PSM 2.0 is a powerful instrument for measuring sub-10 nm particles and can achieve more precise particle size distribution measurements with proper calibration."

 The AR6 Scenarios Database is a vital repository of climate change mitigation pathways used in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment cycle. In its current version, many scenarios in the database lack information about the level of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) removal via land sinks, as net-negative CO2 emissions and gross removals on land are not always separated and are not consistently reported across models. This makes scenario analyses focusing on CO2 removal challenging. We test and compare the performance of different regression models to impute missing data on land carbon sequestration for the global level and for several sub-global macro-regions from available data on net CO2 emissions from agriculture, forestry, and other land uses. We find that a k-nearest neighbors regression performs best among the tested regression models and use it to impute and provide two publicly available imputation datasets  (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13373539, Prütz et al., 2024) on CO2 removal via land sinks for incomplete global scenarios (n=404) and incomplete regional R10 scenario variants (n=2358) of the AR6 Scenarios Database.

Each SIC map is given in a 6.25 km polar stereographic grid and is catalogued into one of the 12 regions of the Arctic Ocean. This dataset was produced to be used as a reference in the validation of various SIC products. 
 The decline in Arctic sea ice in the global warming era has received much attention as a contributing factor to the changes in the weather and climate in the Arctic and beyond. The coverage of Arctic sea ice (i.e. sea ice concentration (SIC)) has been monitored since 1972 using satellite passive microwave (PMW) measurements because of their extensive coverage and all-weather capability. However, the fundamental basis of algorithms for estimating SIC has not improved much since the early days due to the lack of reference SIC data, leading to discrepancies between existing PMW SIC algorithms. To overcome this issue, this study aims to construct data records of reference SIC over Arctic sea ice using 30 m resolution imagery from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on board Landsat-8. In order to collect relatively bright and clear scenes, thresholds of solar elevation >15° and cloud cover <10 % were applied in this study. Clouds in each Landsat-8 scene were masked using the cloud-masking array provided in Landsat data. Due to the poor accuracy of the cloud-masking array over ice-covered surface types, an additional step of visually inspecting the state of the cloud mask using the true-colour image was designated in this study. Each Landsat-8 scene was sorted into four categories depending on the state of the cloud mask. The normalized difference snow index and OLI band-5 reflectivity were used to differentiate between ice and open water within each selected Landsat-8 pixel. The classified data were projected onto a 6.25 km polar stereographic grid, and SIC for each grid cell was obtained by counting ice-classified pixels within the grid. SIC was only computed for grid cells where more than 99 % of their area was covered with Landsat-8 pixels to limit the uncertainty in SIC arising from grids that are not fully concentrated with Landsat-8 pixels. Uncertainty in the produced SIC was 1 %–4 %, inferred using the Gaussian error propagation method. Out of 15 286 collected Landsat-8 images, 14 297 images were translated into SIC maps, and a total of 2 934 399 Landsat-8 SIC grid cells were generated. Evaluation of Landsat-8 SIC with SIC from ice charts revealed a good linear relationship (correlation coefficient of 0.96) between the two products, as well as a mean negative bias which fell within the uncertainty range of Landsat-8 SIC. SIC based on Landsat-8 can be used as reference SIC to evaluate existing SIC products, and, thus, one can improve SIC products, as well as use the improved SIC for other applications such as data assimilation and retrieval studies. The vast amount of Landsat-8 SIC generated in this study may also be used to train deep-learning models for the estimation of Arctic SIC coverage. The Landsat-8 SIC dataset can be publicly accessed at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10973297 (Jung et al., 2024), and the Python codes for the production and evaluation of the Landsat-8 SIC dataset are accessible at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12754602 (Jung, 2024)."

The results reveal a significant expansion in cropland, particularly for soybean, leading to a substantial reduction in natural vegetation such as forests and grasslands. The datasets can be used to assess the impacts of cropland expansion on carbon and nitrogen cycles in South America. 
 South America is a global hotspot for land use and land cover (LULC) change, marked by dramatic agricultural land expansion and deforestation. Developing high-resolution, long-term crop-specific data is essential for gaining a deeper understanding of natural-human interactions and addressing the impacts of human activities on regional biogeochemical, hydrological cycles, and climate. In this study, we integrated multi-source data, including high-resolution remote sensing data, model-based data, and historical agricultural census data, to reconstruct the historical dynamics of four major commodity crops (i.e., soybean, maize, wheat, and rice) in South America at annual time scale and 1 km×1 km spatial resolution from 1950 to 2020. The results showed that cropland in South America has expanded rapidly through encroachment into other vegetation over the past 70 years. Specifically, soybean is one of the most dramatically expanded crops, increasing from essentially zero in 1950 to 48.8 Mha in 2020, resulting in a total loss of 23.92 Mha of other vegetation (i.e., forest, pasture/rangeland, and unmanaged grass/shrubland). In addition, the area of maize increased by a factor of 2.1 from 12.7 Mha in 1950 to 26.9 Mha in 2020, while rice and wheat areas remained relatively stable. The newly developed crop type data provide important insights for assessing the impacts of agricultural land expansion on crop production, greenhouse gas emissions, and carbon and nitrogen cycles in South America.

 Small lakes and ponds are hotspots of biodiversity, biogeochemical reactions, and hydrological interactions in the landscape.

It is tested with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with the Noah-Multiparameterization (Noah-MP) land surface model to investigate sea breeze circulation sensitivity to vegetation-related parameters. 
 The accurate calibration of parameters in atmospheric and Earth system models is crucial for improving their performance but remains a challenge due to their inherent complexity, which is reflected in input–output relationships often characterised by multiple interactions between the parameters, thus hindering the use of simple sensitivity analysis methods. This paper introduces the Machine Learning-based Automated Multi-method Parameter Sensitivity and Importance analysis Tool (ML-AMPSIT), a new tool designed with the aim of providing a simple and flexible framework to estimate the sensitivity and importance of parameters in complex numerical weather prediction models. This tool leverages the strengths of multiple regression-based and probabilistic machine learning methods, including LASSO (see the list of abbreviations in Appendix B), support vector machine, classification and regression trees, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, Gaussian process regression, and Bayesian ridge regression. These regression algorithms are used to construct computationally inexpensive surrogate models to effectively predict the impact of input parameter variations on model output, thereby significantly reducing the computational burden of running high-fidelity models for sensitivity analysis. Moreover, the multi-method approach allows for a comparative analysis of the results. Through a detailed case study with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with the Noah-MP land surface model, ML-AMPSIT is demonstrated to efficiently predict the effects of varying the values of Noah-MP model parameters with a relatively small number of model runs by simulating a sea breeze circulation over an idealised flat domain. This paper points out how ML-AMPSIT can be an efficient tool for performing sensitivity and importance analysis for complex models, guiding the user through the different steps and allowing for a simplification and automatisation of the process."

The combined model resolution is about 10–15 km in both the ocean and atmosphere, which makes it one of the finest ever used to complete historical and scenario simulations. This model is compared with two lower-resolution versions, with a 100 km and a 25 km grid. The three models are compared with observations to study the improvements thanks to the increased resolution. 
 We  present the very-high-resolution (VHR) version of the EC-Earth global climate model, EC-Earth3P-VHR, developed for HighResMIP. The model features an atmospheric resolution of ∼16 km and an oceanic resolution of 1/12° (∼8 km), which makes it one of the finest combined resolutions ever used to complete historical and scenario-like CMIP6 simulations. To evaluate the influence of numerical resolution on the simulated climate, EC-Earth3P-VHR is compared with two configurations of the same model at lower resolution: the ∼100 km grid EC-Earth3P-LR (LR) and the ∼25 km grid EC-Earth3P-HR (HR). Of the three configurations, VHR shows the smallest drift in the global mean ocean temperature and salinity at the end of a 100-year 1950s control simulation, which points to a faster equilibrating phase than in LR and HR. In terms of model biases, we compare the historical simulations against observations over the period 1980–2014. In contrast to LR and HR, VHR shows a reduced equatorial Pacific cold tongue bias, an improved Gulf Stream representation with a reduced coastal warm bias and a reduced subpolar North Atlantic cold bias, and more realistic orographic precipitation over mountain ranges. By contrast, VHR shows a larger warm bias and overly low sea ice extent over the Southern Ocean. Such biases in surface temperature have an impact on the atmospheric circulation aloft, connected with a more realistic storm track over the North Atlantic yet a less realistic storm track over the Southern Ocean compared to the lower-resolution model versions. Other biases persist or worsen with increased resolution from LR to VHR, such as the warm bias over the tropical upwelling region and the associated cloud cover underestimation, a precipitation excess over the tropical South Atlantic and North Pacific, and  overly thick sea ice and an excess in oceanic mixing in the Arctic. VHR shows improved air–sea coupling over the tropical region, although it tends to overestimate the oceanic influence on the atmospheric variability at midlatitudes compared to observations and LR and HR. Together, these results highlight the potential for improved simulated climate in key regions, such as the Gulf Stream and the Equator, when the atmospheric and oceanic resolutions are finer than 25 km in both the ocean and atmosphere. Thanks to its unprecedented resolution, EC-Earth3P-VHR offers a new opportunity to study climate variability and change of such areas on regional and local spatial scales, in line with regional climate models."

We systematically analyzed the settling velocities of particles, including different MP sizes and SS concentrations, in a plexiglass column with a camera array. For each experimental variant, we collected data on thousands of individual MPs, strengthening the statistical analysis of the particles’ velocities. Simultaneous measurements of the SS flow and MPs trajectories revealed that the SS induced complex flow patterns, with MPs spending more time in downwelling flow regions, thereby accelerating MPs sedimentation. This effect was more pronounced when SS were aggregated. Additionally, we found that smaller MP fragments were more affected by the fluctuations than spheres or larger fragments. Collectively, our results provide valuable data for future MP fate models and help to understand the sedimentation processes of MPs in natural waters, which is crucial for assessing their environmental transport and impact."

Our results indicated that the DF-O and MPs samples exhibited higher cytotoxicity, inflammatory, and oxidative stress levels than the DF-S samples did. The DF-O and MPs samples suppressed autophagy by decreasing expression levels of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3B), p-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p-PI3K), phosphorylated AKT protein (p-Akt), and p-mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR) while increasing the level of p62. Meanwhile, DF-O and MPs samples induced apoptosis through increasing levels of Bax/Bcl-2 and Cleaved Caspase-3/Caspase-3 in Raw264.7 cells. These trends could be reversed through removing half of the MPs in DF-O. Therefore, dust fall microplastics inhibited autophagy and induced apoptosis via activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, increasing the Bax/Bcl-2 and Cleaved Caspase-3/Caspase-3 ratios. Here we provide a comprehensive perspective into the studies of atmospheric MPs pollution status and mechanisms of inhalation toxicity for health risk assessment of MPs in DF."

Coutelier,Ceres: Organic‐Rich Sites of Exogenic Origin?,"Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid belt, is the only potential ocean world in the inner Solar System. Previous studies identified deposits of aliphatic organics in and around the Ernutet crater, and at small locations at Inamahari and Urvara craters. The origin of organics, either endogenic or exogenic, in these fresh exposures is still under debate. This study addresses the origin of the organics by analyzing their global distribution and geologic context. Our first step involved a global search for organic‐rich sites that might have escaped previous detections. We achieved this by using a deep neural network, utilizing spectral redness in the Dawn's Framing Camera multispectral data to identify potential organic‐rich sites. The identified sites were further studied by using IR spectrometer data to infer the compositions of materials showing spectral redness. Of the newly identified red‐sloped sites, only two can be considered certain to be organic‐rich. We also identified sites with spectral redness, but without any signature of organics in their infrared spectra. These sites could be attributed to the aqueous alteration of magnetite into ferric‐iron bearing phases. At Ernutet, Inamahari, and Urvara, the organic‐rich material is confined to the near surface only. Additionally, the absence of tectonic/volcanic features at these sites makes an endogenic origin questionable. The global rarity of detectable organics also supports this assessment. Consequently, we suggest that organics at these sites were originally delivered by low‐velocity, organic‐rich impactor(s) from the main belt and subsequently excavated, rather than originating from endogenous processes."

 The Amazon forest is fire sensitive, but, where fires were uncommon as a natural disturbance, deforestation and drought are accelerating fire occurrences, which threaten the integrity of the tropical forest, the carbon cycle and air quality. Fire emissions depend on fuel amount and type, moisture conditions and burning behaviour. Higher-resolution satellite data have helped more accurately map global burnt areas; however, the effects of fuels on the combustion process and on the composition of fire emissions remain uncertain in current fire emissions inventories. By using multiple Earth observation-based approaches, here we show that total fire emissions in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes are dominated by smouldering combustion of woody debris.

Here authors show ferroptosis-induced lipid peroxidation enhances injury-triggered phosphatidylserine exposure to promote axonal fusion and enhanced functional restoration. 
 Axonal fusion represents an efficient way to recover function after nerve injury. However, how axonal fusion is induced and regulated remains largely unknown. We discover that ferroptosis signaling can promote axonal fusion and functional recovery in C. elegans in a dose-sensitive manner. Ferroptosis-induced lipid peroxidation enhances injury-triggered phosphatidylserine exposure (PS) to promote axonal fusion through PS receptor (PSR-1) and EFF-1 fusogen. Axon injury induces PSR-1 condensate formation and disruption of PSR-1 condensation inhibits axonal fusion. Extending these findings to mammalian nerve repair, we show that loss of Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a crucial suppressor of ferroptosis, promotes functional recovery after sciatic nerve injury. Applying ferroptosis inducers to mouse sciatic nerves retains nerve innervation and significantly enhances functional restoration after nerve transection and resuture without affecting axon regeneration. Our study reveals an evolutionarily conserved function of lipid peroxidation in promoting axonal fusion, providing insights for developing therapeutic strategies for nerve injury. The induction and regulation of axonal fusion after nerve injury remains poorly understood.

A computational framework for optimal decision-making under uncertainty based on dynamically changing conditions observed in time is developed in response. 
 Climate change-related risk mitigation is typically addressed using cost-benefit analysis that evaluates mitigation strategies against a wide range of simulated scenarios and identifies a static policy to be implemented, without considering future observations. Due to the substantial uncertainties inherent in climate projections, this identified policy will likely be sub-optimal with respect to the actual climate trajectory that evolves in time. In this work, we thus formulate climate risk management as a dynamic decision-making problem based on Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs), taking real-time data into account for evaluating the evolving conditions and related model uncertainties, in order to select the best possible life-cycle actions in time, with global optimality guarantees for the formulated optimization problem. The framework is developed for coastal adaptation applications, considering a wide variety of possible action types, including various forms of nature-based infrastructure. Related environmental impacts of carbon emissions and uptake are also incorporated, and social cost of carbon implications are discussed, together with several future directions and supported features.

 Visualizing mechanical stress distribution in soft and live biomaterials is essential for understanding biological processes and improving material design. However, it remains challenging due to their complexity, dynamic nature, and sensitivity requirements, necessitating innovative techniques. Since polysaccharides are common in various biomaterials, a biosensor integrating a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based tension sensor module and carbohydrate-binding modules (FTSM-CBM) has been designed for real-time monitoring of the stress distribution of these biomaterials. By simple dripping or soaking, FTSM-CBM enables fast, reproducible and semiquantitative detection of both 2D and 3D stress distributions in polysaccharide-based hydrogels. Additionally, it provides valuable information such as microstructure hints and fracture site warnings. FTSM-CBM can also monitor the locomotion of maggots, which is not feasible with most existing techniques. Furthermore, by changing the CBM, FTSM-CBM can be expanded for various polysaccharide-based biomaterials.

 Aerobic and anaerobic organisms and their functions are spatially or temporally decoupled at scales ranging from individual cells to ecosystems and from minutes to hours. This is due to competition for energy substrates and/or biochemical incompatibility with oxygen (O2). Here we report a chemolithotrophic Aquificales bacterium, Hydrogenobacter, isolated from a circumneutral hot spring in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) capable of simultaneous aerobic and anaerobic respiration when provided with hydrogen (H2), elemental sulfur (S0), and O2. Cultivation experiments demonstrated that simultaneous aerobic and anaerobic respiration enhanced growth rates and final cell concentrations when compared to those grown aerobically or anaerobically. Consumption of O2 measured via gas chromatography and detection of transcripts for proteins involved in S0 and O2 reduction in H2/S0/O2-grown cultures confirmed co-occurring aerobic and anaerobic metabolism. This aerobic, S0-reducing metabolism is suggested to provide a competitive advantage in environments where O2 availability is low and variable. Genomic data indicating the prevalence of proteins allowing for this hybrid form of energy metabolism among bacteria and archaea suggest it to be widespread but previously overlooked due to rapid, O2-dependent abiotic oxidation of produced sulfide. These observations challenge existing paradigms of strict delineations between aerobic and anaerobic metabolism.

 The 2023/24 El Niño, emerging after a rare triple-dip La Niña, garnered global attention due to its potential to evolve into an extreme event, given the largest accumulation of warm water in the equatorial western Pacific since 1980. Despite initial expectations, its growth rate unexpectedly decelerated in mid-2023, preventing it from reaching the anticipated intensity. Here, we show through observational analyses that unusual easterly anomalies over the tropical western-central Pacific, persisting after the end of the preceding La Niña, significantly contributed to this slowdown. A prominent east‒west sea surface temperature gradient in the region has been identified as the crucial factor associated with these unusual and persistent easterly anomalies. This temperature gradient is directly attributed to a negative North Pacific Meridional Mode and a deepened thermocline over the Philippine Sea. These findings offer a deeper understanding of the atypical transition from a prolonged multi-year La Niña to an El Niño."

Here, we employ a convection-permitting numerical model to quantify the relative effects of urbanization and climate change on rainfall from ten typhoons across a highly urbanized area in China. We show that climate change is largely responsible for the changes in the spatial pattern and amounts of rainfall from tropical cyclones; on the other hand, urbanization consistently contributes to the redistribution of rainfall, and its positive effects are comparable to those of climate change in the urban core.

 The airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) bathymetry (ALB) system is a promising and effective approach for surveying nearshore bathymetry and underwater terrain. Deep-learning techniques have been developed to reduce waveform superposition in shallow and deep areas. These methods avoid the complex transmission process of laser pulses in the water column and the intricate determination of various parameters and thresholds in traditional ALB methods. However, studies on ALB bathymetry using deep-learning techniques remain insufficient. To improve the accuracy and reliability of nearshore bathymetry, this study proposes deep-learning bathymetry fusing waveform features and spatial-angular field features (DBWSF). This method utilizes the waveform curvature to construct an energy curve, enhancing the waveform's features. Additionally, it employs a Gram angle difference field to convert the temporal waveform into a two-dimensional Gram angle difference field image, increasing the dimensions and quantity of waveform features. Finally, this method constructs a dual-path neural network with an attention mechanism to extract the water surface and bottom waveform signals precisely to achieve nearshore bathymetry. In comparison to sample data, DBWSF exhibited high bathymetric accuracy across three study areas (Ganquan Island, Lingyang Reef, and Dong Island), achieving a root mean squared error of 0.21 m. The R2 in these regions were 99.6 %, 95.1 %, and 99.8 %, respectively. In the above three study areas, compared with the bathymetric results obtained using the waveform decomposition method, DBWSF was more accurate, with improvements in RMSE of 0.33, 0.27, and 0.04 m.

 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) techniques are commonly used approach for identifying Slow-moving Landslide (SML). However, most SML boundary identification with deep learning are based on single-source InSAR data, which cannot fully explore the dynamic process of destabilization, and are inefficient due to high model complexity. Meanwhile, research on automatic procession with multi-source InSAR data is few. To enhance efficiency in geohazard monitoring, this paper proposed an automatic framework for Boundary-Changed Slow-moving Landslide (BCSML) detection by integrating multi-source Small Baseline Subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and change detection methodologies. Firstly, surface deformation was estimated using multi-source SBAS-InSAR.

Finally, BCSMLs were identified using a change detection approach based on newly defined geometric measurements.

The proposed Light-U2Net model achieves high Precision (80.1 %), Recall (80.2 %), and F1-scores (80.1 %) in Zayu County. Additionally, the model’s complexity has reduced by 42.4 % without compromising identification accuracy compared to the original model.

 Multibeam sounding is a high-precision remote sensing method for seabed detection. Seabed topography classification is crucial for marine science research, resource exploration and engineering. When using multibeam data for seabed topography automatic classification, the fuzzy boundaries of different topographic entities, redundancy of multimodal data, and the lack of geological knowledge guidance have led to low classification accuracy. Thus, a knowledge graph-guided vision mamba seabed topography classification network (CUG-STCN) was constructed, consisting of three modules: (1) The long sequence modeling mamba-based encoder addresses the fuzzy seabed topography boundary.

 Dividing a forest point cloud dataset into tiles is a common practice in point cloud processing (e.g., individual tree segmentation), aimed at addressing memory constraints and optimizing processing efficiency. Existing methods typically utilize automatic regular clipping (e.g., rectangular clipping), which tends to result in splitting tree crowns along the cutting lines. To preserve the completeness of tree crowns within predefined clipping boundaries (e.g., rectangles), we develop a tree crown edge-aware (E-A) point cloud clipping algorithm, named E-A algorithm. Firstly, the crown edge and distance features are enhanced and quantified using mathematical morphology and nearest neighbor pixel methods. Then, these two features are linearly weighted and integrated for cutting line detection. Finally, the optimal cutting lines are detected by exploring a set of edges with the minimum sum of integrated feature values. E-A algorithm was tested with airborne LiDAR point clouds collected from China’s Saihanba Forest Farm, comparing it against regular clipping methods. The results indicate that E-A algorithm can automatically and effectively emphasize preserving tree crown completeness within predefined clipping boundaries.

 The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) radiometer can provide dependable ocean wind measurements for tropical cyclones (TCs), almost without being affected by rain.

Spanning 663 TC scenes, the dataset covers all storm intensity categories that have occurred in the northern Hemisphere during 2015–2022, and includes 93 cases where stepped frequency microwave radiometer (SFMR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements are coincident, within 30 min. SMAP-estimated TC metrics are then comprehensively compared with best-track reports, and when available, SFMR and SAR observations. For collocated SFMR and SAR measurements, the average differences for storm center locations are approximately 36 and 51 km, respectively. The root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) between SMAP-estimated TC intensities and those obtained from SFMR and SAR are 6.18 and 7.51 m/s, respectively. For wind radii, the RMSEs are 42.93 km (R34), 35.96 km (R50) and 32.23 km (R64), respectively. In addition, the average difference between our model and best-track reported TC center locations is 49.2, 32.4 and 23.5 km for tropical storms, category 1–2 storms, and major storms, respectively. The RMSE between SMAP-estimated storm intensities and best track reports is 6.82 m/s. For wind radii, the RMSE values are 47.16 km(R34), 34.94 km (R50) and 21.25 km (R64), respectively."
