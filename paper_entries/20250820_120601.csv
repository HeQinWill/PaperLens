10.1088/1748-9326/ade904,False,Environmental Research Letters,该论文主要关注城市水系统的循环经济，探讨在水资源短缺地区，如何通过减少淡水取用来适应气候变化，降低用水风险。论文构建了一个模拟模型，评估了泄漏减少、需求降低、饮用水回用和海水淡化等措施对减少原水取用和系统成本的影响。虽然水资源管理与环境有一定的关联，但该论文的核心内容与大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等，没有直接关系。,[],Dale Whittington;Maya Chandrasekaran,The economics of a circular urban water system,"In many water-scarce locations, cities will need to reduce their freshwater withdrawals in order to adapt to the changing climatic conditions of the Anthropocene, reduce the risks of ‘Day Zeros,’ and reduce the disruption to the global hydrological cycle. This paper shows that it is possible for water utilities to make dramatic reductions in raw water withdrawals without proportionally large increases in system-wide costs. A simulation model is built that characterizes the piped water and wastewater network of an urban water utility in a hypothetical high-income city and the costs at nodes and links of the system. This simulation model is used to estimate the effects of four interventions—leakage reduction, demand reduction, potable reuse, and desalination—on raw water withdrawals and system-wide costs. We illustrate the effects of both individual interventions and policy mixes. Compared to the assumed baseline urban water and sanitation system, policy mixes can reduce raw water withdrawals by 74% with only modest increases in system-wide costs."

Denmark has combated this challenge from mid-1980 by implementing effective national N regulation of agriculture. Further reduction is needed to meet legislative objectives, and more targeted farm-level regulation schemes are under development. Assessing the necessary farm-level reduction of agricultural N losses to the aquatic environment such as groundwater requires detailed knowledge of denitrification in the groundwater system. In this paper we demonstrate how determinations of the extent of the anoxic nitrate-reducing zone and associated denitrification rates can be done by combined use of national and local level multiscreen groundwater monitoring data representing different agro-hydrogeochemical conditions across Denmark. A new concept for evaluating groundwater denitrification both nationally and locally is presented. The new concept relies on the assessment of nitrate trends in oxic and anoxic nitrate-reducing groundwater using up to 35 years of groundwater monitoring data on nitrate content and groundwater age, dated with CFC or the 3H/3He method. The results from the anoxic nitrate-reducing zone indicate that the probability of denitrification increases with groundwater residence time. On average, the national level assessment shows that in the anoxic nitrate-reducing zone approximately 47% of the nitrate is being denitrified while in the local areas the assessments show variation between 14%–59%, and estimations of denitrification rates range from 0.008–0.032 µmol l−1 day−1. Results show that the variation in the thickness of the anoxic nitrate-reducing zone can be up to 16 m, indicating that the denitrification rates can vary from very fast (thin zone or sharp interface) to slow (thick zone) in a homogenous aquifer layer with the same magnitude of residence time. These results are important for groundwater modeling of nitrate transport from agricultural fields to streams and coastal areas through the groundwater system."

However, the role of these projects in facilitating a just transition for fossil fuel-dependent communities remains debated and uncertain. This study combines focus groups across three Gulf Coast sites with state-wide surveys in Texas and Louisiana to lend insights on community perspectives on DAC. Focus groups offer rich, qualitative insights into local concerns and aspirations, while the surveys provide broader quantitative data on regional attitudes. We find that DAC may be difficult to extract from the entrenched power of the fossil fuel industry and presents a need for careful planning to avoid social and economic upheaval in the wake of industrial transition. Community perceptions emphasize a dual nature of the fossil fuel industry: providing economic stability while also contributing to environmental and health injustices. While DAC emerges as a potential solution, requiring shared skillsets with the fossil fuel industry, community members express reservations about industry risks and historical lack of community engagement. Our findings underscore the importance of community involvement in decision-making (including when not to build), cooperative ownership models, and transparent processes. Both qualitative and quantitative results illustrate that community support for DAC is conditional on broader socio-economic benefits and inclusive governance, highlighting the need to consider these factors alongside technological features when planning DAC deployment in the region."

However, quantifying global groundwater withdrawals remains a significant challenge due to inherent uncertainties in input data, sectoral allocation assumptions, and model parameterization. In this study, we analyze global groundwater withdrawals from 2001 to 2020 using a newly developed data-driven Global Groundwater Withdrawal (GGW) model and quantify uncertainties through Monte Carlo simulations. The GGW model integrates reported country-level data with global grid-based datasets to estimate annual withdrawals across domestic, industrial, and agricultural sectors at a 0.1° resolution (≈10 km). Our results indicate an average global groundwater withdrawal of 648 km3 a−1, with an uncertainty range of 465–881 km3 a−1. Agriculture accounts for 50% of total withdrawals, followed by domestic use at 34.5% and industrial use at 15.5%. Temporal analysis shows increasing groundwater withdrawal in 66% of the 44 IPCC WGI reference regions over the 20 years, with a global average annual increase of 0.5% (varying regionally from 6.5% annual increase to 9% annual decrease). Comparison with previous studies highlights the impact of methodological choices and assumptions about groundwater withdrawal on the resulting global estimates. Our findings underscore the need for comprehensive uncertainty assessments and improved datasets. Expanding spatial coverage in underrepresented regions and enhancing temporal resolution, particularly for dynamic variables like irrigated areas, are crucial for more accurate groundwater withdrawal assessments. These improvements will enable better management and conservation of this vital resource in the face of growing global demands and climate change impacts."

Perceptions of the roles of diverse actors in addressing climate change,"Understanding how different actors perceive their own and others’ roles in addressing climate change is critical to promoting societal-wide climate action. Yet, most studies focused on the perceptions held by the general population. We extended previous work by examining a unique sample of government, business, and resident representatives. We assessed the extent to which these three groups perceive different actors as responsible, capable, and likely to take climate action, as well as their own responsibility, capacity, and likelihood to act as residents or employees, respectively. We found that Dutch residents and representatives from governments and businesses believe that most societal actors are not doing enough and that the government and businesses are most responsible and capable of taking climate action. Compared to Dutch residents, however, representatives from governments and particularly businesses reported that they have relatively low responsibility and capacity to act. This discrepancy highlights the need to empower different actors, particularly professionals (i.e. from governments and businesses), to fulfill their roles in achieving climate goals. We discuss the scientific and practical implications of better understanding the perspectives of diverse actors and identifying ways to leverage their potential contributions to collective climate progress."

In large-scale water quality (WQ) models the effects are, however, associated with uncertainties that may differ in space and time but are hardly studied worldwide and for multiple pollutants simultaneously. Moreover, explicit ways to assess climate-driven uncertainties in large-scale multi-pollutant assessments are currently limited. Here, we aim to build trust in future river exports of nutrients (i.e. nitrogen and phosphorus), plastics (i.e. micro and macroplastics), and chemicals (i.e. diclofenac and triclosan) under climate-driven hydrological changes on the sub-basin scale worldwide. We used a soft-coupled global hydrological (VIC) and WQ (MARINA-Multi) model system, driven by five Global Climate Models (GCMs), to quantify river exports of selected pollutants to seas for 2010 and 2050 under an economy-driven and high global warming scenario. Subsequently, we developed and applied a new approach to build trust in projected future trends in coastal water pollution for the selected pollutants. Results reveal that in arid regions, such as the Middle East, East Asia, and Northern Africa, climate-driven uncertainties play a key role in future river exports of pollutants. For African sub-basins, high increases in river exports of pollutants are projected by 2050 under climate-driven hydrological uncertainty. Nevertheless, over 80% of the global sub-basin areas agree on the direction of change in future river exports of individual pollutants for at least three GCMs. Multi-pollutant agreements differ among seas: 53% of the area agrees on increasing river exports of six pollutants into the Indian Ocean by 2050, whereas 17% agrees on decreasing trends for the Mediterranean Sea. Our study indicated that even under climate-driven hydrological uncertainties, large-scale WQ models remain useful tools for future WQ assessments. Yet, awareness and transparency of modelling uncertainties are essential when utilising model outputs for well-informed actions."

Current options for such inventories are limited, being either spatially precise but economically bounded sector-specific or owner-specific datasets, or gridded gross domestic product (GDP) products with coarse spatial resolution and inadequate sectoral resolution. To address these limitations, we develop a map of national GDP with high spatial and sectoral resolution. We stress this with meter-scale flood hazard maps to characterize GDP at risk from flooding. We further couple this to a macroeconomic input–output analysis to use the new sectoral resolution to estimate the scope of indirect economic exposure to flood at a national scale."

Sustainable forest management practices through forest thinning could reduce the impact of wildfires and provide lumber for wood-based, long-lived, and low-carbon building materials. This study explores the potential for harvesting biomass in California (CA) to mitigate wildfire risk and provide multi-decade carbon storage in the form of cross-laminated timber (CLT) for use in buildings. First, we assessed biomass resource availability, finding that the total live hardwood and live softwood available in the wildland-urban interfaces (WUIs) across CA sums to 14.1 million metric tons (MMT) and 34.9 MMT, respectively, which contains the equivalent of 90 MMT of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Then, we conducted a life cycle assessment of CLT considering softwood and hardwood sources to provide insights into emissions and energy demand associated with utilization of the wood removed for wildfire risk management. We found that the net life cycle carbon footprint of live hardwood and softwood when including biogenic carbon storage/emissions is 414 and 317 kg CO2e/m3 CLT, respectively. To incorporate the timing of these emissions and uptake, we have also conducted a cradle-to-grave time-dependent global warming potential (GWP) analysis. The time-adjusted GWP for live hardwood and live softwood is −227 and −104 kg CO2e/m3 CLT, respectively. In terms of total CLT production potential, 0.03 and 0.005 million m3 CLT can be sourced from live softwood and hardwood, respectively, in WUI on gentle slopes in CA. The resulting insights and approaches from this study are broadly applicable to other forested regions and WUIs across the US and the world, and provide a holistic approach to use forest thinning as a wildfire mitigation strategy in combination with a novel approach for life cycle assessment of building materials with a limited dataset."

This paper investigates the individual and combined impacts of water availability, heat, population growth, income dynamics, and technological advancements on global groundwater stress over a historical period from 1997 to 2017. Utilizing the gridded Simplified International Model of agricultural Prices, Land use, and the Environment (SIMPLE-G), the study attributes local changes in water and land use patterns to these key global drivers. Furthermore, it evaluates an alternative, counterfactual scenario in which sustainable management interventions for groundwater resources are implemented over these two historical decades. The analysis quantifies the historical contribution of each global change driver to local groundwater stress and measures the economic benefits of a scenario in which groundwater extraction caps and improved technology adoption began in 1997. We find that implementing a groundwater extraction cap combined with irrigation investment beginning in 1997 could have reduced global groundwater withdrawals by more than 34% by 2017, preserving over 5 trillion cubic meters of groundwater in aquifers, with the greatest reductions occurring in South Asia and the Western United States.

Despite their importance for climate mitigation and adaptation planning, the response of TC activity to carbon dioxide removal (CDR) has received limited attention. Here, we examine the influence of CDR on TC activity over the western North Pacific (WNP) using an Earth system model under an idealized CDR scenario. Our results show that the WNP-mean genesis potential index (GPI) does not exhibit hysteresis between the ramp-down (model years 249–279) and ramp-up (model years 0–30) periods. This lack of hysteresis is attributed to a regionally asymmetric GPI hysteresis, characterized by a west–east dipolar pattern. The dipole is primarily driven by changes in vertical wind shear associated with a weakened Walker circulation, which is in turn linked to hysteresis in El Niño-like sea surface temperature patterns. Additional simulations using a higher-resolution atmospheric model confirm these findings, revealing no significant change in the number of TCs over the WNP between the two periods. However, a notable 20.11% decrease in TC landfall frequency in East Asia is identified, attributed to reduced TC genesis over the western part of the WNP between the two periods. These results suggest that CDR could help mitigate TC-related socio-economic risks, particularly in East Asia."

This study aims to investigate the social factors influencing the generation and recycling rate of HSW and HPW in urban Japan. Using panel data from 105 cities across the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020, we conducted an actual situation analysis and stepwise multiple regression analysis. Social factors were categorized into demographic (age, gender, income) and non-demographic factors, including economic, infrastructure-related, and HPW-related policy indicators. The actual situation analysis revealed a rise in HPW and stagnant recycling rates in Japan. Regression results confirmed several previous findings, such as older people generating less HSW and recycling more, and positive correlations between economic indicators and recycling rates. Novel findings include: (1) people aged 20–29 and those with higher incomes generate less HSW but more HPW; (2) females are negatively linked to recycling, possibly due to shifting gender roles; (3) higher power generation efficiency of incinerator facilities is statistically associated with higher HPW generation and lower HPW recycling, suggesting a structural trade-off in cities that focus on energy recovery rather than recycling HPW; (4) HPW-related policy indicators significantly improved both HSW and HPW performance. These findings highlight the complexity of urban waste management. By integrating both HSW and HPW dimensions and incorporating underexplored indicators, this study deepens understanding of localized HSW dynamics and offers targeted recommendations for enhancing municipal recycling systems in Japan."

 Aerosol–cloud interaction (ACI) significantly influences global and regional weather and is a critical focus in numerical weather prediction (NWP), but subgrid-scale ACI effects are often overlooked. Here, a subgrid-scale ACI mechanism is implemented by explicitly treating cloud microphysics in the KFeta convective scheme with real-time size-resolved hygroscopic aerosol activation and introducing subgrid-scale cloud radiation feedback in an atmospheric chemistry model, CMA_Meso5.1/CUACE. With a focus on summer over central and eastern China, the performance evaluation shows that this developed model with subgrid-scale cloud microphysics and radiation feedback refines cloud representation, even in some grid-scale unsaturated areas, and subsequently leads to attenuated surface downward shortwave radiation (∼ 18.5 W m−2) that is more realistic. The increased cloud radiative forcing results in lower temperature (∼ 0.35 °C) and higher relative humidity (∼ 2.5 %) at 2 m, with regional mean bias (MB) decreasing by ∼ 40 % and ∼ 18.1 %. Temperature vertical structure and relative humidity below ∼ 900 hPa are improved accordingly due to cooling and humidifying. The underestimated precipitation is enhanced, especially at the grid scale, thus reducing regional MB by ∼ 34.4 % (∼ 1.1 mm). The performance differences between various subregions are related to convective conditions and model local errors. Additionally, compared to simulations with anthropogenic emissions turned off, subgrid-scale actual aerosol inhibits cumulative precipitation during a typical heavy rainfall event by ∼ 4.6 mm, aligning it with observations, associated with lower autoconversion at the subgrid scale and less available water vapor for grid-scale condensation, suggesting competition between subgrid- and grid-scale cloud. This study contributes to the understanding of the impact of subgrid-scale ACI on NWP."

This study provides a first quantitative source analysis of ON aerosol and valuable observational evidence of secondary ON aerosol formation through NH3 and NOx chemistries. 
 Nitrogenous organic aerosol (OA) has a significant effect on solar radiation, human health, and ecosystems. However, our knowledge of the total budget of aerosol organic nitrogen (ON) and its major sources, particularly the secondary formation processes, remains largely qualitative. In this study, we conducted bihourly measurements of aerosol ON and a comprehensive array of organic and inorganic source markers in urban Shanghai during the fall–winter period of 2021. ON accounted for 6 %–58 % of the total aerosol N, averaging 20 %. Positive factorization matrix source apportionment revealed that both primary emissions (52 %) and secondary formations (48 %) made substantial contributions to the ON mass. Dominant primary ON sources included coal combustion and vehicle emissions, accounting for 21 % each. Five significant secondary formation processes involving ON formation were identified, namely, nitrate formation (14 %), photochemical formation (10 %), nitroaromatics formation (7 %), dicarboxylic acids (DCA) formation (8 %), and oxygenated cooking OA (7 %). DCA formation-related ON probably represented reduced N-containing organic species such as imidazoles and amides. Nitrate formation processes produced OA with a very low organic carbon-to-ON ratio, suggesting a heterogeneous/aqueous formation of organic nitrates. Our fieldwork provides first quantitative source analysis and new insights into the secondary formation processes of ON aerosols in an urban atmosphere."

Wiltink;Hartwig Deneke;Chiel C. van Heerwaarden;Jan Fokke Meirink,Evaluating parallax and shadow correction methods for global horizontal irradiance retrievals from Meteosat SEVIRI,"Global horizontal irradiance retrievals from satellite observations are affected by spatial displacements due to parallax and cloud shadows. We assess different approaches to correct for these displacements and quantify their added value by comparison with a network of ground-based pyranometer observations. The corrections are found to become increasingly important at higher spatial resolutions and are most relevant for variable cloud types. 
 Satellite-derived global horizontal irradiance (GHI) is an excellent data source for nowcasting solar power generation and validating weather and climate models. To obtain a good match between satellite-derived GHI and surface observations of GHI,  precise geolocation of the satellite GHI is an essential factor in addition to the accuracy of the retrieval. The geolocation of satellite retrievals is affected by parallax, a displacement between the actual and apparent position of a cloud, as well as by a displacement between the actual position of a shadow and the retrieved position of the shadow, which, due to the one-dimensional (1D) radiative transfer assumption, is directly below the cloud.  This study evaluates different approaches to correcting Meteosat Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) retrievals for parallax and cloud shadow displacements using ground-based observations from a unique network of 99 pyranometers deployed during the HD(CP)2 Observational Prototype Experiment (HOPE) field campaign in Jülich, Germany, in 2013. The first method provides geometric corrections for the displacements calculated using retrieved cloud top heights (Hc). The second method relies on empirical collocation shifting. Here, the collocation shift of the satellite grid is determined by maximizing the correlation between the satellite retrievals and ground-based observations. This optimum shift is determined either based on daily or time-step-averaged correlations. The time-step-averaged collocation shift correction generally yields the most accurate results, but a major drawback of this method is its reliance on ground measurements. The geometric correction, which does not have this disadvantage, achieves the most accurate results if a combined parallax and shadow correction is performed. It reduces the GHI root mean square error (RMSE) by 11.7 W m−2 (10.8 %) compared to the uncorrected retrieval.  Separate parallax or shadow corrections do not reach this level of accuracy. In fact, depending on the cloud regime, they may even increase the error compared to the uncorrected retrieval. In some cases, particularly when multilevel clouds are present, the retrieval accuracy improves if the geometric correction is based on a reduced Hc. Finally, it is demonstrated that GHI becomes increasingly sensitive to the applied correction at higher spatial resolutions, especially for variable cloud regimes. This has important implications for the retrieval accuracy of the current generation of geostationary satellites with spatial resolutions down to 500 m."

Here, we measured fluorescent bio-aerosols in the Finnish sub-Arctic with a high time resolution. A data set that might improve our understanding of biosphere–cloud interactions and the dynamics of bio-aerosols in the atmosphere. 
 Fluorescent aerosol particles (FAPs), as a fraction of total aerosol particles (TAPs), were measured online with a Wideband Integrated Bioaerosol Sensor 5/NEO (WIBS, Droplet Measurement Technologies) from mid-September to mid-December during the Pallas Cloud Experiment 2022 (PaCE22) at the station of Sammaltunturi, located in the sub-Arctic region of Finnish Lapland. The WIBS measures particle size distributions from 0.5 to 30 µm and fluorescence in three channels of single aerosol particles, as well as particle concentrations. Since biological aerosol particles can exhibit intrinsic fluorescence, FAP concentration can be used as a proxy for primary biological aerosol particles (PBAPs) like bacteria, fungal spores and pollen. The concentrations and size distributions of different fluorescent particles, together with meteorological data and air mass trajectories, allow valuable insights into the emission of PBAPs from northern boreal forests and their dynamic in the atmosphere. We found a clear seasonal trend for most FAP types and a strong, sudden decrease in concentration after the surrounding ground is covered in snow. Caution should be taken in interpreting the data as interference may be introduced by non-biological fluorescent particles like secondary organic aerosols or soot, as well as biological secondary organic aerosols.

Using data from 3746 rain gauges, 11 precipitation-related variables, and advanced machine learning methods, we created a daily precipitation dataset spanning 1960–2023 with unprecedented accuracy. Compared to existing datasets, it better captures rainfall events while reducing false alarms. This work provides a reliable tool for studying water resources, climate change, and disaster management. 
 Precipitation is a critical driver of the water cycle, profoundly influencing water resources, agricultural productivity, and natural disasters. However, existing gridded precipitation datasets exhibit markable deficiencies in capturing the spatial autocorrelation and associated environmental and climatic influences – here referred to collectively as precipitation-related covariates – that limit their accuracy, particularly in regions with sparse meteorological stations. To address these challenges, this study proposes a completely new gridded precipitation generation scheme that integrates long-term daily observations from 3746 gauges with 11 key precipitation-related covariates. Building upon the improved inverse distance weighting interpolation method used in our previous dataset CHM_PRE V1, we integrated a machine learning algorithm – light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) – to incorporate precipitation-related covariates in a data-driven manner. This integration allows for a more comprehensive characterization of precipitation patterns, jointly capturing spatial autocorrelation and covariate-based variability. By this novel scheme, a new high-precision, long-term, daily gridded precipitation dataset for the Chinese mainland (CHM_PRE V2) was developed. Validation against 63 397 high-density gauges demonstrated that CHM_PRE V2 significantly outperforms existing gridded precipitation datasets. Specifically, it achieves a mean absolute error of 1.48 mm d−1 and a Kling-Gupta efficiency of 0.88, representing improvements of 12.84 % and 12.86 %, respectively, compared to the previously optimal dataset. Regarding precipitation event detection, CHM_PRE V2 achieved a Heidke skill score of 0.68 and a false alarm ratio of 0.24, surpassing the previously optimal dataset by 17.24 % and 29.17 %, respectively. These results demonstrate that CHM_PRE V2 markedly enhances precipitation measurement accuracy, reduces overestimation of precipitation events, and provides a reliable foundation for hydrological modeling and climate assessments. This dataset features a resolution of 0.1°, spans from 1960 to 2023, and will be updated annually.

Hauglustaine;Frédéric Chevallier;Grégoire Broquet;Dylan B. Millet;Kelley C. Wells;Jinghui Lian;Bo Zheng,Global biogenic isoprene emissions 2013–2020 inferred from satellite isoprene observations,"We present the first global, multi-year maps of monthly isoprene emissions (2013–2020) derived from satellite isoprene observations, averaging 456 TgC yr-1. The dataset reveals two emission peaks linked to 2015–2016 El Niño and 2019–2020 extreme heat events, driven mainly by tropical regions such as the Amazon. It highlights the region-specific sensitivity of biogenic isoprene emissions to temperature anomalies, providing new insights into their roles in air quality and climate feedbacks. 
 Isoprene, the most emitted biogenic volatile organic compound, exerts a remarkable influence on atmospheric oxidation capacity, air quality, and climate. Most existing top-down atmospheric estimates of isoprene emissions rely on observational formaldehyde (HCHO) as an indirect proxy, introducing substantial uncertainties due to complex and nonlinear chemical pathways. Recent advances in satellite retrievals of isoprene concentrations from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) enable a direct constraint on isoprene emission inversions. Yet global, multi-year isoprene-based atmospheric inversions are still lacking. Here, we present global, monthly biogenic isoprene emission maps spanning 2013–2020, derived from a mass-balance inversion framework that assimilates CrIS-retrieved isoprene columns into the LMDZ-INCA chemistry–transport model. The global biogenic isoprene emissions average is of 456 ± 200 TgC yr-1 over 2013–2020, which is broadly consistent with existing inventories and HCHO-based inversion estimates. The LMDZ-INCA simulations using this estimate of the emissions exhibit improved spatial agreement and reduced biases relative to two independent satellite HCHO retrieval products and to surface observations, confirming the robustness of this inversion framework. The seasonal cycle of emissions is dominated by the Northern Hemisphere, driven by the strong seasonality in temperature and vegetation biomes. Interannually, emissions vary by on average 14 TgC yr-1 (1-sigma standard deviation). Two major emission peaks are found in 2015–2016 (456 TgC yr-1) and 2019–2020 (478 TgC yr-1), coinciding with El Niño and widespread extreme heat-wave events, underscoring the dominant influence of temperature anomalies that increase biogenic emissions. Regional analyses identify the Amazon as the largest contributor to the interannual variability, accounting for 22.3 % of the global interannual variance in isoprene emissions. Temperature emerges as the primary driver of regional interannual emissions, with its influence modulated by leaf area index, precipitation, and radiation to varying degrees across regions. As one of the earliest attempts at a global, multi-year inversion based on isoprene observations, this dataset provides input for air quality and climate-chemistry models. The isoprene emission dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16214776 (Hui et al., 2025)."

The simulations also serve as a basis for identifying parameters of the model that are most plausible to explain observed data. This research has been done to showcase the capabilities of isogeometric analysis in solving higher-order problems in geoscientific applications. 
 This paper presents methods from isogeometric finite-element analysis for numerically solving problems in geoscience involving partial differential equations. In particular, we consider the numerical simulation of shells and plates in the context of isostasy. Earth's lithosphere is modeled as a thin elastic shell or plate floating on the asthenosphere and subject to topographic loads. We demonstrate the computational methods on the isostatic boundary value problem posed on selected geographic locations. For Europe, the computed lithospheric depression is compared with available Mohorovičić depth data. We also perform parameter identification for the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere, the rock density, and the topographic load that are most plausible to explain the measured depths. An example of simulating the entire lithosphere of the Earth as a spherical shell using multi-patch isogeometric analysis is presented, providing an alternative to spherical harmonics for solving partial differential equations on a spherical domain. The numerical results serve to showcase the features and capabilities of isogeometric methods rather than to provide insightful predictions since a fairly simple model is used for the loading of the lithosphere."

In this study, we introduce a rolling AI-based method for modeling global significant wave height. Our model achieves accuracy comparable to traditional numerical methods while significantly improving speed, making it operable on standard laptops. This work demonstrates AI's potential to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of global wave modeling. 
 Significant wave height (SWH) is crucial for many human activities, such as marine navigation, offshore operations, and coastal management. Traditionally, SWH is modeled using numerical wave models, which, while accurate, are computationally intensive and constrained by incomplete physical representations of wave spectral evolution. This study introduces a simple global deep-learning-based model for SWH, which uses the current SWH field and the wind field at the next time step as inputs to predict the SWH field at the next time step. This approach mirrors the rolling prediction strategy of numerical wave models. After training on a reanalysis dataset, the errors of the model accumulate lightly with time when given a good initial field because no spectral information is used. However, after accumulating for ∼ 200 h, the errors stabilize, remaining comparable to those of state-of-the-art numerical wave models. Additionally, the error accumulation can be mitigated through the assimilation of altimeter measurements. This deep learning model can not only serve as an efficient surrogate for traditional numerical wave models with respect to SWH but also provide a baseline for statistical modeling of global SWH due to its simplicity in inputs and outputs."

Sutton,A dynamical process-based model for quantifying global agricultural ammonia emissions – AMmonia–CLIMate v1.0 (AMCLIM v1.0) – Part 2: Livestock farming,"A special model called AMmonia–CLIMate (AMCLIM) has been developed to understand and calculate NH3 emissions from livestock farming. It is estimated that about 30 % of excreted N from livestock is lost due to NH3 emissions from housing, manure management and land application of manure. High NH3 volatilization often occurs in hot regions, while poor management practices also result in significant N losses through NH3 emissions. 
 Agricultural ammonia (NH3) emissions are a major pathway of nitrogen loss, which can have significant environmental consequences, such as air and water pollution, ecosystem damage, and biodiversity loss. Ammonia emissions related to livestock farming are major sources in the agricultural sector, resulting from animal housing, manure management and land application. This paper is the second part of the description of the AMmonia–CLIMate (AMCLIM) model, presenting the development and application of all three main modules to estimate NH3 emissions from livestock, including pigs, poultry (chickens), cattle, sheep and goats. The AMCLIM model simulates the flows of N species at different stages of livestock agriculture. It incorporates the effects of environmental factors and also provides an adequate level of detail for the representation of human management practices. According to simulations by AMCLIM, it is estimated that NH3 emissions from global livestock farming are about 29.9 Tg N yr−1, accounting for around 30 % of total excreted nitrogen. Cattle and buffalo systems are estimated to be the largest sources of NH3 emissions, contributing over 60 % of total livestock emissions. Both pig and poultry systems result in more than 15 % of estimated total emissions, while sheep and goats are responsible for the remaining 7 %. High volatilization rates frequently occur in hot regions, indicating the climate-dependence of NH3 volatilization. It is also shown how AMCLIM can simulate the influence of management practices on NH3 volatilization, e.g. illustrating how fully enclosed animal houses with heating and forced ventilation can result in higher emissions than naturally ventilated barns, while poorly managed manure leads to substantially increased NH3 emissions."

The imagers give consistent emission estimates, with EMIT and EnMAP having better sensitivity than PRISMA.

Our estimates exceed the facility-level Climate TRACE inventory by a factor of 1.8, while we only detect emissions from 9 of the inventory’s 20 highest-emitting sites, highlighting the importance of facility-level information. Furthermore, multimonth observations reveal emission patterns potentially linked to facility operations. We estimate that these instruments could detect 35–60% of global landfill emissions, critically expanding on satellite instruments designed for methane and supporting emission mitigation."

However, molecular constraints governing the formation and mobility of OICs within aquifer systems remain inadequately understood. Here, we employed ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry to investigate the molecular fractionation of organic compounds induced by DOM (humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA)) iodination and by the subsequent formation of OICs complexation with Fe oxides under aquifer conditions. The findings demonstrated that FA served as a major source of unsaturated and aromatic DOM, resulting in the generation of 1390 OICs, which markedly exceeded the 240 iodinated products from dissolved HA. The formation of OICs was primarily dominated by the addition reaction, accounting for 47.0% of the total, followed by the substitution reaction at 33.8%. Unlike the substitution of hydrogen atoms with iodine at the C–H bonds, the addition of reactive iodine to C═C bonds in organic compounds could generate new oxygen-containing structures.

We first document how variations of Hg concentrations, Δ199Hg and Δ200Hg isotope signatures in modern soils and loess are controlled by coupled precipitation-vegetation gradients on the CLP, and unaltered by postdepositional processes. Increased precipitation promotes vegetation growth and foliar gaseous elemental Hg uptake, lowering Δ199Hg and Δ200Hg in modern soils and loess. Similar to modern soils and loess, we attribute Hg accumulation and isotope signatures in loess-paleosol deposits to changes in vegetation Hg uptake in response to variation in paleoprecipitation. Both modern and paleo loess and soils suggest faster Δ199Hg changes and Hg accumulation to precipitation under high precipitation conditions (e.g., > 500 mm yr–1) than under arid conditions, reflecting their potential as proxies for pronounced wet and dry climate changes in the CLP. Our results evidence enhanced sequestration of atmospheric Hg emissions in loess soils during interglacial wetter periods.

Complementary scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging revealed morphological changes on the ferrihydrite aggregate surface, supporting IP measurements. Notably, a consistent strong IP response is observed across both the millifluidic and column systems, validating the reproducibility of these measurements under controlled conditions.

The established offline aerosol mass spectrometry (Off-AMS) uses water for extracting airborne particulate filter samples, efficiently detecting water-soluble constituents of organic aerosols (OA), which are prevalent in secondary OA (SOA), oxygenated primary OA (POA), and aged POA. Consequently, sources with substantial water-insoluble fraction may be undetectable via Off-AMS or be subject to increased uncertainties due to the absence of useful markers (e.g., polycyclic aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons). This potentially compromises the investigation of primary and less-aged OA from diverse anthropogenic sources (e.g., traffic, coal combustion, waste burning, tire wear, among others). Here, we present a new analytical method that combines Off-AMS with organic solvent-based sample extraction (termed: SOff-AMS) to extract and quantify both aged and fresh aerosols simultaneously.

The AMS spectra of samples extracted in organic solvents showed significantly increased contributions from OA fragments that are known tracers of fresh and aged emissions. These included small and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and oxygenated and reduced nitrogen-containing fragments that were enhanced over a broad range of factors (1.2–50). A comparison with an online quadrupole aerosol chemical speciation mass spectrometer (Q-ACSM) in Krakow showed highly similar spectra, demonstrating that SOff-AMS-based offline measurements can provide very similar information as the online data. Future SOff-AMS-based source apportionment could identify air pollution sources more comprehensively regardless of sampling locations, particle sizes, and seasonal conditions, especially in complex urban areas with both primary and secondary source contributors."

In this study, we designed and evaluated a novel bioadsorbent, N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG)-modified cellulose (MGMC), for selective B recovery from desalination brine. The adsorption kinetics, isotherms, selectivity, and influence of competing salts were examined, along with B recovery from seawater and simulated desalination brine. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and pH at the point of zero charge (pHPZC) analysis were used to elucidate the adsorption mechanism. MGMC attained rapid adsorption equilibrium within 0.5 h and exhibited a high B adsorption capacity of 1,647 μmol g–1, surpassing commercial adsorbents and most previously reported NMDG-modified derivatives. Moreover, MGMC demonstrated excellent selectivity for B, effectively rejecting diverse metals and oxyanions. Furthermore, it achieved ≥97% B sorption from seawater and simulated brine with shorter contact times and lower dosages than commercial resins. MGMC’s outstanding B selectivity is attributed to the strong coordinated interaction between B and the hydroxy groups in its NMDG-rich structure, further aided by a low pHPZC (6.9). Our findings demonstrate MGMC as a cost-effective and eco-friendly solution for selective B recovery from desalination processes, presenting a promising avenue for sustainable resource management."

While the observed sulfate-to-total-sulfur ratio remained relatively constant at ∼30% in summer, this fraction increased from ∼10% to ∼20% in winter from 2004 to 2013 and then remained at ∼20%. The rise in sulfate-to-total-sulfur ratio resulted in a slower decrease of sulfate in 2004–2013 compared to 2013–2023 despite a greater reduction of SO2 in the earlier decade, reflecting a significant decline in the efficacy of SO2 emission reduction in improving air quality in winter. The decrease in efficacy is attributed to the increased oxidation of SO2 in winter because of the diminishing oversupply of SO2 compared to the availability of atmospheric oxidant, H2O2. Consequently, the seasonal differences in SO2 and sulfate concentrations between summer and winter have narrowed. This chemical damping effect, caused by limited oxidant availability, is likely to delay the reduction in sulfate concentrations in other polluted regions where the transition from coal to natural gas in power plants or alternative energy sources has not progressed as rapidly as in the United States."

Non-targeted analysis (NTA) by liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) is useful in measuring broad chemical space regions. Internal standards are typically used to optimize the selectivity and sensitivity of NTA LC-HRMS methods, assuming a linear relationship between structure and behavior across all analytes. However, this assumption fails for large, heterogeneous chemical spaces, narrowing measurable coverage to structurally similar compounds. We present a data-driven strategy for unbiased sampling of candidate structures for NTA LC-HRMS method development from extensive chemical spaces, such as the U.S. EPA’s CompTox (>1 million chemicals). The workflow maximizes physicochemical/structural diversity using precomputed PubChem descriptors (e.g., molecular weight, XLogP) and grants LC-HRMS compatibility thanks to predicted mobility and ionization efficiency from molecular fingerprints. The resulting measurable compound lists (MCLs) provide broad, heterogeneous coverage for NTA method development, validation, and boundary assessment. Applied to the CompTox space, the approach yielded MCLs with greater chemical coverage and broader predicted LC-HRMS applicability than conventional “watch list” contaminants, offering a robust framework for enhancing NTA’s measurable chemical space while preserving diversity."

Natural and artificial light sources such as sunlight and fluorescence light may influence the emissions of V/VOCs from photocatalytic paints. However, the effect of indoor light sources on nonphotocatalytic paint has not been extensively explored. Here, we conducted laboratory simulations of water-based acrylic paint (WBP) and solvent-based nitrocellulose paint (NP) in indoor air and found that total V/VOC concentrations increased under different lighting conditions, with the highest increase under LED lights, followed by fluorescent and ultraviolet (UV) lights. The temperature increased by around 2 °C during illuminations and promoted the release of V/VOCs. However, our predictions of V/VOC emissions with temperature rise suggested that for both WBP and NP, certain VOC species (e.g., toluene) underwent photodegradation simultaneously under fluorescent and UV lights. Secondary formation of formaldehyde was even observed for NP under the influence of fluorescent or UV lights. These laboratory findings were corroborated by investigations in a newly painted environment.

Here we investigate ocean warming in the EAC southern extension based on simulations from a state‐of‐the‐art high‐resolution global climate model. In the changing climate, the EAC heat transports intensify near the coasts. However, ocean warming is substantially greater offshore than in coastal regions. Heat budget analysis reveals that this pattern is driven by oceanic eddies, which redistribute the inshore EAC heat fluxes off the coast, suppressing coastal warming while enhancing offshore warming. Under global warming, eddies strengthen the cross‐shore warming structure at a rate of 1.6°C/100 km per year per century.

The Fnew of water sampled in surface soils ranged widely, from 0% to 50%, but those fractions typically decreased with depth and converged on values of 0%–20% at depths below 80 cm.

Overall, AR frequency is reduced over the northeastern Pacific and western North America in phases 2–5 of the MJO. However, under LN, increased AR activity appears over those regions in phases 4–6 and across the central North Pacific in Phase 3. Distinct effects of LN on the basic state and MJO contribute to the persistence of AR anomalous patterns in phases 3–6. For instance, MJO intensifies in Phase 3 under LN, favoring the coupling between northeastward integrated water vapor transport (IVT) and the MJO convection over the eastern Indian Ocean. Also, suppressed MJO convection in Phase 4 strengthens and shifts eastwards in LN, affecting the MJO teleconnection linked to North Pacific ARs. The northern Pacific subtropical jet extends northeastward in LN, supporting cyclonic flow over the Gulf of Alaska. The MJO propagates eastward more slowly over the Maritime Continent in LN, favoring a second coupling between eastward IVT and the MJO convection in Phase 5. Decreased AR precipitation and frequency of AR rainfall extremes in phases 2–5 over western North America fade in LN. Furthermore, increased AR precipitation and frequency of AR extremes over the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia intensify and shift from phases 3–4 to 4–6. Therefore, LN has nonlinear effects on the North Pacific MJO‐AR connections and their AR landfalling impacts on western North American precipitation."

 Continued India–Eurasia convergence since the early Palaeogene has led to the formation of the Tibetan Plateau. Yet the primary driving mechanisms of this protracted convergence remain debated, limiting our understanding of continental collision dynamics. Here we provide a holistic quantification of various driving forces to this convergence by integrating high-resolution, plate-boundary-resolving global convection models with observational constraints. Whereas different forces can produce the observed plate motion, we show that the primary driving force can be definitively constrained when Indo-Australian intraplate stress and strain rates are used as constraints in addition to plate motions. Specifically, we identify that the position of the transition in stress orientation within the Indo-Australian plate is highly sensitive to the relative strength of plate-boundary forces. When the plate motion and this stress-orientation transition are fit simultaneously, we find slab pull from Sumatra–Java subduction is the predominant driving force of India–Eurasia convergence with continental collision exerting an overall resisting force and rule out mantle basal drag playing more than a secondary role. We suggest slab pull from adjacent subduction zones has been the primary driver of the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau since its onset and so this may be an exceptional event in Earth’s history.

 Thiazide-type and thiazide-like diuretics are structurally distinct first-line antihypertensive drugs that target the sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC) in the kidney. Thiazide-like diuretics are reported to have better cardioprotective effects than thiazide-type diuretics, but whether this is due to differences in NCC-inhibition mechanisms, if there is any, remains unclear. To understand the molecular mechanisms of NCC inhibition by thiazide-like diuretics, we determine the structures of human NCC (hNCC) bound to two of the most widely used thiazide-like diuretics, chlorthalidone and indapamide, using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Structural analyses reveal shared features and distinctions between NCC-inhibition by thiazide-like and thiazide-type diuretics. Furthermore, structural comparisons allow us to identify polymorphisms in hNCC that have substantial differential effects on the potencies of specific thiazide-like and thiazide-type diuretics.

We demonstrate an on-chip, active wavelength division multiplexer (WDM) operating at THz frequencies (> 1 THz). The WDM architecture is based on an inverse design topology optimization applied to an active quantum cascade heterostructure embedded in a double metal cavity and planarized with a polymer. Such an approach enables the fabrication of a strongly subwavelength device, with a normalized volume of V/λ3 ≃ 0.5. The WDM input is coupled to an integrated THz quantum cascade laser (QCL) frequency comb, providing three 330 GHz broadband output ports, ranging from 2.2 THz–3.2 THz, with a maximum crosstalk of -6 dB. The three ports are outcoupled via integrated broadband patch array antennas enabling surface emission. Such a device can also operate as a stand-alone element, unlocking advanced on-chip signal processing in the THz range.

By applying the readily accessible O-tosyl hydroxamates as nitrogen electrophiles, direct nucleophilic cyanation can be achieved with trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) under mild and transition metal-free conditions. This protocol features excellent functional group tolerance, easy scalability, and broad substrate scope (over 70 examples). Moreover, preliminary experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations support an SN2-type mechanism of this reaction.

Here, Allen et al. show that the obligate intracellular bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi inhibits p53 expression and protects host cells from DNA damage, thus delaying apoptosis and favouring bacterial replication. 
 Infections by intracellular pathogens often cause insult to host cell DNA, which stimulates responses that ultimately eliminate the damaged cell and hence the microbial niche. p53 is an innate immunity mediator that responds to DNA damage and intracellular infection by transcriptionally activating pathways that arrest the cell cycle, repair DNA, and elicit apoptosis. How pathogens counter p53 are incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that the endotheliotropic obligate intracellular bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi blocks transcription of TP53 to nearly deplete p53 levels. Contrary to the unrestricted proliferation expected based on the transcriptome of p53-deficient infected cells, Orientia arrests the cell cycle at S phase to promote bacterial replication. It protects host endothelial cells from DNA damage even if induced by etoposide and delays genotoxic-dependent apoptosis until late in infection once a high bacterial load has been achieved. TP53 downregulation, protection against genotoxicity, and inhibition of DNA damage-dependent apoptosis are executed by the Orientia nucleomodulatory effector, Ank13. Therefore, O. tsutsugamushi inhibits TP53 expression and genotoxicity to reconfigure the intracellular environment of its host cell into one that favors bacterial replication.

 DNA replication stress is a hallmark of cancer that is exploited by chemotherapies. Current assays for replication stress have low throughput and poor resolution whilst being unable to map the movement of replication forks genome-wide. We present a new method that uses nanopore sequencing and artificial intelligence to map forks and measure their rates of movement and stalling in melanoma and colon cancer cells treated with chemotherapies. Our method can differentiate between fork slowing and fork stalling in cells treated with hydroxyurea, as well as inhibitors of ATR, WEE1, and PARP1. These different therapies yield different characteristic signatures of replication stress. We assess the role of the intra-S-phase checkpoint on fork slowing and stalling and show that replication stress dynamically changes over S-phase. Finally, we demonstrate that this method is applicable and consistent across two different flow cell chemistries (R9.4.1 and R10.4.1) from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. This method requires sequencing on only one nanopore flow cell per sample, and the cost-effectiveness enables functional screens to determine how human cancers respond to replication-targeted therapies.

 Wilms tumor (WT), the most common pediatric renal malignancy, exhibits a relatively low mutational burden compared to adult cancers, which hinders the development of targeted therapies. To elucidate the molecular landscape of WT, we perform integrative proteomic, phosphoproteomic, transcriptomic, and whole-exome sequencing analyses of WT and normal kidney tissue adjacent to tumor.

 The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) plays a crucial role in regulating global climate. Although subpolar sea surface temperature (SST) covaries with recent AMOC variability, the relatively short timescales considered by previous studies leave room for doubt on whether subpolar SST reliably represents AMOC state. The same doubt arises for the sea surface salinity (SSS), though freshwater flux into the subpolar North Atlantic (SPNA) affects AMOC stability by regulating salinity. Here, we investigate the relationships of SST and SSS with the AMOC mean states in model simulations conducted for paleoclimate modeling. SPNA SSS aligns well with changes in the AMOC mean state under these scenarios, while SST does not. Notably, climate experiments simulating an abrupt quadrupling of CO2 demonstrate a significant correlation between SPNA SSS and transient AMOC strength. The absence of significant SPNA freshening over the past several decades may imply the AMOC is less fragile than previously postulated, but data remain insufficient to predict its long-term stability."

 Agricultural supply chains increasingly mitigate climate change and biodiversity loss through initiatives that either plant trees or protect threatened carbon stocks on farmlands. We conducted a global meta-analysis to evaluate how these programs may impact carbon and biodiversity outcomes across coffee agriculture, which spans a vegetation complexity gradient from monoculture to biodiverse agroforestry. For aboveground carbon, we estimated coffee farms currently hold 481.59 TgC globally and could sequester an additional 81.53-86.50 TgC under different agroforestry adoption scenarios. However, more than twice as much aboveground carbon could be lost under intensification scenarios (174.23-221.45 TgC). While tree diversity supports overall biodiversity in agroforestry, we found it does not independently increase carbon, indicating carbon and biodiversity outcomes may be decoupled. Ultimately, tree planting programs in coffee can sequester meaningful carbon volumes but may fail to achieve global carbon and biodiversity goals if they do not also protect existing agroforestry and diversify planting efforts. Global coffee farms now store roughly 481.59 Tg carbon, with more carbon lost from removing existing shade trees than gained by planting new ones into coffee monocultures, which is largely independent of biodiversity outcomes, as revealed by a global meta-analysis."

 Amazonian peatlands are carbon-rich ecosystems that act as long-term carbon sinks but have faced increasing fire risks in recent decades. As a legacy of past fires, the contribution of pyrogenic carbon (PyC) to carbon cycling in these peatlands remains poorly understood. Here, we assess PyC accumulation variability using six cores spanning peatlands in northwestern Amazonia using hydrogen pyrolysis. We also estimate the PyC stock for the entire Amazonian peatlands by combining our field dataset with published sources. The PyC to total organic carbon ratio averaged 1.2% across our sites and increased with peat age. We estimate a total peatland PyC stock of 0.73 ± 0.61 Pg for the Amazon Basin, representing 1.6% of their TOC stock. Due to the slower turnover of PyC in peatland ecosystems, our findings indicate the importance of PyC generated by past fires and highlight the potential long-term carbon sequestration role of PyC in the future carbon cycle.

 Accurate urban land-use mapping is an essential undertaking for various urban issues, such as urban planning, disease transmission, and climate change. Recently, learning-based method has emerged as a prevalent approach for urban land-use mapping, although it relies heavily on abundant labeled data. However, since land-use categories are jointly determined by physical and social attributes, obtaining such labels is challenging. This scarcity of labeled data often leads existing learning-based methods to overfit, resulting in models that struggle to recognize diverse land-use categories. To bypass these limitations, this paper for the first time advocates knowledge graph to leverage indirect supervision from related tasks for zero-shot land-use mapping. Toward this goal, this paper introduces a multi-granularity knowledge graph reasoning (mKGR) framework.R Only with indirect supervision from other tasks, mKGR can automatically integrate multimodal geospatial data as varying granularity entities and rich spatial–semantic interaction relationships. Subsequently, mKGR incorporates a fault-tolerant knowledge graph embedding method to establish relationships between geographic units and land-use categories, thereby reasoning land-use mapping outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that mKGR not only outperforms existing zero-shot approaches, but also exceeds those with direct supervision, achieving improvements of 0.16, 0.08, and 0.20 on PA, UA, and OA. Furthermore, this paper reveals the superiority of mKGR in large-scale holistic reasoning, an essential aspect of land-use mapping. Benefiting from mKGR’s zero-shot classification and large-scale holistic reasoning capabilities, a comprehensive urban land-use map of China is generated with low-cost. In addition, a nationwide assessment of 15-minute city walkability over the land-use map provides insights for urban planning and sustainable development.

 Assessing sea surface nitrate (SSN) concentrations and dynamics is crucial for understanding marine ecosystem health, yet optical remote sensing of SSN remains challenging because of the lack of distinct spectral features. While various global-scale SSN regression and machine learning algorithms based on SSN-environment variable relationships have been developed, the prediction accuracy and spatiotemporal resolution of their applications continue to face limitations. Additionally, there has been relatively little reporting on the interannual variability of global SSN in previous studies. Here we aim to enhance the accuracy and spatial resolution of SSN retrievals by developing improved regression and machine learning models, enabling the generation of global daily ∼ 8 km SSN products from satellite and model data. To construct the empirical regression models, the global ocean was divided into five regions on the basis of the relationship between sea surface temperature (SST) and SSN: 80° S to 40° N, the North Pacific, the North Atlantic, the Arabian Sea, and the eastern equatorial Pacific. After adding SSN-related physical variables, high-accuracy regional empirical models are developed, with root mean square deviations (RMSDs) of 1.641, 2.701, 1.221, 1.298, and 2.379 μmol/kg for the studied regions. For the machine learning models, seven algorithms, namely, extremely randomized trees (ET), multilayer perceptron (MLP), stacking random forest (SRF), Gaussian process regression (GPR), support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithms, were tested. After modeling, validation, and extensive tests using independent cruise dataset, the XGBoost model outperformed others (RMSD = 1.189 μmol/kg) and bypassed the need for regional segmentation. Mechanistic analysis revealed the driving variables influencing SSN in both regional empirical and XGBoost models, improving interpretability. Comparative validation confirmed that our models surpass traditional approaches in accuracy and applicability, demonstrating their potential to advance global SSN monitoring. Using XGBoost-derived products, we find a slight weak decreasing trend in SSN over 23 years. The proposed robust and explainable SSN retrieval models have the potential to assist in ocean environmental management."

 The Los Angeles wildfires of January 2025 caused more than 250 billion dollars in damage and lasted for nearly an entire month before containment. Following our previous work, the Digital Twin Building, we modify and leverage the multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework as well as the cloud-mapping integration to study the air quality during the Los Angeles wildfires. Recent advances in large language models have allowed for out-of-the-box automated large-scale data analysis. We use a multi-agent large language system comprised of an Instructor agent and Worker agents. Upon receiving the users’ instructions, the Instructor agent retrieves the data from the cloud platform and produces instruction prompts to the Worker agents. The Worker agents then analyze the data and provide summaries. The summaries are finally input back into the Instructor agent, which then provides the final data analysis. We test this system’s capability for data-based policy recommendation by assessing our Large Language Model System with Instructor–Worker Architecture’s health recommendations and numerical summarizations based on the air quality data during the Los Angeles wildfires."
