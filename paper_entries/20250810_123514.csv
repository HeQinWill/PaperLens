Dennis,"Relative to a Common Phthalate, Citrate-Based Plasticizers Exert Minimal Impact on Plastisphere Bacterial Community Composition during Biopolymer Biodegradation","Citrate-based plasticizers are often marketed as eco-friendly alternatives to phthalates like dibutyl phthalate (DBP). Here, we investigated these assertions by examining the response of soil microbial communities to biopolymer samples plasticized with acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC), triethyl citrate (TEC), DBP, or nothing (control). Samples were buried in soil for 14 weeks, after which the biomass and diversity of bacterial and fungal communities associated with the biopolymer, attached soil, and bulk soil were characterized using metabarcoding and quantitative PCR. Differences between buried (incubated) and nonincubated biopolymer samples were also analyzed using X-ray microcomputed tomography, gel permeation chromatography, and 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to assess biopolymer degradation and plasticizer migration. Surface degradation and plasticizer migration were observed for all treatments, with minor impacts of plasticizers on microbial biomass and alpha diversity. Critically, however, plastisphere bacterial communities formed two groups that were compositionally distinct. One group comprised the DBP samples while the other comprised the control, ATBC, and TEC samples. This indicates that DBP can impact soil bacterial community composition on release from biopolymer blends, while the effects of the citrate-based plasticizers were reduced─supporting their use as potentially less environmentally impactful alternatives to phthalates."

In this study, DNA-based stable isotope probing was employed to decipher the changes of potentially active methanotrophic communities across five different mangrove forests along a 370 km coastline of Taiwan, with Kandelia obovata dominating the northern sites (Hsinchu and Miaoli) and Avicennia marina dominating the central and southern sites (Changhua, Tainan, and Pingtung). The results showed that the CH4 oxidation potentials ranged from 10 to 60 nmol CH4 g–1 hr1 in the mangrove forest soils. The pmoA sequencing of fresh soils revealed that unclassified Methylomonadaceae-affiliated methanotrophs, Methylomicrobium-jap-rel, Methylobacter, and Methylomonas were predominant in K. obovata forests. In contrast, unclassified Methylomonadaceae-affiliated methanotrophs and Methylomonas dominated in A. marina forests. Furthermore, Methylomonadaceae-affiliated methanotrophs were positively correlated to soil TOC and TN. DNA-SIP analysis further identified unclassified Methylomonadaceae-affiliated methanotrophs, Methylomonas, and Methylobacter as potentially active methanotrophs in K. obovata forests. In contrast, other unclassified Methylomonadaceae-affiliated methanotrophs and methanotrophs belonging to the deep-sea-1 and deep-sea-3 clusters were potentially active in A. marina forests. Overall, this study revealed distinct biogeographic patterns of methanotrophs in Taiwan’s coastal mangrove ecosystems and highlighted the ecological role of Methylomonadaceae in mangrove CH4 cycling."

However, little is known about how the microbiomes associated with anthropogenic MPs compare with those associated with natural particles (NPs) in urban rivers with varying MP pollution levels. We therefore conducted a comparative analysis of the metagenomes associated with MPs and NPs (100–5000 μm) and river water (RW) across 10 urban river systems. Although we found similarities in taxonomic and functional compositions between the microbiomes associated with MPs and NPs, the plastisphere exhibited distinct associations with specialized taxa and life-history strategies. These unique traits enhanced the potential of the plastisphere for complex carbohydrate and plastic degradation, nitrate and nitric oxide reduction, and antibiotic resistance and virulence compared with the NP or RW microbiomes. Furthermore, MPs supported the sharing of unique microbes with the surrounding RW; these shared microbes possessed enhanced horizontal gene transfer capabilities and potentially could disperse traits of the plastisphere into the broader RW microbiomes. This study highlights the distinct ecological roles and shared microbes of the plastisphere, indicating that MP pollution may substantially and uniquely impact the function and health of riverine ecosystems."

The study uses ambient chemical composition measurements from the COVID-19 pandemic-induced lockdown in 2020. The key drivers of pollutant reductions were the 74 ± 4% reduction in transport activity between prelockdown and postlockdown, accompanied by a 63 ± 5% drop in traffic VOC emission and a 96 (80–100)% drop in NO emissions. Reductions in industrial activity and power demand caused a 53 ± 3% drop in industrial VOC emissions and 67 ± 5% drop in SO2 emissions, as well as a 59 ± 3% reduction in open waste burning during lockdown, which resulted in 43 ± 2% and 39 ± 1% reductions in PM2.5 and PM10 emissions, respectively.

A comparison of the moist Froude number between the two cases suggested stronger cross‐barrier flow on 29 August than that on 16 August 2020, corresponding to relatively high precipitation amounts on 29 August. The stratiform cloud regions exhibited stable structures and dominated by vapor deposition. Convective regions contained more graupel, dendrites, and larger aggregates and grew primarily through riming and aggregation. Secondary ice production was responsible for the significant increase in ice particle concentrations in the convective region. Evidence of the Hallett–Mossop process was observed at temperatures between −3°C and −8°C and the estimated ice splinter production rate in the Hallett–Mossop region was positively related to the high ice particle concentration. Ice‐ice collisional fragmentation might coexist at approximately −4°C in the embedded convective region. The observed ice particle size distributions (PSDs) in stratiform regions were weakly dependent on temperatures ranging from −5°C to −18°C and exhibited bimodal distributions with breakpoints at 500–600 μm. The observed PSDs in convective regions were also bimodal, but exhibited varied peaks due to the variation of dominant microphysical processes. The incomplete gamma fitting technique effectively characterized the PSDs from 300 to 2,000 μm. The significant increase in N0 due to high ice particle concentrations was possibly attributed to secondary ice production processes within clouds, and the decrease in λ corresponded to broadened ice particle spectra associated with aggregation."

However, quantifying the relationship between cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration remains challenging due to extensive heterogeneities in cloud properties, processes occurring during cloud lifecycle, and observational uncertainties. This study integrates satellite observations with a global climate model and employs advanced statistical techniques to improve estimates of cloud droplet susceptibility to aerosol perturbations, particularly focusing on the CCN‐CDNC slope. A key challenge in determining this relationship is that CDNC is influenced by factors beyond CCN alone, such as atmospheric dynamics and cloud microphysics. These additional factors introduce variability that complicates direct correlation between CCN and CDNC, making it difficult to ascertain their true relationship. In addition, traditional methods like Ordinary Least Squares regression can produce biased slope estimates due to uncertainties in both CCN and CDNC measurements. When applied to CCN‐CDNC data, advanced curve fitting methods, such as bivariate least squares, often yield slopes exceeding 1, deviating from expected physical behavior. Our machine learning analysis identifies updraft velocity, among other key predictors, as a major factor leading to this larger‐than‐one slope between CCN and CDNC. To address this, we utilized Elastic Net Regression to isolate the effect of changes in CCN concentration on CDNC. This method refines the slope estimates by accounting for factors affecting CDNC, resulting in a slope that better captures the susceptibility of CDNC to CCN changes."

Sediment supply remains the dominant driver, but human interventions and rising sea levels significantly disrupt the system's dynamics potentially leading to a tipping point in the estuarine morphodynamics of the Pearl River Estaury. We identify three distinct phases of estuarine evolution, revealing how cumulative pressures driven by anthropogenic pressure could force the estuary into different states with ecological, economic and societal consequences.

However, the extreme 2014 drought occurred independently of El Niño, suggesting other dynamic forcings at play. Here we use moisture budget analysis, moisture tracking, and physics‐informed joint probability modeling to disentangle the interplay between dynamic and thermodynamic drivers behind this unprecedented drought and to assess future drought risks under climate change. We find that the 2014 drought primarily resulted from air subsidence due to anticyclone‐driven mid‐troposphere divergence, leading to significant precipitation deficits, which are further intensified by reduced marine moisture inflow from the West Pacific. Incorporating the dynamic and thermodynamic drivers into our bivariate probabilistic analysis, we find that the likelihood of 2014‐like droughts will increase by 25% and 43% under stabilized and business as usual pathways, respectively, by mid‐century (2030–2064). Such increases in drought risk are dominated by climate‐change‐induced changes in dynamic processes, particularly reduced mid‐troposphere vertical motion, where thermodynamic processes and the dependence structure between the two play a less significant role. However, significant inter‐model inconsistence in attributing the relative importance of these factors highlights the challenges of using current climate models for robust risk assessment."

Here, we utilize the lag‐1 temporal autocorrelation of satellite‐based vegetation data to evaluate long‐term resilience trends in stable and restored forests across China from 2001 to 2020, then apply machine‐learning algorithms to explore the key drivers behind these trends. Results show that nearly half (45%) of forest ecosystems have experienced resilience declines, whether they are stable forests (44.4%) or restored forests (44.8%). Increased aridity and interannual precipitation variability have a significant impact on the resilience declines in both types of forest ecosystems. Comparatively, non‐climate variables exert a larger impact on resilience declines in restored forests than in stable forests. Resilience declines are more prevalent in restored forests with low plant species richness (<2,000), short forestation times (<10 years), or high soil moisture (>0.2 m3/m3). Structural equation models reveal that fewer critical factors directly influence the resilience of restored forests compared to stable forests.

The results demonstrated that policies implemented between 2020 and 2023 led to reductions of 38.2%, 19.1%, 31.6%, and 18.4% for particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and CO2, respectively. Notably, 90% of plants already met the 2024 ultra‐low emission (ULE) standards for PM and SO2, but only 26.3% complied with the ULE standards for NOx. Furthermore, our results revealed that adopting multiple abatement measures plays a critical role in capturing the co‐benefits of pollutants and CO2 emissions reduction. If all remaining plants adopt co‐processing technology, install and upgrade high‐efficiency emission control equipment, improve energy efficiency, and further eliminate outdated production capacity, they could synergistically reduce 9.8%–67.4% of pollutants and CO2 emissions and increase the proportion of synergy index (SI) > 0 (indicating a synergistic trend between pollutants and CO2 emissions) values by 2.8%–21.7%.

However, the dynamic coupling relationship between vegetation and SACD considering the optimal time lag remains unclear. To address this, we first employed copulas to develop a SACD index at temporal scales ranging from 1 to 24 months. Based on this index, the coupling relationship represented by the maximum correlation coefficient (Rmax) and the optimal time lag (Topt) between the Leaf Area Index and the SACD was examined. Furthermore, the coupling degree between the two was explored both temporally and spatially. The results revealed a significant nonlinear trend in both Rmax and Topt, with turning points identified using the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition occurring between 2010–2014 and 2011–2015, respectively. Additionally, it was found that the temporal coupling degree was strong, while the spatial coupling was initially weaker but showed an increasing trend, particularly in water‐limited regions. Land surface model simulations indicated that CO2 was the dominant driver of the vegetation‐drought coupling relationship and degree. Machine learning and SHapley Additive Explanations underscored the critical importance of meteorological variables, with radiation, precipitation and temperature being identified as the most influential meteorological factors.

Recent outbreaks in the Philippines highlight the urgent need for effective control measures. While previous studies have shown the importance of waterfowl‐to‐poultry transmission and farm‐to‐farm spread, the spillover risk to local avian species remains underexplored. This study aimed to examine H5N1‐HPAI outbreaks in poultry in relation to environmental factors and local avian species in the Philippines. We applied a two‐step ecological niche modelling approach using maximum entropy algorithms. First, environmental variables from remote sensing images were used to predict the distribution of 10 common avian species based on citizen science data from the eBird platform. Next, these avian distribution data were combined with environmental variables to create a risk map for H5N1‐HPAI outbreaks in the Philippines. The H5N1‐HPAI risk model demonstrated strong predictive performance, with an AUCROC value of 0.936 ± 0.026. Key factors contributing to predicted H5N1‐HPAI risk included precipitation levels, population density, and avian species such as the Eurasian Tree Sparrow and Zebra Dove. The higher risk of spillover for the two local avian species may be due to their shared similar environmental signatures with outbreak poultries. The risk map highlighted Metro Manila and Central Luzon as high‐risk regions of H5N1‐HPAI. This study identified the main clusters and environmental factors associated with avian influenza outbreaks in poultry in the Philippines.

 Intrapartum azithromycin prophylaxis reduced maternal infections but showed no effect on neonatal sepsis and mortality. Although antibiotic exposure may indirectly alter the mycobiota (community of fungi that live in a given environment), there is no data available on how intrapartum azithromycin impacts gut mycobiota development. We hereby assess the impact of intrapartum azithromycin on gut mycobiota development from birth to the age of three years, by ITS2 gene profiling of rectal samples from 102 healthy Gambian infants selected from a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial (PregnAnZI-2 – ClinicalTrials.org NCT03199547). In the trial, women received 2 g oral azithromycin or placebo (1:1) during labour with the intension of assessing effect on neonatal sepsis or mortality. Secondary objectives included effects on bacterial carriage and resistance, puerperal infections, and infant growth. Our analysis show that season and parity were key factors that influenced gut mycobiota development. Intrapartum azithromycin increased the abundance of Candida orthopsilosis but only in the wet season and did not show different effects by sex of the child. These data suggest that season and parity can be key factors influencing gut mycobiota development and may inform strategies for a wider implementation of intrapartum azithromycin intervention. Here, via ITS2 gene profiling of rectal samples from 102 healthy Gambian infants, the authors show that intrapartum azithromycin has an overall mild effect on gut mycobiota development but associates with increased abundance of C. orthopsilosis in the wet season."

 Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the accumulation and spread of pathological α-synuclein (α-syn) fibrils, which contribute to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Here we show that two immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains derived from α-syn receptors, the D1 domain of lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (L3D1) and the V domain of advanced glycation end-products (vRAGE), effectively block cell surface binding of α-syn fibrils, suppress fibrils-induced neuronal α-syn aggregation, and reduce inflammatory responses in microglia. Building on this, we identified two additional Ig-like binders, the D1 domain of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4 D1) and the D1 domain of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR D1), that target the C-terminal region of α-syn fibrils and mitigate fibrils-induced pathological activities. A structure-guided mutant, CAR D1_Mut, exhibits enhanced binding affinity and functional efficacy. These findings highlight the potential of Ig-like binders as molecular tools to interfere with pathological α-syn interactions.

 Confining catalysis within a nanospace can effectively regulate intermediate configurations and product distributions. Here, we demonstrate the inner cavity of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a nanoreactor to promote the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to methanol (CH3OH). Cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) molecules are rationally incorporated into CNTs of varying diameters, exhibiting different CH3OH selectivities. CoPc confined within the CNTs is more prone to CH3OH production, whereas CoPc located on the exterior primarily facilitates CO formation. Operando spectroelectrochemical measurements and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the nanoconfined environment effectively accumulates CO as an intermediate, introduces structural deformation in CoPc molecules, enhances *CO adsorption on Co sites, and consequently improves CH3OH production. This work underscores the significance of local microenvironment in electrocatalysis and presents an approach to enhancing deep-reduction product selectivity in molecular catalysts through nanoconfinement.

 Health strategies increasingly emphasize both behavioural and biomedical interventions, yet the complex and often contradictory guidance on diet, behavior, and health outcomes complicates evidence-based decision-making. Evidence triangulation across diverse study designs is essential for balancing biases and establishing causality, but scalable, automated methods for achieving this are lacking. In this study, we assess the performance of large language models in extracting both ontological and methodological information from scientific literature to automate evidence triangulation. A two-step extraction approach—focusing on exposure-outcome concepts first, followed by relation extraction—outperforms a one-step method, particularly in identifying the direction of effect (F1 = 0.86) and statistical significance (F1 = 0.96). Using salt intake and blood pressure as a case study, we calculate the Convergency of Evidence and Level of Convergency, finding a strong excitatory effect of salt on blood pressure (942 studies), and weak excitatory effect on cardiovascular diseases and deaths (124 studies). This approach complements traditional meta-analyses by integrating evidence across study designs, and enabling rapid, dynamic assessment of scientific controversies.

 The building sector plays a pivotal role in climate change mitigation. By regulating the demand for services and products from supply sectors, building sector can contribute to decarbonization.

This study analyses variations in threatened species bycatch among operators from industrial fisheries in Australia. 
 Fisheries bycatch continues to drive the decline of many threatened marine species such as marine mammals, seabirds, sea turtles and sharks. Management frameworks typically address non-target catch with fleet-level controls on fishing. Yet, individual operators differ in their fishing practices and efficiency at catching fish. If operators have differing abilities to target, they should also have differing abilities to avoid bycatch. To evaluate the generality of this pattern, we analysed variations in threatened species bycatch among individual operators from five industrial fisheries in Australia representing different geographic areas, gear types and target species. The individual vessel is a significant predictor of interaction rates in all 15 cases, including species that represent high or low costs to fishers, or have economic value. Encouragingly, we found high-target and low-bycatch vessels in all five fisheries, including gears often perceived as indiscriminate in the species they catch. The patterns of variation we find in the Australian fisheries data highlight the potential to reduce bycatch using measures focused on specific performance groups of individuals, offering an alternative approach that can complement fleet-wide controls.

In contrast with studies indicating biogeophysical impacts counteract biogeochemical impacts by up to 50%, we find that biogeophysical effects lead to insignificant global mean cooling (−0.002 ± 0.041 K).

 As dense sensor networks for air quality monitoring become increasingly prevalent, effective calibration remains a critical yet challenging component of their operation, particularly for large-scale networks. Conventional calibration methods, which rely heavily on co-locating sensors with reference monitors for learning and training, often face significant scalability challenges, rendering them impractical for post-deployment recalibration. To address this limitation, we propose an in-situ baseline calibration method (b-SBS) that calibrates sensors remotely without the need for direct co-location. This approach is grounded in the physical characteristics of electrochemical sensors and is informed by statistical analyses of calibration coefficients across a large group of similar sensors. Through preliminary field tests conducted on a batch of sensors for NO2, NO, CO, and O3, two key linear calibration coefficients, sensitivity and baseline, were systematically investigated. Sensitivity analysis of over 100 short-term calibration samples for each gas revealed coefficients clustered within 20% variation, enabling universal parameterization. Long-term baseline drift remained stable within ±5 ppb for NO2, NO, and O3, and ±100 ppb for CO over 6 months, supporting semi-annual recalibration. Applying the b-SBS calibration approach to 73 NO2 sensors in a large-scale Shanghai network yielded pronounced data quality improvements compared to their original measurements (initially calibrated before deployment): the median R2 increased by 45.8% (from 0.48 to 0.70), and RMSE decreased by 52.6% (from 16.02 to 7.59 ppb), as validated against nearby reference stations. The Shanghai application, while showing the method’s potential for large-scale deployments, awaits further real-time validation to confirm its robustness under diverse operational conditions. This study is a valuable advancement in calibration strategies, offering a cost-effective solution that reduces operational costs while ensuring accurate measurements across numerous sensors and long-term network deployments."

 The extent of desiccation in deep enclosed basins has been debated for over 50 years. Here we combine seismic, biostratigraphic, and strontium isotope data to document a deep desiccation event across the Red Sea basin that ended 6.2 million years ago. This event exposed the seafloor to erosion, forming an angular unconformity that decapitated Middle Miocene salt diapirs and truncated Late Miocene layered anhydrites. The unconformity is overlain by Messinian-Pleistocene pelagic carbonates and reef platforms, reflecting an abrupt shift from evaporitic to open marine conditions. The desiccation was likely triggered by the onset of the Messinian salinity crisis in the Mediterranean and it ended with a flood from the Gulf of Aden, which incised a 320 km long canyon through the volcanic Mandab and Hanish sills. This desiccation marks the final disconnection of the Red Sea from the Mediterranean and its initial connection to the Indian Ocean.

 Postseismic deformation carries valuable information about the complex fault system and deep rheological structure. We analyzed ~6 months of postseismic deformation following the 2024 moment magnitude 7.5 Noto earthquake using InSAR and GNSS data. Results reveal subsidence exceeding 8 cm across the Noto Peninsula, alongside significant horizontal surface deformation extending over 400 km. Our models suggest that viscoelastic relaxation plays a more significant role than afterslip in causing this subsidence. A weak zone, characterized by viscoelastic behavior, is necessary to explain localized deformation westward of the volcanic arc. Notably, shallow afterslip overlapping with coseismic slip is also required. We propose that this afterslip occurred on a hidden fault parallel to and beneath the coseismic slip fault, and was likely driven by normal stress corresponding to fault unclamping rather than the commonly assumed shear stress increase. These findings underscore the importance of considering fault structure and rheological heterogeneity in long-term seismic hazard estimation.

 Understanding fresh and decomposed particulate organic matter distributions and their response to macropore structure is crucial for soil carbon stocks. However, the roles of macropore structure in particulate organic matter fractions within aggregates and whether these processes are influenced by fertilization remain largely unknown. Here we investigated the effects of fertilization on particulate organic matter and macropore structures within 3-5 mm aggregates across five long-term field experiments (12 to 34 years) in China, using X–ray computed tomography. Manure application contributed to particulate organic matter accumulation and enhanced pore connectivity across five sites. 20%–69% of the fresh particulate organic matter was distributed within surface-connected pores.

 Microbial resilience is essential for ecosystem stability as environmental conditions fluctuate. Despite resilience emerging from both individual (organism)-level adaptations and community-level processes, integration of these mechanisms remains enigmatic, particularly in arid environments. These extreme ecosystems, spanning over 45% of Earth’s terrestrial surface, provide a natural laboratory for understanding microbial survival under harsh conditions. Here, we use time-resolved multiomics to show that resilience results from dynamic microbial network reorganization enabling the coordination between stochastic processes that maintain community stability, and individual stress responses. Additionally, Thermoproteota emerged as a keystone taxon maintaining nitrogen cycling and fostering cross-feeding networks. Its ecological prominence highlights its central role in arid ecosystems, making it an ideal model organism for understanding microbial adaptation to environmental extremes.

 Current observations of anisotropy in artificial light at night (ALAN) rely entirely on satellite observations, making it impossible to control observation times, viewing angles, and ground surface structures. This presents numerous inconveniences for exploring the mechanisms of anisotropy. Therefore, this study proposes a framework and methodology for nighttime multi-angle observations to investigate anisotropic characteristics in ALAN using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) combined with scaled experiments. First, the scaled experiment constructs an urban canyon consisting of one road, two buildings, and two street lamps. A total of 12 groups of scaled experiments involved variations in building heights, building spacing, luminaire heights, and building surface materials. Then, a hemispherical flight path with different viewing zenith angles and viewing azimuth angles is designed to achieve multi-angle UAV observations. The results indicate that the UAV detected significant anisotropy. We find that increasing building height or decreasing building spacing will enhance the angular effects of the entire scene (0.74 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.98). The building blocking indexes, which describe the building spatial structure, significantly affect anisotropic characteristics (0.62 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.89). Furthermore, we observe the phenomena of the cold spot and hot spot. The building blocking indexes also significantly impact the hot spot angle (R2 = 0.91). This study indicates that utilizing an UAV for multi-angle observations based on scaled experiments can provide multi-angle nighttime light data with nearly instantaneous, complete angular coverage, and controllable surface parameters. In summary, the proposed framework will expand the approach to acquiring prior knowledge about the anisotropy of ALAN."

 The complex sources of particulate organic carbon (POC) in lakes introduce substantial variability in its correlation with optically active constituents (OACs) like chlorophyll-a and suspended minerals. This variability poses a significant challenge in developing long-term POC concentration records from multi-satellite observations, particularly when bridging historical and modern sensors in optically complex waters. The Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) perform well in retrieving the bio-optical parameters related to POC in global inland waters. In this study, we utilize data from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), which has similar spectral bands, as a connection to validate the consistency of the atmospherically corrected remote sensing reflectance (Rrs(λ)) of MERIS and OLCI using field measurements. An inter-sensor validation of Rrs(λ) has also been conducted based on the match-up pairs of satellite data. A blended POC model suitable for both non-algal particles (NAP)-dominated (Type 1) and phytoplankton-dominated (Type 2) waters has been proposed and developed using the multi-sensor Rrs(λ) data. POC concentrations of 110 lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and Huai River (MLYHR) basin in China are retrieved based on multi-sensor Rrs(λ) data from 2003 to 2023. The results demonstrate that: 1) the Rrs(λ) of MERIS, GOCI, and OLCI show good consistency from the green to near-infrared (NIR) bands, 2) the proposed POC inversion model has been validated using field-measured POC with good performance (root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.49 mg/L for Type 1 and 4.52 mg/L for Type 2), and 3) significant seasonal variations in POC in the region have been observed, with high values in summer and low values in winter. Small lakes with areas of ∼10–50 km2 have higher mean POC values (7.63 ± 0.69 mg/L) than those in large lakes (e.g., in lakes ranging from 100 to 500 km2, the POC concentration is 5.91 ± 0.81 mg/L). The multi-sensor strategy for estimating POC in optically complex waters provides a practical way to fully utilize the spectral bands and long-term observations from multiple satellites."

 Several major faults in Northern California, including the Hayward, northern Calaveras, Rodgers Creek, Maacama, and Green Valley-Concord Faults, traverse densely vegetated and non-urban regions. Current differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR) timeseries approaches, such as small-baseline subset (SBAS) and persistent scatterers interferometry (PSI), face limitations in these areas, resulting in substantial data gaps that affect surface fault creep estimation. In this study, we investigate the use of InSAR PS+DS (persistent scatterers + distributed scatterers) timeseries approach to map surface creep-related deformation across the major fault systems in northern California. The PS+DS approach involves statistical analysis of all possible interferometric pairs, minimizing loss of information and maximizing spatial density of estimates. We obtained surface velocity estimates in northern California over a 200 km by 200 km extent and having 100 m spatial resolution using the PS+DS approach, which agree well with GNSS (global navigation satellite system) velocities, with root mean square error (RMSE) of ∼3 mm/yr and ∼2 mm/yr for descending and ascending tracks, respectively. We observe surface creep ranging from 4-8 mm/yr along the 75 km extent of the Hayward Fault. We detect surface creep across the northern Rodgers Creek and Concord Faults, at rates of 1-2 mm/yr.

 The rapid growth of remotely sensed earth observation data presents clear opportunities for monitoring complex ecosystem change and answering fundamental ecological questions. However, large-scale automated monitoring of ecosystems faces challenges. Data-driven models require extensive datasets and often lack generalizability when training data are unrepresentative, while process-driven models, such as radiative transfer models (RTMs), can be imprecise due to gaps in knowledge, or simplified representation of physical processes. To enhance the prediction of plant functional traits and simultaneously discover where process-driven models can be improved, we explore the potential of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of both methodologies at the leaf scale. In contrast to data augmentation approaches, our implementation directly integrates the widely-used PROSPECT5B model into the architecture of an autoencoder framework. Our results show that our PINNs approach is able to outperform data-driven techniques even when trained on very limited training data (i.e. 17 % training vs 83 % validation). We also identified weak points in the PROSPECT5B model by progressively replacing individual components of PROSPECT5B with convolutional neural networks. Our case study indicates that especially Prospect's generalized “plate model” could be refined to improve predictive ability. Hence, our framework provides a self-diagnostic capability and identifies areas for improvement in process-driven models and their components. Thus, we conclude that PINNs 1) improve data-driven predictive accuracy while maintaining physical consistency with minimal training data while 2) being able to identify limitations in process-driven models. Hence, we believe our framework could serve as a new standard for evolving and improving radiative transfer models."

 Movement uncertainty modeling is essential for reliable human mobility analytics, especially in indoor spaces with denied Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals and complex human motion modes. However, the performance of current uncertainty modelling approaches is hindered by the dynamic spatial–temporal correlations within the indoor human movement trajectory. To tackle these problems, this paper proposes a novel uncertainty modelling framework UMTrajNet to address indoor human movement reconstruction, movement uncertainty error prediction, and uncertainty region modelling. A spatiotemporal structure is designed by combining the Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) network and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, enabling adaptive learning the spatial and temporal features of human movement. An adaptive Euclidean distance method is employed to generate continuous uncertainty regions for the selected indoor trajectory based on extracted spatiotemporal features. By integrating GCN with LSTM, UMTrajNet effectively captures the complex spatial–temporal dependencies within the trajectory data thereby overcoming the limitations of traditional solely LSTM-based models in spatial context correlation modeling. Real-world experimental results indicate that the presented UMTrajNet significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline models in uncertainty modelling across different datasets."

 Geo-computation is a crucial process in geographic information science that selects geo-computational models and matches geographic data based on a geo-computational task for detecting, predicting, and simulating geographic entities, events, and phenomena. However, current geo-computations require expertise from users to effectively configure the models, data, and procedures for specialized tasks, which particularly poses challenges for users, especially novice users, as their attention is often drawn to technical details rather than computational analysis of the task. Therefore, we propose a systematic descriptive and procedural method driven by knowledge graphs to capture, organize, and process the essential features of components, relationships, and dynamic computational procedures in geo-computations, aiming to reduce manual involvement and assist in automating model selection and data matching. Then, an application prototype system is developed to implement automated geo-computations that are driven by knowledge graphs. Two application cases, namely, soil erosion and soil potential productivity, are computed to illustrate the accessibility of automated geo-computations supported by our proposed method. As demonstrated by the cases studied, the proposed knowledge graph-driven method improves the efficiency of model selection and configuration, enhances the value of open data, and advances integration of data and models for automated geo-computations."

 Understanding high spatiotemporal resolution monthly industrial production is crucial for detailed economic analysis and effective policy intervention. However, the lack of high-resolution spatial data and validation samples at the regional scales makes this estimation challenging. To address this, we propose a Spatial Analysis-based Convolutional Neural Network (SA-CNN) model that estimates the grid-level Gross Value of Industrial Output (GVIO) in Shanghai’s monthly time series by accounting for heterogeneous nighttime light (NTL) patterns across different land uses. Firstly, we locate each factory based on the corresponding category in Point of Interest (POI) data and propose a new sampling strategy using buffer zones around each factory to capture local NTL patterns. Secondly, the SA-CNN extracts feature from monthly NTL patterns, incorporating urban and rural NTL statistical characteristics to address the few-shot problem. Finally, we map the monthly estimated GVIO grid data from 2014 to 2021 by establishing a linear correlation between NTL in factory areas and the estimated results. Experimental results indicate that SA-CNN outperforms the random forest and baseline models, with R2 values of 0.94 for estimation results and 0.90 for the mapping grid. The spatial distribution of monthly GVIO in northern Shanghai was more balanced and developed faster than in the south and the overall GVIO increased oscillation. The SA-CNN method proposed a new sampling strategy to overcome the problem of the need for large samples in estimating regional industrial activities and offers a fast update and labor-free methodology for monthly GVIO estimation."

 An in-situ field study was conducted during the pre-monsoon season in the Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon, located in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP), to investigate the physicochemical properties of aerosols and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity associated with South Asian outflow. This region serves as a critical water vapor channel into the interior of the TP. During the study, periodic episodes of enhanced aerosol loading were observed, with the maximum of daily average submicron aerosol mass concentrations exceeding 20 μg m−3, substantially higher than typical background levels over the inland TP. The average aerosol composition during the study was dominated by organic aerosols (OA, 57.0 %), followed by sulfate (21.1 %), black carbon (12.1 %), ammonium (7.3 %), nitrate (2.3 %), and chloride (0.2 %). The contribution of OA increased during elevated loading periods, whereas sulfate contributions declined. The high contribution of OA resulted in an overall moderate hygroscopicity of aerosols (κchem = 0.27). Despite the moderate hygroscopicity, aerosols presented relatively high CCN activity ratios (0.5–0.8 for supersaturation between 0.2 % and 1.0 %), primarily due to their size distribution in the accumulation mode after long-range transport. Case studies further indicate potential aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions during pollution episodes. These results improve our understanding of the transport and evolution processes of South Asian outflow and their implications for regional water-cycling during the pre-monsoon season."

 The western United States has experienced a significant increase in the frequency and severity of wildfires, driven by climate change, human activity, and fire suppression strategies. These wildfires generate pollution that adversely affects air quality long distances from the source and with impacts lasting from minutes to days. The Warn-on-Forecast System for Smoke (WoFS-Smoke) provides short-term (0–6 h) forecasts focused on smoke from rapidly evolving wildfires. The system utilizes Fire Radiative Power (FRP) data from the GOES-East and West satellites to estimate smoke emissions. The injection height of biomass burning emissions are then estimated at each grid point using the Freitas plume model that is also utilized by the operational HRRR-Smoke system. One limitation of this system was its inability to incorporate the estimated vertical velocity within the 1-D column back into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, hindering accurate predictions of vertical smoke aerosol transport and pyro-cumulus (pyro-Cu) formation. WoFS-Smoke addresses this limitation by incorporating the vertical velocity profile, as estimated by the Freitas plume model, back into WoFS-Smoke. This enhancement enables the system to provide a more accurate vertical structure of smoke and the potential to forecast the development of smoke-induced pyro-Cu. The improved capabilities were demonstrated through its application to three wildfire events in California, New Mexico, and Texas occurring in 2020 and 2024. We will also assess limitations with this initial development and discuss the next steps at refining the fire – atmosphere coupling in WoFS."

 Aerosols, which envelop the entire Earth, significantly influence climate, environmental quality, and human health. Aerosol mapping is essential for understanding their interactions with meteorological and epidemiological factors, especially in regions with sparse ground stations. However, existing aerosol products face limitations in spatial coverage and resolution. To bridge this gap, we present a novel two-stage hybrid algorithm to generate seamless 1-km aerosol optical depth (AOD) maps across China from 2014 to 2023. In the first stage, an ensemble machine learning model is used to calibrate Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) AOD using same-day Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol retrieval. The calibrated MERRA-2 AOD is then used to fill gaps in the MODIS-derived product (i.e., MCD19A2), producing spatially complete aerosol maps as supervision labels. Subsequently, the second stage employs the labels and an enhanced Downscale-UNet model incorporating Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and Depthwise Separable Convolution (DSC) modules to enhance spatial feature extraction and computational efficiency, ultimately obtaining seamless and high-resolution results through a surface-to-surface learning paradigm. Validation results show that the proposed model outperforms the conventional UNet by approximately 5 %, with a high determination coefficient (R2) of 0.93 and low root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.06 on the testing dataset. Independent validation against ground-based observations confirms its satisfactory performance with improved accuracy (R2 = 0.75) compared to MERRA-2 (R2 = 0.48) and superior spatial coverage (100 %) compared to MCD19A2 (44 %). Moreover, its spatial results demonstrate exceptional continuity and fine-scale feature representation, effectively bridging the complementary limitations of satellite retrievals and reanalysis data. This enables unprecedented aerosol analysis across both regional and climatological scales. Both the model and generated dataset are publicly accessible via https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15847434, providing critical resources for air quality monitoring, epidemiological research, and climate modeling applications."

While stress-tolerant corals have been documented in extreme systems such as mangrove lagoons, it is critical to assess the ability of these corals to maintain tolerance when moved to a more benign habitat. Here, we translocated corals from a mangrove lagoon to an adjacent reef and evaluated the thermal thresholds of corals from both locations before translocation and after 1 year. We demonstrate that mangrove colonies have higher thermal tolerance than reef corals, and, critically, mangrove colonies exhibited no loss in thermal tolerance following 1-year translocation to a less extreme reef habitat. Up-regulation of genes associated with DNA repair, metabolism, and homeostasis indicates the importance of these pathways in helping mangrove corals mitigate thermal stress. Our findings suggest the use of heat tolerant corals from extreme systems holds promise as part of intervention strategies aiming to increase reef resistance."

However, the synthesis of high-quality single-crystalline ferroelectric nitride perovskites has been limited, hindering a comprehensive understanding of their switching dynamics. Here we report the synthesis and characterizations of epitaxial single-phase ferroelectric cerium tantalum nitride (CeTaN3) on both oxides and semiconductors. The polar symmetry of CeTaN3was confirmed by observing the atomic displacement of central ions relative to the center of the TaN6octahedra, as well as through optical second harmonic generation. We observed switchable ferroelectric domains using piezoresponse force microscopy, complemented by the characterization of square-like polarization–electric field hysteresis loops. The remanent polarization of CeTaN3reaches approximately 20 microcoulomb per square centimeter at room temperature, consistent with theoretical calculations. This work establishes a vital link between ferroelectric nitride perovskites and their practical applications, paving the way for next-generation information and energy storage devices."

We engineered a sonosensitive conductive hydrogel incorporating polypyrrole-encapsulated porphyrin derivatives {[Tetrakis (4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP)]@PPy} to regulate cell cycle dynamics. Upon ultrasound irradiation, TCPP@PPy generates free electrons, establishing a controlled microcurrent within degenerative tissues. This sonoelectric niche induces nucleus pulposus cell (NPC) membrane depolarization, activating calcium voltage-gated channels (Cav) to drive Ca2+influx. Subsequent calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I activation up-regulates cyclin-dependent kinases CDK1/CDK2, forming a sonoelectricity–ion–kinase axis that stimulates NPC proliferation and anabolism. Concurrently, ultrasound-responsive borate ester bonds in the hydrogel amplify reactive oxygen species scavenging, counteracting oxidative stress–induced NPC ferroptosis. In a goat model of intervertebral disc degeneration, ultrasound-guided hydrogel implantation alleviated degenerative progression by synergistically reactivating cell cycle progression and suppressing oxidative damage. This strategy demonstrates a noninvasive, dual-targeted approach to regulate degenerative microenvironments through spatiotemporal control of sonoelectric and biochemical cues, offering a translatable strategy for tissue regeneration therapies."
