10.5194/essd-16-3821-2024,MAP-IO: an atmospheric and marine observatory program  on board Marion Dufresne over the Southern Ocean,"The MAP-IO program aims to compensate for the lack of atmospheric and oceanographic observations in the Southern Ocean by equipping the ship Marion Dufresne with a set of 17 scientific instruments. This program collected 700 d of measurements under different latitudes, seasons, sea states, and weather conditions. These new data will support the calibration and validation of numerical models and the understanding of the atmospheric composition of this region of Earth. 
 This article is devoted to the presentation of the MAP-IO observation program. This program, launched in early 2021, has enabled the observation of nearly 700 d of measurements over the Indian and Southern Ocean with the equipment of 17 meteorological and oceanographic scientific instruments on board the ship Marion Dufresne. Several observational techniques have been developed to respond to the difficulties of observations on board the ship, in particular for passive remote sensing data, as well as for quasi-autonomous data acquisition and transfer. The first measurements made it possible to draw up unprecedented climatological data of the Southern Ocean regarding the size distribution and optical thickness of aerosols, the concentration of trace gases and greenhouse gases, UV, and integrated water vapor. High-resolution observations of phytoplankton in surface waters have also shown a great variability in latitude in terms of abundance and community structure (diversity). The operational success of this program and these unique scientific results together establish a proof of concept and underline the need to transform this program into a permanent observatory. The multi-year rotations over the Indian Ocean will enable us to assess the trends and seasonal variability of phytoplankton, greenhouse gases, ozone, and marine aerosols in a sensitive and poorly documented climatic region. Without being exhaustive, MAP-IO should make it possible to better understand and assess the biological carbon pump, to study the variability of gases and aerosols in a region that is remote in relation to the main anthropogenic sources, and to monitor the transport of stratospheric ozone by the Brewer–Dobson circulation. The meteorological MAP-IO data set is publicly available at https://www.aeris-data.fr/catalogue-map-io/ (last access: 26 August 2024) (atmospheric data) and  at https://doi.org/10.17882/89505 (Thyssen et al., 2022a) (phytoplankton data).",Pierre Tulet;Joel Van Baelen;Pierre Bosser;Jérome Brioude;Aurélie Colomb;Philippe Goloub;Andrea Pazmino;Thierry Portafaix;Michel Ramonet;Karine Sellegri;Melilotus Thyssen;Léa Gest;Nicolas Marquestaut;Dominique Mékiès;Jean-Marc Metzger;Gilles Athier;Luc Blarel;Marc Delmotte;Guillaume Desprairies;Mérédith Dournaux;Gaël Dubois;Valentin Duflot;Kevin Lamy;Lionel Gardes;Jean-François Guillemot;Valérie Gros;Joanna Kolasinski;Morgan Lopez;Olivier Magand;Erwan Noury;Manuel Nunes-Pinharanda;Guillaume Payen;Joris Pianezze;David Picard;Olivier Picard;Sandrine Prunier;François Rigaud-Louise;Michael Sicard;Benjamin Torres,Earth System Science Data,True,"['atmospheric composition', 'aerosols', 'trace gases', 'greenhouse gases', 'UV', 'integrated water vapor', 'phytoplankton', 'satellite observations', 'air quality monitoring']",这篇论文介绍了MAP-IO项目，该项目旨在通过在“Marion Dufresne”号船上配备17种科学仪器来弥补南大洋大气和海洋观测的不足。该项目收集了700天的数据，涵盖了不同的纬度、季节、海况和天气条件。这些新数据将用于校准和验证数值模型，并帮助理解该地区的大气成分。论文中提到了对气溶胶尺寸分布和光学厚度、痕量气体和温室气体浓度、紫外线和总水汽的观测，以及对表层水域浮游植物的高分辨率观测。这些观测结果表明，该项目能够提供南大洋大气成分和海洋生态系统变化的宝贵信息，并为该地区的气候变化研究提供重要数据支持。
10.5194/gmd-2024-126,"HTAP3 Fires: Towards a multi-model, multi-pollutant study of fire impacts","The multi-model experiment design of the HTAP3 Fires project takes a multi-pollutant approach to improving our understanding of transboundary transport of wildland fire and agricultural burning emissions and their impacts. The experiments are designed with the goal of answering science policy questions related to fires. The options for the multi-model approach, including inputs, outputs, and model set up are discussed, and the official recommendations for the project are presented. 
 Open biomass burning has major impacts globally and regionally on atmospheric composition. Fire emissions include particulate matter, tropospheric ozone precursors, greenhouse gases, as well as persistent organic pollutants, mercury and other metals. Fire frequency, intensity, duration, and location are changing as the climate warms, and modelling these fires and their impacts is becoming more and more critical to inform climate adaptation and mitigation, as well as land management. Indeed, the air pollution from fires can reverse the progress made by emission controls on industry and transportation. At the same time, nearly all aspects of fire modelling – such as emissions, plume injection height, long-range transport, and plume chemistry – are highly uncertain. This paper outlines a multi-model, multi-pollutant, multi-regional study to improve the understanding of the uncertainties and variability in fire atmospheric science, models, and fires’ impacts, in addition to providing quantitative estimates of the air pollution and radiative impacts of biomass burning. Coordinated under the auspices of the Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution, the international atmospheric modelling and fire science communities are working towards the common goal of improving global fire modelling and using this multi-model experiment to provide estimates of fire pollution for impact studies. This paper outlines the research needs, opportunities, and options for the fire-focused multi-model experiments and provides guidance for these modelling experiments, outputs, and analysis that are to be pursued over the next 3 to 5 years. It proposes a plan for delivering specific products at key points over this period to meet important milestones relevant to science and policy audiences.",Cynthia H. Whaley;Tim Butler;Jose A.

10.1021/acs.est.4c05048,Important yet Overlooked HONO Source from Aqueous-phase Photochemical Oxidation of Nitrophenols,"Nitrites (NO2–/HONO), as the primary source of hydroxyl radicals (•OH) in the atmosphere, play a key role in atmospheric chemistry. However, the current understanding of the source of NO2–/HONO is insufficient and therefore hinders the accurate quantification of atmospheric oxidation capacity. Herein, we highlighted an overlooked HONO source by the reaction between nitrophenols (NPs) and •OH in the aqueous phase and provided kinetic data to better evaluate the contribution of this process to atmospheric HONO. Three typical NPs, including 4-nitrophenol (4NP), 2-nitrophenol (2NP), and 4-nitrocatechol (4NC), underwent a denitration process to form aqueous NO2– and gaseous HONO through the •OH oxidation, with the yield of NO2–/HONO varied from 15.0 to 33.5%. According to chemical composition and structure analysis, the reaction pathway, where the ipso addition of •OH to the NO2 group on 4NP generated hydroquinone, can contribute to more than 61.9% of the NO2–/HONO formation. The aqueous photooxidation of NPs may account for HONO in the atmosphere, depending on the specific conditions. The results clearly suggest that the photooxidation of NPs should be considered in the field observation and calculation to better evaluate the HONO budget in the atmosphere.",Wangjin Yang;Hui Ji;Fu Li;Xue He;Shan Zhang;Xiangli Nan;Tao Du;Kun Li;Chong Han,Environmental Science & Technology,True,"['atmospheric chemistry', 'HONO', 'air quality', 'photochemical oxidation', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric composition analysis']",该研究探讨了硝基酚（NPs）在水相中与羟基自由基（•OH）反应生成亚硝酸（HONO）的过程。研究发现，NPs的氧化反应可以产生可观的HONO，这对于大气化学中的羟基自由基（•OH）生成具有重要意义。研究结果表明，NPs的光氧化反应是大气中HONO的重要来源，需要在空气质量监测和大气成分分析中考虑这一因素。
10.1021/acsestair.4c00141,"Chemical Insights into the Molecular Composition of Organic Aerosols in the Urban Region of Houston, Texas","Molecular functional groups, such as organosulfates (CHOS) and organonitrates (CHNO) are important tracers for field observations of secondary organic aerosols (SOA). While CHOS and CHNO are prevalent in the atmosphere, there is a lack of knowledge regarding daily and day- and night-time variations in these species in the urban atmosphere. Meteorological factors such as wind speed/direction, relative humidity (RH), and temperature can influence the formation of CHOS/CHNO. To investigate these trends, we utilized multimodal chemical imaging and advanced high resolution mass spectrometry techniques to acquire particle speciation and molecular formulas (MFs) associated with day and night sampling periods. Back trajectory analyses revealed the oceanic influence of southern wind airmasses in later June sampling periods with organic fractions <10%. Conversely, northern winds in early June sampling periods contributed to the episodic emergence of extremely low volatile organics (ELVOCs) and organic factions up to 41%. The observed unique MFs to June 3 (223 MFs) and to June 4 (144 MFs) were largely found to be of biogenic rather than anthropogenic origin.

 At the origin of the Universe, an asymmetry between the amount of created matter and antimatter led to the matter-dominated Universe as we know it today. The origins of this asymmetry remain unknown so far. High-energy nuclear collisions create conditions similar to the Universe microseconds after the Big Bang, with comparable amounts of matter and antimatter1–6. Much of the created antimatter escapes the rapidly expanding fireball without annihilating, making such collisions an effective experimental tool to create heavy antimatter nuclear objects and to study their properties7–14, hoping to shed some light on the existing questions on the asymmetry between matter and antimatter.

 Human development relies on the correct replication, maintenance and segregation of our genetic blueprints. How these processes are monitored across embryonic lineages, and why genomic mosaicism varies during development remain unknown. Using pluripotent stem cells, we identify that several patterning signals—including WNT, BMP, and FGF—converge into the modulation of DNA replication stress and damage during S-phase, which in turn controls chromosome segregation fidelity in mitosis. We show that the WNT and BMP signals protect from excessive origin firing, DNA damage and chromosome missegregation derived from stalled forks in pluripotency. Cell signalling control of chromosome segregation declines during lineage specification into the three germ layers, but re-emerges in neural progenitors. In particular, we find that the neurogenic factor FGF2 induces DNA replication stress-mediated chromosome missegregation during the onset of neurogenesis, which could provide a rationale for the elevated chromosomal mosaicism of the developing brain. Our results highlight roles for morphogens and cellular identity in genome maintenance that contribute to somatic mosaicism during mammalian development.

10.1038/s41467-024-51677-z,Variations in plume activity reveal the dynamics of water-filled faults on Enceladus,"Cassini mission revealed water-rich plumes, with temporal variation, near the south pole of Saturn’s moon Enceladus. Here, the authors show combination of slip-controlled jet flow and normal-stress-controlled ambient flow can explain the temporal variability of Enceladus’ plumes. 
 After discovering a jet activity near the south pole of Saturn’s moon Enceladus, the Cassini mission demonstrated the existence of a subsurface water ocean with a unique sampling opportunity through flybys. Diurnal variations in the observed brightness of the plume suggest a tidal control, although the existence and timing of two activity maxima seem to contradict stress analysis predictions. Here, we re-interpret the observed plume variability by combining a 3D global model of tidal deformation of the fractured ice shell with a 1D local model of transport processes within south-polar faults. Our model successfully predicts the observed plume’s temporal variability by combining two independent vapour transport mechanisms: slip-controlled jet flow and normal-stress-controlled ambient flow. Moreover, it provides a possible explanation for the differences between the vapour and solid emission rates during the diurnal cycle and the observed fractionation of the various icy particle families. Our model prediction could be tested by future JWST observations targeted when Enceladus is at different positions on its orbit and could be used to determine the optimal strategy for plume material sampling by future space missions.

Here the authors report the results of a phase 1b trial of the TGFβ type I receptor kinase inhibitor vactosertib in combination with pomalidomide in patients with relapsed and/or refractory (MM) who had received >2 lines of chemoimmunotherapy. 
 Functional blockade of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) signalling pathway improves the efficacy of cytotoxic and immunotherapies. Here, we conducted a phase 1b study (ClinicalTrials.gov., NCT03143985) to determine the primary endpoints of safety, tolerability, and maximal tolerated dose (200 mg twice daily) for the orally-available TGFβ type I receptor kinase inhibitor vactosertib in combination with pomalidomide in relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) patients who had received ≥2 lines of chemoimmunotherapy. Secondary endpoints demonstrated sustained clinical responses, favorable pharmacokinetic parameters and a 6-month progression-free survival of 82%. Vactosertib combined with pomalidomide was well-tolerated at all dose levels and displayed a manageable adverse event profile. Exploratory analysis indicated that vactosertib co-treatment with pomalidomide also reduced TGFβ levels in patient bone marrow as well as the level of CD8+ T-cells that expressed the immunoinhibitory marker PD-1. In vitro experiments indicated that vactosertib+pomalidomide co-treatment decreased the viability of MM cell lines and patient tumor cells, and increased CD8+ T-cell cytotoxic activity. Vactosertib is a safe therapeutic that demonstrates tumor-intrinsic activity and can overcome immunosuppressive challenges within the tumor microenvironment to reinvigorate T-cell fitness. Vactosertib offers promise to improve immunotherapeutic responses in heavily-pretreated MM patients refractory to conventional agents. TGFβ can promote the development of drug resistance and growth of multiple myeloma (MM). Here the authors report the results of a phase 1b trial of the TGFβ type I receptor kinase inhibitor vactosertib in combination with pomalidomide in patients with relapsed and/or refractory (MM) who had received >2 lines of chemoimmunotherapy.",Ehsan Malek;Priyanka S.
