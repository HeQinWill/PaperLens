10.1088/1748-9326/ada16b,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究了阿拉斯加内陆地区4万年前遗存永久冻土中的稳定水同位素，以重建过去的气候变化。通过建立当地大气降水线，研究人员分析了末次盛冰期以来不同时期（包括MIS3和全新世）永久冻土冰核中的稳定水同位素值，定量计算了夏季温度变化。研究结果表明，与现在相比，MIS3晚期夏季温度低约10℃，并在过去70年中升温4℃。这项研究主要关注古气候变化，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等。,[],Thomas A Douglas;Amanda J Barker;Alistair J Monteath;Duane G Froese,A local meteoric water line for interior Alaska constrains paleoclimate from 40 000 year old relict permafrost,"Anthropogenic climate warming is degrading permafrost across interior Alaska. Information from past warming events provides long-term perspectives for future trajectories; however, late Quaternary seasonal temperatures are poorly constrained. We have established a stable water isotope meteoric water line for interior Alaska and measured stable water isotope values from 126 permafrost cores representing different ice types deposited over the past ∼40 ka (thousand years before 1950 CE). Samples represent two late Quaternary warm periods: marine isotope stage three (MIS3; 57–29 ka) and the Holocene (11.7 ka-present). Older samples provide insight into local climatic conditions slightly before the first archeological evidence for Paleolithic hunter-gatherers in the region. From permafrost ice we calculate that summer temperatures warmed by ∼10 °C between late MIS3 and today, with six degrees of warming between 40–30 ka and 3 ka and an additional 4 °C of warming since 3 ka. Half this recent 4 °C warming has occurred over the past 70 years."
10.1088/1748-9326/ada16e,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究的是大型食草动物（白犀牛）的移除对景观尺度生物物理过程的影响，特别是对火灾动态、木本植物入侵和地表反照率的影响。研究发现，白犀牛移除区域的火灾面积和木本植物入侵程度增加，导致地表反照率降低，最终影响气候强迫。该研究使用了半实验方法，结合实地调查和数据分析，揭示了大型食草动物在生态系统中的关键作用及其对气候变化的潜在影响。虽然研究涉及地表反照率，这与大气环境遥感中的卫星观测相关，但其主要关注点并非大气成分分析或空气质量监测等方面，而是生态系统层面的生物物理过程及其对气候的影响。因此，与大气环境遥感技术的关联性较弱。,"['land surface albedo', 'satellite remote sensing', 'climate forcing']",Olli Hyvarinen;Mariska te Beest;Elizabeth le Roux;Graham I H Kerley;Robert Buitenwerf;Dave J Druce;Jiquan Chen;Linda Rapp;Joana Fernandes;Joris P G M Cromsigt,Megagrazer loss drives complex landscape-scale biophysical cascades,"Wild animals can modulate ecosystem-climate feedbacks, e.g. through impacts on vegetation and associated carbon dynamics. However, vegetation cover and composition also affect land surface albedo, which is an important component of the global energy budget. We currently know very little about the influence of wild animals on land surface albedo and the resulting climate forcing of these albedo changes. Leveraging a unique, ecosystem-scale, semi-experimental approach, we study how the local removals of the world’s largest, terrestrial grazer, white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum), affected the coupling between fire dynamics, woody encroachment and surface albedo in Hluhluwe–iMfolozi Park (HiP), South Africa. Our path analysis revealed that areas in the park where more rhinos had been removed showed a stronger increase in burnt area and woody encroachment compared to areas with fewer rhinos removed, which were both related to a decrease in surface albedo. Increasing burnt area was further associated with higher rates of woody encroachment, indirectly reinforcing the negative effect of rhino loss on albedo. Our study demonstrates that removals of megagrazers in HiP were related to complex ecosystem-wide cascades with measurable impacts on land cover and surface albedo and consequences on climate forcing. This highlights the importance of restoring functional ecosystems by reinstating trophic processes."
10.1088/1748-9326/ada459,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇研究论文关注的是气候变化对喀麦隆耐热玉米产量的影响以及适应策略。研究使用作物模型APSIM模拟不同气候情景下（包括考虑人为气候变化和不考虑人为气候变化的场景）玉米产量，评估耐热玉米品种的适应潜力。该研究与大气环境遥感技术关联不大，因为它主要关注的是地面作物模型模拟和气候变化影响，而非利用遥感技术观测大气成分或进行大气环境监测。,[],Lennart Jansen;Sabine Undorf;Christoph Gornott,Current and future adaptation potential of heat-tolerant maize in Cameroon: a combined attribution and adaptation study,"Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to be exposed to substantial climate change hazards, especially in its agricultural sector, so adaptation will be necessary to safeguard crop yields. Tropical and subtropical maize production regions approach critical temperature thresholds in the growing season already in today’s climate, and climate change might already be contributing to this. In this study we analyse the impact of anthropogenic climate change on maize yields and the potential for adaptation in Cameroon. We innovate by introducing a counterfactual climate as baseline to a definition for adaptation potential proposed in the literature to assess the relative benefit heat-tolerant crop varieties have already under current and under projected climate change. Spatially detailed simulations of maize yields are performed using the process-based crop model APSIM with W5E5 reanalysis data and bias-corrected and downscaled climate model data from CMIP6/ISIMIP3b for counterfactual, historical and projected future climate scenarios SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0. It is found that unadapted maize yields experience significant losses under all climate change scenarios, with mean losses of 0.3 t ha−1 for the current period compared to the counterfactual climate without anthropogenic climate forcings and that yields are significantly higher for the heat-tolerant varieties across all scenarios simulated. Yield impacts of heat tolerance are highest under projected climate change, making it effective climate change adaptation. This result is robust to the exact value of parameterised heat tolerance. Breeding heat-tolerant varieties as parameterised in this study can be an effective adaptation but is still not enough to mitigate simulated losses under a high-emissions scenario."
10.1088/1748-9326/ada8c3,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文关注的是中国实现碳中和目标的路径，研究了自然-社会耦合系统框架下，碳中和目标对能源需求、碳排放和经济的影响。它使用了一个耦合了中国能源模型和北京气候中心地球系统模式的框架，模拟了自然和社会系统之间的双向反馈。研究结果表明，这种反馈会增加对电力需求，提高减排压力和碳价，并且碳中和并不能消除所有负面气候影响，可能严重影响中国气候脆弱行业的经济产出。因此，论文强调需要从耦合的自然-社会系统角度规划中国的碳中和路径。该研究主要关注气候变化的经济和社会影响，以及能源政策和减排策略，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）关系不大。,[],Tianpeng Wang;Yixiong Lu;Fei Teng;Xiliang Zhang;Xiaoye Zhang;Min Wei;Tongwen Wu;Deying Wang;Jing Sun;Junting Zhong,Coupling natural-social models can better quantify the interactions in achieving carbon neutrality in China,"Human activities have greatly altered Earth’s radiative balance, necessitating assessments that couple natural and social systems to address the resulting impacts and interactions. However, traditional Earth System Models (ESMs) and integrated assessment models often split to simulate changes in the two systems and neglect the feedback between these systems, limiting our understanding of the pathways to carbon neutrality, the associated global warming level and climate change impacts. This study constructs a coupled natural-social systems framework to bridge this gap, integrating the China-in-global energy model with the Beijing Climate Center ESM version 1. The results show that bidirectional feedbacks in the natural-social system increase the demand for electricity under China’s carbon neutrality target, increasing the pressure to reduce emissions and driving up the carbon prices. Meanwhile, carbon neutrality does not eliminate all negative climate impacts and can substantially reduce the economic output of climate-vulnerable sectors in China, highlighting the need for early adaptation measures. This study emphasizes the importance of planning China’s climate neutrality pathways from a coupled natural-social system perspective."
10.5194/acp-25-555-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了利用卫星观测数据对欧洲钢铁厂一氧化碳排放量的估算。研究者使用了TROPOMI卫星数据，结合WRF气象模式和反演方法，对21家钢铁厂的CO排放量进行了估算，并与欧洲污染物排放和转移登记册(E-PRTR)报告的排放量进行了比较。结果显示，卫星估算结果与报告值总体吻合较好，但也存在一些差异。研究发现，对于一些排放量较低或位于沿海地区的工厂，卫星观测的约束性较弱。此外，研究还利用横截面通量法对主要排放源进行了验证，并对部分排放量波动较大的工厂进行了2020年的数据分析。这项研究表明，卫星遥感技术可以有效地用于验证和改进工业排放清单，提高空气质量监测的精度。,"['carbon monoxide', 'air quality monitoring', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'TROPOMI', 'emission inventory', 'inverse modeling', 'European iron and steel plants']",Gijs Leguijt;Joannes D.

Segers;Tobias Borsdorff;Ivar R. van der Velde;Ilse Aben,Comparing space-based to reported carbon monoxide emission estimates for Europe's iron and steel plants,"The production of steel coincides with large emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants including carbon monoxide. European facilities are required to report their emissions, which are estimated using a variety of methods. We evaluate these estimates using carbon monoxide concentrations measured via satellite. We find generally good agreement between our values and those reported but also identify some uncertainties, showing that satellites can provide insights into these emissions. 
 We use satellite observations of carbon monoxide (CO) to estimate CO emissions from European integrated iron and steel plants, the continent's highest-emitting CO point sources. We perform analytical inversions to estimate emissions from 21 individual plants using observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) for 2019. As prior emissions, we use values reported by the facilities to the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR). These reported emissions vary in estimation methodology, including both measurements and calculations. With the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, we perform an ensemble of simulations with different transport settings to best replicate the observed emission plumes for each day and site. Comparing the inversion-based emission estimates to the E-PRTR reports, nine of the plants agree within uncertainties. For the remaining plants, we generally find lower emission rates than reported. Our posterior emission estimates are well constrained by the satellite observations (90 % of the plants have averaging kernel sensitivities above 0.7) except for a few low-emitting or coastal sites. We find agreement between our inversion results and emissions we estimate using the cross-sectional flux (CSF) method for the seven most strongly emitting plants, building further confidence in the inversion estimates. Finally, for four plants with large year-to-year variability in reported emission rates or large differences between the reported emission rate and our posterior estimate, we extend our analysis to 2020. We find no evidence in either the observed carbon monoxide concentrations or our inversion results for strong changes in emission rates. This demonstrates how satellites can be used to identify potential uncertainties in reported emissions."

Maasakkers,Satellite quantification of methane emissions from South American countries: a high-resolution inversion of TROPOMI and GOSAT observations,"We quantify 2021 methane emissions in South America at up to 25 km × 25 km resolution using satellite methane observations. We find a 55 % upward adjustment to anthropogenic emission inventories, including those reported to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change under the Paris Agreement. Our estimates match inventories for Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay but are much higher for other countries. Livestock emissions (65 % of anthropogenic emissions) show the largest discrepancies. 
 We use 2021 TROPOMI and GOSAT satellite observations of atmospheric methane in an analytical inversion to quantify national methane emissions from South America at up to 25 km × 25 km resolution. From the inversion, we derive optimal posterior estimates of methane emissions, adjusting a combination of national anthropogenic emission inventories reported by individual countries to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the UNFCCC-based Global Fuel Exploitation Inventory (GFEIv2), and the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGARv7) as prior estimates. We also evaluate two alternative wetland emission inventories (WetCHARTs and LPJ-wsl) as prior estimates. Our best posterior estimates for wetland emissions are consistent with previous inventories for the Amazon but lower for the Pantanal and higher for the Paraná. Our best posterior estimate of South American anthropogenic emissions is 48 (41–56) Tg a−1, where numbers in parentheses are the range from our inversion ensemble. This is 55 % higher than our prior estimate and is dominated by livestock (65 % of anthropogenic total). We find that TROPOMI and GOSAT observations can effectively optimize and separate national emissions by sector for 10 of the 13 countries and territories in the region, 7 of which account for 93 % of continental anthropogenic emissions: Brazil (19 (16–23) Tg a−1), Argentina (9.2 (7.9–11) Tg a−1), Venezuela (7.0 (5.5–9.9) Tg a−1), Colombia (5.0 (4.4–6.7) Tg a−1), Peru (2.4 (1.6–3.9) Tg a−1), Bolivia (0.96 (0.66–1.2) Tg a−1), and Paraguay (0.93 (0.88–1.0) Tg a−1). Our estimates align with the prior estimates for Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay but are significantly higher for other countries. Emissions in all countries are dominated by livestock (mainly enteric fermentation) except for oil–gas in Venezuela and landfills in Peru. Methane intensities from the oil–gas industry are high in Venezuela (33 %), Colombia (6.5 %), and Argentina (5.9 %). The livestock sector shows the largest difference between our top-down estimate and the UNFCCC prior estimates, and even countries using complex bottom-up methods report UNFCCC emissions significantly lower than our posterior estimate. These discrepancies could stem from underestimations in IPCC-recommended bottom-up calculations or uncertainties in the inversion from aggregation error and the prior spatial distribution of emissions."
10.5194/acp-25-727-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了南极中山站气溶胶光学厚度(AOD)的季节性、月性和昼夜变化，以及与气象参数（温度、风速、湿度）之间的关系。使用了CE318-T光度计的观测数据，分析了AOD和Ångström指数(AE)的变化，并结合后向轨迹分析探讨了气溶胶的来源。研究发现，冬季和春季AOD较高，主要由粗模态粒子贡献；夏季和秋季AOD较高，主要由细模态粒子增长引起。AOD与温度呈正相关，与风速和湿度呈负相关。海洋来源的粗粒子是高AOD值的主要贡献者，而低AOD值天数的气溶胶主要来自南极高原。本研究通过地面观测数据，提高了对南极沿海地区气溶胶光学特性和季节变化的认识，特别是补充了极夜期间AOD数据的缺乏，为气候模型研究提供了有价值的参考。这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为研究使用了地面光度计进行AOD观测，这属于大气成分分析和空气质量监测的范畴。,"['Aerosol Optical Depth', 'AOD', 'Ångström Exponent', 'AE', 'Air Quality Monitoring', 'Ground-based Photometer', 'Atmospheric Composition', 'Aerosol Size Distribution', 'Meteorological Parameters', 'Backward Trajectory Analysis', 'Antarctica']",Lijing Chen;Lei Zhang;Yong She;Zhaoliang Zeng;Yu Zheng;Biao Tian;Wenqian Zhang;Zhaohui Liu;Huizheng Che;Minghu Ding,Measurement report: Analysis of aerosol optical depth variation at Zhongshan Station in Antarctica,"Aerosol optical depth (AOD) at Zhongshan Station varies seasonally, with lower values in summer and higher values in winter. Winter and spring AOD increases due to reduced fine-mode particles, while summer and autumn increases are linked to particle growth. Diurnal AOD variation correlates positively with temperature but negatively with wind speed and humidity. Backward trajectories show that aerosols on high-AOD (low-AOD) days primarily originate from the ocean (interior Antarctica). 
 Our understanding of aerosol optical depth (AOD) in Antarctica remains limited due to the scarcity of ground observation stations and limited daylight days. Utilizing data from the CE318-T photometer spanning January 2020 to April 2023 at Zhongshan Station, we analyzed the seasonal, monthly, and diurnal variations in AOD and the Ångström exponent (AE). AOD median values increased from spring (0.033) to winter (0.115), while AE peaked during summer (1.010) and autumn (1.034), declining in winter (0.381), indicating a transition in dominant aerosol particle size from fine to coarse mode between summer and winter. Monthly mean AOD variation closely paralleled the proportion of AE < 1, suggesting fluctuations in coarse-mode particle proportions drive AOD variation. The high AOD values during winter and spring were associated with an increased contribution of coarse-mode particles, while high AOD values during summer and autumn were associated with the growth of fine-mode particles. We observed a peak in AOD (∼ 0.06) at 14:00 local time (LT) at Zhongshan Station, possibly associated with a slight decrease in boundary layer height (BLH). Additionally, higher (lower) wind speeds corresponded to lower (higher) AOD values, indicating the diffusion (accumulation) effect. The temperature and AOD showed an insignificant positive correlation (R = 0.22, p = 0.40), and relative humidity exhibited a significant negative correlation with AOD (R = −0.59, p = 0.02). Backward trajectory analysis revealed that coarse particles from the ocean predominantly contributed to high AOD daily mean values, while fine particles on low-AOD days originated mainly from the air mass over the Antarctic Plateau.This study enhances the understanding of the optical properties and seasonal behaviors of aerosols in the coastal Antarctic. Specifically, AOD measurements during the polar night address the lack of validation data for winter AOD simulations. Additionally, we revealed that lower wind speeds, higher temperatures, and lower relative humidity contribute to increased AOD at Zhongshan Station, and air masses from the ocean significantly impact local AOD levels. These findings help us infer AOD variation patterns in the coastal Antarctic based on meteorological changes, providing valuable insights for climate modeling in the context of global climate change."
10.5194/acp-25-771-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究的是全球大气化学模型GEOS-Chem对二次无机气溶胶（SNA）模拟的准确性。研究发现，该模型对硝酸盐的模拟严重高估，而对硫酸盐的模拟相对较好。这表明模型在硝酸盐模拟方面存在缺陷。论文利用11个飞行实验的数据评估模型性能，并通过改变排放量、干湿沉降和化学反应路径等参数进行敏感性测试，试图找出造成硝酸盐模拟偏差的原因。尽管如此，这些改进对模型的整体性能提升有限。研究指出，需要进一步研究以改进对硝酸盐及其相关过程的描述，以提高模型的预测精度，避免在空气质量、健康和气候影响等政策相关研究中产生偏差。 这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为准确的二次无机气溶胶模拟依赖于对大气成分的准确观测，而卫星观测和飞机观测都是重要的遥感手段。,"['Secondary inorganic aerosols', 'Nitrate', 'Sulfate', 'Ammonium', 'Air quality', 'Atmospheric chemistry model', 'GEOS-Chem', 'Aircraft campaigns', 'Satellite observations', 'Remote sensing']",Olivia G.

Nowak;Johannes Schneider;André Welti,Exploring the processes controlling secondary inorganic aerosol: evaluating the global GEOS-Chem simulation using a suite of aircraft campaigns,"This study finds that one component of secondary inorganic aerosols, nitrate, is greatly overestimated by a global atmospheric chemistry model compared to observations from 11 flight campaigns. None of the loss and production pathways explored can explain the nitrate bias alone. The model’s inability to capture the variability in the observations remains and requires future investigation to avoid biases in policy-related studies (i.e., air quality, health, climate impacts of these aerosols). 
 Secondary inorganic aerosols (sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium, SNA) are major contributors to fine particulate matter. Predicting concentrations of these species is complicated by the cascade of processes that control their abundance, including emissions, chemistry, thermodynamic partitioning, and removal. In this study, we use 11 flight campaigns to evaluate the GEOS-Chem model performance for SNA. Across all the campaigns, the model performance is best for sulfate (R2 = 0.51; normalized mean bias (NMB) = 0.11) and worst for nitrate (R2=0.22; NMB = 1.76), indicating substantive model deficiencies in the nitrate simulation. Thermodynamic partitioning reproduces the total particulate nitrate well (R2=0.79; NMB = 0.09), but actual partitioning (i.e., ε(NO3-)= NO3- / TNO3) is challenging to assess given the limited sets of full gas- and particle-phase observations needed for ISORROPIA II. In particular, ammonia observations are not often included in aircraft campaigns, and more routine measurements would help constrain sources of SNA model bias. Model performance is sensitive to changes in emissions and dry and wet deposition, with modest improvements associated with the inclusion of different chemical loss and production pathways (i.e., acid uptake on dust, N2O5 uptake, and NO3- photolysis). However, these sensitivity tests show only modest reduction in the nitrate bias, with no improvement to the model skill (i.e., R2), implying that more work is needed to improve the description of loss and production of nitrate and SNA as a whole."

These results highlight the profound impact of geostationary satellite observations in advancing air quality forecasting models, thereby contributing to future models for health exposure to air pollution. 
 Air quality forecasting plays a critical role in mitigating air pollution. However, current physics-based air pollution predictions encounter challenges in accuracy and spatiotemporal resolution due to limitations in the understanding of atmospheric physical mechanisms, observational constraints, and computational capacity. The world's first geostationary satellite UV–Vis spectrometer, i.e., the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS), offers hourly measurements of atmospheric trace gas pollutants at high spatial resolution over East Asia. In this study, we successfully incorporate geostationary satellite observations into a neural network model (GeoNet) to forecast full-coverage surface nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations over eastern China at 4 h intervals for the next 24 h. GeoNet leverages spatiotemporal series of satellite NO2 observations to capture the intricate relationships among air quality, meteorology, and emissions in both temporal and spatial domains. Evaluation against ground-based measurements demonstrates that GeoNet accurately predicts diurnal variations and spatial distribution details of next-day NO2 pollution, yielding a coefficient of determination of 0.68 and a root mean square of error of 12.31 µg m−3, significantly surpassing traditional air quality model forecasts. The model's interpretability reveals that geostationary satellite observations notably improve NO2 forecast capability more than other input features, especially over polluted regions. Our findings demonstrate the significant potential of geostationary satellite observations in artificial-intelligence-based air quality forecasting, with implications for early warning of air pollution events and human health exposure."

Carmichael;Sang Seo Park;Jhoon Kim,"Aerosol layer height (ALH) retrievals from oxygen absorption bands: intercomparison and validation among different satellite platforms, GEMS, EPIC, and TROPOMI","We compare passive aerosol layer height (ALH) retrievals from the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC), TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), and Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) with lidar. GEMS shows a lower correlation (R = 0.64) than EPIC and TROPOMI (R > 0.7) but with minimal bias (0.1 km vs. overestimated by ~0.8 km). GEMS performance is improved for an ultraviolet aerosol index ≥ 3. EPIC and GEMS ALH diurnal variation differs slightly. 
 The vertical distribution of aerosols is crucial for assessing surface air quality and its impact on the climate. Although aerosol vertical structures can be complex, assuming a certain shape for the aerosol vertical profile allows for the retrieval of a single parameter – aerosol layer height (ALH) – from passive remote sensing measurements. In this study, we evaluate ALH products retrieved using oxygen absorption measurements from multiple satellite platforms: the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) focusing on Asia, the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) in deep space, and the polar-orbiting TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). We use the extinction-weighted aerosol optical centroid height (AOCH) derived from aerosol extinction profiles of Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) as the ground truth. The differences due to the inconsistent definitions of ALH in various retrieval algorithms are investigated and eliminated before comparison. We select multiple dust and smoke cases under ideal observational conditions, referred to as “golden days”, for the evaluation. Given the significant role of aerosol optical depth (AOD) in ALH retrieval, we first evaluate the AOD from these retrievals against the ground-based AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET). Results show that the GEMS AOD at 440 nm has better agreement with the AERONET AOD of the ∼ 0.9 correlation coefficient (R) than that at 680 nm, both of which underestimate with a negative bias. In contrast, EPIC and TROPOMI tend to overestimate AOD by 0.33 and 0.23 for dust cases, while the bias for smoke plumes is small. Evaluation of ALH against CALIOP demonstrates that the EPIC/TROPOMI ALH has good consistency (R > 0.7) with CALIOP but is overestimated by approximately 0.8 km. The GEMS ALH displays minimal bias (0.1 km) but a slightly lower correlation (R = 0.64). Intercomparisons between three passive retrievals indicate that GEMS retrievals have a limited consistency with EPIC and TROPOMI of 0.3–0.4 R, while GEMS underestimates with ALHs of ∼ 0.3 and ∼ 0.6 km compared with TROPOMI and EPIC, respectively. The correlations improve under conditions of higher absorbing aerosols (UVAI ≥ 3), as the signal in the oxygen absorption band (O2–O2 used by GEMS) is enhanced. Although the ALH diurnal cycle from EPIC and GEMS shows some differences, they both demonstrate ALH descent in the afternoon, which might be related to the boundary layer process. Case studies show that the EPIC ALH indicates a morning ascent to around 4.5 km, while the GEMS ALH remains stable before descending to below 3 km in the afternoon."
10.5194/amt-18-351-2025,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这篇论文提出了一种利用Ku频段电视卫星信号衰减来估算降水量的新方法。该方法利用双通道技术，克服了单通道方法中大气自然辐射干扰的影响，提高了降水估算的精度。研究在法国和科特迪瓦进行了验证，结果表明该方法与雨量计测量结果相比，能够更好地估算降水量，尤其是在整体降水累积量方面。虽然该方法在科特迪瓦的应用中仍然存在低估降水的问题，但这为未来的研究提供了方向。该研究属于大气环境遥感技术范畴，利用卫星信号（TV-SAT）进行降水监测，可应用于洪水监测等领域。,"['precipitation estimation', 'microwave links', 'TV-SAT', 'rain rate', 'Ku frequency band', 'rain gauge', 'satellite observations', 'flood monitoring', 'atmospheric attenuation']",Louise Gelbart;Laurent Barthès;François Mercier-Tigrine;Aymeric Chazottes;Cécile Mallet,Enhanced quantitative precipitation estimation through the opportunistic use of Ku TV-SAT links via a dual-channel procedure,"In this paper, we present and evaluate a new method for the quantitative estimation of precipitation from a low-cost sensor. Based on previous work measuring the attenuation of an electromagnetic signal from a broadcast television satellite, we make this approach more accurate so it can be easily deployed and used operationally in areas where rainfall measurements are critical for applications like flood monitoring. In this article, the method is validated in France and applied in Côte d'Ivoire. 
 Earth–satellite microwave links such as TV-SAT can help for rainfall monitoring and could be a complement or an alternative to ground-based weather radars, rain gauges or Earth observation satellites. Rain-induced attenuation which is harmful for telecommunication is exploited here as an opportunistic way to estimate rain rate along the link path. This technique provides rain measurements at a fine temporal resolution (a few tens of seconds) and with a spatial resolution of a few kilometres, which is a good compromise for human activities such as civil security (watershed monitoring, flash flood), agriculture or transport. The advantages of this technique include the low cost of the equipment used, as well as the cost of on-site maintenance. However, the measured attenuation does not directly provide rain intensity,  requiring the estimation of additional parameters. These include the contribution of natural radiation from the atmosphere. In this paper, we detail a theoretical framework allowing us to estimate rainfall from the measurements of a low-cost sensor operating simultaneously over two parts of the Ku frequency band. This framework is assessed in a densely instrumented area in the south of France, where very good results are obtained when compared to rain gauge measurements, in terms of both overall rain accumulation and rainfall rate distribution. Then we apply this dual-channel method in Côte d'Ivoire, in the metropolitan area of Abidjan, where such an approach is very promising. It is shown that this technique when compared to rain gauge measurements gives far better results than a naive single-channel approach neglecting the natural radiation of atmosphere but that significant errors remain in rainfall assessment, leading to a persistent underestimation of rain accumulation. Finally we discuss various effects that could lead to this remaining underestimation, opening the door for further studies."

Rain rate (R) was derived from reflectivity (Z) and specific differential phase (kdp) using the Z(R) and R(kdp) estimators. Z was corrected using the single-polarization Hitschfeld-Bordan (HB) and the dual-polarization philinear methods. Their strengths, limitations, and pre-processing steps were detailed. R(kdp) coefficients were calculated from radar observations. 
 Weather radar observations and quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) are in the early stages of development in the South-West Indian Ocean (SWIO) region, which is prone to heavy rainfall, particularly during the passage of tropical cyclones. Given the topography of SWIO islands, orography plays an important role in the spatial distribution of precipitation. The ESPOIRS project was designed to investigate such dynamics in Reunion Island, Seychelles, and Madagascar using a mobile X-band radar. Reunion Island served as a testbed to evaluate X-band radar retrieved QPE using specific comparisons between several radar approaches and available rain gauges. This is the first study to use an X-band dual-polarization radar in the SWIO region. Our research focuses on the intense tropical cyclone event Batsirai in Reunion Island and shows the effectiveness of dual-polarization radar when compared to single-polarization radar in mitigating reflectivity attenuation. Both the Hitschfeld and Bordan and the philinear algorithms were employed and evaluated for this purpose. As our study encountered challenges related to noisy and low-resolution differential phase (𝜙𝑑𝑝) data, we detailed the pre-processing steps used to extract reliable 𝜙𝑑𝑝 data from the observed measurements. Furthermore, we tested two precipitation estimators, R(Z) and R(kdp). We observed that the accuracy of R(Z) depends on the attenuation correction method. Additionally, using the extracted 𝜙𝑑𝑝, we calculated an empirical model for R(kdp) for Reunion Island. This model provided better results compared to the R(Z) estimates, which can be explained by the fact that kdp is directly linked to precipitation concentration and does not require attenuation correction. Our findings highlight that the accuracy of the radar QPE is strongly influenced by local topography, which in turn governs local rainfall patterns, while the accuracy of QPE also depends on the type of precipitation."

The merged datasets exhibit significantly improved accuracy compared to the original satellite data. These results can provide more reliable estimates of aerosol scattering and absorption properties, essential for improving climate modeling and assessing aerosol climate effects. 
 Accurate global aerosol single scattering albedo (SSA) data is critical for assessing aerosol radiative effects and identifying aerosol composition. However, current satellite-based SSA retrievals are both limited and highly uncertain, whereas the more accurate ground-based observations lack global coverage. In this study, we employ an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) data synergy technique to construct two monthly mean SSA datasets over land by synergizing OMI and POLDER with AERONET observations respectively, namely Merged-OMI and Merged-POLDER dataset. The background ensemble is constructed with 231/106 members using all monthly mean OMI/POLDER SSA available to represent the variability of SSA field. Then AERONET measurements are assimilated into each satellite dataset using the EnKF approach. The merged datasets show substantial improvements against the original products, with the correlation coefficient increased by up to 100 %, and the mean absolute bias (MAB) and root mean square error (RMSE) reduced by more than 30 % compared with AERONET results. Cross validation using independent AERONET observations shows an average increase of 70 % in correlation, 15 % reduction in RMSE and 14 % reduction in MAB for Merged-OMI dataset, and similar although weaker improvement for Merged-POLDER mainly due to the smaller sample size.  This study confirms the effectiveness of the EnKF technique in extending the information obtained from ground stations to larger regions. The two merged datasets generated in this study can offer more accurate SSA estimates for assessing aerosol radiative forcing and improving climate modeling, serving as an important resource for advancing global aerosol research."

 The turnover time (τ) of global soil organic carbon is central to the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Yet our spatially-explicit understanding of depth-dependent variations and environmental controls of τ at a global scale remain incomplete. In this study, we combine multiple state-of-the-art observation-based datasets, including over ninety thousand geo-referenced soil profiles, the latest root observations distributed globally, and large amounts of satellite-derived environmental variables, to generate global maps of apparent τ in topsoil (0–0.3 m) and subsoil (0.3–1 m) layers with a spatial resolution of 30 arcsec (~1 km at the Equator). We show that subsoil τ (385203485 years [mean with a variation range from 2.5th to 97.5th percentile]) is over eight times longer than topsoil τ (1511137 years). The cross-validation shows that the fitted machine learning models effectively captured the variabilities in τ, with R2 values of 0.87 and 0.70 for topsoil and subsoil τ mapping, respectively. The prediction uncertainties of the τ maps were quantified for better user applications. The environmental controls on top- and subsoil τ were investigated at global, biome, and local scales. Our analyses illustrate that how temperature, water availability, physio-chemical properties and depth exert jointly impacts on τ. The data-driven approaches allow us to identify their interactions, thereby enriching our comprehension of mechanisms driving nonlinear τ–environment relationships from global to local scales. The distributions of dominating factors of τ at local scales were mapped for identifying context-dependent controls on τ across different regions. We further reveal that the current Earth system models may underestimate τ by comparing model-derived maps with our observation-derived τ maps. The resulting maps with new insights demonstrated in this study facilitate the future modelling efforts of carbon cycle–climate feedbacks and supporting effective carbon management.

It provides essential insights for further research into these processes. 
 Evapotranspiration (ET) and gross primary production (GPP) are critical fluxes contributing to the energy, water, and carbon exchanges between the atmosphere and the land surface. Land surface models such as the Community Land Model v5 (CLM5) quantify these fluxes, estimate the state of carbon budgets and water resources, and contribute to a better understanding of climate change's impact on ecosystems. Past studies have shown the ability of CLM5 to model ET and GPP magnitudes well but emphasized systematic underestimations and lower variability than in the observations.Here, we evaluated CLM5's predictions of water and energy fluxes using observations from eddy covariance stations from the Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS), remote sensing, and reanalysis data sets. We assess simulated ET and GPP from the grid scale (CLM5grid) and the plant functional type (PFT) scale (CLM5PFT). CLM5PFT exhibited a low systematic error in simulating the ET at the ICOS sites (average bias of −4.68 %), indicating that PFT-specific ET closely matches the observations' magnitude. GPP was underestimated by CLM5PFT, especially in deciduous forests (bias of −43.76 %). The results showed an underestimation of the spatiotemporal variability in the simulated ET and GPP distribution moments across PFTs for both CLM setups compared to reanalysis data and remote-sensing products. These findings provide essential insights for improving land surface models, highlighting the need to enhance the CLM5's ability to capture the spatiotemporal variability in ET and GPP simulations across PFTs."

This study used 19 months of Doppler Lidar data from Qingdao, China, to examine IEC associated with gusts. We found IECs occurred 15% of the time at 50 m height. When near‐surface wind speeds exceeded 11 m·s−1, IEC frequency and intensity increased, indicating that strong winds are a critical driver of IEC. This study suggests that the reduction in the drag coefficient under high wind conditions may generate IEC and gusts, consequently influencing energy transfer throughout the boundary layer and lower troposphere. Analysis using the four‐quadrant model revealed IECs are linked to changes in momentum from ejections and inward interactions, even in weak background fields. The study supports that IECs are more prevalent and highlights their role in the lower atmosphere, contributing to an improved understanding of land‐atmosphere coupling."

We also detected a stronger greening trend on west‐ than east‐ facing slopes over the entire TP grassland from 1991 to 2020. These disparities result from distinct microclimates on the two contrasting slopes: west‐facing slopes tend to be wetter and colder than east‐facing slopes under similar background climate. Our findings underscore the crucial role of slope orientation in shaping vegetation greenness and its response to climate change."

Here, we examine whether AEW strength or sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are the primary drivers of TC genesis. Regional model simulations were performed to address how increased AEW strength and SSTs affect the frequency of AEWs that develop into TCs in a year with below‐average TCs with AEW origins and SSTs. We found that environmental favorability plays a larger role than AEW strength in driving the frequency of TCs with AEW origins. Strengthening the AEWs did not affect the frequency of AEWs that develop into TCs due to low environmental favorability. Warmer SSTs led to increased environmental favorability and a statistically significant increase in TCs with AEW origins."

Revell,Constraining the Uncertainty Associated With Sea Salt Aerosol Parameterizations in Global Models Using Nudged UKESM1‐AMIP Simulations,"Sea salt is the largest source of natural aerosol in the atmosphere by mass. Formed when ocean waves break and bubbles burst, sea salt aerosols (SSA) influence Earth's climate via direct and indirect processes. Models participating in the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison project (CMIP6) demonstrate a negative effective radiative forcing (ERF) when SSA emissions are doubled. However, the magnitude of the ERF ranges widely from −0.35 ± $\pm $ 0.04 W m−2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$ to −2.28 ± $\pm $ 0.07 W m−2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$, with the largest difference over the Southern Ocean. Differences in the response to doubled SSA emissions arise from model uncertainty (e.g., individual model physics, aerosol size distribution) and parameterization uncertainty (e.g., how SSA is produced in the model). Here, we perform single‐model experiments with UKESM1‐AMIP incorporating all of the SSA parameterizations used by the current generation of CMIP6 Earth system models (ESMs). Using a fixed SSA size distribution, our experiments show that the parameterization uncertainty causes large inter‐model diversity in SSA emissions in the models, particularly over the tropics and the Southern Ocean. The choice of parameterization influences the ambient aerosol size distribution, cloud condensation nuclei and cloud droplet number concentrations, and therefore direct and indirect radiative forcing. We recommend that modeling groups evaluate their SSA parameterizations and update them where necessary in preparation for future model intercomparison activities."

To enhance the comparison we use a lidar instrument simulator to derive cloud statistics from the reanalyses which account for instrumental factors. The cloud occurrence in the three reanalyses is slightly overestimated above 3 km, but displays a larger underestimation below 3 km relative to observations. Unlike previous studies, we see no relationship between relative humidity and cloud occurrence biases, suggesting that the cloud biases do not result from the representation of moisture. We also show that the seasonal variation of cloud occurrence and cloud fraction, defined as the vertically integrated cloud occurrence, are small in both the observations and the reanalyses. We also examine the quality of the cloud representation for a set of weather states derived from ERA5 surface winds. The variability associated with grouping cloud occurrence based on weather state is much larger than the seasonal variation, highlighting weather state is a strong control of cloud occurrence. All the reanalyses continue to display underestimates below 3 km and overestimates above 3 km for each weather state. But the variability in ERA5 statistics matches the changes in the observations better than the other reanalyses. We also use a machine learning scheme to estimate the quantity of supercooled liquid water cloud from the ceilometer observations. Ceilometer low‐level supercooled liquid water cloud occurrences are considerably larger than values derived from the reanalyses, further highlighting the poor representation of low‐level clouds in the reanalyses."

 Electron ptychography, recognized as an ideal technique for low-dose imaging, consistently achieves deep sub-angstrom resolution at electron doses of several thousand electrons per square angstrom (e−/Å2) or higher. Despite its proven efficacy, the application of electron ptychography at even lower doses—necessary for materials highly sensitive to electron beams—raises questions regarding its feasibility and the attainable resolution under such stringent conditions. Herein, we demonstrate the implementation of near-atomic-resolution ( ~ 2 Å) electron ptychography reconstruction at electron doses as low as ~100 e−/Å2, for metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which are known for their extreme sensitivity. The reconstructed images clearly resolve organic linkers, metal clusters, and even atomic columns within these clusters, while unravelling various local structural features in MOFs, including missing linkers, extra clusters, and surface termination modes. By combining the findings from simulations and experiments, we have identified that employing a small convergence semi-angle during data acquisition is crucial for effective iterative ptychographic reconstruction under such low-dose conditions. This important insight advances our understanding of the rapidly evolving electron ptychography technique and provides a novel approach to high-resolution imaging of various sensitive materials.

 Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) method leverages spatial diversity to enhance the performance of wireless communications and is expected to be a key technology enabling for high-speed data services in the forthcoming sixth generation (6G) networks. However, the antenna array commonly used in the traditional massive MIMO cannot meet the requirements of low cost, low complexity and high spatial resolution simultaneously, especially in higher frequency bands. Hence it is important to achieve a feasible hardware platform to support theoretical study of the holographic MIMO communications. Here, we propose a near-field holographic MIMO communication architecture based on programmable digital coding metasurface (PDCM) and electromagnetic theory. The orthogonal holographic patterns on the transmitting and receiving apertures are firstly obtained using the Hilbert-Schmidt decomposition of the radiation operator. Then the information to be transmitted is pre-encoded on PDCM following the principle of direct digital modulations. A PDCM-based holographic MIMO prototype is designed and experimentally verified in microwave frequencies. The measured results of constellations show that the prototype can realize dual-channel signal transmissions under quadrature-phase shift keying scheme. The proposed paradigm features low complexity, low cost and low power consumption, and may become a valuable technique in beyond fifth generation and 6G wireless communications.

 Richardson-Lucy (RL) deconvolution optimizes the likelihood of the object estimate for an incoherent imaging system. It can offer an increase in contrast, but converges poorly, and shows enhancement of noise as the iteration progresses. We have discovered the underlying reason for this problematic convergence behaviour using a Cramér Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) analysis. An analytical expression for the CRLB diverges for spatial frequency components that approach the diffraction limit from below. The resulting mean noise variance per pixel diverges for large images.

 (K,Na)NbO3-based ceramics are deemed among the most promising lead-free piezoelectric materials, though their overall piezoelectric performance still lags behind the mainstream lead-containing counterparts.

Phenomenological models, phase field simulations and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy reveal that the structural flexibility originates from the high Coulomb force between K+/Na+ ions and Sb ions in the KNN-xSb system, while the grain orientation promotes the displacement of B-site cations leveraging the engineered domain configuration. As a result of its excellent comprehensive piezoelectric properties, the textured KNN-5Sb/epoxy 1-3 piezoelectric composite is found to possess a broader bandwidth BW = 60% and higher amplitude output voltage than commercial PZT-5 and other KNN counterparts.

 The Arctic–Boreal Zone is rapidly warming, impacting its large soil carbon stocks. Here we use a new compilation of terrestrial ecosystem CO2 fluxes, geospatial datasets and random forest models to show that although the Arctic–Boreal Zone was overall an increasing terrestrial CO2 sink from 2001 to 2020 (mean ± standard deviation in net ecosystem exchange, −548 ± 140 Tg C yr−1; trend, −14 Tg C yr−1; P < 0.001), more than 30% of the region was a net CO2 source. Tundra regions may have already started to function on average as CO2 sources, demonstrating a shift in carbon dynamics. When fire emissions are factored in, the increasing Arctic–Boreal Zone sink is no longer statistically significant (budget, −319 ± 140 Tg C yr−1; trend, −9 Tg C yr−1), and the permafrost region becomes CO2 neutral (budget, −24 ± 123 Tg C yr−1; trend, −3 Tg C yr−1), underscoring the importance of fire in this region.

 Winter Arctic sea ice is a crucial climate indicator, declining at an accelerated rate compared to the past and playing a significant role in Arctic amplification over recent decades. The sea-ice concentration (SIC) in the Greenland–Barents Sea (GBS) shows considerable interannual variability, yet the link between this variability and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) remains uncertain. Here, we identify a reversed relationship between the autumn Central Pacific (CP)-type ENSO and the winter GBS SIC around the mid-1980s. Observational and model experiments demonstrate that, before the mid-1980s, CP ENSO triggered a double wave pattern propagating toward the Arctic, generating a positive geopotential height anomaly in the Arctic. Such an anomaly, along with a northerly anomaly, favored cold-air advection and intrusion into the GBS, resulting in an increased SIC. After the mid-1980s, however, CP ENSO only induced a single wave train towards the Arctic, favoring a positive geopotential height anomaly over Iceland. As a result, the southerly anomaly transported abundant moisture into the GBS and consequently reduced the SIC. The variation in wave patterns can largely be attributed to the sea surface temperature anomaly in the tropical Atlantic induced by CP ENSO. Our findings highlight the unstable connection between tropical and polar regions, which provides a basis for better understanding the mechanisms of Arctic sea-ice changes."

 Aerosols, derived from natural processes and human activities, present various risks to the environment and human health. In this regard, the role of recent pollutant environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) should not be overlooked. However, the oxidative toxicity and mass transfer processes of EPFRs in liquid-phase environments remain completely understood. In this study, the dispersion characteristics of EPFRs and their contributions to the oxidation potential (OP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in sea spray and size-resolved PM were investigated and compared. The results showed that the sea spray contained fast-decaying C-centred EPFRs with a half-life of 0.32 years. The concentration ranged from 0.3 × 1013 spins/m3 to 7.5 × 1013 spins/m3. It increased as the samples approached the coast. Moreover, the size-resolved PM contained slow-decaying O-centred EPFRs with a half-life of 0.51 years. The concentration ranged from 4.57 × 1013 spins/m3 to 11.46 × 1013 spins/m3, which was higher than that of most sea spray samples. The interaction between sea spray and water mainly generated hydroxyl free radicals (54 ± 3%), whereas the size-resolved PM mainly generated organic free radicals (64 ± 5%). Correlation analysis revealed that EPFRs may be involved in ROS generation. In addition, the mass transfer of EPFRs between the PM and sea spray may have been controlled by both gas and liquid films. The concentration of EPFRs at the phase interface was calculated to be 4.92 × 1013 spins/m3. In summary, EPFRs positively contribute to OP and ROS production."

 Global warming is jeopardizing the artificial snow making conditions, shortening outdoor ski resorts opening days and increasing operation cost, severely threatening the sustainability of outdoor ski industry. The sustainability of 772 outdoor ski resorts in China under RCP 4.5 climate scenarios in 2030 s and 2050 s had been analyzed. (1) The skiing sports developed prominently during 1996 to 2023 and will boom in China in the coming decades. (2) Accelerated global warming is the main threat to the sustainability of outdoor ski resorts of China. However, snowfall isn’t a critical influencing factor in the coming decades. (3) The outdoor ski resorts in south China are facing the most threats and are the most unsustainable resorts. We proposed a nexus of Government-Operator-Skier adaptation framework for adapting climate change threats and advocating the temporal small-scale ski resorts are more adaptive as their high water and energy efficiencies for saving water and electricity resources."

 Marine gas seeps are common along tectonically active margins, but they have not been previously observed along the Arabian continental margin. Here we present evidence of gas escape structures, pockmarks, and active gas seeps in the Gulf of Oman. Multibeam bathymetry, water column backscatter and physical parameters, and two-dimensional seismic reflection data were used to map active seafloor seeps and pockmarks. Circular and crescent-shaped pockmarks and complex pockmark strings were identified. These features are confined to regions shoreward of the shelf break. Thirty-five active gas bubble trains were observed, mostly not coincident with the mapped pockmarks. With progressive gas release, the gas seeps are anticipated to lead to development of pockmarks over time. Bright spots on the seismic data indicate shallow subsurface gas accumulation alongside normal fault and fracture conduits, strongly correlated to the presence of pockmarks. These findings suggest an important carbon flux into the Arabian Sea and atmosphere.

 The Arctic Ocean’s Beaufort Gyre, the largest Arctic freshwater reservoir, plays a crucial role for climate and marine ecosystems. Understanding how it changes in a warming climate is therefore essential. Here, using high-resolution simulations and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 data, we find that the Beaufort Gyre will increasingly accumulate freshwater, elevate sea level, and spin up its circulation as the climate warms. These changes, collectively referred to as inflation, are more pronounced in the Beaufort Gyre region than in other Arctic areas, amplifying the spatial asymmetry of the Arctic Ocean. The inflation is driven by increased surface freshwater fluxes and intensified surface stress from wind strengthening and sea ice decline. Current climate models tend to underestimate this inflation, which could be alleviated by high-resolution ocean models and improved atmospheric circulation simulations. The inflation of the Beaufort Gyre underscores its growing importance in a warming climate.

 Here we use multi-waveband single scattering albedo observations from ground-based instruments and satellite to constrain black carbon aerosol's physical properties and loading over Xuzhou, China, and Dhaka, Bangladesh. Our daily high-resolution findings reveal smaller black carbon cores and spatially variable morphology dominate both regions. Column loadings reveal higher black carbon mass in Dhaka, while higher total aerosol mass and number are observed in Xuzhou. These findings reflect differences in emission sources, atmospheric conditions, and regulatory policies. Spatial analysis reveals notable enhanced black carbon along Dhaka’s urban riverbanks (8–9 mg m−2), and over rapidly changing, small industrial sites in China, indicating overlooked sources. Complex daily interactions between wind, accumulation, and dispersion challenge traditional seasonal dynamics. These findings demonstrate high-resolution data can be tailored from available remote sensing platforms, providing nuanced insights into regional air quality, enhancing assessment capabilities and informing targeted mitigation strategies.

 Surface soil moisture is projected to decrease under global warming. Such projections are mostly based on climate models, which show large uncertainty (i.e., inter-model spread) partly due to inadequate observational constraint. Here we identify strong physically-based emergent relationships between soil moisture change (2070–2099 minus 1980–2014) and recent air temperature and precipitation trends across an ensemble of climate models. We extend the commonly used univariate Emergent Constraints to a bivariate method and use observed temperature and precipitation trends to constrain global soil moisture changes. Our results show that the bivariate emergent constraints can reduce soil moisture change uncertainty by 7.87%, which is four times more effective than traditional temperature-based univariate constraints. The bivariate emergent constraints change the sign of soil moisture change from negative to positive for semi-arid, dry sub-humid and humid regions and global land as a whole, but exacerbates the drying trend in arid and hyper-arid regions. Bivariate Emergent Constraints can reduce soil moisture uncertainty by 7.87%, compared to temperature-based univariate constraints, but may worsen drying trends in arid and hyper-arid regions, according to a bivariate Emergent Constraints method, utilizing observed temperature and precipitation trends to constrain soil moisture changes."

 Air pollution is one of the most harmful consequences of industrialization because of its strong influence on both human health quality and climate in general. Often there appears a need to identify one single strong source of air pollution appearing as a result of an accident. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for a single pollution source localization. The proposed algorithm uses the source–receptor matrix concept and assumption about the linearity of pollution transport that allows us to use the pollution spread simulations backward in time. In particular realization, we make use of the weather regional forecast model WRF for airflow simulation and of Lagrangian particle dispersion simulation software FLEXPART-WRF for pollution advection simulation both forward and backward in time. As a result, our algorithm produces the semi-empirical heatmap of possible pollution source locations with marked point of the biggest probability and estimative emission intensity at this point as a function of time. The algorithm is tested on several semi-synthetic and practical cases and compared with other solutions in this field. The mean distance between the predicted and the real sources is around 7 km for the Moscow dataset with 1096 experiments and 45 km region size and around 3 km for the Regional dataset with 803 experiments and 30 km region size. We also conduct an experiment on European Tracer Experiment-1 and get a strong performance on it: distance between the real and the predicted sources is around 6 km, which is comparable or superior to other approaches."
