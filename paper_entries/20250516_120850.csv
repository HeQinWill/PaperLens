10.5194/acp-25-5021-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要探讨了对流砧状云的日变化及其对辐射平衡的影响。论文利用地球静止卫星的红外亮度温度图像和A-Train卫星星座的数据，开发了一种新的综合数据集（GATM），用于研究对流砧状云的外流过程。研究发现，白天由于短波辐射加热的强烈作用，对流系统顶部不稳定，促进了砧状云外流的增强，而夜间长波辐射冷却驱动的外流较弱。此外，砧状云外流日循环的相位变化对辐射预算有显著影响。总的来说，这项工作揭示了辐射加热如何决定砧状云外流的日变化，以及砧状云外流的日变化如何影响地球的辐射平衡。虽然该研究没有直接涉及空气质量监测或大气成分分析，但它利用了卫星观测数据来研究大气过程，并探讨了云辐射反馈，这些都与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['convective clouds', 'anvil clouds', 'radiative heating', 'radiative cooling', 'diurnal variation', 'geostationary satellites', 'infrared brightness temperature', 'A-Train constellation', 'radiative budget', 'mesoscale convective systems']",Zhenquan Wang,Anvil–radiation diurnal interaction: shortwave radiative-heating destabilization driving the diurnal variation of convective anvil outflow and its modulation on the radiative cancellation,"Convective anvil outflow directly driven by the shortwave radiative-heating destabilization is strong during the daytime, whereas the outflow contributed by the longwave radiative cooling through radiative destabilization and circulation is weak. This leads to the diurnal variation in the convection-producing anvil clouds, which in turn can influence the radiative energy budget. 
 The behavior of convection producing anvil clouds is neither well derived from current available observations nor well represented in models. In this work, a novel convective cloud data product is designed to capture the convective anvil outflow. Convective organizations and life stages are derived from the images of infrared brightness temperature (BT) of geostationary (GEO) satellites based on a variable-BT segment-tracking algorithm, which allows the possibility for quantifying the convective anvil outflow. Vertical structures of convection are measured by sensors of the A-Train constellation, which provides the cross section of convective outflow. Here, GEO-based convective tracking and A-Train-detected cloud vertical profiles are combined to develop a novel comprehensive GEO–A-Train Merged (GATM) convective cloud data product for investigating the process of convective anvil outflow.On the basis of this novel Lagrangian-view GATM data, the anvil production for mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) can be quantified. The results show that daytime MCSs can produce more anvil clouds than nighttime MCSs. During the daytime, shortwave radiative heating strongly destabilizes the MCS top to promote the anvil outflow with strong divergence, whereas the nighttime divergence driven by the longwave radiative cooling through radiative destabilization and circulation is weak. Moreover, the assessed sensitivity of the radiative budget to the diurnal-cycle phase shift of the convective anvil outflow is approximately −1 W m−2 h−1 when the phase shift is in the range between −4 and 8 h (otherwise the sensitivity has the same magnitude but positive). Stronger diurnal-cycle amplitude can further amplify this sensitivity. Overall, this work presents the observed anvil–radiation diurnal interaction process: radiative heating determines the diurnal variation of anvil outflow; in turn, the diurnal variation of anvil outflow determines the Earth's radiative budget."

Flynn III;Sascha Usenko,A modular approach to volatile organic compound samplers for tethered balloon and drone platforms,"A robust, automatic volatile organic compound (VOC) collection system was developed for vertical VOC sampling associated with the 2022 DOE ARM-program-led TRACER in Houston, Texas.  This modular sampler has been developed to measure vertical profiles of VOCs to improve near-surface characterization. This article helps fill the current lack of commercially available options for aerial VOC sampling and serves to support and encourage researchers to build and develop custom samplers. 
 Situated at a land–sea interface, Houston, Texas, is a national hub for the petrochemical industry and has the second-fastest-growing metropolitan population in the United States. Addressing air quality in this region is uniquely challenging, due in part to its wide range of meteorological conditions (e.g., convection systems and temperature inversions) and continuum of volatile organic compound (VOC) and aerosol sources (e.g., anthropogenic and biogenic). As a result, Houston was chosen as the location for the Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM)-program-led Tracking Aerosol Convection ExpeRiment (TRACER), which investigated cloud and aerosol interactions in the deep convection over the area. Deployed as a key asset, ARM's tethered balloon system (TBS) was used to investigate questions related to the vertical distributions of aerosols and their formation, including their precursor species volatile organic compounds. Platforms like TBSs and uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) can bridge the vertical gap between ground-based and crewed airplane measurement platforms to focus on near-surface characterization. However, there has been limited effort to modularize and integrate VOC samplers into instrument payloads on both aerial systems. In this study, lightweight and robust VOC samplers were designed and deployed on the TBS and a UAV to collect VOCs in flight. The modular design allowed for scalable adjustments to meet the unique platform requirements and enabled multiple flights per sampling day. Each sampler can autonomously collect VOCs on up to four sorbent tubes for subsequent thermal desorption–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis. The low sampler mass (2.2 kg and 800 g, TBS and UAV, respectively) enables the combination of these VOC samplers with trace gas, aerosol, and meteorological sensors on aerial platforms. These profiles allow us to assess temporal changes in VOC magnitude and composition at multiple locations. Observations from TBS and UAV flights during TRACER are presented and future considerations for sampler design and deployments are discussed."

While traditional methods lack flexibility and accuracy in dynamic environments, SAMURAI-S provides high maneuverability and precise 3D wind measurements. The research demonstrated the system's ability to match the data quality of conventional methods, with a slight overestimation in vertical turbulence under higher wind conditions. 
 This study introduces the SAMURAI-S, a novel measurement system that incorporates a state-of-the-art sonic anemometer combined with a multi-rotor drone in a sling load configuration, designed to overcome the limitations of traditional mast-based observations in terms of spatial flexibility. This system enables the direct measurement of 3D wind vectors while hovering, providing a significant advantage in manoeuvrability and positional accuracy over fixed mast setups. The capabilities of the system were quantified through a series of 10 to 28 min flights, conducting close comparisons of turbulence measurements at altitudes of 30 and 60 m against data from a 60 m  tower equipped with research-grade sonic anemometers. The results demonstrate that SAMURAI-S matches the data quality of conventional setups for horizontal wind measurements while slightly overestimating vertical turbulence components. This overestimation increases with wind speed."

10.5194/essd-2025-215,False,Earth System Science Data Discussions,该论文主要关注中国2000年至2020年的水土保持梯田措施数据集。它使用Landsat卫星影像和数字高程模型数据，对梯田进行分类（水平梯田、坡地梯田、之字形梯田和坡地分离梯田），并分析其时空分布和对减少土壤侵蚀的影响。该研究与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系，而是侧重于土地资源管理和水土保持。,"['soil erosion', 'land resource management', 'food security', 'water cycle', 'Landsat', 'digital elevation model']",Enwei Zhang;Yueli Chen;Shengzhao Wei;Chenli Liu;Hongna Wang;Bowen Deng;Honghong Lin;Xue Yang;Yawen Li;Xingwu Duan,A 30 m soil and water conservation terrace measures dataset of China from 2000 to 2020,"We produced the first soil and water conservation terrace measures dataset with a fine classification system on Google Earth Engine platform. This dataset included terrace data and soil and water conservation measure factor values, covering the period from 2000 to 2020. The terraces are categorized into level terrace, slope terrace, zig terrace, and slope-separated terrace. The results showed that the average overall accuracy of the terrace was 91.90 % and the average F1 score was 76.75 %. 
 Terrace, as one of the most widely distributed and heavily invested soil and water conservation (SWC) measures in China, currently lacks a comprehensive database with spatiotemporal distribution and diverse classification types. This absence significantly hampers accurate soil erosion assessment and SWC planning in China. To address this gap, we proposed a two-stage mapping framework for the different terrace measures classification to produce a new dataset named the Soil and Water Conservation Terrace Measures Dataset (SWCTMD) using time-series Landsat satellite imagery and digital elevation model data. This dataset, spanning from 2000 to 2020, incorporated a fine classification system, providing both terrace data and SWC measure factor. The terraces were classified into four types according to their features: level terrace, slope terrace, zig terrace, and slope-separated terrace. The results showed that the average overall accuracy (OA) of the terrace was 91.90 % and the average F1 score was 76.75 %. For different terrace types, the average OA was 83.50 % and the average F1 score was 52.14 %. Comparative analysis highlighted the superiority and robustness of the SWCTMD compared to existing products. This dataset revealed that terraces in China are predominantly concentrated in the Loess Plateau, Southwest and Southeast regions. From 2000 to 2020, the total terrace areas increased by 96,038.16 km2, with the largest increase occurring in slope terraces. While terrace expansion was concentrated in the Loess Plateau, and southwest and southeast of China, decreases were concentrated around urban areas. Notably, terraces reduced soil erosion of cropland by about 818 million tons in 2020. The SWCTMD enhances the accuracy of soil erosion simulations and enables long-term analysis of soil erosion trends. Moreover, the dataset offers valuable applications in earth system modelling and contributes to research on land resource management, food security, biodiversity, and water cycle. The SWCTMD is freely available at https://doi.org/10.11888/Terre.tpdc.302400 (Duan, 2025)."
10.5194/essd-2025-51,False,Earth System Science Data Discussions,该研究论文主要关注南极冰山，利用遥感技术（特别是Sentinel-1 SAR影像）创建了一个2018年至2023年的冰山数据集。该数据集记录了冰山的位置、大小和形状，并分析了冰山数量和面积的年度变化，主要与大型冰架崩解事件有关。虽然使用了遥感技术，但其重点在于冰山监测和南大洋环境研究，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,"['icebergs', 'remote sensing', 'Southern Ocean', 'ice shelf calving', 'Sentinel-1 SAR imagery']",Zilong Chen;Xuying Liu;Zhenfu Guan;Teng Li;Xiao Cheng;Tian Li;Yan Liu;Qi Liang;Lei Zheng;Jiping Liu,A Six-year circum-Antarctic icebergs dataset (2018–2023),"Our study uses Google Earth Engine to create a dataset of Antarctic icebergs in the Southern Ocean (south of 55°S) from October 2018 to 2023. The dataset includes icebergs larger than 0.04 km², with details on their locations, sizes, and shapes. It shows significant changes in iceberg number and area, mainly driven by major ice shelf calving events – especially in the Weddell Sea. This resource fills key gaps in understanding iceberg impacts on the ocean and climate. 
 The distribution of Antarctic icebergs is crucial for understanding their impact on the Southern Ocean's atmosphere and physical environment, as well as their role in global climate change. Recent advancements in iceberg databases, based on remote sensing imagery and altimetry data, have led to products like the BYU/NIC iceberg database, the Altiberg database, and high-resolution SAR-based iceberg distribution data. However, no unified database exists that integrates various iceberg scales and covers the entire Southern Ocean. Our research presents a comprehensive circum-Antarctic iceberg dataset, developed using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, covering the Southern Ocean south of 55°S. A semi‐automated classification method that integrates incremental random forest classification with manual correction was applied to extract icebergs larger than 0.04 km² , resulting in a dataset for each October from 2018 to 2023. The resulting dataset not only records the geographic coordinates and geometric attributes (area, perimeter, long axis, and short axis) of the icebergs but also provides uncertainty estimates for area and mass. The dataset reveals significant interannual variability in iceberg number and total area-the number of icebergs increased from 33,823 in 2018 to approximately 51,332 in 2021, corresponding to major ice shelf calving events (e.g., the A68a iceberg in the Weddell Sea), followed by a decline in 2022. The annual average total iceberg area is 44,518 ± 4800 km², and the average mass is 8,779 ± 3,029 Gt. Validation using test set samples and a rolling cross-validation of interannual variability shows that the integrates incremental random forest classification achieves accuracy, recall, and F1 scores exceeding 0.90, and after manual correction, all performance metrics should be even better. Comparisons with existing iceberg products (including the BYU/NIC iceberg database and the Altiberg database) indicate a high consistency in spatial distribution, while our dataset demonstrates clear advantages in terms of spatial coverage, iceberg detection scale, and identification capabilities in regions with dense sea ice. This dataset serves as a novel data resource for investigating the impact of Antarctic icebergs on the Southern Ocean, the mass balance of ice sheets, the mechanisms underlying ice shelf collapse, and the response mechanisms of iceberg disintegration to climate change."

Natali,Fusing Regional and Global Datasets to Develop a Composite Land Cover Product Across High Latitudes,"Arctic warming is causing permafrost to thaw, affecting ecosystems and climate. Since land cover, especially vegetation, shapes how permafrost responds, accurate maps are crucial. Using machine learning, we combined existing global and regional datasets to create a hybrid detailed 1-km map of Arctic-Boreal land cover, improving the representation of forests, shrubs, and wetlands across the circumpolar. 
 Rapid warming across the Arctic is the primary driver of widespread permafrost thaw, with far-reaching consequences for local ecosystem resilience, the regional carbon budget, and the global climate system. Because permafrost characteristics and vulnerability are tightly linked to land cover, particularly vegetation type and surface properties, understanding these dynamics requires accurate and detailed land cover information. Spatial variation in vegetation cover influences energy balance, snow insulation, and soil moisture, factors that directly affect permafrost stability. Consequently, high-resolution land cover products are essential for assessing the ecological impacts of permafrost thaw and for improving the representation of permafrost-related processes in predictive models. However, many global land cover datasets fail to capture the spatial heterogeneity and fine-scale ecological features that influence permafrost dynamics, while more detailed regional products often lack coverage across broader, continental extents. This gap presents a challenge for large-scale assessments of permafrost vulnerability under accelerating climate change."

RTSs are key features of abrupt permafrost thaw accelerated by climate change. Using satellite images and field data, we identified and classified over 6000 RTSs. This dataset helps scientists better understand how warming is changing Arctic landscapes and provides a trusted reference for training artificial intelligence to detect these landforms in the future. 
 Permafrost thaw disrupts ecosystems, hydrology, and biogeochemical cycles, reinforcing climate change through a positive permafrost-carbon feedback loop. Thaw can be gradual, deepening the active layer, or abrupt, triggering thermokarst, thermo-erosion, or thermodenudation. Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTSs) are a key manifestation of abrupt permafrost thaw. Yet, their distribution, scale, and environmental controls in the West Siberian Arctic remain poorly understood, further complicated by their rapid evolution. This study presents an extensive update of the West Siberian RTS inventory through manual mapping using high-resolution, multi-source, multi-year recent (2016-2023) satellite basemaps (ESRI, Google Earth, and Yandex Maps). We developed an RTS classification capturing key environmental parameters, including morphology, spatial organization, terrain position, and associated relief-forming concurrent processes. The dataset comprises 6168 classified RTS landforms, integrating newly mapped sites with previously reported occurrences to provide a comprehensive view of a 445226 km2 region covering the Yamal, Gydan, and Tazovsky peninsulas. The collected data underwent manual filtering and verification, leveraging local field experience and observations from key sites to reduce uncertainty and minimize false positives. Accuracy analysis, performed by comparing the dataset with various field datasets collected across the peninsulas, confirmed high accuracy (>90%) for RTS identification. The dataset likely underestimated the distribution of small RTSs due to the resolution limitations of remote sensing data, hence generally providing a conservative estimate. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for diverse research fields, including ecology, biogeochemistry, geomorphology, climatology, permafrost science, and natural hazard assessment. Additionally, it provides a crucial reference dataset for machine learning applications, enhancing upcoming remote sensing classification and predictive modeling approaches. "

The identified out-of-domain character of atmospheric compounds is related to their distinct functional groups and atomic composition.

While the intestinal tract is a critical site for MP interactions in soil organisms, current research predominantly focuses on overall physiological responses, overlooking organ-specific toxic mechanisms. To address this gap, we exposed earthworms (Eisenia fetida) to polyethylene (PE) and biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) MPs sourced from agricultural films at an environmentally realistic concentration of 1.0 g/kg. Incorporating natural earthworm mobility, we designed two exposure scenarios: migration from clean to contaminated soil (scenario A) and vice versa (scenario B). Machine learning-driven image analysis and phenotypic profiling revealed that PE induced more severe intestinal lesions than PLA, adversely affecting intestinal immune functions. Furthermore, PE resulted in greater oxidative damage and significantly activated immune proteins such as melanin and antimicrobial peptides through reprograming immune-related gene and protein pathways. Conversely, PLA predominantly disrupted intestinal digestive and absorptive functions, though the gut microbial community partially mitigated damage through structural and compositional adaptation. Compared with scenario A, earthworms in scenario B exhibited reduced tissue damage, enhanced digestive enzyme activity, and upregulated energy-related metabolites and cell proliferation genes, indicating partial recovery from MP-induced intestinal dysfunction. These findings elucidate the distinct toxicity mechanisms of conventional and biodegradable agricultural MPs on soil organisms, while the scenario-based approach advances risk assessment by aligning experimental design with real-world ecological behaviors."

Utilizing data from detailed observational monitoring campaigns, conducted over 21 weeks, we explore the influence of cleaning activities in two normally occupied, single-family houses. To study emissions and chemistry, we quantified more than 200 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using a proton-transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer and 52 semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) using a semivolatile thermal-desorption gas chromatograph. During regular professional home cleaning, we observed postcleaning concentration enhancements in ∼60% of measured VOCs and ∼80% of measured SVOCs. Most of these concentration enhancements were not clearly linked to either primary emission from cleaning products or secondary formation through reactive chemistry. Instead, we infer that shifts in the sorptive properties of indoor surfaces account for most of these observations. Cleaning-associated enhancements mostly ebbed within a few hours, with some VOCs and lower-volatility SVOCs persisting more than 5 h, longer than would be expected for removal of inert species by ventilation. The use of carpet cleaner was associated with direct emission of 2-butoxyethanol, which persisted at elevated concentrations for days after the initial event.

This study introduces mechanochemical depassivation to revitalize passivated ZVI and restore its reactivity. The method is exemplified through mechanical milling to depassivate ZVI with different passivation layers formed in solutions containing Cr(VI), Ni(II), and/or trichloroethylene, as well as in a complex water matrix. The results demonstrate rapid restoration of ZVI reactivity within 10 min of milling, achieving a 7-fold increase in contaminant removal capacity after eight cycles. The method universally outperforms acid pickling and ultrasonication across all of the tested passivation scenarios. Mechanistic analysis attributes its efficacy to the ductile–brittle disparity between the metallic iron and the passivation layers: brittle passivation layers fragment under mechanical stress, while ductile iron resists structural damage. Discrete element method simulations provide further mechanical insights into the milling dynamics and identify the contact frequency as the key factor determining depassivation efficiency. The study provides a versatile, environmentally benign, and effective depassivation method for ZVI reactions that can be integrated into ZVI reuse processes for water treatment applications."

Transcriptome sequencing of M. aeruginosa revealed that elevated SO42– significantly upregulated genes related to sulfur metabolism, including those encoding ABC transporters, gluthathione synthase, carbamoyl transferase, and aminomethyltransferase glycine dehydrogenase, suggesting that enhanced sulfur uptake and metabolic capacity may promote algal DMS synthesis and release. This study elucidates the effects of SO42– on freshwater algal DMS release and explores the underlying mechanisms, offering insights into aquatic sulfur cycling and a foundation for addressing climate challenges."

In the highly populated and heavily polluted South Asian region, the wintertime modeled atmospheric abundance of BC has remained underestimated relative to surface observations. We hypothesize this is linked to underestimated (i) atmospheric lifetime (τBC) and/or (ii) regional emission fluxes of BC. To address this hypothesis, we developed a novel inversion framework combining multiwinter (2018–2020) hourly resolved BC and carbon monoxide (CO) measurements from a wide footprint site in the North Indian Ocean, intercepting wintertime South Asian outflow. The average ΔBC/ΔCO ratio in this continental outflow of 14 ± 5 ng m–3 ppb–1 was 2–3 times higher than in East Asian outflow and shows a profound regional wintertime presence of BC. The empirically derived τBC of 8 ± 0.5 days was higher than global-mean τBC of 5.5 days employed in climate models and suggests greater regional longevity of wintertime BC. The ΔBC/ΔCO inversion-estimated ‘top-down’ BC emission flux of ∼200 Gg/month was in fact higher by a factor of ∼1.5 than wintertime monthly BC emission flux from scaled ‘bottom-up’ emission inventory (∼125 Gg/month). Taken together, assimilating higher BC emissions with greater longevity seems promising to reconcile the model-observation offset of wintertime BC abundance for South Asia."

Here, we examine the processes determining the moment when sea ice locally disappears each spring, defined as the retreat date, using satellite observations over 1994–2020. We find that climatological retreat date is driven by sea ice melt in most of the seasonal ice zone and strongly constrained by the seasonal maximum ice thickness. Ice removal due to drifting ice export predominantly drives retreat only in coastal polynyas. At interannual timescales, retreat date anomalies are also preconditioned by prior maximum ice thickness, which affects melt‐driven spring ice loss through the ice‐albedo feedback, though this effect appears limited to specific regions. Winds emerge as a primary driver of interannual variability in the retreat date, influencing both drift‐ and melt‐related spring ice removal processes."

Such temperature overshoots affect the future hydrological cycle, with implications for land water availability. However, the hydrological response to such temperature overshoots is not well understood. Here, we investigate regional and seasonal changes of precipitation minus evaporation (P − E) in an ensemble of Earth system model simulations of temperature overshoot. Most climate models broadly show P − E reversibility after overshoot. However, models exhibiting an irreversible shift of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) during the temperature overshoot experience reduced wet‐season and enhanced dry‐season land water availability in tropical regions, which has long‐lasting effects on the amplitude of P − E seasonality after the overshoot, constituting irreversible changes on human timescales. While some regions may experience alleviating seasonal hydrological conditions, others are subject to more intense seasonality. Half a century of CO2‐stabilization after the temperature overshoot only halves the legacy effects of the overshoot on land water availability on over 23% of the world population in 12% of the global land area, covering regions of various hydrological regimes. Based on the model ensemble presented here, a strong irreversible shift of the ITCZ after an overshoot is a low‐probability but high‐impact outcome that would entail long‐lasting hydrological changes with consequences for ecosystems and human societies."

Yet, these wetlands are being increasingly converted to aquaculture ponds, which could trigger a pulse emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from existing carbon stocks, a loss of opportunity for future carbon sequestration from mangroves, and an additional GHG emission incurred from pond establishment and operation. In this study, we determined the magnitude, temporal variations and environmental drivers of ecosystem‐scale carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and water vapor fluxes from the subtropical brackish fishponds using the eddy covariance technique, and assessed the net carbon impact arising from the conversion of mangroves to fishponds under three conservation scenarios. Our results showed that the brackish fishponds were significant sources of carbon and water, with a mean annual emission of 687.6 ± 83.1 gC m−2 for CO2, 101.5 ± 2.7 gC m−2 for CH4, and 2422.5 ± 48.0 mm for water vapor. Fishpond CH4 and water vapor fluxes exhibited distinct seasonal patterns with higher fluxes in summer. CO2, CH4, and water vapor fluxes were driven predominantly by shortwave radiation, air temperature, and wind speed, respectively. At the current deforestation rate, the global carbon impact arising from mangrove conversion to fishponds could reach 109 Gt CO2‐equivalent by 2100. Halting global mangrove conversion to aquaculture ponds by 2030 could reduce the net carbon impact by 90.2 Gt CO2‐equivalents by 2100. Thus, preserving coastal wetlands from conversion to aquaculture ponds is among the most effective nature‐based climate solutions."

Whilst event attribution studies tend to focus on the change in probability or magnitude of the extreme temperatures themselves, we provide context to these studies by examining whether there are human induced trends in the atmospheric circulation that might affect the likelihood of similar extreme circulation patterns and associated heat waves occurring in the future. We examine trends and variability in summer jet latitude, blocking frequency and overall circulation pattern over the Scandinavian sector in a variety of reanalyses and climate model ensembles. Both the number of blocked days, and the average jet location for summer 2018 were unprecedented in the reanalyses, and rare in climate model simulations. We found no robust evidence of past or future externally forced changes in summer blocking frequency over Scandinavia in model simulations, whilst trends in circulation analogs were also largely insignificant. Trends in jet latitude were dependent on the time period examined, models included and other analysis choices. Overall, we found no robust evidence for systematic trends in average or extreme years toward Summer 2018‐like conditions for any of the three indices, nor in the frequency of co‐occurring extreme northward jet latitude and high blocking frequency. We conclude that Summer 2018s circulation can likely be explained by internal atmospheric variability."

The AGE method identified critical precipitation events for the flood quantile estimations and the POT method was employed to estimate 100‐year discharge (Q100) for over 2.2 million river grid cells. Key findings include: (a) Nationwide, 100‐year discharge (Q100) is projected to increase 1.16 times (+2°C) and 1.37 times (+4°C), with equivalent return periods reduced to 45 years (+2°C) and 23 years (+4°C). Northern regions (Hokkaido and Tohoku) are particularly climate‐sensitive, exceeding national averages in Q100 increases. (b) Small river basins and transition zones from plains to mountains exhibit higher increase ratios, necessitating targeted flood prevention measures. (c) Flash flood risks are expected to rise, with most national basins seeing flashiness increases of over 10% (+2°C) and 20% (+4°C). Southern Japan faces further flash flood intensification, while Northern Japan under +4°C stage anticipates emerging challenges related to flash floods.

This limitation places a major constraint on our capacity to understand how vegetation fire may change under future scenarios of climate change and socio‐economic development. Here, we address this challenge by presenting a novel integration of two process‐based models. The first is the Wildfire Human Agency Model (WHAM!), which draws on agent‐based approaches to represent anthropogenic fire use and management. The second is JULES‐INFERNO, a fire‐enabled dynamic global vegetation model, which takes a physically grounded approach to the representation of vegetation‐fire dynamics. The combined model enables a coupled socio‐ecological simulation of historical burned area. We calibrate the combined model using GFED5 burned area data and perform an independent evaluation using MODIS‐based fire radiative power observations. Results suggest that as much as half of all global burned area is generated by managed anthropogenic fires—typically small fires that are lit for, and then spread according to, land user objectives. Furthermore, we demonstrate that including representation of managed anthropogenic fires in a coupled socio‐ecological simulation improves understanding of the drivers of unmanaged wildfires. For example, we show how vegetation flammability and landscape fragmentation control inter‐annual variability and longer‐term change in unmanaged fires.

Moreover, with the progress of urbanization, changes in land cover have led to increasingly unavoidable changes in terrestrial carbon storage. However, there is still a lack of research on the impact of land cover change on global terrestrial carbon storage under the latest IPCC scenarios. Therefore, this study utilizes the InVEST model to examine the impact of future land dynamics on global terrestrial carbon storage under various SSP‐RCP scenarios from 2015 to 2100. The results reveal significant regional differences and trends. For instance, under the SSP4‐3.4 scenario, global terrestrial carbon storage loss could reach up to 30.2 PgC due to land conversions, such as the transformation of tropical rainforests into bioenergy crops in Indonesia. The social cost of offsetting terrestrial carbon loss could range from trillions to tens of trillions of dollars in various scenarios. Additionally, our analysis indicates that urban expansion generally reduces carbon storage, but strategic urban planning can mitigate this impact. In ecological protected areas and biodiversity hotspots, we observed a polarized trend: areas with increasing carbon storage are experiencing growth at a faster rate than historically, while areas with decreasing carbon storage are facing accelerated losses. This disparity underscores the necessity for targeted conservation efforts. In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of sound land management and policy interventions in mitigating terrestrial carbon storage losses, protecting ecologically sensitive areas, and achieving climate goals."

 Ku70 and Ku80 form Ku, a ring-shaped complex that initiates the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway.1 Ku binds to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) ends and recruits other NHEJ factors (e.g., LIG4, DNA-PKcs). While Ku can bind to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)2 and trap mutated-DNA-PKcs on ribosomal RNA (rRNA),3,4 the physiological role on Ku-RNA interaction in otherwise wildtype cells remains unclear. Intriguingly, Ku is dispensable for murine development5,6 but essential in human cells.7 Despite similar genome sizes, human cells express ~100-fold more Ku than mouse cells, implying functions beyond NHEJ - possibly through a dose-sensitive interaction with dsRNA, which binds Ku 10~100 times weaker than dsDNA.2,8 Investigating Ku’s essentiality in human cells, we found that Ku-depletion - unlike LIG4 - induces profound interferon (IFN) and NF-kB signaling via dsRNA-sensor MDA5/RIG-I and MAVS. Prolonged Ku-degradation further activates other dsRNA sensors, especially PKR (suppressing translation) and OAS/RNaseL (cleaving rRNA), leading to growth arrest and cell death. MAVS, RIG-I, or MDA5 knockouts suppressed IFN signaling and, like PKR knockouts, all partially rescued Ku-depleted human cells. Ku-irCLIP analyses revealed Ku binding to diverse dsRNA, predominantly stem-loops in primate-specific antisense Alu elements9 in introns and 3’-UTRs. Ku expression rose sharply in higher primates, correlating tightly with Alu-expansion (r = 0.94/0.95). Thus, Ku plays a vital role in accommodating Alu-expansion in primates by limiting dsRNA-induced innate immunity, explaining both Ku’s elevated expression and its essentiality in human cells."

 In the future, monsoon rainfall over densely populated South Asia is expected to increase, even as monsoon circulation weakens1–3. By contrast, past warm intervals were marked by both increased rainfall and a strengthening of monsoon circulation4–6, posing a challenge to understanding the response of the South Asian summer monsoon to warming. Here we show consistent South Asian summer monsoon changes in the mid-Pliocene, Last Interglacial, mid-Holocene and future scenarios, characterized by an overall increase in monsoon rainfall, a weakening of the monsoon trough-like circulation over the Bay of Bengal and a strengthening of the monsoon circulation over the northern Arabian Sea, as revealed by a compilation of proxy records and climate simulations. Increased monsoon rainfall is thermodynamically dominated by atmospheric moisture following the rich-get-richer paradigm, and dynamically dominated by the monsoon circulation driven by the enhanced land warming in subtropical western Eurasia and northern Africa. The coherent response of monsoon dynamics across warm climates reconciles past strengthening with future weakening, reinforcing confidence in future projections. Further prediction of South Asian summer monsoon circulation and rainfall by physics-based regression models using past information agrees well with climate model projections, with spatial correlation coefficients of approximately 0.8 and 0.7 under the high-emissions scenario. These findings underscore the promising potential of past analogues, bolstered by palaeoclimate reconstruction, in improving future South Asian summer monsoon projections.

 The anti-tumour effect of radiotherapy beyond the treatment field—the abscopal effect—has garnered much interest1. However, the potentially deleterious effect of radiation in promoting metastasis is less well studied. Here we show that radiotherapy induces the expression of the EGFR ligand amphiregulin in tumour cells, which reprogrammes EGFR-expressing myeloid cells toward an immunosuppressive phenotype and reduces phagocytosis. This stimulates distant metastasis growth in human patients and in pre-clinical mouse tumour models. The inhibition of these tumour-promoting factors induced by radiotherapy may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to improve patient outcomes.

 Moiré superlattices in van der Waals materials have emerged as a promising platform for studying the correlated states in condensed matter physics. These correlated states have substantial effects on the emission coherence, an important parameter for quantum light applications. However, the effect of correlated states on the excitonic emission coherence is largely unexplored. Here, we show that the coherence of moiré interlayer exciton emission in tungsten diselenide (WSe2)/molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) heterobilayers is sensitive to the correlated insulating states in this material. We demonstrate that the emission linewidth of interlayer exciton shows a dip at a particular power range, which we attributed to the excitonic (bosonic) interaction. Moreover, such linewidth minima also appear in the doping dependence of the photoluminescence spectrum at the integer electronic filling factor, fel = 1, demonstrating the effect of the electronic (fermionic) correlated insulating state on the interlayer exciton emission coherence. Our results demonstrate the richness of exciton-exciton and exciton-electron interactions in moiré semiconductors and pave the way for engineering emission coherence by controlling such interactions.

 Neoadjuvant immunotherapy can induce pathologic complete response (pCR) in patients with localized deficient mismatch repair (dMMR)/microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors. The long-term outcomes of these patients are unknown, as is the clinical utility of measuring circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Follow-up was evaluated in patients enrolled in a phase II trial (NCT04082572) that evaluated the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in patients with localized dMMR/MSI-H tumors. The primary outcomes of this trial have previously been reported. 3-year EFS and OS rates were 80% (95% CI: 66% – 93%) and 94% (95% CI: 86% – 100%). Patients without detectable ctDNA after pembrolizumab had higher 3-year EFS and OS rates than patients with detectable ctDNA after pembrolizumab (3-year EFS 92% vs 20%; p < 0.001, 3-year OS 100% vs 80%; p < 0.001). Patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) who had undetectable ctDNA after pembrolizumab were more likely to have pCR compared to those with detectable ctDNA after pembrolizumab (91% vs 0%; p = 0.03). Patients with CRC who were managed non-operatively and had undetectable ctDNA after pembrolizumab had a higher 2-year EFS rate than patients with detectable ctDNA after pembrolizumab (100% vs 33%; p = 0.03).

 Oxidation of alkenes with O3 and photoexcited nitroarenes represents one of the most attractive organic chemical transformations for the synthesis of oxygen-enriched molecules.

This study shows by sequentially swelling hydrogels the mechanic properties can be properly balanced. 
 Nature suggests concepts for materials with efficient mechanical energy storage and release, i.e., resilience, involving small energy dissipation upon mechanical loading and unloading, such as in resilin and elastin. These materials facilitate burst-like movements involving high stiffness and low strain and high reversibility. Synthetic hydrogels that allow highly reversible mechanical energy storage have remained a challenge, despite mimicking biological soft tissues. Here we show a synthetic concept using fixed hydrogel polymer compositions based on sequentially swollen and sequentially photopolymerized gelation steps for hierarchical networks. The sequential swellings facilitate the balance of properties between resilience and dissipation upon controlling of the chain extension. At low hierarchical levels, we show resilience with small hysteresis with increased stiffness and resilient energy storage, whereas at high hierarchical levels, a transition is shown to a dissipative and considerably reinforced state. The generality of this approach is shown using several photopolymerizable monomers.

 This work reports the successful production of rare earth (RE) metal using Na-RE-F. Presently, RE metals are primarily produced using RE-fluoride due to its higher air and moisture stability compared to RE-chloride. However, its preparation requires the use of corrosive and hazardous chemicals, such as hydrofluoric acid (HF) or ammonium bifluoride (NH4HF2). The present study demonstrates that Na-RE-F is an alternative salt to the typically used RE-fluoride. The Na-RE-F for this work is produced via a scalable hydrometallurgical approach using three different RE salts as feedstock, including acetate, nitrate, and chloride. HF is neither used nor generated during the salt preparation process. Furthermore, the Na-RE-F powder dries in air (without dry HF), and only water evolves during the drying process. Analyses of the Na-RE-F show that NaF liberates as a flux during the heating process, which lowers the salt reduction temperature to <900 °C, thus minimizing or eliminating the need for additional flux. Calciothermic reduction of the Na-RE-F salt is successfully employed to obtain RE metal. This work represents a safer, greener, and more widely deployable approach for producing the RE metals needed for permanent magnets which support the transition to a cleaner society through the decarbonization of the transportation industry.

Its temperature sensitivity is higher than expected with implications for future warming. 
 Carbon storage in soils is important in regulating atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). However, the sensitivity of the soil-carbon turnover time (τsoil) to temperature and hydrology forcing is not fully understood. Here, we use radiocarbon dating of plant-derived lipids in conjunction with reconstructions of temperature and rainfall from an eastern Mediterranean sediment core receiving terrigenous material from the Nile River watershed to investigate τsoilin subtropical and tropical areas during the last 18,000 years. We find that τsoil was reduced by an order of magnitude over the last deglaciation and that temperature was the major driver of these changes while the impact of hydroclimate was relatively small. We conclude that increased CO2 efflux from soils into the atmosphere constituted a positive feedback to global warming. However, simulated glacial-to-interglacial changes in a dynamic global vegetation model underestimate our data-based reconstructions of soil-carbon turnover times suggesting that this climate feedback is underestimated.

 DDX3X is an X-linked RNA helicase that escapes X chromosome inactivation and is expressed at higher levels in female brains. Mutations in DDX3X are associated with intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and are predominantly identified in females (DDX3X syndrome). Using cellular and mouse models, we show that Ddx3x mediates sexual dimorphisms in brain development at a molecular, cellular, and behavioral level. During cortical neuronal development, Ddx3x sustains a female-biased signature of enhanced ribosomal biogenesis and mRNA metabolism. Compared to male neurons, female neurons display larger nucleoli, higher expression of a set of ribosomal proteins, and a higher cytoplasm-to-nucleus ratio of ribosomal RNA. All these sex dimorphisms are obliterated by Ddx3x loss. Ddx3x regulates dendritic arborization complexity in a sex- and dose-dependent manner in both female and male neurons. Ddx3x modulates the development of dendritic spines but only in female neurons. Further, ablating Ddx3x conditionally in forebrain neurons is sufficient to yield sex-specific changes in developmental outcomes and motor function. Together, these findings pose Ddx3x as a mediator of sexual differentiation during neurodevelopment and open new avenues to understand sex differences in health and disease.

Notably, heatwave and cold-spell intensities for all lakes surged by over 100% after 1996 or 1976, aligning with the strongest El-Niño and a major shift in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, respectively, marking potential regional climate tipping points. This emphasizes the long-lasting impacts of climate change on large lake thermodynamics, which cascade through larger ecological and regional climate systems. The world’s largest freshwater bodies have experienced a 20-60% increase in lake surface temperature extremes over the past 50 years, with heatwave and cold-spell intensities more than doubling after 1996 or 1976, according to a hydrodynamic-ice model driven by climate data."

 North Sea human-made, offshore structures (e.g. oil/gas platforms, offshore wind farms) provide a hard substrate habitat for benthic marine species which can spread between sites during their larval stage. Here, we aim to address how the installation of additional human-made structures, like new wind farms, or decommissioning of existing ones, like oil and gas platforms at the end of service, contribute to changes in larval connectivity. We use particle tracking model simulations to assess the ecological connectivity of benthic species in the northern North Sea during two contrasting years to highlight seasonal to annual variability. The methodology of releasing an extensive set of particles over a wide area produces our Retrospective Particle Tracks dataset. The sets of simulations can be interrogated to understand if additional human-made structures placed in any locations in the northern North Sea could potentially affect the ecological connectivity. Network metrics were used to identify connectivity between sites. Clustering of existing structures identifies a region that acts as an interchange between other structures which may otherwise only be connected during intermittent periods. The addition of new human-made structures located in areas with stronger residual current flow would enhance the connectivity.

 Estuarine and coastal areas are important sources of methane emitted to the atmosphere through diffusion or ebullition. These processes can be triggered by pressure changes and water column mixing, which can be induced by ships. However, the contribution of ship-triggered emissions is unknown and missing in current emission inventories. Here we show evidence of extensive ship-induced methane emissions and an estimated methane flux (11.1 mmol m−2 day−1) from Neva Bay shipping lane. The flux is 10–1000 times higher than reported global estuarine/coastal fluxes, and of similar magnitude as aquatic methane emission hotspots. Our results indicate that ship-induced pressure changes (30–60 mbar) trigger methane emission, comparable with observed emissions induced by tidal pressure changes. The ship-triggered methane emissions corresponded to a 22% increase of emitted carbon dioxide equivalents, compared to the combustion related exhausts. Our results demonstrate the need to include shipping lanes when assessing estuarine/coastal methane emissions.

 Despite the global ban on leaded gasoline, environmental lead pollution remains a concern, especially in developing countries.

Here we reconstruct a 60-year history of lead concentration (lead/calcium) and isotopic composition in a coral from Dongsha Atoll in the northern South China Sea. The record shows a fourfold increase in lead level from 1953 to the mid-2000s, followed by a ~60% decline over the next decade. Shifts in lead isotopic composition suggest a transition from local automotive emissions to more distant industrial emissions, primarily from coal combustion in mainland China after 2000.

Here we introduce a limited area artificial intelligence-based weather forecasting model with 3 km and 1 h resolutions, utilizing parallel global-local structures to capture multiscale meteorological features. The model is trained on high-resolution regional analysis data, and utilizes the global artificial intelligence-based model forecasts for the lateral boundary condition during prediction, and operates much faster than the dynamical forecast model. In two selected limited areas, it outperforms dynamical forecast models in surface wind speed forecasting but underperforms in surface temperature and pressure. Skills in surface temperature and pressure can be further improved comparable to the dynamical forecast model by providing better lateral boundary conditions. Issues related to lateral boundary conditions, such as selecting width of lateral boundary regions and combining finer and coarser resolution predictions in the regions, are also studied.

 The Indian Ocean Dipole exhibits large variations in its evolution depending on the presence of El Niño, with notable changes in intensity, duration, and peak phase. Here, using a simple Indian Ocean Dipole model and observational-reanalysis datasets, we revealed that Indian Ocean Dipole events co-evolving with El Niño exhibit an early-summer growth-disruption, which results from a sudden decrease in Indian Ocean Dipole sensitivity to El Niño in May and June, despite the steadily increasing El Niño’s amplitude. In May and June, as the Intertropical Convergence Zone migrates northward with the onset of South Asian monsoon, El Niño-induced low-level cyclonic circulation causes Ekman upwelling over the western Indian Ocean, which stalls Indian Ocean Dipole development. Moist linear baroclinic model experiments verified that the Intertropical Convergence Zone modulates El Niño–Southern Oscillation’s impact on Indian Ocean Dipole seasonally.

 Countries increasingly rely on metal ores for the energy transition but face potential supply constraints. Here we combine multi-region input–output analysis with corporate ownership data from 2000 to 2022 for ten widely used metals, and visualize the results using Sankey diagrams for 159 countries plus four world regions. We find no association between a country’s wealth and the share of its locally extracted ores under domestic control, highlighting the highly globalized nature of the mining sector. Similarly, overseas mine ownership does not translate into direct material flows back to the controlling region, indicating that market forces can overshadow corporate influence. Despite no measurable trade shifts, foreign ownership remains a potential lever for supply chain disruptions. By integrating corporate control into criticality assessments, policymakers can identify future vulnerabilities and strengthen resource security.

 The Land Surface Temperature (LST) is well suited to monitor biosphere–atmosphere interactions in forests, as it depends on water availability and atmospheric/meteorological conditions above and below the canopy. Satellite-based LST has proven integral in observing evapotranspiration, estimating surface heat fluxes and characterising vegetation properties. Since the radiative regime of forests is complex, driven by canopy structure, components radiation properties and their arrangement, forest radiative temperatures are subject to strong angular effects. However, this depends on the scale of observation, where scattering mechanisms from canopy – to satellite – scales influence anisotropy with varying orders of magnitude. Given the heterogeneous and complex nature of forests, multi-angular data collection is particularly difficult, necessitating instrumentation distant enough from the canopy to obtain significant canopy brightness temperature and concurrent observations to exclude turbulence/atmospheric effects. Accordingly, current research and understanding on forest anisotropy at varying scales (from local validation level to satellite footprint) remain insufficient to provide practical solutions for addressing angular effects for upcoming thermal satellite sensors and associated validation schemes. This study presents a novel method founded in the optical remote sensing domain to explore the use of microcanopies that represent forests at different scales in the footprint of a multi-angular goniometer observing system. Both Geometric Optical (GO) and volumetric scattering dominated canopies are constructed to simulate impacts of anisotropy in heterogeneous and homogeneous canopies, and observed using a thermal infrared radiometer. Results show that heterogeneous canopies dominated by GO scattering are subject to much higher magnitudes of anisotropy, reaching maximum temperature differences of 3 °C off-nadir. Magnitudes of anisotropy are higher in sparse forests, where the gap fraction and crown arrangement (inducing sunlit/shaded portions of soil and vegetation) drive larger off-nadir differences. In dense forests, anisotropy is driven by viewing the maximum portion of sunlit vegetation (hotspot), where the soil is mostly obscured. Canopy structural metrics such as the fractional cover and gap fraction were found to have significant correlation with off-nadir differences. In more homogeneous canopies, anisotropy reaches a lower magnitude with temperature differences up to 1 °C, driven largely by volumetric scattering and components radiation properties. Optimal placement of instrumentation at the canopy-scale (more heterogeneous behaviour due to proximity to the canopy and small pixel size) used to validate satellite observations (more homogeneous behaviour due to larger pixel size) was found to be in cases of viewing maximum sunlit vegetation, for dense canopies. Given upcoming high spatial resolution sensors and associated validation schemes needed to benchmark LST and downstream products such as evapotranspiration, a better understanding of anisotropy over forests is critical to provide accurate, long-term and multi-sensor products."

 3D Transformers have achieved great success in point cloud understanding and representation. However, there is still considerable scope for further development in effective and efficient Transformers for large-scale LiDAR point cloud scene segmentation. This paper proposes a novel 3D Transformer framework, named 3D Learnable Supertoken Transformer (3DLST). The key contributions are summarized as follows. Firstly, we introduce the first Dynamic Supertoken Optimization (DSO) block for efficient token clustering and aggregating, where the learnable supertoken definition avoids the time-consuming pre-processing of traditional superpoint generation. Since the learnable supertokens can be dynamically optimized by multi-level deep features during network learning, they are tailored to the semantic homogeneity-aware token clustering. Secondly, an efficient Cross-Attention-guided Upsampling (CAU) block is proposed for token reconstruction from optimized supertokens. Thirdly, the 3DLST is equipped with a novel W-net architecture instead of the common U-net design, which is more suitable for Transformer-based feature learning. The SOTA performance on challenging LiDAR datasets (airborne MultiSpectral LiDAR (MS-LiDAR) (89.3% of the average F1 score) and DALES (80.2% of mIoU)) demonstrate the superiority of 3DLST. Furthermore, 3DLST also achieves satisfactory results in terms of algorithm efficiency, which is up to 5× faster than previous best-performing methods."

 Based on the results of numerical simulations, a possible mechanism for the occurrence of a rapid increase in lightning frequency preceding a downburst was investigated according to cloud microphysical processes in mixed-phase areas. To elucidate the mechanism, idealized experiments were conducted targeting multi-cell convective clouds using a meteorological model coupled with a bulk lightning model, which explicitly calculates riming, charge separation via riming electrification, and lightning discharge. The model well reproduced a rapid increase in the lightning flash rate in multi-cell convective clouds approximately 15 min before a downburst. In a convective cell during increasing flash rate, solid hydrometeors were supplied to the convective area and riming electrification occurred actively. In contrast, in a convective cell that caused a downburst, riming occurred actively because of the supply of a large amount of supercooled water from the lower layers. A convective cell suitable for riming electrification or graupel growth by riming occurred when the convection was or was not tilted, respectively.

We found that the average area of linear, spherical, plate, and dendritic particles in the stratiform cloud region was larger than that in the convective cloud region. The average area of graupel and aggregates in the embedded convection cloud region was larger than that in the stratiform cloud region. Moreover, we found that the larger the average area of graupel was, the lower the proportion of particles in the inner region of the mature stratiform cloud was."

Our analysis demonstrates that West Siberian ancestry, represented by the Kets and Nenets, contributed to the genetic ancestry of most Siberian populations. West Beringians, including the Koryaks, Inuit, and Luoravetlans, exhibit genetic adaptation to Arctic climate, including medically relevant variants. In South America, early migrants split into four groups—Amazonians, Andeans, Chaco Amerindians, and Patagonians—~13,900 years ago. Their longest migration led to population decline, whereas settlement in South America’s diverse environments caused instant spatial isolation, reducing genetic and immunogenic diversity. These findings highlight how population history and environmental pressures shaped the genetic architecture of human populations across North Asia and South America."

We observed this quantum melting of a disordered Wigner solid in bilayer molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) using a noninvasive scanning tunneling microscopy imaging technique. At low densities, the Wigner solid forms nanocrystalline domains pinned by local disorder. It exhibits a quantum densification behavior with increased densities in the solid phase.

During futility-induced behavioral transitions in the larval zebrafish, the neuromodulator norepinephrine (NE) drives fast excitation and delayed inhibition of behavior and circuit activity. We found that astroglial purinergic signaling implements the inhibitory arm of this motif. In larval zebrafish, NE triggers astroglial release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), extracellular conversion of ATP into adenosine, and behavioral suppression through activation of hindbrain neuronal adenosine receptors. Our results suggest a computational and behavioral role for an evolutionarily conserved astroglial purinergic signaling axis in NE-mediated behavioral and brain state transitions and position astroglia as important effectors in neuromodulatory signaling."

Here, we show that NE remodeling of synaptic function is completely independent from its binding on neuronal receptors. Instead, astrocytic adrenergic receptors and calcium dynamics fully gate the effect of NE on synapses. Additionally, we found that NE suppression of synaptic strength results from an adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP)–derived and A1 adenosine receptor–mediated control of presynaptic efficacy. These findings suggest that astrocytes are a core component of neuromodulatory systems and the circuit effector through which NE produces network and behavioral adaptations."

We also find deeply divergent lineages north and south of the American ice sheets that genetically influenced populations across Beringia and into Eurasia. As climate warmed and horses entered the ice-free corridor connecting Beringia and midcontinental America, restricted mobility and food availability impeded population growth.
