Through case studies of the United States, Norway, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), we analyze national industrial decarbonization strategies and present findings from extensive fieldwork, including 139 expert interviews and 124 site visits supplemented with document analysis. Our results reveal that CCE and defossilization, which is defined as decarbonization through the elimination of fossil fuel extraction and use, are potentially compatible concepts in the long-term pursuit of net-zero industry. The CCE approach, which incorporates energy efficiency, renewable energy, electrification, low-carbon fuels, and carbon capture, utilization and storage, particularly offers a practical pathway for oil and gas (O&amp;G) producing countries to transition towards net-zero industrial emissions. CCE allows these and similar countries to balance environmental goals with technical, economic, social and political challenges associated with defossilization. The case studies demonstrate that all three countries are adopting CCE strategies tailored to their unique contexts. The US emphasizes a portfolio approach integrating multiple technologies, the UAE focuses on leveraging existing fossil fuel infrastructure for CCE efforts, and Norway capitalizes on its abundant renewable resources while investing in carbon capture and storage and hydrogen projects utilizing its extensive O&amp;G sector expertise and resources. Key policy recommendations include technology and policy leadership from countries pursuing a CCE framework, encouragement of public–private partnerships in the deployment of CCE technologies and ensuring social equity as net-zero industry is pursued in the near and long term. We also summarize existing approaches, pathways, and frameworks for industrial decarbonization, as well as barriers and challenges. We lastly call for further research on integration of CCE and defossilization visions, strategies and roadmaps and a strong focus on international cooperation in achieving net-zero industry."

We studied the molecular composition of exometabolites for cultured typical airborne microbes and traced their metabolic processes. Bacteria and fungi produce highly oxidized exometabolites and have significant variations in metabolism among different strains. These insights are pivotal for assessing the biogeochemical impacts of atmospheric microorganisms following their deposition. 
 The interactions of metabolically active atmospheric microorganisms with cloud organic matter can alter the atmospheric carbon cycle. Upon deposition, atmospheric microorganisms can influence microbial communities in surface Earth systems. However, the metabolic activities of cultivable atmospheric microorganisms in settled habitats remain less understood. Here, we cultured typical bacterial and fungal species isolated from the urban atmosphere using tryptic soy broth (TSB) and Sabouraud dextrose broth (SDB), respectively, and investigated their exometabolites to elucidate their potential roles in biogeochemical cycles. Molecular compositions of exometabolites were analyzed using ultrahigh-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. Annotation through the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database helped identify metabolic processes. Results showed that bacterial and fungal strains produced exometabolites with lower H / C and higher O / C ratios compared with both consumed and resistant compounds. As CHON compounds are abundant in both TSB (85 %) and SDB (78 %), CHON compounds also constituted over 50 % of the identified exometabolite formulas. Bacterial strains produced more abundant CHONS compounds (25.2 %), while fungal exometabolites were rich in CHO compounds (31.7 %). These microbial exometabolites predominantly comprised aliphatic/peptide-like and carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecule (CRAM)-like compounds. Significant variations in metabolites were observed among different microbial strains. Bacteria exhibited proficiency in amino acid synthesis, while fungi were actively involved in amino acid metabolism, transcription, and expression processes. Lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism varied widely among bacterial strains, while fungi exhibited notable differences in carbohydrate metabolism and secondary metabolism. This study provides new insights into the transformation and potential oxidative capacity of atmospheric microorganisms concerning organic matter at air–land/water interfaces. These findings are pivotal for assessing the biogeochemical impacts of atmospheric microorganisms in clouds or following their deposition."

Using data from multiple sensors, including individual Lightning Mapping Array stations, we reveal that positive flashes sustain strong high-frequency radiation due to the recharging of their in-cloud leader; this is in contrast to negative flashes, for which this activity declines rapidly. 
 We investigate properties of the electromagnetic activity following the first lightning return stroke (RS), using concurrent observations from the SLAVIA (Shielded Loop Antenna with a Versatile Integrated Amplifier) sensor, the SAETTA (Suivi de l'Activité Electrique Tridimensionnelle Totale de l'Atmosphère) Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) and the METEORAGE LF (low-frequency) network in the Corsica region. From the data collected between September and December 2015, we selected 66 negative cloud-to-ground (−CG) and 26 positive cloud-to-ground (+CG) lightning flashes in the north-western Mediterranean region. In the SAETTA data, we observe a decrease in the very high frequency (VHF) radiation rate and the VHF power, as recorded within a typical 80 µs time window at the LMA stations, immediately after the RS pulse in 59 −CG flashes.  Contrastingly, we show that all examined +CG flashes exhibit a rapid increase in the VHF radiation rate and the VHF power immediately after the RS. We suggest a possible explanation of this phenomenon by considering the step-like propagation of a negative part of the bidirectional leader starting at the top end of the positive lightning channel inside the thundercloud, emitting electromagnetic radiation across a broad frequency spectrum."

 This study proposed a new quality control method via physical constraints and data-driven collaborative artificial intelligence (PD-BX) to reduce wind speed measurement errors caused by the complex environment along high-speed railway lines, achieving enhanced accuracy and reliability. On the one hand, based on the special structure in railway assembly, the physical constraint model of the railway electrical catenary supports and anemometers was experimentally established. The performance of the physical model in the wind field was simulated based on FLUENT software, and the environmental change characteristics of the anemometer in the railway area were analyzed. On the other hand, to solve the constrained error mapping expression under different wind conditions, a data-driven model of hyperparameter optimization (BO-XGBoost) is introduced to perform error compensation on physical relationships. Through the PD-BX method, the RMSE of the railway anemometer was reduced by 2.497 from 2.790 to 0.293, achieving quality control of wind observations along the high-speed railway lines and providing reliable results for improving the accuracy of the high-speed railway early warning system."

We exploit this sensitivity and extend the Infrared Microwave Sounding retrieval scheme for use on observations from FORUM. This scheme is evaluated on both simulated and observed measurements and shows good agreement with references of the atmospheric state. 
 We present the extension of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) Infrared Microwave Sounding (IMS) optimal estimation retrieval scheme to include the use of far-infrared channels in preparation for the upcoming Far-infrared Outgoing Radiation Understanding and Monitoring (FORUM) mission. The IMS code has been previously applied to mid-infrared spectral radiances measured by the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Instrument (IASI) to retrieve temperature and water vapour.  Given this, the evolution and evaluation of the extended scheme is performed in two steps. First, clear-sky retrievals of temperature and water vapour are performed on IASI and FORUM simulations. Comparable retrieval biases are observed for retrievals of temperature and water vapour; however, there is an increase of ∼ 1 degree of freedom for water vapour and temperature for the FORUM configuration. Secondly, radiances observed from an aircraft flight in the upper troposphere are modified to match the FORUM spectral characteristics. Retrievals from these radiances using the modified code show a strong agreement with contemporaneous in situ measurements of the atmospheric state, reducing the root-mean-square error (RMSE) by 18 % for water vapour from the a priori, giving confidence in its performance. The extended IMS scheme is now available for use on FORUM observations and can be easily adapted to other far- and mid-infrared instrument configurations."

 Seismic facies classification is crucial for seismic stratigraphic interpretation and hydrocarbon reservoir characterization but remains a tedious and time-consuming task that requires significant manual effort. Data-driven deep-learning approaches are highly promising for automating the seismic facies classification with high efficiency and accuracy, as they have already achieved significant success in similar image classification tasks within the field of computer vision (CV). However, unlike the CV domain, the field of seismic exploration lacks a comprehensive benchmark dataset for seismic facies, severely limiting the development, application, and evaluation of deep-learning approaches in seismic facies classification. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive workflow to construct a massive-scale benchmark dataset of seismic facies and evaluate its effectiveness in training a deep-learning model. Specifically, we first develop a knowledge graph of seismic facies based on geological concepts and seismic reflection configurations. Guided by the graph, we then implement the three strategies of field seismic data curation, knowledge-guided synthesization, and generative adversarial network (GAN)-based generation to construct a benchmark dataset of 8000 diverse samples for five common seismic facies. Finally, we use the benchmark dataset to train a network and then apply it to two 3-D seismic data for automatic seismic facies classification. The predictions are highly consistent with expert interpretation results, demonstrating that the diversity and representativeness of our benchmark dataset are sufficient to train a network that can be generalized well in seismic facies classification across field data. We have made this dataset (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10777460, Gao et al., 2024a), the trained model, and the associated codes (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13150879, Gao et al., 2024b)  publicly available for further research and validation of intelligent seismic facies classification."

This work presents the first publicly available daily global front dataset spanning from 1982 to 2023, with comprehensive validations using in-situ global observations. Our validations enhance confidence in the application of satellite-based front detection and provide independent support for global front occurrence patterns. The dataset is expected to be widely used in front-related studies. 
 Ocean fronts have garnered significant attention from researchers across various scientific disciplines due to their profound ecological and climatic impacts. The development of front detection algorithms has enabled the automatic extraction of frontal information from satellite observations, providing valuable tools for understanding the biophysical interactions within marine ecosystems. However, the lack of comprehensive validation and comparison of cross-satellite products against in-situ observations, along with limited accessibility to frontal datasets, must be addressed to enable the broader application of front detection algorithms. This study promoted the improved histogram-based front detection algorithm to global oceans with additional enhancements, generating the first publicly available, high-resolution, daily global mesoscale front dataset spanning from 1982 to 2023 (Xing et al., 2024a, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14373832). Global validation using in-situ underway observations shows that most in-situ and satellite-detected fronts can be matched with each other, with high temporal and spatial consistency, demonstrating the dataset's acceptable performance in detecting fronts. Cross-dataset comparisons reveal that multi-satellite merged products offer the best front detection performance, followed by observation-assimilated ocean model products, while single-satellite and purely simulated products show the lowest performance, all of which provide independent validation of the satellite-based global occurrence patterns. These results enhance confidence in the application of satellite-based front detection, and our global front dataset and detection algorithm may be valuable for both regional and global studies in marine ecology, fisheries, ocean dynamics, and climate change."

Rabin;Danica L. Lombardozzi;Gudimetla Venkateswara Varma;Ruchira Biswas;Devavat Chiru Naik,Improving the representation of major Indian crops in the Community Land Model version 5.0 (CLM5) using site-scale crop data,"The study aimed to improve the representation of wheat and rice in a land model for the Indian region. The modified model performed significantly better than the default model in simulating crop phenology, yield, and carbon, water, and energy fluxes compared to observations. The study highlights the need for global land models to use region-specific crop parameters for accurately simulating vegetation processes and land surface processes. 
 Accurate representation of croplands is essential for simulating terrestrial water, energy, and carbon fluxes over India because croplands constitute more than 50 % of the Indian land mass. Wheat and rice are the two major crops grown in India, covering more than 80 % of the agricultural land. The Community Land Model version 5 (CLM5) has significant errors in simulating the crop phenology, yield, and growing season lengths due to errors in the parameterizations of the crop module, leading to errors in carbon, water, and energy fluxes over these croplands. Our study aimed to improve the representation of wheat and rice crops in CLM5. Unfortunately, the crop data necessary to calibrate and evaluate the models over the Indian region are not readily available. This study used comprehensive wheat and rice novel crop data for India created by digitizing historical observations. This dataset is the first of its kind, covering 50 years and over 20 sites of crop growth data across tropical regions, where data have traditionally been spatially and temporally sparse. We used eight wheat sites and eight rice sites from the recent decades. Many sites have multiple growing seasons, taking the total up to nearly 20 growing seasons for each crop. We used these data to calibrate and improve the representation of the sowing dates, growing season, growth parameters, and base temperature in CLM5. The modified CLM5 performed much better than the default model in simulating the crop phenology, yield, and carbon, water, and energy fluxes compared to  site-scale data and remote sensing observations. For instance, Pearson's r for monthly leaf area index (LAI) improved from 0.35 to 0.92, and monthly gross primary production (GPP) improved from −0.46 to 0.79 compared to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) monthly data. The r value of the monthly sensible and latent heat fluxes improved from 0.76 and 0.52 to 0.9 and 0.88, respectively. Moreover, because of the corrected representation of the growing seasons, the seasonality of the simulated irrigation matched the observations. This study demonstrates that global land models must use region-specific parameters rather than global parameters for accurately simulating vegetation processes and corresponding land surface processes. The improved CLM5  can be used to investigate the changes in growing season lengths, water use efficiency, and climate impacting crop growth of Indian crops in future scenarios. The model can also help  provide estimates of crop productivity and net carbon capture abilities of agroecosystems in future climate."

However, large-scale observation of their pollution characteristics in surface water is still lacking. Herein, a nationwide investigation revealed the pervasive occurrence of PPDs and PPD-Qs in riverine waters across China, with the mean concentration of ∑5PPD-Qs being 4.9 times higher than their parent ∑5PPDs. Notably, the 6PPD-Q concentrations at eight sampling sites exceeded the median lethal concentration for coho salmon. National annual riverine fluxes were estimated at 113.1 and 276.2 tonnes/year for PPDs and PPD-Qs, respectively, with the Yangtze River contributing more than one-third of the total fluxes. The transformation of PPDs to PPD-Qs was dependent on atmospheric hydroxylation rates and the half-lives of PPDs. A combined multimedia exposure assessment revealed that water exposure accounted for 82.5% of human exposure to PPDs and PPD-Qs, surpassing the contributions from dust and air exposure. This study provides a comprehensive spatial picture of PPDs and PPD-Qs in China. The national atlas highlights their potential ecological risks and implies that targeted actions should be taken to mitigate potential exposure to PPDs and PPD-Qs."

However, the capture of DOMD•+ by Cu is possibly partially due to strong competition from phenolic antioxidant moieties intrinsically present in DOM for DOMD•+ quenching. In this study, the extent of interaction between DOMD•+ and phenolic antioxidant moieties is quantified by measuring the inhibitory effect of Cu on DOM photooxidation and photobleaching under varying pH (5.2–10.0) conditions. The increase in pH facilitates formation of deprotonated phenolic moieties (pKa ∼ 9–10), increasing their quenching capacity of DOMD•+. Accordingly, our results indicate that the inhibitory effect of Cu on the DOM photobleaching and the loss of electron-donating moieties of DOM significantly decreased with an increase in pH, suggesting more pronounced competition for DOMD•+ from antioxidant phenolic moieties within DOM. Considering the precursors of DOMD•+ also originate from phenolic moieties of DOM, the findings of this study provide important insights into the long-distance charge transfer reactions occurring at different phenolic moiety sites during DOM photooxidation."

This study first examines whether 149 countries can transition 100% of their business-as-usual (BAU) all-sector energy to electricity and heat obtained from 100% wind-water-solar (WWS) sources to solve these problems. WWS eliminates energy-related air pollution deaths and CO2-equivalent emissions while reducing end-use energy needs by ∼54.4%, annual energy costs by ∼59.6%, and annual social (energy plus health plus climate) costs by ∼91.8% among nations, giving energy- and social-cost payback times of 5.9 and 0.78 years, respectively. Conversely, “all-of-the-above” policies promoting carbon capture (CC) and/or synthetic (as opposed to natural) direct air carbon capture (SDACC) to reduce or offset CO2 emissions trigger, with full penetration of CC/SDACC across 149 countries, $60–80 trillion/y in social cost, or 9.1–12.1 times the WWS social cost and only 1.1–25.6% lower social cost than BAU. Even when all CO2 is stored, CC and SDACC increase air pollution, CO2-equivalent emissions (due to capture inefficiencies and not capturing non-CO2 greenhouse gases), energy needs, and equipment costs relative to WWS. Sensitivity tests reinforce this finding. Although full penetration is extreme, any CC/SDACC level increases social cost and emissions substantially versus WWS. Thus, policies promoting CC and SDACC should be abandoned."

A new mechanism of water lead contamination via nitrate-induced spallation of solder was elucidated through surface analyses of new solder coupons and harvested pipe samples, bench-scale testing with lead–tin alloys of varying tin content, and electrochemical tests. Nitrate attack was associated with the formation of ammonia and other reduced nitrogen compounds, causing detinning of solder alloys with more than 40% tin by weight and eventually complete detachment of solder from the point of adhesion to copper pipe via the formation of a corrosive microenvironment. Solder spallation was observed in as little as 6 weeks and resulted in 1.3 times more metal weight loss than could be explained by Faraday’s law for both tin and 50/50 lead–tin solder in 32 h electrochemical tests.

Further analysis reveals that all patterns are significantly modulated by Madden Jullian Oscillation (MJO) activities, each showing distinct peak occurrences in different MJO phases, with further links to ENSO and the Indian Ocean Dipole."

We analyzed 7,093 high‐quality SWS measurements from teleseismic S waves recorded by Hi‐net stations across the Ryukyu arc in Japan. Our findings show a systematic rotation of the fast S polarization from trench‐parallel to trench‐perpendicular depending on the earthquake backazimuth. For the same earthquake, the measured splitting patterns also vary spatially across the southwest Japan. Using full‐wave seismic modeling, we showed that a dipping slab with ∼30% shear anisotropy of the tilted transverse isotropy (TTI) type, with a symmetry axis perpendicular to the slab interface, can predict the observed delay times and polarization rotation. Our results highlight the importance of considering dipping anisotropic slabs in interpreting SWS at subduction zones."

Surface water CH4 ranged from 690% supersaturation relative to atmospheric equilibrium near the glacier to 140% on the shelf. N2O was undersaturated (84 ± 21%) near the glacier front and approached equilibrium in coastal seawater. The glacial lagoon was a CH4 source to the atmosphere and N2O sink, while nearshore shelf waters were a weak source of both gases. The total shelf CH4 emissions to the atmosphere were one order of magnitude greater than the lateral freshwater dissolved CH4 exports from the lagoon. The strong regional marine CO2 sink exceeds the CO2‐equivalent global warming potentials of CH4 and N2O emissions to the atmosphere by one order of magnitude.

Proposed mechanisms include anomalous radiative and thermodynamic surface fluxes, horizontal transport, changing mixed layer thickness and basal entrainment rates. To test these ideas the heat budget of the ocean mixed layer was examined in a numerical simulation. The results show that the anomalous SSTs in the North Atlantic during the summer of 2023 were caused by increased shortwave warming and reduced thermodynamic cooling. In contrast, ocean mean and eddy heat transport convergence and heat exchanges along the mixed layer base dominate only regionally. A second contributor to the record SSTs was the preconditioning of mixed layer temperature following a series of anomalously warm years."

For model inputs, we utilize climate simulations conducted at 4‐km horizontal grid spacing over Alaska from 2005 to 2016, providing a historical and future pseudo‐global warming scenario. Analysis of hydrographs reveals the peak timing shifts slightly earlier in the year for most of Alaska's streams. The change in peak magnitude is more heterogeneous across the state, with the northernmost region showing the highest projected increases. The changes in timing are driven by temperature, while precipitation and temperature drive the changes in magnitude.

We generated two P‐wave velocity profiles of the shallow section of the detachment using first‐arrival travel‐time tomography, preconditioned by downward continuation. Our results reveal a low‐angle detachment, dipping at ∼15° (±5°) at 5 km east of the ridge axis, and evidence for uplifted lower‐crustal gabbro in the footwall. Increasing footwall velocities southward suggest a more intense exhumation of deep‐seated rocks, showing the detachment's geometry changes along the ridge axis.

MJO assessments are challenging because characterizing MJO behavior outside of the satellite era suffers from a lack of detailed information about its observed state, remote signals and often relies on climate models' typically poor MJO representation. This study shows that, while tropical soundings are spatially and temporally sparse, they are still useful for better understanding multi‐decadal MJO amplitude variability. The similarities between variability of the MJO derived from (imperfect) reanalysis products and (sparse) tropical station observations suggest that decadal changes during the last 60 years are physical and not necessarily related to changes in the observational network. The larger differences in MJO amplitude between station and reanalysis prior to 1960 suggest that sparse tropical observations are a barrier to fully characterizing long‐term MJO evolution during the 20th $20\text{th}$ century."

However, the energization of cold ions in the magnetotail during storm periods remains poorly understood. This paper investigates cold ion energization by secondary reconnection in a magnetotail reconnection outflow during a storm period. This secondary reconnection was triggered by the interaction between a large‐scale flux pileup region and a magnetic flux rope. Cold protons originating from the ionosphere were injected into the diffusion region from the lobe region. These cold protons gained energy mainly through the normal electric field in the flux pileup region before entering the cold ion diffusion region, where their bulk kinetic energy was mainly converted into thermal kinetic energy. These results will significantly advance our understanding of the energization and transport of cold ions in the magnetotail."

We identify two characteristic modes of variability—decadal‐to‐multidecadal (DMDvar) and centennial (CENvar). The former is driven largely by temperature anomalies in the subpolar North Atlantic, while the latter is driven by salinity in the western subpolar North Atlantic. The amplitude of each mode scales linearly with the mean AMOC strength in the IPSL experiments. The DMDvar amplitude correlates well with the AMOC mean strength across CMIP6 models, while the CENvar mode does not. These findings suggest that the strength of DMDvar depends robustly on the North Atlantic mean state, while the CENvar mode may be model‐dependent."

 Water is a principal component of Earth’s fluids, and its interaction with rocks governs lithospheric geochemical and geodynamic processes. Water–rock interactions are crucial in societally relevant resource management, including subsurface extraction and storage of energy, the deep carbon cycle and generating critical metal deposits. The prevailing view is that fluids navigate through the lithosphere without being influenced by the distinct properties that arise from matter confined at the nanoscale. Here we use electron microscopy and neutron scattering data to show that a diverse range of lithospheric rocks, including sandstones, peridotites and serpentinites, consistently show nanoporosity, predominantly with pore sizes < 100 nanometres. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that water’s dielectric permittivity—a fundamental property that governs its geochemical behaviour—diverges in nanoconfinement from its bulk counterpart under conditions ranging from ambient to extremes of 700 °C and 5 GPa. Our geochemical simulations suggest that changes in water permittivity due to confinement will decrease mineral solubility, a process that is not currently considered in models of fluid–rock interactions. Given that permittivity is also intimately linked to ion speciation, pore-size-dependent properties should be expected to exert a primary influence on rock reactivity and the geochemical evolution of fluids during fluid–rock interactions. Diverse lithospheric rocks show nanoporosity that changes the geochemistry of fluids and rock reactivity during fluid–rock interactions, according to a study including electron microscopy, molecular dynamics and thermodynamic modelling."

 Ocean pH is a fundamental property regulating various aspects of Earth system evolution. However, early ocean pH remains controversial, with estimates ranging from strongly acidic to alkaline. Here we develop a model integrating global carbon cycling with ocean geochemistry, and incorporating continental growth and mantle thermal evolution. By coupling global carbon cycle with ocean charge balance, and by using solid Earth processes of mantle degassing and crustal evolution to specify the history of volatile distribution and ocean chemistry, we show that a rapid increase in ocean pH is likely during the Hadean to the early Archaean eons, with pH evolving from 5 to neutral by approximately 4.0 Gyr ago. This rapid pH evolution is attributed primarily to elevated rates of both seafloor and continental weathering during the Hadean. This acceleration in weathering rates originates in the unique aspects of Hadean geodynamics, including rapid crust formation, different crustal lithology and fast plate motion. Earth probably transformed from a hostile state to a habitable one by the end of the Hadean, approximately 4.0 Gyr ago, with important implications for planetary habitability and the origin of life.

 The inner core has been inferred to change its rotation rate or shape over years to decades since the discovery of temporal variability in seismic waves from repeating earthquakes that travelled through the inner core. Recent work confirmed that the inner core rotated faster and then slower than the rest of Earth in the last few decades; this work analysed inner-core-traversing (PKIKP) seismic waves recorded by the Eielson (ILAR) and Yellowknife (YKA) arrays in northern North America from 121 repeating earthquake pairs between 1991 and 2023 in the South Sandwich Islands. Here we extend this set of repeating earthquakes and compare pairs at times when the inner core re-occupied the same position, revealing non-rotational changes at YKA but not ILAR between 2004 and 2008. We propose that these changes originate in the shallow inner core, and so affect the inner-core-grazing YKA ray paths more than the deeper-bottoming ray paths to ILAR. We thus resolve the long-standing debate on whether temporal variability in PKIKP waves results from rotation or more local action near the inner-core boundary: it is tentatively both. The changes near the inner-core boundary most likely result from viscous deformation driven by coupling between boundary topography and mantle density anomalies or traction on the inner core from outer-core convection.

Here, the authors report a molecular dipole orienting strategy for preparation of single-crystal thin films with high transistor mobility. 
 Precise control over crystallinity and morphology of conjugated polymers (CPs) is essential for progressing organic electronics. However, manufacturing single-crystal thin films of CPs presents substantial challenges due to their complex molecular structures, distorted chain conformations, and unbalanced crystallization kinetics. In this work, we demonstrate a universal nanoconfined molecular-dipole orientating strategy to craft high-quality single-crystal thin films for a variety of CPs, spanning from traditional thiophene- and theinothiophene-based homopolymers to diketopyrrolopyrrole- (i.e., p-type) and naphthalene-based (i.e., n-type) donor-acceptor copolymers. Central to this strategy is the synergetic manipulations of molecular dipoles, π-π stackings, and alkyl-alkyl interactions of CPs within our rationally-designed spatial-electrostatic confinement capacitor, which facilitates the rotation of conjugated backbones and the alignment of π-π stackings into microscale-sized single-crystal thin films. A minimal energetic disorder of 25 meV that below the thermal fluctuation energy kBT at room temperature, as well as an excellent transistor mobility of 15.5 cm2V−1s−1 are achieved, marking a significant step towards controllable growths of conjugated-polymer single-crystal thin films that hold a cornerstone for high-performance organic electronic devices.

 Defining the trajectory of cells during differentiation and disease is key for uncovering the mechanisms driving cell fate and identity. However, trajectories of human cells remain largely unexplored due to the challenges of studying them with human samples. In this study, we investigate the proteome trajectory of iPSCs differentiation to hepatic stellate cells (diHSCs) and identify RORA as a key transcription factor governing the metabolic reprogramming of HSCs necessary for diHSCs’ commitment, identity, and activation. Using RORA deficient iPSCs and pharmacologic interventions, we show that RORA is required for early differentiation and prevents diHSCs activation by reducing the high energetic state of the cells. While RORA knockout mice have enhanced fibrosis, RORA agonists rescue multi-organ fibrosis in in vivo models. Notably, RORA expression correlates negatively with liver fibrosis and HSCs activation markers in patients with liver disease. This study reveals that RORA regulates cell metabolic plasticity, important for mesoderm differentiation, pericyte quiescence, and fibrosis, influencing cell commitment and disease.

 Interactions among insects, plants, and microorganisms are fundamental to ecosystem dynamics, with floral nectar and pollen serving as key resources for various organisms. Yeasts, such as Metschnikowia reukaufii, commonly found in nectar, influence nectarial attraction through volatile compounds (VOCs), yet the underlying biological mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that isoamyl alcohol, a prominent yeast VOC, attracts oriental armyworm moths (Mythimna separata) to pollen-rich, yeast-fermented nectar. In a series of electrophysiological and behavioral assays, we show that isoamyl alcohol activates a single class of highly specific olfactory sensory neurons expressing the olfactory receptor MsepOR8. In the moth antennal lobe, these neurons target the AM2 glomerulus, which responds to isoamyl alcohol. Genetic disruption of MsepOR8 leads to complete abolition of both physiological and behavioral responses to isoamyl alcohol, resulting in an impaired ability to locate nectar sources. Moreover, we show that isoamyl alcohol-induced foraging behavior fosters a mutualistic relationship between yeast and moths to some extent, enhancing yeast dispersal and increasing moth reproductive success. Our results unveil a highly specific mechanism by which a yeast-derived VOC facilitates insect-yeast mutualism, providing insights into insect-microbe interactions within pollination ecosystems.

 Quantum effects like entanglement and coherent amplification can be used to drastically enhance the accuracy of quantum parameter estimation beyond classical limits. However, challenges such as decoherence and time-dependent errors hinder Heisenberg-limited amplification. We introduce Quantum Signal-Processing Phase Estimation algorithms that are robust against these challenges and achieve optimal performance as dictated by the Cramér-Rao bound. These algorithms use quantum signal transformation to decouple interdependent phase parameters into largely orthogonal ones, ensuring that time-dependent errors in one do not compromise the accuracy of learning the other. Combining provably optimal classical estimation with near-optimal quantum circuit design, our approach achieves a standard deviation accuracy of 10−4 radians for estimating unwanted swap angles in superconducting two-qubit experiments, using low-depth ( < 10) circuits. This represents up to two orders of magnitude improvement over existing methods. Theoretically and numerically, we demonstrate the optimality of our algorithm against time-dependent phase errors, observing that the variance of the time-sensitive parameter φ scales faster than the asymptotic Heisenberg scaling in the small-depth regime. Our results are rigorously validated against the quantum Fisher information, confirming our protocol’s ability to achieve unmatched precision for two-qubit gate learning.

 The springtime Arctic Oscillation (AO), a dominant pattern of atmospheric variability in the extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere, influences the subsequent El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) by triggering westerly wind bursts over the equatorial western Pacific. It thereby provides a source of predictability of ENSO. However, the influence of AO on ENSO is not stable in time, the causes of which have not been well addressed. This study shows that the AO-ENSO relationship has exhibited multi-decadal variations that are primarily caused by the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV). During the negative AMV phases, the strengthening of the Pacific center of the AO induces stronger atmospheric and sea surface temperature anomalies in the subtropical North Pacific. Those anomalies generate pronounced westerly wind anomalies over the equatorial western Pacific via air–sea interaction process, leading to a strengthened impact of the spring AO on ENSO. Observations and North Atlantic Pacemaker experiments confirm the AMV impact on the Pacific center of the AO by changing the strength of the Aleutian Low and the polar vortex.

 Atmospheric amines, derivatives of ammonia, play a unique yet not fully understood role in air quality, climate and public health.

This serves as the initial step for cloud droplet formation and, consequently, influences cloud properties and the hydrological cycle. Ambient observations demonstrate more than a thousand-fold particle formation rates in the presence of amines as compared to ammonia. Yet, the challenges related to detecting minute levels of amines, the paucity of ambient amine measurements, and the limited process-based understanding of airborne aerosol production have resulted in amines being underrepresented in global climate models.

 Since the late 1990s, summer surface melt across ice shelves in the Ross-Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica increased significantly, as demonstrated by satellite measurements and MetUM simulations. This contrasts with the period from 1979 to the late 1990s, which witnessed a decreasing summer melt trend driven by the positive trend in Southern Annular Mode. The increase in summer melt since the late 1990s is linked to an increase in geopotential height and intensified anticyclonic blocking along coastal West Antarctica, which strengthened northerly winds over the Ross-Amundsen Sea sector, leading to enhanced advection of warm, marine air. Our analysis reveals a strong connection between summer melt indices and sea surface temperatures in the South Pacific Convergence Zone during this period. Moreover, increased summer precipitation in South Pacific Convergence Zone since the late 1990s strengthened the Rossby wave teleconnection toward West Antarctica, contributing to enhanced blocking along the coastal region.

 Highly sodic peralkaline magmas can reach hyper-enrichment in critical metals including rare earth elements (REE). We explore clinopyroxene zoning to track the evolution of peralkaline magmas and the mechanisms that trigger critical metal mineralisation, focusing on the Mesozoic Benolong Volcanic Suite in eastern Australia, which includes a zirconium + hafnium + niobium + tantalum mineralised subvolcanic sill. Major and trace element analysis of clinopyroxene across the volcanic field tracks continuous magma differentiation from diopside-hedenbergite to aegirine, associated with progressive enrichment of rare metals. Crucially, aegirine in the mineralised trachyte becomes sector-zoned and depleted in critical metals, which instead partition into latest-stage eudialyte. Association with vesiculated portions of the sill suggests that sector zoning is the product of undercooling which may be driven by degassing. Because volatiles increase the solubility of critical metals in silicate magmas, we suggest retention of volatiles and dynamic crystallisation conditions drive enrichment of critical metals in the Toongi deposit. Our data show that pyroxene chemistry and zoning can help track fertility in critical metals in peralkaline magmas.

 Land surface temperature (LST) data are crucial for global climate change research. While remote sensing data serve as a key source for LST, single-source sensor data often lack spatiotemporal continuity due to long satellite revisit intervals and cloud cover. Spatiotemporal fusion, which combines the strengths of multiple sources, can increase the available information. However, most current spatiotemporal fusion methods are designed for local-scale applications. This research proposes the Global Spatiotemporal Fusion Model (GLOSTFM) to generate global LST products. GLOSTFM, built on image pyramid principles, addresses the computational and complexity challenges of global-scale spatiotemporal fusion. Moreover, the model utilizes data from the novel Fengyun-3D satellite, which has a daily revisit capability and provides LST products separately derived from its thermal infrared (MERSI, 1 km) and microwave (MWRI, 25 km) sensors. By leveraging the cloud-penetrating capabilities of the microwave data to compensate for missing information, GLOSTFM increases the available information and reduces observational uncertainties. The results showcase high processing efficiency and enhanced spatiotemporal continuity, with an average RMSE of 2.874 K and an excellent R2 of 0.980. The utility of the GLOSTFM model for monitoring urban heat island effects in Beijing was explored to illustrate one application among a broad range of potential applications of the proposed GLOSTFM that require global data on LST across the Earth's surface."
None,False,Remote Sensing of Environment,该论文主要关注利用遥感技术估算农作物的产量，通过高分辨率的总初级生产力（Gross Primary Productivity）和动态收获指数来绘制作物产量图。它侧重于农业遥感应用，而非大气环境遥感，因此与空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等大气环境遥感技术关系不大。,"['Gross Primary Productivity', 'Crop Yield', 'Remote Sensing', 'Harvest Index']",Weiguo Yu;Dong Li;Hengbiao Zheng;Xia Yao;Yan Zhu;Weixing Cao;Lin Qiu;Tao Cheng;Yongguang Zhang;Yanlian Zhou,"Corrigendum to “HIDYM: A high-resolution gross primary productivity and dynamic harvest index based crop yield mapper” [Remote Sensing of Environment, 2024, 114301]",

This research focuses on the application of environmental data to improve the classification and understanding of the mechanisms behind woody species encroachment in the Southern Great Plains (USA). While ""environmental data"" might include some atmospheric-related variables (e.g., precipitation), its core is in terrestrial ecology and plant geography, rather than atmospheric environmental remote sensing technology. Therefore, the research is not directly or strongly related to atmospheric environmental remote sensing technologies such as air quality monitoring, satellite observations, or atmospheric composition analysis.",[],Justin Dawsey;Nancy E.

10.1016/j.atmosenv.2025.121099,False,Atmospheric Environment,该研究论文主要关注中国郑州市大气中颗粒物结合的多环芳烃（PACs）的污染特征和健康风险。虽然与空气质量监测相关，但它更侧重于具体的污染物成分分析、来源解析和健康风险评估，而不是利用遥感技术进行大气环境监测，如卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术的直接关联性不强。,"['PAHs', 'air quality', 'health risk assessment', 'particulate matter']",Junmei Zhang;Zhiyu Wang;Yuhang Wei;Shushen Yang;Xiaoyan Song;Sen Yao;Lingxiao Yang,Pollution characteristics and health risks of size-resolved particulate-bound polycyclic aromatic compounds in Zhengzhou,"•The particulate PACs concentrations were higher in winter than in summer. •The masses of PACs were enriched mainly in fine particles. •The secondary formation of N/OPAHs was significant. •Human exposure through dermal absorption to PACs was non-negligible. •The total ILCR of PACs for adults was higher than the acceptable limit. 
 Size-segregated particulate samples were collected from a megacity in Central China during four different seasons to determine the concentrations of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs), explore their size distributions, and evaluate their health risks. The annual average concentrations of Σ17PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), Σ7NPAHs, and Σ6OPAHs (nitrated and oxygenated PAHs) were 22.0 ng m−3, 0.59 ng m−3, and 4.65 ng m−3, respectively, which all exhibited significantly seasonal variations with peak values in winter. Five-to seven-ring PAHs were dominant, explaining 47.0%–63.5% of the Σ17PAHs, with BbF being the most important component across the four different seasons. (2 + 3)-NFLT and 9,10-ATQ were the most abundant NPAHs and OPAHs, respectively. More than 60% of the PACs masses were enriched in fine particles (aerodynamic diameter (Dp) < 2.1 μm), and the mass median diameters (MMDs) of PACs were much less than 2.1 μm. The main sources of PACs identified by diagnostic ratios and principal component analysis (PCA) were coal/biomass combustion, vehicular exhaust emission, and secondary generation. Inhalation exposure assessment revealed that the annual average deposition efficiency of PACs was 48.2%, with PACs mainly deposited in the head airway (36.7%). The inhalation exposure pathway was more significant than the dermal absorption exposure pathway, whereas the incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) for inhalation exposure (ILCRinh) was slightly lower than the ILCR for dermal absorption exposure (ILCRderm). The PACs in the fine particles (Dp < 2.1 μm) contributed more than half of the ILCRinh values, but the coarse particles (Dp > 3.3 μm) contributed more than 76.2% of the ILCRderm values. The total ILCR, including the ILCRinh and ILCRderm for adults, exceeded the acceptable limit of 10−6 set by the USEPA."
