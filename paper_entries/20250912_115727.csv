10.1088/1748-9326/adf2c0,True,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文探讨了2011-2023年间中国热浪极端事件的加剧趋势，并分析了温室气体浓度上升和气溶胶减少对其的影响。研究发现，二氧化碳浓度上升和气溶胶冷却效应减弱共同导致了极端高温的增加，尤其是在气溶胶减少显著的中国东部地区。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及气溶胶光学厚度的变化，这可以通过卫星观测和大气成分分析进行监测。此外，空气质量监测是评估气溶胶减少政策效果的重要手段。,"['aerosols', 'greenhouse gases', 'air quality monitoring', 'aerosol optical depth', 'atmospheric composition']",Aili Zou;Yang Yang;Hailong Wang;Pinya Wang;Ke Li;Yuanjian Yang;Chao Liu;Jiandong Wang;Hong Liao,Intensifying heat extremes in China attributed to rising greenhouse gases and declining aerosols since the 2010s,"Rising temperatures have increased the frequency, duration, and intensity of extreme temperature events over China in recent decades. The upward trends in heat extremes in China in the warm season (May–September) and their relationships with changes in aerosols and greenhouse gases are investigated using observations, reanalysis data and model results. Significant increasing trends in China are observed in daily maximum temperatures (TXx), heatwave frequency, and heatwave mean duration during 2011–2023, with increasing rates of 0.70 °C/decade, 3.77 d/decade and 0.31 d/event/decade, respectively. This study shows that 43 ± 3% of the TXx increases in China are attributed to the rising CO2 concentrations. Aerosol optical depth in China decreased at a rate of 0.054 per decade from 2011 to 2023 due to significant air quality improvements. The weakened aerosol cooling effect due to declining aerosols contributes 27 ± 3% to the observed TXx trend. In eastern China, where aerosol reductions were most significant, aerosol reduction even accounts for 79 ± 10% of the TXx increasing trend. The intensifying heat waves attributed to GHGs and aerosols are in accordance with the increasing extreme high temperatures. The results highlight the significant impacts of rising GHGs and decreasing aerosols on heat extreme events over China in recent years, emphasizing the need of considering both GHGs and aerosols to address the issue of intensification of heat extremes in a warming future."

Despite the potential positive outcomes achieved through forest restoration (hereafter restoration), many projects have neglected to focus on social and biocultural benefits of restoration at the local level. Erasures of locally-derived restoration priorities by larger-scale actors (e.g. project developers, practitioners, funders, and scholars) have resulted in inequitable distributions of benefits and tree mortality. It is therefore crucial to determine some of the key locally-derived, plural priorities and benefits of restoration. In this study, we investigated how communities conceptualize the priorities and benefits of restoration by conducting in-depth participatory mapping workshops with two Indigenous communities, two Afro-descendant (Quilombola) communities, and two agrarian-reform settlements in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil–a top global priority biome for restoration. Through transdisciplinary mapmaking exercises on conceptions of restoration, we assembled five primary themes on the plural ways that communities have reappropriated the concept of restoration and created alternatives to how restoration has been commonly represented by larger-scale actors. These include: asserting territorial sovereignty and defending claims to lands; Bem Viver (living well); contesting dominant narratives about monoculture, capitalism, and land speculation; caring for ancestors, animals, and other living things, and fulfilling spiritual and cultural responsibilities; and realizing dreams and visions for desired futures. By broadening conceptualizations of the priorities and benefits of restoration, our study diverges from past research on restoration and emphasizes the importance of expanding beyond narrow definitions of restoration. We highlight the critical role of communities in the restoration process and the importance of conducting direct work with affected communities to inform the way restoration is understood, discussed, and practiced. This research may support action towards a restoration future that is both effective and equitable."
10.1088/1748-9326/adfe7f,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注不同生态系统中植被冠层温度的动态变化及其与环境驱动因素的关系。虽然温度是大气环境的一个因素，但该研究的重点是植被生理过程（如光合作用、呼吸作用和蒸腾作用）与冠层温度之间的关系，以及环境因素（如太阳辐射）和植被类型如何影响这些温度动态。它不直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术的关联性较弱。,[],Jen L Diehl;Mostafa Javadian;George W Koch;Christopher J Still;Andrew D Richardson,Drivers of canopy temperature dynamics across diverse ecosystems,"Temperature of leaves and canopies is critically important for many physiological processes, including photosynthesis, respiration, and transpiration. But the variation of canopy temperature and its relationship with air temperature across a range of ecosystems and environmental conditions is understudied, challenging our ability to predict canopy temperature responses in a rapidly warming climate. Therefore, to better understand how environmental drivers and site characteristics interact with vegetation types to influence these temperature dynamics, we analyzed canopy temperature estimates derived from upwelling longwave radiation measurements across seven years and 36 NEON (National Ecological Observatory Network) sites in the USA. Canopy temperature consistently exceeded or closely tracked air temperature, with the strength and magnitude of this relationship varying by vegetation type. Multiple linear regression analysis confirmed incoming shortwave radiation as the dominant driver of ΔT (canopy temperature—air temperature). While this driver was consistently important across all sites, sites within the same vegetation type tended to respond similarly to the full set of environmental drivers. Vegetation height was associated with variation in the magnitude of ΔT. These findings support the use of vegetation type groupings to capture generalizable patterns in canopy temperature dynamics, patterns that are critical for understanding ecosystem responses under future climate scenarios."
10.1088/1748-9326/adff2e,False,Environmental Research Letters,该论文主要探讨了在实现巴黎协定目标的过程中，如何通过公平分配碳排放和碳移除的责任来应对气候变化。它侧重于伦理和公平性，提出了一个基于公正的框架，用于分配碳移除和剩余排放的责任，尤其是在达到全球净零排放前后。论文讨论了发达国家和发展中国家如何在碳移除方面进行合作，以增强国际合作和国家层面的气候行动。虽然该研究与气候变化有关，但它更侧重于政策、伦理和国际合作，而不是直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['carbon dioxide removal', 'net-zero emissions', 'climate justice', 'historical responsibility', 'international cooperation']",Mingyu Li;Rui Wang;Xinzhu Zheng;Can Wang;Joeri Rogelj,Sharing emissions and removals for meeting the Paris Agreement through a distributive and corrective justice lens,"Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is critical for achieving net-zero and net-negative CO2 emissions that can halt and potentially reverse global warming, respectively. However, reliable CDR is still costly and comes with considerable technological and ecological uncertainties. Despite the centrality of equity in the Paris Agreement, no integrated framework exists to equitably allocate responsibilities for CDR and residual emissions among countries. Here, we present a justice-based framework that separates out ethical considerations for equitably allocating gross emissions and gross CDR, addressing how these contributions shift before and after reaching global net-zero CO2 emissions. The framework distinguishes between CDR delivered as a common good to reach a collective global climate outcome, and CDR that is used to pay off carbon debts due to emissions overconsumption. We offer a new perspective for how nations with substantial historical responsibilities and emerging economies with increasing capacities can collaborate and equitably share the CDR burden, enhancing both international cooperation and national-level climate action."

This study evaluates the integration of photovoltaic (PV) technology into China’s extensive railway network and reveals that suitable areas on rails could potentially generate 204.6 TWh of electricity annually, equivalent to more than twice of the Three Gorges Power Station’s output, and accounting for approximately 9.2% of China’s total renewable electricity generation in 2020 (2,214.8 TWh). The proposed hybrid railway PV energy system is estimated at a national average levelized cost of electricity of 0.14 CNY kWh−1, with a potential profit of CNY 77.8 billion upon transitioning from the current electricity supply. Among 371 cities analyzed, 291 (78.4%) are expected to reach a production-side grid parity, while all cities would achieve user-side grid parity. The implementation of this PV system could significantly mitigate environmental impacts, reducing carbon emissions by 126.5 Mt and lowering air pollutants, including 64 199 tons of NOX, 44 423 tons of SO2, and 7789 tons of PMX. Substantial railways in rural regions can optimize the energy consumption structure of rural residents, reducing the share of coal and liquefied petroleum gas in per capita energy consumption from 29.44% to 7.27%, and leading their average annual expenditure on primary energy sources dropping from CNY667.9 to CNY502.7—a 24.23% reduction."

These changes are critical in the Arctic where the effects of sea level rise are exacerbated by the loss of sea ice protecting coasts, subsidence as permafrost thaws, and a projected increase in storms. Such changes will likely alter the land-atmosphere gas exchange of high-latitude coastal ecosystems, but the effects of flooding with warming remain unexplored. In this work we use a field experiment to examine the interacting effects of increased tidal flooding and warming on land-atmosphere CO2 and CH4 exchange in the coastal Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta, a large sub-Arctic wetland and tundra complex in western Alaska. We inundated dammed plots to simulate two levels of future flooding: low-intensity flooding represented by one day of flooding per summer-month (June, July and August), and high-intensity flooding represented by three-consecutive days of flooding per summer-month, crossed with a warming treatment of 1.4 °C. We found that both flooding and warming influenced greenhouse gas (GHG) exchange. Low-intensity flooding reduced net CO2 uptake by 20% (0.78 µmol m−2 s−1) regardless of temperature, and marginally increased CH4 emissions 0.83 nmol m−2 s−1 (33%) under ambient temperature, while decreasing CH4 emissions by −1.96 nmol m−2 s−1 (40%) under warming. In contrast, high-intensity flooding restored net CO2 uptake to control levels due to enhanced primary productivity under both temperature treatments. High-intensity flooding decreased CH4 emissions under ambient temperature by 0.76 nmol m−2 s−1 (30%), but greatly increased emissions under warming by 4.68 nmol m−2 s−1 (265%), presumably driven by increased plant-mediated CH4 transport. These findings reveal that GHG exchange responds rapidly and non-linearly to intensifying flooding, and highlight the importance of short-term flooding dynamics and warming in shaping future carbon cycling in this Arctic coastal wetland."

Evaluating consequential greenhouse gas emissions from EV charging,"While electrifying transportation eliminates tailpipe greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, electric vehicle (EV) adoption can create additional electricity sector emissions. To quantify this emissions impact, prior work typically employs short-run marginal emissions or average emissions rates calculated from historical data or power systems models that do not consider changes in installed capacity. In this work, we use an electricity system capacity expansion model to consider the full consequential GHG emissions impact from large-scale EV adoption in the western United States, accounting for induced changes in generation and storage capacity. We find that the metrics described above do not accurately reflect the true emissions impact of EV adoption–average emissions rates can either under- or over-estimate emission impacts, and short-run marginal emissions rates can significantly underestimate emission reductions, especially when charging timing is flexible. Our results also show that using short-run marginal emission rates as signals to coordinate EV charging could increase emissions relative to price-based charging signals, indicating the need for alternative control strategies to minimize consequential emissions."

In this study, we present a univariate machine learning framework using long short term memory networks that forecasts daily-averaged SLA with a 3 d lead time over the north Indian Ocean using historical satellite altimetry data at a spatial resolution of ∼13 km. Assuming that SLA reanalysis from state-of-the-art systems represent the pinnacle of performance skill of forecasts from dynamical models, we show that the SLA forecasts from our model exhibits superior skills through comprehensive analyses. The errors are typically less than 0.04 m over most of the domain and the correlations are close to unity. The skills of the daily-averaged forecasted currents with a 3 d lead, estimated using geostrophic and Ekman theory, are comparable with the best available reanalysis when compared to in-situ observations both in the open ocean or shelf. Treating these forecasted surface currents as synthetic observations, we show that assimilating them can significantly improve the instantaneous subsurface currents during forecasts. The subsurface correlations turn significant with 99% confidence level across depth which were otherwise mostly insignificant and the errors reduce by 0.1 m·s−1. We demonstrate that the short-term forecast of daily-averaged SLA and surface currents can be approached as a collection of localized low-dimensional independent univariate systems thereby reducing computational costs by large margins. This machine learning framework heralds a paradigm shift in the realm of ocean forecasting."

South Korea faces this issue, particularly owing to a rise in the nation’s average age at an unprecedented rate and a significantly low total fertility rate (TFR) (0.72 in 2023). Research on measures to reduce GHG emissions in an aging society with a declining birthrate has highlighted the importance of the structure of household carbon footprint (HCF) across different age groups. However, no studies have analyzed the structure of HCF across different age groups or the impact of demographic changes on HCF in South Korea. This study highlights the structures of HCF by age group in South Korea by combining a multi-regional input–output model with household and demographic surveys. Furthermore, we projected the effects of demographic changes in line with business-as-usual and an ambitious government policy for recovering the TFR (BaU and fertility rate recovery (FRR) Scenarios, respectively) on HCF from 2020 to 2050. These procedures revealed that the FRR will increase in 13.5 Mt-CO2eq in 2050, compared to BaU. This brings the HCF of senior generations (60 years and older) from 49.7% (BaU) to 48.3% (FRR) of the total HCF in 2050, slightly reducing their dominance of HCF. With the fertility recovery policy, the impact of an increase in the HCF of younger generations, aged 39 years and below, was limited until 2050. However, the rebound of HCF (e.g. education, entertainment and culture, restaurants, and hotels) must be considered in case the number of younger generations continues to increase, underlying national policies for fertility recovery."

Here, we systematically compare trends from state-of-the-art precipitation datasets with station data across the region. Our results reveal substantial disagreements in both the magnitude and direction of trends, with datasets frequently failing to capture observed station trends. Trend accuracy varies considerably, with better agreement in more densely sampled areas like the Caatinga, while the Western and Northern Amazonia show lower accuracy. Moreover, we find limited agreement between datasets and stations regarding documented patterns, such as southern Amazonia drying during the dry season and Western Amazonia wetting in the wet season. An exception is the Southeastern Cerrado, where most datasets consistently capture significant drying trends in the wet season. Our findings highlight the need for a multi-dataset approach and an improved observational network to assess precipitation changes in tropical South America."

While forest and shrub fires have decreased, cropland fires are rising, especially in northeastern China. Our findings suggest that climate and local policies affect wildfire emissions and that better fire management is needed to reduce future carbon impacts. 
 Wildfires release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change and causing severe impacts on air quality and human health. In this study, based on a bottom-up approach and using satellite data, combined with emission factor and aboveground biomass data for different vegetation cover types (forest, shrub, grassland, and cropland), the dynamic changes in CO2 emissions from wildfires in China from 2001 to 2022 were analyzed. The results showed that between 2001 and 2022, the total CO2 emissions from wildfires in China were 937.7 Tg (522.6–1516.0 Tg, 1 Tg = 1012 g), with an annual average of 42.6 Tg (23.8–68.9 Tg). The CO2 emissions from cropland and forest fires were relatively high, accounting for 45 % and 46 % of the total, respectively. The yearly variation in CO2 emissions from forest and shrub fires showed a significant downward trend, while emissions from grassland fires remained relatively stable. In contrast, the CO2 emissions from cropland fires showed an upward trend, primarily in Northeast China. Hot spot analysis and geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) models revealed significant spatial heterogeneity in emissions across vegetation types. Persistent hot spots of shrub and forest fires were located in Southwest and South China, while Northeast China experienced sporadic but extreme fire events. The GTWR model for shrub fire CO2 emissions exhibited the highest predictive performance (R2= 0.87), and climatic factors (particularly temperature and humidity) were the main influencing factors. Notably, the recent rise in cropland fire CO2 emissions in Northeast China is closely linked to region-specific straw-burning policies. The research results provide valuable references for atmospheric transport models, regional fire management, and national carbon accounting frameworks in the context of climate change."

We found rapid cooling of the atmosphere and shifts in cloud cover and atmospheric circulation patterns like land–sea circulation. Our research helps to better understand cloud adjustments, which are a major source of uncertainty in climate models. This can improve future climate predictions. 
 “Radiative” or “rapid” adjustments refer to the response of the climate system to an instantaneous radiative forcing, independent of surface temperature changes. These adjustments occur over timescales from hours (e.g. aerosol–cloud interactions) to months (e.g. stratospheric temperature changes), often overlapping with feedback mechanisms – making their separation in realistic scenarios challenging. Controlled simulation experiments can thus help isolate adjustment processes and improve understanding relevant to more complex cases like volcanic eruptions or ongoing climate change.The abrupt-solm4p experiment of the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project (CFMIP), part of the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), simulates an instantaneous 4 % reduction in the solar constant from a pre-industrial state on 1 January 1850. This study analyses changes in climate variables, cloud properties, and radiative fluxes across different timescales (hours, days, months and up to 150 years) to identify adjustment mechanisms and characteristic fingerprints for a shortwave forcing scenario.The four participating models show rapid adjustments of 3.57±0.46Wm-2, offsetting ∼ 35 % of the initial forcing. Distinct local patterns include initial rapid surface cooling – especially over Antarctica and the Southern Hemisphere. Stratospheric cooling slows the polar night jet, disrupts the polar vortex, and increases Arctic cloud cover, causing local warming. Within the first month, the troposphere cools more quickly than the ocean surface, decreasing vertical stability and enhancing cloud cover over oceans, while tropical land regions show the opposite change. On monthly timescales, high clouds shift downward due to reduced convective heating."

Allen,The biogeophysical effects of carbon fertilization of the terrestrial biosphere,"Climate models are analyzed to quantify the biogeophysical and biogeochemical effects of carbon fertilization at the time of atmospheric carbon dioxide quadrupling under both a preindustrial and a warmer background climate.  The biogeophysical effects lead to relatively weak warming largely due to reduced canopy transpiration.  Biogeochemical cooling associated with enhanced land carbon storage dominates.  Similar results are obtained under both background climates but with some nuances. 
 The climate impacts of carbon fertilization of the terrestrial biosphere include cooling associated with the biogeochemical effects of enhanced land carbon storage, whereas the non-carbon-cycle biogeophysical effects associated with changes in surface energy and turbulent heat fluxes may warm or cool the climate system. Both of these effects may be dependent on the background climate. Here, I analyze state-of-the-art CMIP6 Earth system models that conducted simulations driven by 1 % yr−1 increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration that isolate the carbon fertilization effect (i.e., CO2 radiative effects are not active) relative to a preindustrial background climate. At the time of CO2 quadrupling, the biogeophysical effects yield multimodel global mean near-surface warming of 0.16±0.09 K, with 13 of the 15 models yielding warming. Using a Surface Energy Balance decomposition, most of this warming is associated with decreases in surface latent heat flux associated with reduced canopy transpiration. Decreases in surface albedo and increases in downwelling shortwave and longwave radiation – both of which are modulated by cloud reductions – are also associated with the warming. Overall, however, the biogeophysical warming is about an order of magnitude smaller than the corresponding cooling associated with enhanced land carbon storage at −1.38 K (−1.92 to −0.84 K). Simulations that isolate the carbon fertilization effect relative to a warmer, higher CO2 background climate yield similar overall results. However, some nuances exist including stronger biogeophysical warming of the extratropics and weaker but nonsignificant biogeophysical warming of the tropics."

A total of 36 close approaches between December 2022 and February 2023 were identified and analysed. The comparison reveals that the two instruments have good structural agreement and that MATS detects a signal that is ~20 % stronger than what is measured by OSIRIS. 
 The MATS (Mesospheric Airglow/Aerosol Tomography and Spectroscopy) satellite was launched in November 2022 and began collecting scientific measurements of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) in early 2023. The satellite utilises a multichannel limb-viewing instrument designed to gather images across six distinct spectral bands, each selected to capture atmospheric airglow from O2 atmospheric band emissions and light scattered by noctilucent clouds (NLC). This article presents a comparison between the MATS limb measurements and the observations made by the OSIRIS spectrograph on the Odin satellite. Specifically, airglow signals from excited O2, as recorded by MATS infrared (IR) channels and OSIRIS, are analysed over the polar regions under temporally and spatially aligned conditions. From December 2022 to February 2023, 36 close encounters of the two satellites were identified and analysed. The results show that the two instruments agree well on the overall structure but that the MATS signals generally exceed OSIRIS by ∼ 20 % in magnitude. OSIRIS measurements are also compared to the radiative transfer model SASKTRAN to investigate stray light  impact on the measurements."

France,An evaluation of airborne mass balance and tracer correlation approaches to estimate site-level CH4 emissions from LNG facilities using CO2 as a tracer of opportunity,"To ensure robust use of measurement-based approaches to estimate methane emissions from individual sites, it is important to validate the accuracy of the methods used in the field. By using co-emitted carbon dioxide, we evaluate the performance of one such quantification method at liquefied natural gas terminals.

 Accurate and representative quantification of methane (CH4) emissions from individual oil and gas facilities is crucial to improve our knowledge of CH4 sources, improve the reliability of emissions reporting and help facilitate mitigation opportunities. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminals primarily emit carbon dioxide (CO2) but are also potentially large CH4 sources in the gas supply chain. Here, in work supported by the United Nations Environment Program International Methane Emissions Observatory (UNEP's IMEO), we evaluate two airborne measurement approaches to quantify CH4 emissions from four LNG facilities. The first approach applies a downwind mass balance method to quantify emissions of both CH4 and CO2. Since operator-reported CO2 emissions are relatively well-established, we evaluate the method's performance by comparing to operator-reported CO2 values. Using this approach, we show that an individual facility CO2 mass balance quantification has a mean relative difference to operator reporting of ±20 %, with no significant mean bias across all estimates. The second approach uses measured CH4 : CO2 mole fraction ratios as an alternative method for estimating site-level CH4 emissions. Using this tracer correlation approach, we show that uncertainties in the ratio of CH4 : CO2 from a single day can be below ±10 % at the 95 % confidence level. Due to uncertainty in the CO2 emission rate, the resulting mean 2σ uncertainty on CH4 emissions is ±30 %. CH4 : CO2 ratios are found to vary with height, with larger variation at lower altitudes (<250 m). Representative sampling across both horizontal and vertical space is needed to enhance the accuracy of the tracer correlation approach for individual emission estimates. We find that when repeated over multiple days and different atmospheric conditions, ratio measurements below 250 m provide a median estimate that is within 5 % of the mass balance and multi-height ratio methods. Whilst the CO2 : CH4 emission ratios derived from measurements could be applied to estimate CH4 emissions over longer timeframes, the degree of representativeness will depend on the variability of the ratio over time. Our results indicate that the mass balance and the CO2-based tracer correlation approaches provide estimates of CH4 emissions from LNG facilities that are consistent with each other."

By using existing hydrodynamic data, the model significantly reduces computation time from 6 h to just 30 min. We tested its accuracy in the northern Gulf of Mexico and found it closely matches physical–biogeochemical coupled simulations. This model allows researchers to conduct more tests and simulations without the need for extensive computational resources. 
 Ocean biogeochemical models are essential for advancing our understanding of oceanographic processes. Here, we present the Offline Fennel model, a biogeochemical model that relies on previously computed physical fields, within the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). We evaluated the model performance against a fully coupled physical–biogeochemical online application in the northern Gulf of Mexico, a region with intense biogeochemical activity, including rather frequent hypoxia events. By leveraging physical hydrodynamic outputs, we ran the Offline Fennel model using various time-step multiples from the coupled configuration, significantly enhancing computational efficiency and reducing simulation computational time by up to 87 %. The accuracy of the offline model was assessed using three different mixing schemes: the generic length scale (GLS), Large–McWilliams–Doney (LMD), and Mellor and Yamada 2.5 (MY25). The offline model achieved an average skill score of 93 %, with minimal impact on performance from the time-step choice. While the GLS configuration yielded the highest accuracy, all three mixing schemes performed well. Although some discrepancies appeared between offline and coupled simulation outputs, these were smaller than those observed when using different mixing schemes within the same model configuration. A significant challenge identified was the simulation of ammonium (NH4), which exhibited the largest discrepancies due to its rapid-turnover timescale compared to other tracers. The promising results achieved so far validate the Offline Fennel model's capability and efficiency, thus offering a powerful tool for researchers aiming to conduct extensive biogeochemical simulations without rerunning the hydrodynamic component, thus significantly reducing computational demands."

Here, we systematically investigated SNPs within the ligand-binding domains (LBDs) of 48 nuclear receptors (NRs), focusing on their influence on receptor–ligand interactions. Through the integration of genomic databases, we identified 27 missense SNPs with global minor allele frequencies (MAFs) of >0.001 and mapped their distribution across NR LBDs. Structure-based molecular docking revealed significant differences in the ligand-binding affinities between wild-type and variant receptors, with differential docking index (DDI) scores ranging from 0.7 to 30.5. Functional validation demonstrated altered transcriptional activity for estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα, Leu388Phe) and retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα, Met254Ile) in response to diverse environmental chemicals. Notably, the ERRα variant exhibited divergent responses to different classes of modulators, whereas the RXRα variant showed attenuated activation to multiple agonists, particularly organotin compounds at environmentally relevant concentrations. Population-level analysis further showed geographic variations in allele frequencies, suggesting potential variability in environmental susceptibility among populations. Collectively, these findings emphasize the critical role of SNPs in shaping individual and population-level responses to environmental exposures, highlighting the need to incorporate SNP data into toxicological risk assessment frameworks."

Here, we shed light on the directed biomineralization of Hg2+ into mercury selenide (HgSe), which is a promising environmental sink for Hg with minimal ecological risk. This process displays a controlled subcellular localization, improved efficiency, and redistribution of Hg species through the coordination of three modules, including reinforced respiratory, reconfigured electron flow, and anchored trap in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, a model DMRB. By supplementing redox substance, we first construct a golden Hg2+ capture system, that is S. oneidensis-Se0 hybrid. Redox substance triggers a transition from intracellular selenite reduction to extracellular biosynthesis of Se0 nanoparticles (NPs), resulting in a notably increased yield of Se0 NPs. Importantly, this hybrid alters the biotransformation fate of Hg2+, enabling the efficient formation of less toxic HgSe nanoparticles and decreasing the percentage of volatile Hg0. Such a biological decontamination process relies on sufficient bioelectron donation, unimpeded electron channels, and highly effective Hg2+ traps, all of which can be initiated, directed, and coordinated by the redox-active compound. The resulting S. oneidensis-Se0 hybrid is feasible to scale up for the depuration of Hg2+ in artificial wastewater by using a membrane bioreactor (MBR).

This study first revealed the methodological bias of the conventional sampling method using a phytoplankton net (20 μm) in previous phytotoxin assessments, which underestimated particulate DA (pDA) by approximately 90% due to cell loss while artificially elevating dissolved DA (dDA) due to cell rupture. Subsequently, we conducted a year-long monthly survey using in situ seawater in the Chinese tropical Daya Bay. The results revealed widespread DA contamination, with detection rates of 82% and 93% for pDA and dDA, respectively. Higher levels were concentrated between April and June, with peaks of 5059 ng L–1 for pDA and 13220 ng L–1 for dDA in May, orders of magnitude higher than previously reported. DA was detected in 76.3% of shellfish samples, with scallops showing the highest tissue burdens (144–26075 μg kg–1), primarily concentrated in the digestive glands (p < 0.01). The majority (92.9%) of elevated pDA levels (exceeding 200 ng L–1) occurred at temperatures between 24.9 and 30.8 °C, implying a warm-temperature adaptation in toxigenic Pseudonitzschia. Dissolved silicate (DSi) showed a significant negative correlation with environmental DA, indicating that silicate limitation under nitrogen-replete conditions may enhance DA synthesis. A recent decadal monitoring data set revealed a warming trend and a declining DSi/DIN ratio during spring, reinforcing the emergence of conditions favorable to DA production. These findings revealed underestimated DA levels and environmental drivers in tropical seawaters, suggesting that warming and nutrient imbalance may exacerbate DA-related risks."

We investigated dissolved organic matter (DOM) in PM2.5 using high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and cellular DNA damage assays to elucidate molecular composition and sources of carcinogenic components. Our analysis revealed hundreds of genotoxic compounds, with condensed aromatic amines predominating in number, abundance, and contribution to overall genotoxicity. Notably, norharman, a heterocyclic aromatic amine, was identified as a key carcinogenic component. Genotoxicity analysis using a lung cell exposure model indicated that, based on the measured concentration ratio of norharman to benzo[a]pyrene in DOM, the genotoxicity of norharman was approximately 0.21 to 0.6 times that of benzo[a]pyrene. Compared to proinflammatory compounds, these carcinogenic compounds exhibited greater unsaturation, increased aromaticity, an augmented reduced state, and the presence of nitrogenous organic matter. Two-ring aromatic amines containing two nitrogen atoms were identified as key contributors to both inflammation and genotoxicity. Regional source apportionment revealed significant regional variability in condensed aromatic amines within PM2.5.

Results showed that median concentrations of ∑PPDs (114 μg/g) and ∑PPD-Qs (354 μg/g) in indoor workshops far exceeded the levels in industrial park road dust (∑PPDs: 1.84 μg/g; ∑PPD-Qs: 0.410 μg/g) and surrounding road dust (∑PPDs: 219 ng/g; ∑PPD-Qs: 217 ng/g) in tire rubber factories.

Distribution patterns differed by facility type, with concentrations halving within 0.3 km of plant boundaries.

These delays slow instrument responses and affect the accuracy of subsequent analyses. In this work, we introduce a deconvolution algorithm that corrects measurements affected by partitioning delays. We evaluate the performance of this algorithm using synthetic data and also demonstrate its utility in correcting partitioning delays in airborne nitric acid measurements. We compare the effectiveness of deconvolution to the current best practice for partitioning delays: frequent subtraction of instrument background. Frequent background measurements are outperformed by the deconvolution algorithm when sample concentrations are changing faster than the instrument response time. The deconvolution algorithm can be applied to time series that include frequent measurement of instrument backgrounds, enabling reanalysis of past data. Furthermore, the algorithm does not rely on any coincident data; it is effective without any external information about the true time series of an analyte. When applied to nitric acid measurements from a wildfire smoke plume, deconvolution increases the calculated normalized excess mixing ratio (ΔHNO3/ΔCO) by 72%. We conclude that the deconvolution algorithm is applicable to ground, airborne, and eddy covariance measurements of “sticky” compounds."

Based on multi‐source data sets in the past four decades, this study investigates the coastward trends of global TC‐induced precipitation changes. We find that the TC lifetime maximum precipitation intensities show a statistically significant landward migration, moving about 30 km per decade. Furthermore, the precipitation intensities of TCs exhibit faster growth in coastal areas, with a concurrent rapid expansion of the land coverage of TC‐induced precipitation. A consistent pattern of change is demonstrated between intensifying TC‐induced precipitation and the warming‐humidifying ambient environment, with higher significance in coastal areas.

However, a global distribution of this sensitivity with observational constraints that may be implemented in climate models remain inadequately explored. Using long‐term satellite observations spanning 2003–2017, we propose an empirical methodology to assess the sensitivity of aeolian dust events to variations in wind velocity. Subsequently, we quantitatively analyze the relationships between this sensitivity and two key influential factors: soil moisture (SM) content and the leaf area index (LAI). Our findings reveal a global mean sensitivity of 0.06 s m−1, indicating that the dust optical depth would change by 0.06 s m−1 under one wind velocity unit variation. Dust events exhibit negligible sensitivity to variations in wind velocity when the SM exceeds 0.17 m3 m−3 or the LAI exceeds 0.45 m2 m−2, which means that dust emission processes are effectively constrained under these conditions. Furthermore, employing these critical thresholds, we compute the fraction of days with constrained dust events. We show that under four shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585), areas experiencing an increase in constrained days and those experiencing a decrease account for approximately 10.6%–12.5% and 9.3%–10.3% of the global land area, respectively."

Here, the authors show that an adverse social exposome is linked to poorer clinical, cognitive, and brain changes in Latin American older adults. 
 A multidimensional social exposome (MSE)—the combined lifespan measures of education, food insecurity, financial status, access to healthcare, childhood experiences, and more—may shape dementia risk and brain health over the lifespan, particularly in underserved regions like Latin America. However, the MSE effects on brain health and dementia are unknown. We evaluated 2211 individuals (controls, Alzheimer’s disease, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration) from a non-representative sample across six Latin American countries. Adverse exposomes associate with poorer cognition in healthy aging. In dementia, more complex exposomes correlate with lower cognitive and functional performance, higher neuropsychiatric symptoms, and brain structural and connectivity alterations in frontal-temporal-limbic and cerebellar regions. Food insecurity, financial resources, subjective socioeconomic status, and access to healthcare emerge as critical predictors. Cumulative exposome measures surpass isolated factors in predicting clinical-cognitive profiles. Multiple sensitivity analyses confirm our results. Findings highlight the need for personalized approaches integrating MSE across the lifespan, emphasizing prevention and interventions targeting social disparities.

 Precise control of covalent protein binding and cleavage in mammalian cells is crucial for manipulating cellular processes but remains challenging due to dark background, poor stability, low efficiency, or requirement of unnatural amino acids in current optogenetic tools. We introduce a photoswitchable intein (PS Intein) engineered by allosterically modulating a small autocatalytic gp41-1 intein with tandem Vivid photoreceptor. PS Intein exhibits superior functionality and low background in cells compared to existing tools. PS Intein-based systems enable light-induced covalent binding, cleavage, and release of proteins for regulating gene expression and cell fate. The high responsiveness and ability to integrate multiple inputs allow for intersectional cell targeting using cancer- and tumor microenvironment-specific promoters. PS Intein tolerates various fusions and insertions, facilitating its application in diverse cellular contexts. This versatile technology offers efficient light-controlled protein manipulation, providing a powerful tool for adding functionalities to proteins and precisely controlling protein networks in living cells.

Here the authors show that when often-neglected land–atmosphere feedbacks are considered, evapotranspiration increases less than currently projected by offline models. 
 Accurate projections of evapotranspiration (ET) are crucial for understanding hydrological responses to climate warming, which remain highly uncertain because of complex land–atmosphere interactions. Here we develop a theoretical framework to disentangle these interactions, achieving highly consistent ET projections between offline and coupled models. Our findings show that previous estimates of climate-driven ET increases have been exaggerated, primarily due to a substantial overestimation of atmospheric evaporative demand. Notably, the atmospheric conditions often assumed to drive ET are, in fact, responses to ET changes induced by soil moisture and vegetation dynamics. Neglecting these land–atmosphere feedbacks has led to a 25–39% overestimation of climate-driven global ET increases and a 77–121% exaggeration of the negative contribution from land surface changes. These biases have caused large discrepancies in hydrological projections and attributions between offline and coupled models, underscoring the importance of accurately representing land–atmosphere interactions to improve the reliability and consistency of future hydrological projections.

 The VIIRS was designed in recognition of the need for long-term observations in support of global-change science and to provide MODIS observation continuity. The NASA MODIS burned area (BA) product (MCD64A1) has been generated systematically for nearly 25 years and maps globally the approximate day of burning at 500-m resolution. We describe the follow-on NASA Collection 2 VIIRS BA product (VNP64A1) that became available in October 2024 and provides global BA mapping from 2012 into the next decade. The product is derived using an adaptation of the Collection 6.1 MCD64A1 BA mapping algorithm and using the same sinusoidal grid and 500-m reporting resolution. Annual and monthly intercomparisons of the VPN64A1 and MCD64A1 products at global and continental/regional scales indicate high product BA reporting consistency. Approximately 2.6 % of the land surface was mapped as burned annually; VNP64A1 mapped slightly more than MCD64A1 but with 0-day median burn-date reporting differences. A global (Stage-3) product validation, using 561 interpreted Landsat image pairs, was undertaken and the VNP64A1 product had estimated 36.7 % commission and 72.4 % omission errors, compared to MCD64A1 34.2 % commission and 71.5 % omission errors. Product accuracies were also characterized using metrics derived from the weighted regression (to incorporate sample inclusion probabilities) between 5-km BA proportions in the products and the Landsat data. The omission and commission errors observed at 30-m were largely compensated at 5-km, with coefficient of determination (0.70), slope (0.83), and intercept (−0.0006) terms for the VNP64A1 product nearly identical to those of MCD64A1. With respect to global temporal reporting accuracy, 38 % of VNP64A1 burned grid cells had burn dates that matched the date of a MODIS active fire, versus 46 % for MCD64A1, and 71 % of VNP64A1 burned grid cells had burn dates within two days (72 % for MCD64A1). The research presented in this paper indicates that the VNP64A1 product is suitable for providing continuity of the MODIS BA record."

 Models to simulate solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) are widely used to interpret fluorescence observations across scales. However, leaf fluorescence spectra models often mix-use the plate model and Kubelka-Munk (KM) model, which differ in their assumptions in the internal scattering within a leaf and brings in uncertainty in explaining SIF observations. Additionally, fluorescence photons are not conserved in spectral models due to their use of a sigmoid function to adjust the fluorescence emission spectrum dependent on excitation wavelength. To resolve these problems in SIF simulation, we present a new spectral model, Platespect. It is based on the plate model that can compute backward and forward leaf fluorescence spectra and also rescales the raw fluorescence emission spectrum to conserve fluorescence photons. We theoretically compared the fluorescence simulations from Platespect and Fluspect, which adopts the commonly used KM model, at the leaf and canopy scales; we also evaluated them with leaf-level backward fluorescence observations. At the leaf level, although Platespect predicted fluorescence magnitudes similar to those of Fluspect, it showed substantial differences in the backward and forward fluorescence spectra. Accounting for scattering among leaf plates in Fluspect helps reduce the difference. Platespect predicted a higher far-red fluorescence due to the rescaled fluorescence spectra emitted by longer wavelength light. When fitted against leaf-level observations, Platespect performed slightly better in the red fluorescence region, but all models showed a systematically biased fluorescence spectrum. Assessed at the canopy level, Platespect-based simulations predicted a higher SIF and higher sensitivity to leaf chlorophyll content. Our results highlight the necessity of better representing the scattering among plates, improving the raw fluorescence emission spectrum, and conserving emitted fluorescence photons to improve the simulation of SIF across scales."

 The growing availability of medium-resolution optical and radar satellite observations has prompted the development of synergistic change detection methodologies. Timely forest change detection, particularly early deforestation, is crucial for preventing illegal activities. This study proposes and evaluates an innovative model that integrates ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 L-band data with optical data from Landsat and Sentinel-2 to detect early deforestation, defined as the initial transition from stable to logged forest. Our model employs a 2-tier approach, combining harmonic curve fitting and z-scores to calculate differences between the time series. Bayesian updating statistics are then used to derive change probabilities. We comprehensively assessed the spatial and temporal detection accuracy of early deforestation maps generated by each sensor type, both individually and in combination. The integrated L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical method demonstrated the best performance, achieving a user’s accuracy of 99.19 ± 0.0081% (± 95 confidence interval) and a mean detection time lag of just 16 days. For comparison, L-band SAR data alone yielded a user’s accuracy of 93.70% (± 0.0333) with a mean time lag of 67 days, primarily due to ALOS-2’s lower repeat frequency. Optical-derived detections achieved a user’s accuracy of 98.39% (± 0.0113) and a mean time lag of 20 days. These findings confirm that combining radar and optical datasets significantly improves both detection accuracy and timeliness. Furthermore, detections were consistently captured shortly after logging activities, well before subsequent forest disturbances, underscoring true early deforestation. The high detection accuracies validate that both individual and combined L-band SAR and optical data can reliably detect early deforestation in this tropical region. We anticipate that the longer detection time lags observed with ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 will substantially improve with upcoming L-band SAR missions, such as NISAR and ALOS-4 PALSAR-3, which promise significantly enhanced global temporal sampling."

 In recent years, the frequency and intensity of compound high-temperature drought events have significantly increased on a global scale, posing severe challenges to agricultural production and ecological environments. To elucidate the spatiotemporal variation patterns of such extreme events and enhance prediction accuracy, this study systematically analyzed the distribution patterns and evolutionary trends of terrestrial high-temperature drought events based on the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Temperature Index (STI), utilizing global multi-source observational data from 1980 to 2022. The results indicate that regions such as Brazil, West Africa, the Arabian Desert, South Asia, and Mexico exhibit particularly prominent high-temperature trends, while precipitation significantly decreases in parts of South America, South Asia, Libya, western United States, eastern Canada, and southwestern China. Additionally, the recurrence intervals of high-temperature droughts in Venezuela, Brazil, northern Russia, Iran, and southwestern China have markedly shortened. To further improve prediction accuracy, this study employed wavelet transforms in combination with three deep learning methods—Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM)—to develop multi-scale predictive models for SPI and STI. The results demonstrate that all three models achieved coefficients of determination (R2) exceeding 0.98 for SPI and STI predictions, with mean absolute errors (MAE) below 0.036 and 0.07, root mean squared errors (RMSE) below 0.09 and 0.05, respectively, indicating high reliability in extreme event prediction.

 Accurate registration of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is critical for effective fusion in remote sensing applications. To address the significant radiometric and geometric differences between these modalities, SMAF-Net, a novel network that integrates semantics-guided modality transfer and hierarchical feature fusion for optical-SAR image registration, is proposed. For modality transfer, a feature-constrained generative adversarial module (SGMT) is used to translate SAR to pseudo-optical images. By incorporating deep features from a multiscale feature learning module (MFLM) as semantic constraints, the translated images preserve structural details and reduce modality discrepancies. For feature matching, a channel attention-based hierarchical aggregation module (CA-HAM) is designed to effectively fuse multi-level features. Combined with a joint detection-description strategy, the network enables accurate keypoint detection and descriptor extraction. Experiments on optical-SAR datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average registration error of 2.26 pixels, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and enabling accurate registration between optical and SAR images."

 This study utilized the Thunderstorm Feature Dataset (TFD), combined with the sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the NINO3.4 region (ENSO index) from the NOAA/ERSSTv5 dataset and ERA5 reanalysis data, to investigate the response of thunderstorm activity in East Asia and the Western Pacific region to ENSO events, an aspect that has been seldom addressed in previous studies. Results indicate ENSO events as the primary factors influencing the interannual variation of thunderstorm activity in the study area, with thunderstorm activity anomalies negatively correlated with the ENSO index, lagging by approximately 3 months. Regionally, thunderstorm activity anomalies and the ENSO index show a strong positive correlation in areas north of 20°N, encompassing Southeastern China land and adjacent sea area, but a negative correlation in areas south of 20°N, including the South China Sea, the Philippine Islands, and parts of the Western Pacific. Thunderstorm activity anomalies in these areas all lag the ENSO index by 1–3 months. The response of thunderstorm activity to ENSO events demonstrates a strong correlation with anomalies in convective parameters such as convective available potential energy (CAPE), K index, the mid-level (700–400 hPa) averaged relative humidity, and 500 hPa vertical velocity. During El Niño, warm SST in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, along with enhanced upward motion, leads to anomalous downward motion and anticyclonic circulation in the Western Pacific region within the study area, resulting in a decrease in thunderstorm activity. Concurrently, the anomalous anticyclonic circulation in the Western Pacific region enhances the warm, moist southwest winds, which transport more water vapor to Southeastern China, thereby increasing thunderstorm activity. Conversely, during La Niña, the anomalous cyclonic circulation and moisture convergence in the Western Pacific region result in an increase in thunderstorm activity in the Western Pacific region within the study area. Additionally, the anomalous cyclonic circulation leads to a weakening of the warm and moist southwest winds and upward motion in the Southeastern China land area, consequently reducing thunderstorm activity."

By examining the dynamics of gene flow across a continuum of divergence in both kingdoms, we observed the opposite relationship: Plants experience less introgression than animals at the same level of genetic divergence, suggesting that species barriers are established more rapidly in plants.

Economo,Genomic signatures indicate biodiversity loss in an endemic island ant fauna,"Insect populations have declined worldwide, but the extent and drivers of these declines are debated. Most studies rely on field surveys performed in the past century, leaving gaps in our understanding of longer-term trends. Using a “community genomics” approach, we estimated community assembly over millions of years and more recent demographic trends of ant species in the Fijian archipelago. We found that 79% of endemic species are in decline, starting after the arrival of humans approximately 3000 years ago and accelerating in the past 300 years, whereas recent arrivals are expanding. The primary correlate of population decline among endemic species was found to be sensitivity to habitat disturbance. This study demonstrates the value of contemporary collections for estimating long-term community trends and highlights the vulnerability of endemic island species to anthropogenic change."

Although their ordering lacks complete theoretical understanding, abstract models of spin glasses inform problems in other fields, such as combinatorial optimization and artificial intelligence—where they form a mathematical basis for neural network computing. We demonstrate the ability to realize a spin glass of a distinct driven-dissipative and vector form. By microscopically visualizing its glassy spin states, the technique allows us to directly measure replica symmetry breaking and the resulting ultrametric hierarchical structure. Ultrametricity is known to be emergent in models of evolution, protein folding, and climate change; this work shows it to be directly observable in a physically realized system."

However, depending on the regulated promoter identity, TF function can vary, and the principles underlying this context dependence remain unclear. We demonstrate an inverse scaling relationship between the promoter’s basal activity and its regulation by a given TF. Specifically, activation is weaker and repression is stronger on stronger promoters. This scaling applies to both activators and repressors, which suggests a common underlying mechanism where TFs regulate expression by stabilizing RNAP binding at the promoter. The consequence of this relationship is that TFs buffer expression by affecting constant regulated expression levels across promoters of different basal activity, ensuring homeostatic control despite genetic or environmental changes."

However, conformally wrapping these film devices onto three-dimensional surfaces often leads to stress-induced damage. We propose a “drop-printing” strategy that enables damage-free film transfer using a droplet. The droplet acts as a lubricating layer between the film and the target surface, facilitating local sliding during shape-adaptive deformation. This mechanism prevents in-plane film stretching and reduces stress concentration. Even nonstretchable and fragile films can be intactly and accurately wrapped onto delicate surfaces, such as microscale microorganisms and optical fibers. Two-micrometer-thick silicon films, without any stretchable engineering, can form conformal neural-electronic interfaces by being drop-printed on nerves and brain tissue.

Interconversion rates were observed on the microsecond time scale.

Leucine Zipper-like Transcription Regulator 1 (LZTR1), a substrate adapter of the Cullin-3 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase, binds specific RAS GTPases and promotes their ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. We present structures of LZTR1 Kelch domains bound to RIT1, MRAS, and KRAS, revealing interfaces that govern RAS isoform selectivity and nucleotide specificity. Biochemical and structural analyses of disease-associated Kelch domain mutations revealed three types of alterations: impaired substrate interaction, loop destabilization, and blade-blade repulsion.

Electrophysiological recordings in postsubiculum, the cortical head direction (HD) system hub, confirmed a preference for visual objects in both HD cells and fast-spiking interneurons.

However, we found that heat produced by wildfires, a commonly neglected effect, can reduce fine particle concentrations (PM2.5) in the eastern United States (EUS) by an amount comparable to the increases in the WUS during the fire season. This phenomenon arises from fire heat–induced convection in the WUS and subsequent downstream meteorological changes distant from fires. Enhanced wet deposition and weakened eastward transport of fire aerosols lower PM2.5levels in the EUS. Therefore, neglecting the effect of fire heat on PM2.5pollution leads to an overestimate of 1200 additional premature deaths and 3.3 billion USD in economic losses, particularly in the densely populated EUS."

We analyzed global forest fragmentation from 2000 to 2020 using complementary metrics that captured patch connectivity, aggregation, and structure. Connectivity-based metrics revealed that 51 to 67% of forests globally—and 58 to 80% of tropical forests—became more fragmented, which is nearly twice the rate suggested by traditional structure-focused methods (30 to 35%).

Although the role of oxytocin signaling in parental care has been widely investigated, little is known about its function in social behavior during early life. We studied the role of oxytocin in mouse pup social behavior during acute separation from the mother as well as upon reunion. The activity of oxytocin neurons was increased by acute maternal separation. Behaviorally, maternally separated pups emitted more ultrasonic vocalizations upon reunion, which were further modulated by nipple attachment behavior. These effects were attenuated by blocking the oxytocin receptor during maternal separation. Optogenetic silencing of oxytocin neurons during maternal separation disrupted vocal behavior during separation and reunion. Our findings reveal an important role of oxytocin in context-dependent vocal communication in mouse pups."
