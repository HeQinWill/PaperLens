While issuers must provide post-issuance impact reports to inform investors about the allocation of proceeds, these reports lack standardization and often contain unverifiable claims, limiting independent assessment. We examined a dataset of 1600 corporate green bonds (CGBs) and found that only a small fraction provided project-level data. For these 32 bonds and their 192 projects, representing issuers with the highest level of disclosure, we applied a LCA-based methodology to verify the reliability of the environmental impact claims of the issuers. In about 73% of cases, reported avoided climate change (CC) impacts exceed LCA-based estimates, highlighting the lack of methodological consistency in post-issuance reporting. Applying a cost-effectiveness perspective, we estimate that one million euro invested in a CGB from our sample can avoid the annual CC impact of 44–48 European citizens, but effectiveness varies significantly across projects. Expanding the analysis beyond CC to other environmental impact categories reveals significant uncertainties and potential violations of the do no significant harm (DNSH) principle of the EU Taxonomy. This study demonstrates how LCA can enhance transparency by benchmarking green bond impact claims, comparing climate cost-effectiveness across investments, and ensuring compliance with DNSH through standardized metrics. However, the lack of mandatory project-level data disclosure, which is not requested by the existing green bond standards significantly limits the potential of such analyses. Strengthening project-level reporting, integrating LCA methodologies, and enforcing third-party verification would improve transparency, comparability, and credibility in CGB markets."

However, there is growing evidence of their ineffectiveness and the social-ecological concerns they raise, including emergent systemic risks. This paper presents a social-ecological systems approach, offering a model that acts as a boundary object to integrate knowledge, foster stakeholder collaboration to tackle community vulnerability, and facilitate policy experimentation—key elements for advancing adaptive management. Employing systems thinking and system dynamics-based modelling can bridge the divide between science and policy, especially in areas characterized by data limitations and uncertainties like the BRB. This study adopts a nested approach encompassing three scales: macro (basin-level hydro-geomorphology), meso (flood control policies and infrastructure at administrative levels), and micro (village-level socio-economic conditions). The constructed boundary object promotes cross-scale learning and policy experimentation. Model scenarios of policy alternatives demonstrate that an integrated strategy—leveraging land covered with coarse sediment, innovating land use, and redesigning floodplains—significantly enhances effective land use and minimizes embankment failures. The findings emphasize the reinforcing dynamics between embankment degradation and community protests, highlight the limitations of compensation mechanisms, and reveal the erosion of adaptive capacity under the current control-based policy regime. A crucial insight from this study is that flood management strategies must evolve continually, reflecting scientific advancements, assessing policy impacts, and addressing local adaptation needs. Furthermore, a greater focus on riparian land use within development strategies is essential. The model scenarios advocate transitioning from traditional flood control to a landscape design harmonizing cropping practices and floodplain development with river morphology dynamics. While rooted in the Indian BRB context, the modelling framework provides a basis for adaptive water governance in other sediment-rich, politically sensitive, and hydrologically dynamic transboundary basins."

The current landscape of biodiversity assessments typically requires time-intensive and costly field surveys that rarely match the pace of monitoring needs. Automated biodiversity monitoring could increase the speed and accuracy at which information on species and ecosystems is gathered, and thus improve the data used in conservation decision making. However, the extent of existing monitoring with these ‘digital assets’ is not well characterized, limiting how and where current data can be used and our understanding of where key gaps remain. Here, we catalog existing digital assets for monitoring living organisms globally, finding that they predominantly come from satellite data (68%) and monitor plants at coarse taxonomic resolutions. Additionally, the spatial coverage is biased towards regions in North America and Europe, and data availability frequently lags well behind its collection. We also developed a framework to describe key steps in creating digital assets that can be used to identify bottlenecks in their production, and suggest strategies to address barriers. In particular, investing in developing data processing algorithms, building and automating workflows, and increasing accessibility of existing data could help rapidly increase the availability of digital assets for biodiversity monitoring. Accelerating and expanding development of automated biodiversity assessments should pay broad dividends for managing and conserving biodiversity globally."

Existing studies often rely on correlation analysis and occasionally use causal inference, but they tend to overlook the intraseasonal scales of monsoon variability and their impact on vegetation water content. Traditional methods struggle to reveal these dependencies due to the tight coupling between SM and VPD, making it difficult to isolate their individual effects. This study fills this gap by analyzing the interactions between SM, vegetation water content, and VPD at the two dominant intraseasonal modes of the Southwest Monsoon, i.e. the 10–20 d and 30–60 d timescales, using multi-satellite observations from 1998 to 2018. We found a counterintuitive phase relationship in central India’s core monsoon zone, where vegetation optical depth (VOD), a measure of vegetation water content, is out of phase with SM but in phase with VPD. Our analysis indicates that VPD enhances vegetation’s water uptake, increasing VOD when SM is not limiting, extending even into monsoon breaks. The delayed impact of prior rainfall contributes to the soil-water availability during the break and subsequently, to the out-of-phase relationship between SM and VOD. While both intraseasonal variability modes are evident in SM, VPD, and VOD, the out-of-phase relationship between SM and VOD and the in-phase relationship between VPD and VOD are more pronounced at the 30–60 d scale. Given that intraseasonal variability is a key characteristic of the monsoon, shaping its seasonal totals and impacts, the findings from this study offer crucial insights into vegetation responses to climate variability in the Indian subcontinent. These results can be expected to have implications for atmosphere-land interactions and climate predictions."

The frequency and intensity of unprecedented rainfall events have increased in recent years, underscoring the urgent need to revise design storms and depth-duration frequency (DDF) curves to better adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change. This study used a serial type of stochastic rainfall generator (SRG) that is capable of simulating daily rainfall series by embedding unprecedented events to study extreme precipitation scenarios under the changing climate. By perturbing values of power law tuning parameters in the SRG model, we developed thirty-six precipitation scenarios, some of which directly correlate with the current climate change scenario, while others represent very extreme conditions. High-performance computing is employed to run the computationally intensive SRG for simulating thirty-six scenarios across the entire Indian region. These simulated scenarios were analyzed to prepare rainfall return level maps and DDF curves. The findings reveal substantial increases in rainfall return levels across all frequencies when unprecedented events are considered, with pronounced impacts in coastal, northeastern, and Himalayan regions. The spatial pattern of simulated extreme precipitation was consistent across all generated scenarios from SRG irrespective of the return periods. Minimal spatial uncertainty in return level estimates across climate zones is observed which confirms the robustness of the SRG model and spatial clusters of extreme rainfall are identified irrespective of SRG being a point model. The analysis in this study based on SRG simulated climate change scenarios offers crucial insights for revising design storms and for devising climate resilience and flood management strategies."

In this study, a systematic investigation involving a life cycle approach, structure analysis, sensitivity analysis and the individual fixed regression was conducted on the structure, changing trends and driving factors of carbon footprint in Chinese sugarcane industry from 2012 to 2021. Results showed that the national average value of carbon footprint per unit area was 7.8317 t CO2e ha−1, whereas the average carbon footprint of yield and output were 0.1029 t CO2e t−1 and 0.2311 kg CO2e yuan−1, respectively. Notably, significant differences were observed in the carbon footprint of each main production region. Due to regional natural resource conditions, variations in industrial structure and differences in cultivation technology, Guangdong had the highest average carbon footprint per unit area (8.8213 t CO2e ha−1), while Hainan exhibited the lowest carbon footprint per unit area (7.0263 t CO2e ha−1), which was 79.65% of that in Guangdong. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that when the major carbon source varies ±40%, the indirect sensitivity coefficient was 0.9775. Interestingly, Yunnan displayed the highest direct sensitivity (0.9802), while the weakest direct sensitivity (0.6098) was observed in Guangxi. At both natural and social levels, the main drivers of carbon footprint in sugarcane were fertilizer, agricultural film, sugarcane machinery and the disposable income of rural residents. From all the above, optimizing cultivation practices and machinery use, reducing fertilizer and agricultural film inputs while maintaining high yield and high sugar production and low-carbon utilization of straw represent the three directions for low-carbon sugarcane production in the future."

Advocates endorse the combined goals of universal, affordable access to electricity, and the use of clean, renewable sources of energy. In the Global South and particularly Africa, international organizations are promoting these rapid green energy transitions with financing and encouraging private sector investment and innovation. What remains unclear is how rapid green energy transitions are experienced by citizens, especially the poor in the Global South. Are the transitions just or equitably shared across populations? Kenya is an important country for assessing this question. Kenya is expected to achieve SDG 7, ‘sustainable energy access for all’, by 2030, one of the few African countries to reach this milestone. Kenya’s achievements, however, mask significant tensions surrounding its rapid energy transition. This paper reveals a mismatch between national and global narratives about access to electricity compared to local-level citizen experiences. The paper argues that the current transition aims for but is not achieving distributional justice. While there are many valuable lessons to take from Kenya’s experience, there are also significant concerns as the poor are carrying a heavy burden of the transition. Our analysis is based on focus groups, qualitative interviews, and survey data. The paper concludes by reflecting on the lessons from this critical case about the relationship between the global promotion of just energy transitions and African citizen needs."

Managing temperate forests to achieve these benefits sustainably is challenging given the legacy of past human impacts, the complexity of forest development, and increasing but unpredictable disturbances. These intricacies prompted debate about the most effective management of temperate forests to achieve climate mitigation while sustaining forest productivity, regeneration, and diversity. Most research focused on management impacts under relatively stable environmental conditions, whereas forests are facing increasingly frequent and more severe climatic and biotic disturbances. Here, we used a regionally calibrated forest growth model to simulate the effects of forest management on carbon, biodiversity, and wood production under prevalent natural disturbances in the northeastern US. We developed scenarios combining forest management and disturbance regimes based on assumptions of species-specific tree regeneration and mortality rates. We compared passive management with no cutting that prioritizes maintaining existing forest trees with two common regional harvest practices: exploitative timber harvest that prioritizes short-term wood production and regenerative timber harvest that prioritizes regenerating biodiverse native forest tree seedlings. In the absence of natural disturbance, no cutting provides 41% higher forest carbon storage and 50% higher tree structural diversity after 100 years than exploitative or regenerative practices. The presence of drought, windstorm, pest, and disease disturbances altered these outcomes. Regenerative forest management provides 25% higher forest carbon storage and 26% higher tree structural diversity after 100 years than no cutting. Our results demonstrate that wood products and their carbon storage and fossil emission avoidance are important for determining the total climate benefits of forest management under natural disturbances. Our findings highlight that natural disturbance regimes should be considered when selecting management to promote multiple forest benefits, suggesting the need for tailored as opposed to one-size-fits-all policies to sustainably manage temperate forests worldwide."

Currently, the FDRS is based upon the Canadian system, which is driven by only weather parameters. However, fires in Indonesia are primarily caused by human activities with most of them occurring on peatlands. Thus, it is necessary to integrate these factors in the development of the next generation FDRS to increase the precision and accuracy in assessing levels of fire danger in various Indonesian regions. This study presents a proof of concept for a new FDRS, applied in forest and peatland in Ogan Komering Ilir (OKI) District, South Sumatra Province, based on three parameters: weather, anthropogenic factors and presence or absence of peat. The anthropogenic and peatland FDRS (AP-FDRS) map was produced using a spatial logistic regression method for incorporating anthropogenic and peat models, using the fire weather index (FWI) model from forest and land fire early warning system together with an overlay method to produce a composite map of forest and peatland fire. In this study, 2 d in 2020 were selected as sample dates: one with hotspot occurrences (23 August 2020) and one without hotspots (28 December 2020). On 23 August 2020, the AP-FDRS map was dominated by high (54%) and extreme (46%) fire hazard levels after combining high FWI values with extreme AP risks in the OKI District. In contrast, on 28 December 2020, although the FWI indicated low fire risk, the integration with AP factors resulted in an AP-FDRS map dominated by medium (34%) and high (60%) fire hazard levels. These results highlight that weather factors alone are not sufficient to predict fire hazard risks in Indonesia. Therefore, the AP-FDRS provides more detailed and accurate predictions compared to current FWI based systems."

The Mekong River basin is one of the world’s most significant agricultural regions, sustaining millions through rice production and export. However, rapid hydrological changes from hydropower development, altered flow regimes, and climate variability threaten the flood pulses essential for rice cultivation. Using a multivariate autoregressive state space analysis, we examined how hydrological variability influences rice production across four lower Mekong basin countries: Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Our study integrated high-resolution hydrologic and agricultural data spanning decades to assess the effects of flood magnitude, duration, and saline intrusion on rice yields. We found significant spatial tradeoffs, particularly in areas affected by flooding and salinity. In Viet Nam, large flood pulses mitigate saline intrusion and expand arable land but reduce cultivation efficiency likely due to fertilizer runoff. In Cambodia, where saline intrusion is minimal, excessive flooding lead to field inundation and reduced arable land, decreasing yields. Our findings reveal the complex interactions between hydrology, land use, and agricultural productivity, emphasizing the need for coordinated transboundary water management. By identifying key tradeoffs, this research informs decision-makers on optimizing agricultural strategies to ensure food system resilience amid changing hydrological and climatic conditions."

To address this, we explored three different models for predicting air temperature in dynamic outdoor settings using wrist-mounted wearable sensors. Data was collected for 22 d between 2020 and 2024 in Sydney, Australia. Each experiment involved 6–15 participants walking through different built environments. When air temperature and relative humidity measured by wrist-mounted sensors were compared to reference sensors, we found that wrist-mounted wearables cannot directly measure air temperature due to the influence of skin temperature. However, we can use their data to train a prediction model for air temperature. We explored three prediction methods: a steady-state heat transfer model of human skin, multi-linear regression, and random forest machine learning (ML). Results showed that the heat transfer model relied heavily on climatic parameters which could not be measured by wrist-mounted sensors, limiting the applicability of this method. The linear regression model (developed solely based on wrist-mounted data) neglected the non-linear correlation between wrist air temperature and wrist skin temperature. The ML approach, however, was capable of capturing non-linear, multi-dimensional relationships and demonstrated the best predictive performance. ML tested on out-of-sample data achieved a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.97 (in contrast with 0.60 and 0.88 for heat transfer and linear regression) between predicted and observed air temperature, with mean absolute error of <1 °C (in contrast with 4.43 and 1.81 °C). This performance is equivalent to the accuracy of many common air temperature sensors. This prediction model can be an effective method for providing high-resolution air temperature data in cities with temperate climates, such as Sydney, while informing future work in other climate backgrounds."

We unravel the evolution of real-time mixing states and the aging timescale of size-resolved particles based on field measurements in urban Beijing. This study provides an observational basis for accurately parameterizing the aging timescale of aerosol particles in climate models. 
 The mixing states and aging timescale of aerosol particles play a vital role in evaluating their climate effects. Here, by using field measurements at a site in urban Beijing, we have identified four different real-time mixing patterns of size-resolved particles, which are defined as less hygroscopic (LH) internally mixed, externally mixed, transitional externally mixed and more hygroscopic (MH) internally mixed particles, with atmospheric fractions of 0 %–10 %, 20 %–46 %, 17 %–24 % and 27 %–56 %, respectively. The fraction depends on particle size, with the maximum fraction of MH internally mixed particles at 80 and 110 nm and the minimum fraction of LH internally mixed particles across all sizes, implying rapid mixing and aging of ambient particles during the observational period. The diurnal variations of the mixing states of particles in all sizes investigated (40, 80, 110, 150 and 200 nm) present an apparent aging process from externally mixed to MH internally mixed, which typically spans a duration of approximately 5–10 h from 08:00–10:00 to 15:00–17:00 local time (LT), revealing the mixing (aging) timescale of aerosols in a polluted urban atmosphere. Additionally, our results suggest that those fine aerosol particles experience aging through both the photochemical process and non-photochemical growth during the campaign. Furthermore, through a comprehensive review of the mixing–aging timescale of particles adopted in current models and derived from observations, we show a great discrepancy between observations and models, highlighting the importance of parameterizing their aging timescale based on more field campaigns."

Surveyed cloud properties show signatures of cloud microphysical processes, such as cloud-top entrainment and secondary ice formation. 
 Postfrontal clouds, often appearing as marine cold-air outbreaks (MCAOs) along eastern seaboards, undergo overcast-to-broken cloud regime transitions. Earth system models exhibit diverse radiative biases connected to postfrontal clouds, rendering these marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds a major source of uncertainty in projected global-mean temperature. The recent NASA multi-year campaign Aerosol Cloud meTeorology Interactions oVer the western ATlantic Experiment (ACTIVATE) therefore dedicated most of its resources to sampling postfrontal MCAOs, deploying 71 flights from 2020 through 2022. We provide an overview of (1) the synoptic context within the parent extratropical cyclone, (2) the meteorological conditions with respect to the season, (3) the suitability of case data and measurements for Lagrangian analysis and modeling studies, and (4) the encountered cloud properties. A proposed subset of flights deemed most suitable for Lagrangian modeling case studies is highlighted throughout. Such flights typically cover a greater fetch range, were better aligned with the MBL wind direction, and revisited sampled air masses when key instruments were operational. Like many other flights, these flights often probed cloud formation and some cloud regime transitions. Surveying cloud properties from remote sensing and in situ probes, we find a great range in cloud-top heights and a relatively large concentration of frozen hydrometeors, which suggest strong free tropospheric entrainment and secondary ice formation, respectively. Both processes are expected to leave marked signatures in cloud evolution, such as strongly ranging cloud droplet number  concentrations.

Jenkins;William H. Brune,Spatially separate production of hydrogen oxides and nitric oxide in lightning,"Both the atmosphere's primary cleaner, the hydroxyl radical, and nitric oxide are generated in extreme amounts by lightning, and laboratory and modeling experiments demonstrate that these molecules are generated in different places in lightning flashes. Thus the hydroxyl radical is not immediately consumed by the nitric oxide and instead is available to remove other pollutants in the atmosphere. Additionally, substantial nitrous acid is also likely generated by lightning. 
 The atmosphere's most important oxidizer, the hydroxyl radical (OH), is generated in abundance by lightning, but the contribution of this electrically generated OH (LOH) to global OH oxidation needs to be better quantified. Part of the uncertainty in this contribution is due to the abundant nitric oxide (NO) also generated in lightning, which rapidly removes the LOH before it can oxidize other pollutants in the atmosphere. However, atmospheric observations and a previous laboratory study show extreme LOH coexists with extreme NO. The only way this electrically generated HOx (LHOx) can possibly survive is if LOH production is spatially separated from the NO production in lightning flashes and laboratory sparks. This hypothesis of spatially separate OH and NO production is further tested here in a series of laboratory experiments, where the OH decays were measured from spark discharges in air which had increasing amounts of NO added to it. The LOH decayed faster as more NO was added to the air, indicating that the LOH was reacting with the added NO and not the spark NO. Thus, LOH from lightning flashes is not immediately consumed by the electrically generated NO but is available to oxidize other pollutants in the atmosphere and contribute to global OH oxidation. Subsequent modeling of the laboratory data also supports the spatially separate production of LOH and NO and further suggests that substantial HONO may also be produced by sparks and lightning in the atmosphere."

It enables automatic sequential sampling of up to 168 hourly samples of PM10, PM2.5 or PM1. It has been conceived for subsequent elemental composition analysis (from Na to Pb) by particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE), but optical techniques may also be applied to measure black and brown carbon. Its use combined with other high-temporal-resolution instrumentation can provide complete chemical speciation of aerosols on an hourly basis. 
 The joint use of hourly resolution sampling and analyses with accelerated ion beams such as with the particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) technique has allowed the measurement of hourly temporal patterns of particulate matter (PM) composition at many sites in different parts of the world. The demand within the scientific community for this type of analysis has been continuously increasing in recent years, but hourly resolution samplers suitable for PIXE analysis have been discontinued and/or suffer from some technical limitations. In this framework, a new hourly sampler, STRAS (Size- and Time-Resolved Aerosol Sampler), was developed for the collection of PM10, PM2.5 or PM1. It allows automatic sequential sampling of up to 168 hourly samples (1 week), and it is mechanically robust, compact and easily transportable. To increase PIXE sensitivity, each sample is concentrated on a small surface area on a polycarbonate membrane. Comparison between the elemental concentrations retrieved by STRAS samples and samples collected using a standard sequential sampler operated in parallel shows very good agreement; indeed, if both the samplers use the same kind of membrane, the concentrations of all detected elements are in agreement within 10 %."

Edwards;Yee Ka Wong;Cheol-Heon Jeong;Jonathan M. Wang;Yushan Su;Greg J. Evans,Comparison of methods for resolving the contributions of local emissions to measured concentrations,"We tested a variety of scientific measurements and algorithms for distinguishing the amounts of air pollution that were emitted by a nearby polluter from background pollution that was already in the air. The results show that machine learning and other statistical algorithms produced accurate estimates of this background pollution. These findings help scientists and regulators to understand where pollution comes from and to improve measurements of pollution from sources like traffic. 
 To accurately study the characteristics of an air pollution emitter, it is necessary to isolate the contribution of that emitter to total measured pollution concentrations. A variety of published methods exist to complete this task, like placing measurements upwind the emitter, employing a distant background measurement station, or algorithmic methods that extract a background from the time series of measured concentrations (e.g. wavelet decomposition). In this study, we measured nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at four sites spanning Toronto, Ontario, Canada. We first characterized the spatial variability of background concentrations across the city and then tested the accuracy of seven different algorithmic methods of estimating true measured upwind-of-emitter backgrounds near Toronto's Highway 401 by using the data collected at a downwind site. These methods included time-series and regression methods, including machine learning (XGBoost). We observed background concentrations had notable spatial variability, except for PM2.5. When predicting backgrounds upwind the highway, we found a distant measurement station provided an accurate background only during some times of day and was least accurate during rush hours. When testing algorithmic predictions of upwind-of-highway backgrounds, we found that regression models surpassed the performance of time-series methods, with best predictions having R2 exceeding 0.8 for all four pollutants. Despite the better performance of regression models, time-series methods still provided reasonable estimates. We also found that emitter-specific covariates (e.g. traffic counts, on-site dispersion modelling) did not play an important role in regressions, suggesting backgrounds can be well characterized by time of day, meteorology, and distant measurement stations. Based on our results, we provide ranked recommendations for choosing background estimation methods. We suggest future air pollution research characterizing individual emitters includes careful consideration of how background concentrations are estimated."

We analyzed two centuries of direct ocean measurements and found large gaps in deep-sea and coastal data that limit climate and marine studies. We suggest better monitoring, technology, and collaboration to improve understanding of ocean changes. These efforts will help predict climate impacts and support marine conservation and sustainable resource use. 
 The Indonesian Seas and Surroundings (ISS) play an important role in global ocean circulation by connecting the Pacific and Indian Oceans via the global thermohaline circulation. This region regulates the exchange of water mass, heat, salinity, and biogeochemical elements, further influencing the global climate and carbon cycle. Consequently, extensive observations and surveys, particularly the in-situ measurements, have been conducted over the past two centuries. This study analyzed over 461,865 oceanographic casts from multiple international repositories, with 360,409 casts, or 21.97 % rejection, after rigorous quality control. The findings indicate that data collection was sparse and temporally limited before the early 19th century, with a marked increase beginning from the mid-20th century. Spatially, observations are heavily concentrated along major international shipping routes, including the Makassar Strait, Malacca Strait, and South China Seas, while vast areas, such as the Halmahera Sea, Timor Sea, Java Sea, and Sulawesi Sea, remain poorly detected. Temperature and salinity are the most collected data, whereas deep-sea observations, particularly below 800 meters, are critically lacking, with limited measurements of essential ocean variables such as dissolved oxygen, nutrients, and currents. Additionally, coastal regions exhibit substantial data deficiencies. Given the region's complex ocean-atmosphere interactions and unique topographic features, the current observational coverage remains insufficient to resolve the uncertainties in Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) variability, ocean heat transport, and monsoon forecasting. This study proposes to address the gaps by deploying autonomous monitoring technologies (Argo floats, gliders, moored buoys) in deep-sea and coastal regions, expanding regional observational networks, and enhancing executable data-sharing mechanisms. The raw datasets can be accessed freely from the website provided in the text, and processed datasets are preserved in data repositories with a corresponding assigned DOI. Final datasets and the computed cast per half-degree grid square with Python syntax are freely available from the Mendeley repository.

 The Multi-Compartment Hg (mercury) Modeling and Analysis Project (MCHgMAP) is an international multimodel research initiative intended to simulate and analyze the geospatial distributions and temporal trends of environmental Hg to inform effectiveness evaluations of two multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs): the Minamata Convention on Mercury (MC) and the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP). This MCHgMAP overview paper presents its science objectives, background, and rationale; experimental design (multimodel ensemble (MME) architecture, inputs and evaluation data, simulations, and reporting framework); and methodologies for the evaluation and analysis of simulated environmental Hg levels. The primary goals of the project are to facilitate detection and attribution of recent (observed) and future (projected) spatial patterns and temporal trends of global environmental Hg levels and identification of key knowledge gaps in Hg science and modeling to improve future effectiveness evaluation cycles of the MEAs. The current advances and challenges of Hg models, emission inventories, and observational data are examined, and an optimized multimodel experimental design is introduced to address the key policy questions of the MEAs. A common set of emissions, environmental conditions, and observation datasets is proposed (where possible) to enhance the MME comparability. A novel harmonized simulation approach between atmospheric, land, oceanic, and multimedia models is proposed to account for the short- and long-term changes in secondary Hg exchanges and to achieve mechanistic consistency of Hg levels across environmental matrices. A comprehensive set of model experiments is proposed and prioritized to ensure systematic analysis and participation of a variety of models from the scientific community."

Roberts,Resolution dependence of interlinked Southern Ocean biases in global coupled HadGEM3 models,"The Southern Ocean is a key region of the world ocean in the context of climate change studies. We show that the Met Office Hadley Centre coupled model with intermediate ocean resolution struggles to accurately simulate the Southern Ocean. Increasing the frictional drag that the seafloor exerts on ocean currents and introducing a representation of unresolved ocean eddies both appear to reduce the large-scale biases in this model. 
 The early spinup of the HadGEM3 coupled model displays large-scale biases in the Southern Ocean at an eddy-permitting ocean resolution: the subpolar gyres and Antarctic Slope Current (ASC) are too active, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) transport is too weak, and there are large-scale water mass biases on the Antarctic shelf and in the open ocean. Most of the biases persist for at least 100 years of the model spinup. This set of biases is largely absent with a non-eddying ocean model and reduced with an eddy-rich ocean model. We show that damping the gyres and the ASC in the eddy-permitting model, either by introducing a parameterization of baroclinic instability or by changing the lateral momentum boundary condition to increase bathymetric drag, acts to alleviate all the biases. This suggests that the fundamental issue in the eddy-permitting model may be to do with unresolved eddy processes and/or the representation of bathymetric drag on the flow. We investigate the structure of the biases in more detail and show that the eddy-permitting model has steep isopycnals near the Antarctic shelf slope, consistently with a strong ASC and reduced transport of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) onto the shelf. However, across the region of the ACC jets, the eddy-permitting model has shallower isopycnal slopes than the other models, consistently with a weaker ACC transport and warm near-surface biases in the open ocean."

The study collected data from six WWTPs between 2018 and 2024, and developed 10 machine learning models for each effluent indicator, with the best performance bidirectional long-term memory network (BM) as Baseline. Compared to direct training and classical federated averaging (FedAvg), AWSFA reduces the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of BM significantly. Analysis of input dimensions, data set size, and interpretability reveals that the performance improvement is not driven by the complexity of algorithm design but by data sharing via parameter sharing. By simulation of possible disturbances in water quality, the model remained robust when 50% of key features were missing.

Both satellite observations and bottom-up estimates identify significant NH3 emission hotspots in China. However, bottom-up NH3 emission inventories are highly uncertain due to the lack of localized emission factors, while large and uncertain errors in IASI satellite NH3 columns have hindered their direct application in top-down emission inversion methods. In this study, we perform a top-down optimization of monthly NH3 emissions over China using IASI-derived surface NH3 concentrations with well-evaluated error estimates, combined with the CAMx model at a 36 km resolution. Our posterior NH3 emissions for 2020 (12.3 [10.9–13.6] Tg N yr–1) are significantly higher than prior estimates from the MEIC inventory (7.6 Tg N yr–1), which primarily underestimates emissions during the warm months in hotspot areas (e.g., NCP and MLYR).

As critical habitats for many endemic species, these small and often poorly flushed surface waters are especially vulnerable to accumulating high levels of salts and other pollutants. Here, we measured salinity in 165 seasonal ponds, characterizing salt pollution patterns across space, through time, and over depth within ponds. We found that 70% of ponds within 37 m of a road contained salinity levels exceeding Canadian federal guidelines. 54% of ponds within 25 m exceeded less conservative US federal guidelines. Within ponds, the water column was stratified due to the combined density effects of salt and temperature. Bottom waters of polluted ponds were about 57% saltier than near-surface waters, though many were much saltier than this.

Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated specific binding between PFOS and proteins involved in the tryptophan metabolism pathway, leading to dynamic structural alterations in these proteins. Furthermore, supplementation with tryptophan was shown to significantly enhance mitochondrial function in oocytes, regulate the glutathione (GSH)/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratio, reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and alleviate oxidative stress, thereby mitigating the decline in oocyte quality caused by PFOS exposure.

This study evaluates the performance of the calibration‐free surface flux equilibrium theory (SFET) for ET estimation at 33 Ameriflux sites in the continental USA. SFET‐derived ET estimates are intercompared with widely used continental remote sensing products, including ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, and SSEBop. Results indicate that SFET consistently outperforms these ET products. SFET's performance is found to be better under wet conditions and clear skies, with reduced accuracy under arid and high evaporative stress conditions. Overall, SFET exhibits significant potential for providing accurate, continuous, long‐term ET estimates, paving the way for operational application in uninstrumented regions over large scales."

Past studies of mT hailstorms have been limited to individual case studies. A more comprehensive study is needed to improve understanding of hailstorms in this region, and may also provide new insights into the requirements for hailstorms worldwide. This study uses simulations of five recent hailstorms created with the Weather Research and Forecasting Model to evaluate the pre‐storm environments, and five additional simulations help differentiate these environments from those associated with storms that lacked hailfall. Compared to other regions experiencing hailstorms, the mT environments exhibit moderate CAPE, much less deep‐layer shear, and much higher low‐level specific humidity. These environmental conditions typically result in ordinary single‐cell, pulse‐type storms. The introduction of a new variable, NetCAPE (the net value of CAPE after accounting for precipitation loading and any CIN at lower levels), demonstrates potential in distinguishing hail from no‐hail events in the mT. The median NetCAPE for the five hail events is over 40% greater within various depths of the hail growth zone, and when combined with lower near‐surface relative humidity and melting level heights, differentiates most hail from no‐hail cases."

Here, we analyzed global AET trends from 2001 to 2019 and assessed the relative contributions of six key influencing factors. Our findings reveal that AET exhibits a significant positive trend across 31.6% of the global land surface, predominantly in the Amazon Plain and the Loess Plateau of China, whereas a significant negative trend is observed over 5.2% of the land area, concentrated in eastern Brazil and southern Africa. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) showed the strongest partial correlation with AET, influencing 26.6% of the global land area. Multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis indicates that precipitation exerts the greatest influence on AET in 39.9% of the world, followed by wind speed (WS) at 37.9%, while soil moisture (SM) is the dominant factor in only 0.2% of the global land area. Notably, WS drives 23.5% of the observed AET trends, whereas precipitation contributes most to trends in just 8.6% of the land area. Among the factors evaluated, NDVI emerges as the primary driver of AET changes, followed by precipitation, while surface net solar radiation (SNSR) has the weakest influence. These insights advance the understanding of global AET's spatiotemporal evolution and its driving mechanisms, offering a foundation for devising adaptive strategies to mitigate climate change impacts and enhance ecosystem resilience."

Schuler;Craig Motell,Wind Diversity Trends in the Lower Stratosphere Analyzed From Radiosondes Launched in the Western Hemisphere,"High altitude balloons (HABs) with altitude control capability can leverage varying wind patterns at different altitudes to perform station‐keeping maneuvers and other complex trajectories. At minimum, effective station‐keeping of HABs requires opposing winds at two different altitudes. Wind diversity trends in the lower stratosphere are highly dependent on geographic area, altitude range, and time of year. To investigate historical wind diversity trends, we analyzed over 1.25 million radiosonde sounding launches from the Western Hemisphere between 2012 and 2023. Radiosondes provide higher vertical resolution than standard reanalysis forecasts, which often underestimate wind diversity due to smoothing during the global assimilation process. Overall, our analysis reveals that higher opposing winds probabilities tend to follow the summer months for each hemisphere, respectively, with the exception being the tropics, which typically have strong opposing wind probabilities year round. Similarly, the summer months also tend to have a higher probability of calm (“light‐and‐variable”) winds, although in a smaller latitudinal and altitude bands than opposing winds. Transition months, typically in the spring and fall, have the highest variation in opposing wind probabilities from decadal means, while the summer and winter months have more predictable regional trends. These wind diversity trends can assist with developing trajectories and mission planning for high altitude platforms."

Johnson;Brian H. Tang;Kristen L. Corbosiero;Jonathan R. Moskaitis,Observed Downdrafts and Ventilation During the Rapid Intensity Changes of Hurricane Delta (2020),"This study examines downdrafts and downdraft ventilation, and their effects on Hurricane Delta (2020). Delta experienced rapid intensification (RI) before abruptly weakening before making landfall. Two sampling periods by reconnaissance aircraft provided observations during RI and the subsequent rapid weakening, giving an opportunity to study the downdraft evolution and compare these two periods. Across both sampling periods, the vertical wind shear increased, causing the vortex to tilt and exposing Delta's inner core to the surrounding environment. The increased shear provided a pathway for downdraft ventilation, the transport of low‐equivalent potential temperature θe $\left({\theta }_{e}\right)$ air aloft into the boundary layer via downdrafts. Aircraft Doppler radar measured intense, deep downdrafts toward the end of the RI period; however, minimal downdraft ventilation was observed. After peak intensity, during the weakening period, downdraft ventilation was more prevalent with moderate to intense downdrafts and low‐θe ${\theta }_{e}$ air concentrated on the left‐of‐tilt side of the storm. The observations show that as Delta weakened, the inner core became diluted with low‐θe ${\theta }_{e}$ air from downdraft ventilation and the convection was limited to the downtilt and left‐of‐tilt regions of the storm. These findings are consistent with previous idealized and real‐case modeling studies that have shown downdraft ventilation weakens tropical cyclones and degrades their structure. Additionally, the location of the downdraft ventilation observations relative to the vortex tilt and shear directions agree with previous modeling studies. More broadly, observations of the downdraft structure and diagnostics of downdraft ventilation may provide cues of subsequent intensity change in sheared storms."

However, the lack of robust, spatially explicit estimates of C stocks in BCEs presents a major challenge to incorporating them into national and global C accounting and climate mitigation strategies. For the first time, we develop spatially explicit estimates of both soil and living biomass C stocks in BCEs across China by integrating open‐access remote sensing, climate, and soil property data with 2,899 site measurements using a data‐driven method. Our C stock estimates reveal that mean C stocks in BCEs significantly decrease with increasing latitude. We estimate the total C storage within China's BCEs at 121.1 ± 48.4 Tg C, with soil accounting for 90% of the total C storage. Tidal marshes and flats contribute a total of 64.7 ± 8.7 Tg C, while mangroves store a much smaller amount (4.4 ± 1.4 Tg C) due to their limited spatial extent. Seagrasses store a total of 52.0 ± 38.3 Tg C, which is significantly larger than previous estimates. These findings underscore the significant potential of BCEs protection and restoration for China's climate mitigation efforts. Our spatially explicit C stock estimates for China's BCEs provide essential data for national and global C accounting and can serve as baselines for quantifying the impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities on BCEs C stocks. Additionally, this study offers a practical framework for comprehensively assessing C stocks in BCEs at the national scale."

Walker,Ground‐Truth: Can Forest Carbon Protocols Ensure High‐Quality Credits?,"Forests have substantial potential to help mitigate climate change. Private finance channeled through carbon credits is one way to fund that mitigation, but market‐based approaches to forest carbon projects have been fraught to date. Public skepticism of forest carbon markets signals a need to closely scrutinize the system for certifying carbon credits. We rigorously reviewed and scored new and existing protocols for the voluntary and North American compliance carbon markets. We included protocols for forest projects engaging in improved forest management, afforestation/reforestation, and avoided planned forest conversion. Most protocols score poorly overall, and none were assessed as robust. Only one new protocol that had yet to issue credits at the time of our evaluation was assessed as satisfactory, owing to improvements in the approach to additionality demonstration. We conclude that existing protocols do not ensure carbon credits are consistently real, high‐quality, and accurately represent 1 tonne of avoided, reduced, or removed emissions. We offer recommendations for how protocols can be strengthened using existing data and new tools to promote reliably high‐quality credits. Continuing to rely on the status quo without such investments is a serious risk to climate change mitigation, and in our estimation, these proposed improvements would increase the likelihood that forests carbon projects can deliver their promised climate mitigation benefits."

Here the authors show that the thermal properties of the skin are reactive to diet and that skin is a target for dietary fat delivery. 
 Skin is a regulatory hub for energy expenditure and metabolism, and alteration of lipid metabolism enzymes in skin impacts thermogenesis and obesogenesis in mice. Here we show that thermal properties of skin are highly reactive to diet: within three days, a high fat diet reduces heat transfer through skin. In contrast, a dietary manipulation that prevents obesity accelerates energy loss through skins. We find that skin is the largest target for dietary fat delivery, and that dietary triglyceride is assimilated by epidermis and dermal white adipose tissue, persisting for weeks after feeding. With caloric-restriction, mouse skins thin and assimilation of circulating lipids decreases. Using multi-modal lipid profiling, keratinocytes and sebocytes are implicated in lipid changes, which correlate with thermal function. We propose that skin should be routinely included in physiological studies of lipid metabolism, given the size of the skin lipid reservoir and its adaptable functionality. The mechanisms underlying the regulation of the skin thermal barrier are poorly understood.

 Microbial synthesis of chemicals using renewable feedstocks has gained interest due to its sustainability. The class of β,γ-diols has unique chemical and physical properties, making them valuable for diverse applications. Here, we report a biosynthetic platform in Escherichia coli for the synthesis of branched-chain β,γ-diols from renewable feedstocks. Firstly, we identify an acetohydroxyacid synthase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to catalyze the condensation of branched-chain aldehydes with pyruvate, forming α-hydroxyketones. Next, de novo production of branched-chain β,γ-diols (4-methylpentane-2,3-diol, 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol and 4-methylhexane-2,3-diol) is realized from branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) metabolism. After systematic optimization of the BCAA pathway, we have achieved high-specificity production of 4-methylpentane-2,3-diol from glucose, achieving 129.8 mM (15.3 g/L) 4-methylpentane-2,3-diol with 72% of the theoretical yield. In summary, our work demonstrates the synthesis of structurally diverse branched-chain β,γ-diols, highlighting its potential as a versatile carbon elongation system for other β,γ-diol productions.

 Preclinical studies of tifcemalimab (anti-BTLA antibody) in combination with toripalimab (anti-PD-1 antibody) demonstrated synergistic anti-tumor effects. We present the outcomes of tifcemalimab with or without toripalimab in lymphoma patients. This is a 2-part, phase I study (NCT04477772). In Part A (dose escalation based on 3 + 3 design), patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma received tifcemalimab monotherapy 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg for dose escalation and 3 mg/kg or 200 mg for dose expansion. For Part B (indication expansion), only classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (cHL) patients were included to receive tifcemalimab 100 or 200 mg plus toripalimab 240 mg due to poor tumor response in other subtypes. The primary endpoints were safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). 25 patients in Part A and 46 in Part B were enrolled. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed, and MTD was not reached. The RP2D for tifcemalimab was 200 mg. Adverse events were predominantly Grade 1/2.

 Statistical characterisations of traits evolving on phylogenies combine the contributions of unique and shared influences on those traits, potentially confusing the interpretation of historical events of macroevolution. The Fabric model, introduced in 2022, identifies historical events of directional shifts in traits (e.g. becoming larger/smaller, faster/slower over evolutionary time) and of changes in macroevolutionary ‘evolvability’ or the realised historical ability of a trait to explore its trait-space. Here we extend the model to accommodate situations in which the trait is correlated with one or more covarying traits. The Fabric-regression model identifies a unique component of variance in the trait that is free of influences from correlated traits, while simultaneously estimating directional and evolvability effects. We show in a dataset of 1504 Mammalian species that inferences about historical directional shifts in brain size and in its evolvability, having accounted for body size, differ qualitatively from inferences about brain size alone, including finding many new effects not visible in the whole trait. A class of fundamental macroevolutionary questions awaits testing on the variation uniquely attributable to traits, and the ability to accommodate statistically one or more covariates opens the possibility of bringing the formal methods of causal inference to phylogenetic-comparative studies.

However, groundwater irrigation rates in the Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna delta exceed monsoonal recharge rates, reduce available surface freshwater and increase the risk of saltwater intrusion. 
 Southern Asia benefits from groundwater pumping for dry-season irrigation by increasing both crop productivity and monsoon aquifer recharge rates in the region. On the basis of a data-driven integrated modelling system, we provide numerical evidence that the impacts of unsustainable groundwater-fed irrigation on surface freshwater availability go beyond what was previously understood. Our results confirm findings from previous studies showing increased groundwater recharge rates during wet seasons over 2002–2021, but these rates are insufficient for aquifers to recover, gradually depleting groundwater across the Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna delta. The main findings are that this increased recharge causes a drop in surface runoff and baseflow generation during the monsoons, resulting in lower flood risk (a beneficial outcome), but also less surface freshwater available for farming, which may trigger additional groundwater demand. The drop in coastal flood risk induced by inland groundwater-fed irrigation exceeds the increase caused by sea level rise by about five- to tenfold. Reduced runoff may also increase seawater intrusion, driven by less freshwater to push ocean water away, further increasing freshwater scarcity. This is particularly concerning, since the region has been under rising sea levels and sinking lands. Our findings over this delta have global implications, as humans and climate are increasingly pressuring coastal and deltaic ecosystems worldwide.

 Semi-/intermediate volatile organic compounds (S/IVOCs) are important precursors for secondary organic aerosols (SOA) and ozone formation. Vehicle emissions from real-world vehicle fleets are significant anthropogenic source, but their emission profiles and chemical fingerprints remain inadequately characterized. Here, we combined tunnel observation with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry to investigate vehicular S/IVOCs emissions. We identified 256 vehicle-related compounds with fleet-average emission factors (EFs) of 16.4 ± 12.1 mg·km−1·veh−1, comprising 67.2% VOCs, 24.3% IVOCs, and 8.5% SVOCs. VOCs accounted for the majority of ozone formation potential (OFP, 84.8%), whereas VOCs, IVOCs, and SVOCs contributed to SOA formation potential at different times. Importantly, our speciated-based SOA estimation enhanced SOA production estimates by 44.1–76.9% compared to traditional approach. We identified eight potential vehicle-related tracers in S/IVOC range through volcano plots and hierarchical clustering analysis, which could benefit future source apportionments.

 The impact of biogenic emissions on ozone (O3) has significant implications for air quality management. We analyze biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions resulting from urban greening in three major Chinese cities, and impacts on tropospheric ozone. Urban greening BVOCs contributed 1.9 ppb (2.5%), 1.9 ppb (3.3%), and 3.6 ppb (5.9%) to O3 formation in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, respectively. Temperature-driven enhancement in urban BVOCs produces significantly enhanced O3 on hot days. Guangzhou shows the highest summer temperatures, and the impact of the BVOC isoprene on O3 is more significant. The urban BVOC contribution to O3 is concentrated downwind of each city, due to transport processes. Estimated O3-related mortality in the cities was 900–2000 people during summertime, with 6–14% of the O3-related deaths attributable to urban BVOC emissions.

However, the cycling of sedimented carbon before being separated from the biosphere remains unclear. Here, we constructed the chronologic profiles of the sediment cores from a typical oyster farm with approximately 50 years of farming history.

 Oceanic submesoscale processes are believed to play a pivotal role in influencing phytoplankton growth and distribution, essentially influencing oceanic primary productivity and carbon cycling. However, our understanding of how phytoplankton respond to these dynamics remains fragmentary. Here, by combining surface drifter data and satellite observations, we show a rich geographic variability in the response of phytoplankton to submesoscale ageostrophic events over the global ocean. Substantial phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll enrichments are observed during submesoscale processes in mid-high latitude regions and coastal upwelling systems. However, negligible phytoplankton biomass increases with notable chlorophyll increases are observed in the tropical ocean and subtropical gyres, suggesting that phytoplankton are likely undergoing physiological adjustments. Globally, about half of the chlorophyll growth driven by strong submesoscale ageostrophic events is due to physiological adjustments rather than biomass enrichment, calling for a reevaluation of the effects of submesoscale processes on oceanic productivity and carbon cycling.

 The weathering and erosion of emerged land profoundly influences the Earth system, including the composition of the atmosphere and the type of nutrients delivered to the oceans. The emergence of land allowed for the formation of lakes and continental shelves, important habitats for the origin and evolution of life. Recent studies indicate a difference in silicon isotopes between Archean granitoids and their modern counterparts, which is explained by the incorporation of seawater-derived silica in the melting sources of the former. We show that this signature changed rapidly around 3.6 billion years ago, and that this shift is likely linked to an increase in the dissolved silicon flux from terrestrial weathering. Modeling suggests that the amount of oceanic silicon derived from terrigenous sources increased from near zero to around 32 ± 15% between 3.8 and 3.6 billion years ago. This indicates that, from this point onward, continental weathering feedbacks were established, and mass flux from land became an important source in the chemical budget of seawater, changes that likely exerted positive effects on the evolution of life.

 The Light Use Efficiency (LUE) model, epitomized by the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model, is extensively applied in the quantitative estimation and analysis of vegetation Net Primary Productivity (NPP). However, the classic CASA model is marked by significant complexity: the estimation of environmental stress, in particular, necessitates multi-source observation data and model parameters, adding to the complexity and uncertainty of the model’s operation. Additionally, the saturation effect of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a key variable in the CASA model, weakens the accuracy of CASA’s NPP predictions in densely vegetated areas. To address these limitations, this study introduces the Exponential-CASA (EXP-CASA) model. The EXP-CASA model effectively improves the CASA model with RMSE decreasing by 37.5% by using novel functions for estimating the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) and environmental stress, utilizing long-term observational data from FLUXNET and MODIS surface reflectance data. In a comparative analysis of NPP estimation accuracy, EXP-CASA (R2=0.68, RMSE=1.1gC⋅m−2⋅d−1) performs better than the NPP product from GLASS (R2=0.61, RMSE=1.2gC⋅m−2⋅d−1). Additionally, this research assesses the EXP-CASA model’s adaptability to various vegetation indices, evaluates the sensitivity and stability of its parameters over time, and compares its accuracy against other leading NPP estimation products across different seasons, latitudinal zones, ecological types, and temporal sequences. The findings reveal that the EXP-CASA model exhibits strong adaptability to diverse vegetation indices and stability of model parameters over time series. Importantly, EXP-CASA displays superior sensitivity to NPP anomalies at flux sites and more accurately simulates short-term NPP fluctuations than GLASS-NPP and captures periodic trends. By introducing a novel estimation approach that optimizes model construction, the EXP-CASA model remarkably improves the accuracy of NPP estimations, paving the way for global-scale, consistent, and continuous assessment of vegetation NPP. It presents an effective approach for evaluating the saturation effect of vegetation indices and the influence of category independence on NPP estimation."

 Invasions by Spartina species have posed serious threats to coastal ecosystems worldwide. Since the introduction of Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) in China in 1979, it has expanded across 68,000 ha of coastal wetlands by 2020. In 2022, the Chinese government issued the “Special Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Spartina alterniflora (2022–2025)”, aiming for nationwide eradication by 2025.

Frequent cloud cover hinders the application of optical satellite imagery in timely monitoring of S. alterniflora removal in coastal areas.

Our key findings include: (1) The resultant S. alterniflora removal map achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 97.95 % and an F1-score of 98.39 % for removal identification, and the removal timing estimation exhibited a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 6.77 days and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 14.68 days; (2) the multi-kernel Conv1D and Band Dropout strategy considerably improved the model performance compared to models using only Transformer encoder and conventional Dropout; (3) the STS-CTD model outperformed state-of-the-art time series analysis models, including Bi-LSTM, Bi-GRU, TCN, and InceptionTime; (4) the model demonstrated strong temporal transferability, showing promise for application in future years; (5) it effectively mitigated noise from SAR imaging and tidal inundation, though continuous inundation and incomplete removal reduced accuracy in certain areas.

 Landslide susceptibility assessment (LSA) plays a vital role in disaster prevention and mitigation. Recently, numerous data-driven LSA approaches have emerged. Nonetheless, most of them neglected the rapid oscillations within the landslide-prone environment, primarily due to significant changes in external triggers such as rainfall, which would render landslides susceptible to varying causations over time. Thus, conducting dynamic landslide susceptibility mapping (D-LSM) and revealing the underlying trends in landslide causes, become increasingly important for effective landslide hazard assessment. This study decomposed the entire D-LSM task into yearly LSA subtasks, and innovatively meta-learned intermediate representations that can be well-generalized and fine-tuned in a fast-adaptation manner. Then, to interpret the model predictions and characterize the variations in landslide causation, Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was utilized for feature permutation year by year. In addition, MT-InSAR techniques were applied to enhance and validate the D-LSM results. The study area was Lantau Island, Hong Kong, where the yearly LSA was executed from 1992 to 2019. The performance comparison results show that the proposed method outperformed the other approaches with regard to accuracy (3 %–7 %), precision (2 %–9 %), recall (3 %–5 %), and F1-score (2 %–7 %), even when adopting a fast adaptation strategy using only 5 samples and 5 gradient descent updates. This validates the applicability of meta-learning for identifying commonalities across multi-temporal LSA tasks. The overall model interpretation results indicate that slope and extreme rainfall were the primary contributors to landslide occurrences in Hong Kong. The feature permutation results over the 30 years reveal a variation in landslide causation, particularly a dramatic shift in the ranking of some contributing factors under extreme weather conditions. Remarkably, the importance of AERD (Annual Extreme Rainfall Days), a factor indicating extreme rainfall intensity, was deeply affected by global climate change and the government's Landslide Prevention and Mitigation Programme (LPMitP)."

 Identifying where maritime activities take place, and quantifying their potential impact on marine biodiversity, is important for the sustainable management of marine areas, spatial planning and marine conservation. Detection and monitoring of small vessels, such as pleasure crafts, has been challenging due to limited data availability with adequate temporal and spatial resolution. Here, we develop an analysis framework to detect and quantify small vessels, using openly available Sentinel-2 optical imagery, and the YOLO-family object detection models. We also show how existing spatial datasets can be used to improve the quality of the model output.We chose five distinct marine areas along the Finnish coast in the northern Baltic Sea and manually annotated 8,768 vessels for training and validating object detection models. The top-performing model, based on F1-score, achieved a test set F1-score of 0.863 and an mAP50 of 0.888. This model was then used to quantify pleasure crafts in the southern part of Finland from May to September 2022, using all available Sentinel-2 images with sufficient image quality. Detected recreational traffic was primarily concentrated on boating lanes and close to marinas, with weekend traffic averaging approximately twice the volume of weekday traffic.The developed approach can be used to identify areas with high boat traffic, thus supporting sustainable spatial planning, ecological impact avoidance, and serving as an indicator of recreational popularity of marine areas. Additionally, it provides a basis for assessing the potential impacts of pleasure crafts on marine biodiversity. By leveraging openly available satellite images with frequent revisits, the approach offers broad geographical coverage and high spatial accuracy, making it scalable for estimating boat traffic across large areas, even globally."

 With regard to climate change and population growth, irrigated croplands need to be accurately delineated for sustainable water resource management. Owing to the lack of extensive training samples and the limitations of coarse spatiotemporal resolution data in complex agricultural regions, China’s irrigated croplands are difficult to map with a unified spatiotemporal framework. This study presents an innovative method for mapping irrigated and rainfed croplands in mainland China with a local adaptive random forest classifier on the Google Earth Engine platform. Based on the dynamic threshold extraction of multiple peak vegetation index values and a rigorous multi-dataset integration strategy, the annual sample sets of irrigated and rainfed croplands are generated automatically. After constructing 147 multi-feature variables sensitive to irrigation activities, China’s annual irrigated croplands dataset (CAICD) is developed, with 30-m spatial resolution for the 1990–2022 period. The results show the following:(1) CAICD has higher accuracy and a more realistic spatial distribution of irrigated croplands compared with existing datasets, with an average overall accuracy of 0.80. (2) The most sensitive classification features for irrigation signals are spectral indices and original bands, with regional differences influenced by climate characteristics (precipitation and evapotranspiration) and terrain features. (3) Over the past three decades, China’s irrigated croplands have expanded overall and Xinjiang has exhibited the most significant increase and the highest growth rate of irrigated area in mainland China, with an annual expansion of 103 thousand hectares. The results exhibit significant implications for the balance between food security and water resource security, providing valuable insights and contributions for future global monitoring of irrigated croplands."

 The aboveground dry biomass (AGDB), leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll density (CHD), and plant water content (PWC) are important growth physiological parameters that can reflect the growth status of winter wheat. Monitoring the growth physiological parameters of winter wheat by constructing vegetation index is a common method that can quickly obtain the growth physiological parameters of winter wheat. In order to further improve the accuracy of using vegetation index method to monitor the growth physiological parameters of winter wheat, this study proposed a new method based on the genetic algorithm that can quickly construct multi-band vegetation index. The main results were as follows: Compared with the traditional random bands combination to construct the vegetation index, the results of using the rapid method proposed in this study to construct the vegetation index were reliable, and can greatly reduce the time required to construct the vegetation index, which only took about 17.7044 s on average. In the four arithmetic operations used, the priority should be given to Subtraction(Sub.) and Division(Div.), combined with Addition(Add.) and Multiplication(Mul.) operations to construct multi-band vegetation index can achieve good monitoring results. In this study, AGDB, LAI, CHD, and PWC reached the highest accuracy when using ’Sub.-Add.-Sub.-Sub., ’Div.-Div.-Mul.-Mul.’, ’Sub.-Add.-Sub.-Add.’, and ’Div.-Sub.-Div.-Add.’ to construct the five-band vegetation index, respectively, with validation R2 (R2v) of 0.6104, 0.6849, 0.7019, and 0.8960, and validation RMSE (RMSEv) of 0.4508, 2.1025, 1.1473, and 3.4683.

 Mercury (Hg) is a pollutant that adversely affects all regions worldwide. This study investigates how Gaseous Elemental Mercury (GEM), the predominant form of Hg, has changed over the Southern African Highveld Priority Area (SAHPA) since 2009. The SAHPA is one of the regions of interest regarding South African air quality, given its frequent and recurrent occurrence of pollutant concentrations exceeding the country's prescribed thresholds. The present study measured GEM concentrations and other South African criteria pollutants and meteorological parameters between 2016 and 2023 at Elandsfontein, an industrially/anthropogenically influenced monitoring site on the SAHPA. Following quality control procedures, major jumps and shifts were noticed in some of the data for 2016 and 2019, as well as all of the 2017 and 2018 data, these data were excluded from the analysis. The mean hourly GEM concentrations during the monitoring period at Elandsfontein ranged from 0.10 to 71.22 ng/m3 with a mean concentration of 1.74 ± 1.62 ng/m3. The observed mean GEM concentrations exhibit characteristic seasonal patterns, with the highest levels in winter (1.94 ± 2.00 ng/m3), spring (1.83 ± 1.85 ng/m3), autumn (1.79 ± 1.1.55 ng/m3), and summer (1.48 ± 1.08 ng/m3). The diurnal variation of GEM at Elandsfontein shows a distinct pattern, with concentrations peaking before sunrise and dipping in the late afternoon. High GEM concentrations (>6 ng/m3) are linked to air masses from the western interior, indicating significant local emissions. Pollution events peak between July and October 2016–2023, likely due to increased domestic fuel combustion and biomass burning during the dry season, contributing to elevated atmospheric pollutant levels. An Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) analysis showed that eastern air masses were predominantly ‘clean’ and ocean-derived, emphasising the significant influence of local and regional emissions of GEM surrounding the site. These findings highlight the complex interaction of meteorology and pollutant emissions in shaping GEM levels. Further research is needed to understand better how GEM variations are influenced by interactions with other pollutants, meteorology, halogens, and ozone, particularly in the southern hemisphere."

 Due to the complicated characteristics of secondary aerosols (SAs), their study requires research into their formation and oxidation processes under diverse atmospheric conditions and reactions. Moreover, the increasing atmospheric pollution in Korea has been attributed to factors such as long-range transport of pollutants from China and emissions from domestic sources like cities, power plants, and industrial complexes. In this study, an oxidation flow reactor (OFR) was utilized to assess the chemical characteristics of potential SAs in Korea's background atmosphere. Sampling was conducted from 2019 to 2021 on Baengnyeong Island (37.967° N, 124.630° E), located west of the Korean Peninsula and approximately 180 km from China's Shandong Peninsula. The OFR, coupled with a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) and various gas monitors (SO2, NO, NO2, NOX, CO, NH3, and O3), facilitated the analysis of the chemical composition of potential SAs. Additionally, to analyze long-range transport from Baengnyeong Island to Seoul, data on SAs and gaseous pollutants from the island were compared with those from Seoul. Results indicate that the potential SAs generated by the OFR were influenced by ozone (O3) and relative humidity (RH) levels. The concentration of these potential SAs increased with aging time and varied depending on O3 and RH levels. During spring, elevated PM1 concentrations in Seoul were noted, driven by additional SAs from photochemical reactions in inland regions. In contrast, during winter, the formation of certain SAs was predominantly due to long-range transport or the accumulation of domestic pollutants in the atmosphere."

 Northeastern British Columbia is a rural and remote region in Western Canada that is experiencing rapid growth in unconventional oil and gas development (UOGD) and increasingly severe wildfire impacts.

The random forest model was trained and validated on the ground-level air quality monitoring network from 2013 to 2022 and then used to predict and backcast daily concentrations in the study area at a 50-km resolution from 2005 to 2022. The predictions were then compared to global and provincial health guidelines and analyzed for annual trends. Our model achieved a 10-fold cross validation root mean square error (RMSE) and R2 of 3.89 μg/m3 and 0.77, and test scores of 3.02 μg/m3 and 0.78. Between 2006 and 2021, the number of days exceeding PM2.5 guidelines increased by 122 %, and the person-days exceeding the guideline increased by 166 %.

 Due to the scarcity of measured precipitation data in arid zones and the numerous factors affecting the uncertainty of precipitation data from multiple sources, understanding precipitation patterns is limited, and drought monitoring is constrained. Whereas water vapor content is closely related to precipitation, changes in water vapor can be an important indicator of drought development. Therefore, this paper takes Xinjiang as the study area, introduces precipitable water vapor, and constructs two new drought indices, the standardized and nonparametric standardized precipitable water indices (SPWI and NSPWI), using parametric and nonparametric kernel density estimation methods. Aiming at the drought characteristics of long duration and intensity in the study area, an identification method for long-duration and high-severity drought (LHD) events was proposed using the three-dimensional clustering method and the Copula function. The three-dimensional evolution characteristics and centroid migration patterns of LHD events were then analyzed.The results indicate that: (1) The newly constructed drought index can be used for drought monitoring in Xinjiang, and the performance of SPWI is better than that of NSPWI. (2) Based on the three-dimensional clustering method, which can better identify the drought events in the study region, it was found that the droughts were mostly concentrated in 1960–1987, and there was a trend from dry to wet. (3) The LHD events were identified based on the joint distribution probability of drought duration and severity greater than 75 %, and it was found that droughts originated in the southern and died out in the western part of the study region, that droughts were likely to be more frequent the deeper inland and farther away from the ocean, and that droughts lasted for longer periods and had a wider impact area; mountainous areas are more profoundly affected by the LHD events than plains and deserts areas. (4) LHD events have a wider centroid migration distance, and their drought development process is more complex, with spatial and temporal distributions. The drought index that introduces precipitable water vapor and the LHD event identification method proposed in this study can provide some guidance for the enhancement of drought prevention and mitigation capabilities in arid regions."

Thus, this study demonstrates that nucleosomes are targeted by the intra-S phase checkpoint and highlights the checkpoint’s critical role in configuring compact chromatin structures at replication fork stalling sites.

However, factors contributing to this cycle remain unclear. Here, sheep were infected with a JEV strain isolated from sheep exhibiting neurological symptoms. The results revealed that sheep are susceptible to JEV infection and develop viremia, with levels and duration comparable to those observed in pigs, a known JEV-amplifying host. Mosquitoes fed viremic sheep blood showed an infection rate of 40.6 to 57.1%. These findings indicate that sheep can serve as amplifying hosts for JEV, potentially contributing to JEV transmission and increasing the public health risk of human infections. We propose an alternative, sheep-associated rural domestic JEV transmission cycle, which may be prevalent in specific regions where sheep are bred but pigs are not.

Despite the impressive progress in developing nanowire lasers, their integration into Si photonics platforms remains challenging largely because of the use of III-V and II-VI semiconductors as gain media. Recently, group IV nanowires, particularly direct bandgap GeSn nanowires capable of emitting above 2 μm, have emerged as promising cost-effective gain media for Si-compatible nanowire lasers, but there has been no successful demonstration of lasing from this seemingly promising nanowire platform. Herein, we report the experimental observation of lasing above 2 μm from a single bottom-up grown GeSn nanowire. By harnessing strain engineering and optimized cavity designs simultaneously, the single GeSn nanowire achieves an amplified material gain that can sufficiently overcome minimized optical losses, resulting in single-mode lasing with an ultralow threshold of ~5.3 kilowatts per square centimeter.

Half of the operons inEscherichia colihave been reported to also contain internal promoters. We studied their role during genome-wide stresses targeting key transcription regulators, RNA polymerase (RNAP) and gyrase. Our results suggest that operons’ responses are influenced by stress-related changes in premature elongation terminations and internal promoters’ activity. Globally, this causes the responses of genes in the same operon to differ with the distance between them in a wave-like pattern. Meanwhile, premature terminations are affected by positive supercoiling buildup, collisions between elongating and promoter-bound RNAPs, and local regulatory elements. We report similar findings inE. coliunder other stresses and in evolutionarily distant bacteriaBacillus subtilis,Corynebacterium glutamicum, andHelicobacter pylori. Our results suggest that the strength, number, and positioning of operons’ internal promoters might have evolved to compensate for premature terminations, providing distal genes similar response strengths."

We studied the effects of bothPpp1r3boverexpression and deletion in mice and cell models and found that both changes inPpp1r3bexpression result in dysregulated metabolism and liver damage, with overexpression increasing liver glycogen stores, while deletion resulted in higher liver lipid accumulation. These patterns were confirmed in humans where variants increasingPPP1R3Bexpression had lower liver fat and decreased plasma lipids, whereas putative loss-of-function variants were associated with increased liver fat and elevated plasma lipids. These findings support that PPP1R3B is a crucial regulator of hepatic metabolism beyond glycogen synthesis and that genetic variants affectingPPP1R3Bexpression levels influence if hepatic energy is stored as glycogen or triglycerides."

However, detailed mechanistic information regarding rhenium redox transitions in anoxic systems is scarce. Here, we performed a comprehensive laboratory study of rhenium redox transitions on variably oxidized magnetite nanoparticle surfaces. Through high-end spectroscopic and microscopic tools, we propose an abiotic transition pathway in which aqueous iron(II) ions in the presence of pure or preoxidized magnetite serve as an electron source to reduce rhenium(VII) to individual rhenium(IV) atoms or small polynuclear species on nanoparticle surfaces. Notably, iron(II) ions recharged preoxidized magnetite nanoparticles exhibit a maghemite core and a magnetite shell, challenging the traditional core-shell magnetite-maghemite model.

Variations in the location of internal tide dissipation can modify the climatic state of oceanic circulation. Mesoscale eddies and internal tides are two prominent peaks in the ocean energy spectrum, which overlap in spatial scale despite contrasting temporal scales. How eddies affect the dissipation of internal tides remains unclear. Using high-resolution simulations and Argo observations, we show that strong oceanic eddies, such as Agulhas rings, can dissipate internal tides in regions where they intersect, making these eddies hotspots for internal tide dissipation. The Agulhas rings facilitate the transfer of internal tide energy from stable low wave numbers to less stable high wave numbers and subsequently trap these high wave numbers, thereby enhancing their dissipation. Observations from Argo floats reveal elevated dissipation in regions where Agulhas rings and internal tides converge, corroborating the simulations."

This multidecadal sea level variability, largely arising from fluctuations in the buoyancy-driven Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), substantially modulates the frequency of flood occurrences along the USNEC and serves as a source of multiyear predictability. Using an initialized dynamical downscaling decadal prediction system with a1/12° ocean resolution, we demonstrate that flood frequency along the USNEC can be predicted on multiyear to decadal timescales. The long-term increasing trend in flood frequency, mainly driven by increasing greenhouse gases and associated radiative forcing changes, can be predicted a decade ahead. Furthermore, detrended flood frequency along the USNEC exhibits prediction skill for up to 3 years, as verified by TG observation. This multiyear prediction skill is achieved using prediction models that are initialized from our best estimate of observed AMOC."

First-principles calculations reveal that the introduction of Sb not only triggers a topological phase transition but also changes the integral of the Berry curvature at the shifted Fermi level, which leads to the reversal of the anomalous Hall resistance polarity for Sb fractionsx> 0.67. Moreover, it also induces the opposite spin splitting of the valence bands compared to the Sb-free host, and the resulting clockwise/counterclockwise spin chirality gives rise to a tunable unidirectional second-harmonic anomalous Hall response.

We demonstrate that warming projections conditioned on the entire instrumental annual surface temperature record are of sufficiently high quality and should be considered as long-term predictions rather than merely as projections. We support this view by considering the skill of predicted 20- and 50-year lead temperature changes under the Shared Economic Pathway (SSP)1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 emission scenarios in climates of different sensitivities. Using climate model simulations, we show that adjusting raw multimodel projections of future warming with the Kriging for Climate Change (KCC) method eliminates most biases and reduces the uncertainty of warming projections irrespective of the sensitivity of the climate being considered. Simpler methods, or using only the more recent part of the temperature record, provide less effective constraints.

PAX7 binds to UHRF1 and prevents its interaction with DNMT1, thus blocking activation of its enzyme activity. The ten-eleven translocation DNA dioxygenase (TET) DNA demethylases also contribute to the replication-dependent loss of DNA methylation. Thus, PAX7 hijacks UHRF1 to block activation of DNMT1 after replication, leading to loss of DNA methylation by dilution, and the process is assisted by the action of TET demethylases."

Transient photoreduction of the cryptochrome flavin chromophore initiated signaling via a poorly understood mechanism. By serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX), we show that the photoreduction mechanism ofChlamydomonas reinhardtiicryptochrome involves three loci [carboxyl-terminal region, a transient protonation pathway, and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)–binding site] acting in unison to accomplish three effects: radical pair stabilization, protonation of FAD radical, and formation of the signaling state. Using 19 time-resolved SFX snapshots between 10 nanoseconds and 233 milliseconds, we found that light-driven FAD•–/tyrosyl-373 radical pair (RP) formation primes α22 unfolding. Electron transfer–dependent protonation of aspartate-321 by tyrosine-373 is the epicenter of unfolding by disrupting salt bridges between α22 and the photolyase homology region. Before helix unfolding, another pathway opens transiently for FAD•–protonation and RP stabilization. This link between RP formation and conformational changes provides a structural basis for signaling by animal-like cryptochromes."

Nevertheless, the cellular and molecular regulation of settlement, including in Cnidaria (corals, jellyfish, sea anemones, and hydroids), is not well understood. We generated and compared anterior (aboral) transcriptomes and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from the planula larvae of three cnidarian species: the jellyfishClytia hemisphaericaand the coralsAstroides calycularisandPocillopora acuta. Integrating these datasets and characterizing aboral cell types, we defined common cellular features of the planula aboral end and identified clade-specific specializations in cell types. Among shared features were genes implicated in taurine uptake and catabolism expressed in distinct specialized aboral cell types. In functional assays using bothClytiaandAstroidesplanulae, exogenous taurine inhibited settlement. These findings define the molecular and cellular architecture of the planula aboral pole and implicate localized taurine destruction in regulating settlement."

This systemic mechanism relies on the recognition, transport, and internalization of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Our aim was to identify cell surface proteins that bind extracellular dsRNA and mediate its internalization inDrosophilacells. We used coimmunoprecipitation coupled with proteomics analysis and found that silencing heat shock cognate protein 70-4 (Hsc70-4), a constitutively expressed heat shock protein, impairs dsRNA internalization. Unexpectedly, despite lacking a predicted transmembrane domain, Hsc70-4 localizes to the cell membrane via lipid interactions. Antibody blocking experiments revealed an extracellular domain on Hsc70-4 that is essential for dsRNA internalization. Intriguingly, this dsRNA-specific binding capacity of Hsc70-4 functions independently of its chaperone activity. These findings not only highlight Hsc70-4 as a previously uncharacterized and essential component in the dsRNA internalization process but also offer promising insights for advancing RNA interference–based technologies to combat pests and vector-borne diseases."

Gene-encoded circular single-stranded DNA (Css DNA) has been developed as a switchable vector to enrich regulatory components beyond protein/RNA-based systems in mammalian cells. However, the previous Css DNA regulator suffered from constrained regulatory sequence flexibility, disability of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) signals, and lack of endogenous orthogonal regulation. Here, we address these challenges by engineering a “bridge” design into the Css DNA regulator. These bridges function as sequence-programmable switches to control gene expression, responding to endogenous molecular signals (such as ATP, APE1, and RNase H) and enabling trans-regulation within or between Css DNAs. We exploit the orthogonality of Css DNA regulator to construct the three-input three-output genetic circuits. The upgraded Css DNA–based regulatory strategy represents a versatile and powerful platform for gene regulation and provides a promising avenue for the development of synthetic gene networks."

In this study, we solved the PSI-LHCI structure ofGaldieria sulphurariaNIES-3638 at 2.19-angstrom resolution using cryo–electron microscopy, revealing a PSI monomer core associated with seven LHCI subunits. Structural analysis uncovered the absence of phylloquinones, the common secondary electron acceptor in PSI of photosynthetic organisms, suggesting adaptation to a benzoquinone-like molecule. Phylogenetic analysis suggests thatG. sulphurariaretains traits characteristic of an ancestral red alga, including distinctive LHCI binding and interaction patterns. Variations in LHCI composition and interactions across red algae, particularly in red-lineage chlorophylla/b–binding–like protein and red algal LHCs, highlight evolutionary divergence and specialization. These findings not only deepen our understanding of red algal PSI-LHCI diversification but also enable us to predict features of an ancestral red algal PSI-LHCI supercomplex, providing a framework to explore evolutionary adaptations from an ancestral red alga."

However, directly observing and controlling these rotational phenomena across these different scales remains a challenge. Here, we introduce an acoustofluidic spinning control method that dynamically guides particles into three-dimensional, periodic spatial patterns within a droplet. Using surface acoustic waves, we induce internal streaming that generates centrifugal forces counteracted by surface tension, leading to the formation of rotating Stokes waves along the droplet’s equator. We show that fluid motion inside the droplet couples with these rotating waves, giving rise to a controllable superimposed helical particle orbit. These findings provide a platform for controlled rotational flows with potential applications in droplet-based microfluidics, biochemical processing, and tunable particle transport in lab-on-a-chip systems."

This underscored chromatin remodeling, endosomal sorting, ubiquitin pathways, as well as proviral factors identified by CRISPR assays as components of the viral-host response in these cells.
