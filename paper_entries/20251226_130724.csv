Although extracellular electron transfer (EET) drives the electrical signal output of EAB sensors, its relationship with sensitivity is poorly understood. This raises two critical questions: (1) Do toxicants affect EET performance? (2) What is the relationship between EET performance and sensitivity. Herein, we employed a double-electrode-controlled electrochemical gating method (EGM) to evaluate the effects of different toxicants on EET performance across multiple biological scales, ranging from mixed- and purified-species biofilms to isolated OmcA proteins. Results indicated that five representative toxicants (0.02% formaldehyde, 5 mg/L NO2–, 5 mg/L tobramycin, 5 mg/L Cu2+, and 5 mg/L SDS) rarely impacted EET performance directly. On this basis, we probed the link between EET performance and sensitivity using riboflavin (RF) and anthraquinone-2,7-disulfonate (AQDS). After a 30 min toxicity exposure, the inhibition ratios were ranked as follows: AQDS-EABs > Control > RF-EABs. Although RF observably reduced the resistance, the high capacitance weakened the sensitivity. It is suggested that reducing resistance alone could not result in a higher sensitivity, and capacitance effects cannot be overlooked through modeling and electrochemical analysis. This study, therefore, proposes the time constant as a suitable metric for evaluating the relationship between the EET performance and sensitivity."

Nonetheless, concerns arise as climate change and agricultural practices threaten Mollisol sustainability. Particularly, how the environmental conditions and biogeochemical processes constrain coevolution of OM and Se in Mollisols of cold regions is an unresolved issue. By combining pedogeochemical and multi-isotopic analyses with ultrahigh-resolution molecular and bioenergetic characterization of Mollisols in NE China, this research presents new evidence that unique cold region soil-forming environments are central to the coenrichment of OM and Se. While Mollisol OM originated from both C3 (e.g., meadow) and C4 (e.g., corn) plants, paleoclimate and redox shifts emerged as critical factors driving variations in the compositional and structural characteristics of OM, and substantial differences with the underlying parent material. The abundance of moderately energetic organic compounds (e.g., lipids and proteins) in Mollisols accounts for Se retention as organic-bound species. Under agricultural land use, the loss of OM and Se was accompanied by increasing proportions of microbial metabolites and fulvic acid-bound and hydrophilic Se species. By highlighting the dominant environmental drivers of changes in OM and Se chemistry in Mollisols, our research provides new knowledge that helps guide sustainable management of this valuable natural resource."

Patra;Gerhard Steiner;Brandon E. Boor,Fate of 1 to 6 nm Candle Combustion Nanoparticles in Indoor Atmospheric Environments,"Nano-organic carbon (NOC: 1–6 nm) particles are emitted during combustion processes and remain understudied down to their smallest sizes in indoor environments. We investigate the persistence of atmospheric nanoparticles in the NOC size range indoors during scented candle combustion in a residential test house. Our results indicate that atmospheric nanoparticles in the 1–6 nm size range dominate indoor particle concentrations, constituting up to ∼65% of total particles. The fate of these nanoparticles in indoor air is mainly governed by their apparent emission rates and the coagulation scavenging potential of the indoor atmosphere, parametrized through the net coagulation sink and aerosol Fuchs surface area. To better characterize this, we introduce a dimensionless parameter (S)─the ratio of the max-normalized net coagulation sink to the apparent emission rate─which effectively describes particle survival at specific sizes and offers a critical and previously lacking metric to evaluate nanoparticle persistence versus suppression in indoor environments. When this ratio exceeds 10, the concentration of 1–6 nm nanoparticles is suppressed by more than a hundred-fold. However, since this ratio typically remains <10 for most 1–6 nm nanoparticles, they persist at high concentrations, posing significant health risks due to their potential to penetrate deeply into the human respiratory tract, quantified through another novel parameter─the respiratory survival probability."

Because NH3 is a key precursor of SNA formation, accurate NH3 emission data are essential for reliable SNA simulations. This study improves NH3 emission inventories in East Asia by integrating the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) and the Cross-Track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), with extensive evaluation against ground-based and aircraft observations from the Korea-United States Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) campaign. Iterative linear inversion of NH3 emissions using WRF-Chem markedly enhances simulations of nitrate and ammonium, in agreement with both the aircraft and surface measurements. The absolute biases of nitrate and ammonium were reduced from 89.7 and 50.1% to 13.6 and 0.6%, respectively, compared to the aircraft observations over Seoul. However, uncertainties in nocturnal NH3 emissions remain potential sources of nighttime biases in nitrate and ammonium. Overall, the results indicate that nitrate aerosol in most of East Asia is sensitive to NH3 emission changes. To advance our understanding of SNA formation and support effective aerosol mitigation policies, improved characterization of the diurnal cycle of NH3 emissions through ground-based monitoring and high-resolution geostationary satellite observations is urgently needed."

This study used the zebrafish embryo assay to assess developmental toxicity and gene expression changes (fgf10a, igf1, fabp10a, pparg, and mttp) linked to growth and lipid metabolism for nine legacy and emerging photolithography-relevant PFAS. Exposure induced increased lethality and common malformations, including failure of swim bladder inflation and yolk sac edema. Transcriptional analysis revealed that certain PFAS, especially triphenylsulfonium perfluoro-1-butanesulfonate, 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, perfluorooctanoic acid, and bis(1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,4-nonafluoro-1-butanesulfonyl)imid, significantly downregulated pparg and mttp expression, even at environmentally relevant concentrations. Our findings raise concerns that certain PFAS actively used in photolithography, including some with less-studied functional groups (e.g., perfluoroalkyl dicarboxylic acids and perfluorosulfonamides), are more toxic than equivalent-chain monocarboxylic acid and legacy PFAS, respectively, providing mechanistic insight into PFAS-induced toxicity.

Aircraft sewage, aggregating microbial material from global travelers, offers a unique surveillance opportunity for AMR at international entry points. However, specific AMR elements detected in aircraft sewage and how their relative abundance and transcriptional activity may be associated with flight characteristics such as flight duration or departure country remain unclear. This study analyzed 130 sewage samples from international flights arriving in Saudi Arabia across 27 countries. Metagenomic analyses revealed distinct AMR profiles in aircraft sewage compared to local municipal sewage, including elevated relative abundances of Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus. Aircraft sewage harbored 51 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) that were not detected in local municipal sewage, predominantly carbapenem-resistant genes (e.g., blaNDM, blaVIM). Additionally, geographical origin of flights shaped AMR composition with lower ARG diversity observed from African-origin flights, whereas Asian and American flights exhibited enriched ARG profiles. Flight length affected AMR expression with long-haul flights (>3500 km) associated with elevated transcription levels. These findings demonstrated how international air travel facilitates the dissemination of AMR across regions and provided actionable insights to devise aircraft sewage surveillance strategies."

To further advance the impact assessment and remediation technology for PFAS pollution, new approaches for identifying emerging PFAS are necessary. While 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has unique advantages in analyzing PFAS in complex sample matrices, the spectra interpretation remains challenging due to the limited reference data. Herein, we address this significant knowledge gap using machine learning (ML) to predict 19F NMR chemical shifts of PFAS. We curated a data set comprising 3616 chemical shifts from 647 fluorinated compounds, explored various atomic feature descriptors for modeling, and evaluated multiple ML algorithms. The feed-forward neural network (FFNN) model performed the best, achieving a mean absolute error of 2.40 ppm on the test data set. Notably, 49% of predictions had errors <1.0 ppm and 86% < 5.0 ppm. The model predicted the chemical shifts of novel F atom configurations with up to 90% lower average errors than a database-driven method. We also developed a confidence level system (1–6) to provide error estimation for each prediction and guide future data set expansion toward low-confidence structures. The utility of the model was further validated through (i) prediction of NMR spectra of novel PFAS compounds, (ii) assistance in peak assignment, and (iii) structural clarification of an unknown PFAS in a real wastewater sample. Overall, this study demonstrates the advantages of ML and offers a practical predictive tool to support PFAS analysis."

However, the role of sea surface temperature (SST) in modulating this emission remains unclear. This study systematically investigates the impact of SST on PFAAs enrichment in SSA using laboratory experiments and global emission modeling. Results show that higher SST can significantly promote the enrichment of PFAAs in SSA (particularly in submicrometer SSA), due to increased bubble collision efficiency and surface-active behavior of PFAAs. The enrichment factors (EFs) at 25 °C were 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than those at 4 °C, with a stronger SST dependence for longer-chain PFAAs. When considering SST effects, the estimated global emission fluxes of PFOA and PFOS are approximately 3.1 and 2.7 times the previously calculated values, respectively. These findings highlight SST as a critical regulator of PFAAs sea–air transfer, emphasizing the need to integrate temperature-dependent enrichment mechanisms into global models for accurate assessment of atmospheric PFAAs transport and environmental impact."

A single low-cost sensor package (the “keystone” package) was colocated alongside regulatory-grade (reference) instruments at the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Queens College monitoring site for 16 months. For each pollutant, hourly data from the keystone package and reference instruments were used to train a single calibration model that was subsequently applied to all packages at field sites across the network. The calibration models included multiple linear regression (MLR) for CO and a hybrid approach that combined MLR with a Random Forest model for PM2.5, O3, NO2, and NO. The performance of the NCA-calibrated low-cost sensors was quantified using multiple evaluation data sets, with a focus on accuracy and long-term stability over the 16-month period.

It provides the first observational evidence of bidirectional leader behavior in positive altitude‐triggered lightning and highlights the connection process's driving effect on leader initiation/development. In positive triggered lightning, the bidirectional leader system first emerged from the wire bottom with positive polarity, rapidly connected with the tower and generated an impulsive current wave initiating an upward negative leader from the wire top. The wire ends generated different E‐field distortions, but less significant than the different initiation thresholds of positive and negative leaders. Consequently, the positive leader always initiates first for both triggering cases, regardless of background E‐field direction and formation position. Wire end's E‐field distortion alone was insufficient to initiate negative leader. Besides slow charge accumulation from the opposite end's positive leader, impulsive current surge is another effective/indispensable abrupt driver."

Many studies use elastic homogeneous half‐space models to calculate vertical displacements from a specified earthquake slip distribution, neglecting complexities of 3D structure in subduction zone settings. Here, we use 3D ground motion simulations of potential Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquakes to investigate the impact of realistic 3D Earth structure on estimated vertical displacements. We show that offshore uplift increases when including 3D structure due to high fault slip in low‐rigidity accretionary wedge sediments and coastal subsidence decreases due to higher rigidity material at depth. These larger offshore uplifts cause increased tsunami maximum wave heights, and coastal subsidence at paleoseismic sites decreases on average by ∼17 cm, or ∼60%, which can have important implications for the amplitude and extent of slip in earthquake scenarios developed based on paleoseismic data constraints."

In the tropics, maximum moist heat in models is constrained via convective stability by the weak temperature gradient approximation combined with entraining quasi‐equilibrium dynamics. We examine how observed monthly maximum moist heat varies with atmospheric instability and dryness in comparison to reanalysis. In observations, extreme moist heat increases with lower‐tropospheric saturation deficit in convecting regions as expected from theory. However, weather stations show higher moist heat than reanalysis. We hypothesize that a combination of poor representation of convection sensitivity to lower tropospheric dryness and breakdown of quasi‐equilibrium on small scales causes the extremes in weather stations to be underpredicted by entraining quasi‐equilibrium dynamics calculated from reanalysis statistics. Allowing for small, positive instability better represents extremes."

The reduction of CGT amplitude is reflected in decrease of Rossby wave source (RWS) anomalies, with upstream signal located at jet entrance over eastern Mediterranean. The weakening of RWS is resulted from decreased Mediterranean circulation anomalies. The weakened CGT further alters the pattern of associated heatwave events.

In this study, a minimization technique and a data assimilation method are first applied to reduce the impact of initial errors on the uncertainties in the ET simulation over the TP. Second, the conditional nonlinear optimal parameter perturbation ensemble prediction (CNOP‐PEP) method is employed to evaluate the simulation and forecast performances with imperfect model physical parameters based on the reduction of impact of initial errors. The main features are the combined contribution for ensemble prediction of ET over the TP through the perturbed parameter and the optimization and assimilation of the initial conditions. The numerical results show that the minimization technique and the data assimilation method are useful for reducing uncertainties in ET over the TP due to errors of initial values. Moreover, the ensemble prediction of ET over the TP with assimilated initial conditions is better than that without assimilated initial conditions using the CNOP‐PEP method.

Despite loss, methylation partly recovers via H3K9me3 after fertilization, revealing partial intergenerational epigenetic inheritance. 
 Inter/transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is a crucial and controversial theory that could reshape the concept of genetics. To investigate this theory directly, we invent a system for targeted reprogramming of epigenetic memory in mouse sperm. Using this system, we erase DNA methylation at the differentially methylated region of the H19 gene (H19-DMR) in sperm, which causes Silver-Russell syndrome-like phenotypes in F1 offspring. Although DNA methylation is fully lost in the sperm, it is partially restored during pre-implantation development, suggesting the existence of epigenetic memory that instructs de novo DNA methylation. Importantly, targeted removal of histone modifications in zygotes reveals that tri-methylation at lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me3), which is deposited shortly after fertilization, is required for the subsequent de novo DNA methylation at the H19-DMR. Thus, our study provides a robust germline editing tool, which reveals partial intergenerational inheritance and no transgenerational inheritance at the model locus. Furthermore, we identify H3K9me3 as a mediator for DNA methylation recovery also acting at imprinted loci. The authors develop a system to erase DNA methylation at H19-DMR in mouse sperm. Despite loss, methylation partly recovers via H3K9me3 after fertilization, revealing partial intergenerational epigenetic inheritance."

 E3 ubiquitin ligases are vital enzymes that define the ubiquitin code in cells. Beyond promoting protein degradation to maintain cellular health, they also mediate non-degradative processes like DNA repair, signaling, and immunity. Despite their therapeutic potential, a comprehensive framework for understanding the relationships among diverse E3 ligases is lacking. Here, we classify the “human E3 ligome”—an extensive set of catalytic human E3s—by integrating multi-layered data, including protein sequences, domain architectures, 3D structures, functions, and expression patterns. Our classification is based on a metric-learning paradigm and uses a weakly supervised hierarchical framework to capture authentic relationships across E3 families and subfamilies. It extends the categorization of E3s into RING, HECT, and RBR classes, including non-canonical mechanisms, successfully explains their functional segregation, distinguishes between multi-subunit complexes and standalone enzymes, and maps E3s to substrates and potential drug interactions. Our analysis provides a global view of E3 biology, opening strategies for drugging E3-substrate networks, including drug repurposing and designing specific E3 handles.

 The unavoidable presence of clouds and their shadows in optical satellite imagery hinders the true spectral response of the Earth’s underlying surface. Accurate cloud and cloud shadow detection is therefore a crucial preprocessing step for optical satellite images and any downstream analysis. Various methods have been developed to address this critical task and can be broadly categorized into physical rule-based methods and learning based methods. In recent years, machine learning based methods, particularly deep learning frameworks, have proven to outperform physical rule-based models. However, these approaches are mostly fully supervised and require a large amount of pixel-level annotations whose acquisition is costly and time consuming. In this work, we propose to address cloud and cloud shadow detection in optical satellite images using self-supervised representation learning, a machine learning paradigm that focuses on extracting relevant representations from unlabeled data, which can then be used as an effective starting point to fine-tune models with few labeled data in a supervised fashion. These approaches have been shown to perform competitively with fully supervised methods without the requirement of large annotation datasets. Specifically, we assessed two self-supervised representation learning methods that use different philosophies about self-supervision: Momentum Contrast (MoCo), based on contrastive learning and DeepCluster, based on clustering. Using two publicly available Sentinel-2 cloud datasets, namely WHUS2–CD+ and CloudSEN12, we show that MoCo and DeepCluster, trained with only 25 % of the annotated data, can perform better than physical rule-based methods such as FMask and Sen2Cor, weakly supervised methods and even several fully supervised methods. These results highlight the strong applicability of self-supervised representation learning methods to the task of cloud and cloud shadow detection with self-supervised pretraining leading to fine-tuned models that outperform industry standards and achieve near state-of-the-art performance with a fraction of the data."

 The retrieval of sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) from hyperspectral imagery requires accurate atmospheric compensation to correctly disentangle its small contribution to the at-sensor radiance from other confounding factors. In spectral fitting SIF retrieval approaches this compensation is estimated in a joint optimization of free variables when fitting the measured at-sensor signal. Due to the computational complexity of Radiative Transfer Models (RTMs) that satisfy the level of precision required for accurate SIF retrieval, fully joint estimations are practically unachievable with exact physical simulation. We present in this contribution an emulator-based spectral fitting method neural network (EmSFMNN) approach integrating RTM emulation and self-supervised training for computationally efficient and accurate SIF retrieval in the O2-A absorption band of HyPlant imagery. In a validation study with in-situ top-of-canopy SIF measurements we find improved performance over traditional retrieval methods. Furthermore, we show that the model predicts plausible SIF emission in topographically variable terrain without scene-specific adaptations. Since EmSFMNN can be adapted to hyperspectral imaging sensors in a straightforward fashion, it may prove to be an interesting SIF retrieval method for other sensors on airborne and spaceborne platforms."

 Drought has emerged as a critical constraint on sustainable agricultural development, particularly in water-scarce agroecosystems where multiscale hydrological stresses—such as rainfall deficits, soil moisture depletion, and groundwater exhaustion—interact to undermine crop productivity stability. However, current remote sensing frameworks lack the capacity to isolate and quantify the independent impacts of groundwater drought on crop photosynthesis and yield, leading to long-standing underestimation of deep-layer hydrological stress, especially in groundwater-dependent regions. To address this gap, we have proposed a dynamic monitoring framework based on solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) to assess the photosynthetic response characteristics of winter wheat across the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain under precipitation, surface moisture, and groundwater anomalies. This framework integrates dynamic time warping (DTW) for interannual phenological alignment and constructs a quantile-based dynamic baseline library that overcomes the limitations of traditional normality-based anomaly metrics. On this basis, we have developed a novel photosynthetic response anomaly index (PRAI) to characterize the spatiotemporal evolution of drought-induced photosynthetic stress. Results reveal that groundwater anomalies induce a significantly lagged crop response (mean lag ≈ +2.1 months, p < 0.01) and exert stronger influence on photosynthetic dynamics than soil surface moisture or rainfall. PRAI exhibits more concentrated and persistent negative anomalies during groundwater drought years, correlating more strongly with yield loss (R2 = 0.53) than during meteorological drought years (R2 = 0.30). Cross-validation using evapotranspiration (ET) and vegetation optical depth (VOD) further confirms PRAI reliability in capturing physiological stress. The proposed SIF-based dynamic monitoring framework not only deepens the understanding of crop eco-physiological response mechanisms to multiscale water stress, but also provides critical scientific support and methodological innovations for regional scale precision agriculture, crop model optimization, and sustainable water resource management."

 Ultrafine particles (UFPs, ≤100 nm) are a major component of urban air pollution, influenced by source emission rates (of UFPs and precursors) and meteorological conditions, both of which vary over time. This study evaluates the effect of dispersion normalisation on UFP source apportionment and long-term trends in the urban background of Barcelona (NE Spain) over a 12-year period (2013–2024). Hourly particle number size distributions (PNSD) were normalised using the ventilation coefficient (VC), derived from boundary layer height and wind speed, and analysed with positive matrix factorisation (PMF) for cold (October–March) and warm (April–September) seasons. Seven factors were identified, with road traffic as the dominant contributor. Dispersion corrected (DC) traffic contributions averaged 57 % of particle number concentrations (PNCs), compared with 64 % in the uncorrected (UC) analysis, indicating overestimation of local sources when dispersion is not considered. Photonucleation and Nucleation growth showed higher DC contributions (37 % compared with 31 % for UC), consistent with midday occurrence under favourable mixing conditions. Trend analysis revealed significant decreases in PNCs (−4.4 % yr−1), strongest in the Aitken mode, likely linked to reduced traffic emissions following EURO 5/6 regulations, the introduction of diesel particulate filters (DPFs), and the implementation of Barcelona's low emission zone (LEZ). Traffic-related factors declined by −4.6 % yr−1, with the largest decrease in the diesel-related source. Nucleation growth and Regional-1 also declined, while Photonucleation and Regional-2 showed no clear trend. These findings highlight the value of dispersion normalisation in source apportionment and provide strong evidence of the effectiveness of emission control-policies in reducing traffic-related UFPs."

 Tropical easterly waves (TEWs) play a key role in rainfall variability and act as precursors to tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic. However, the origin of TEW-related precipitation remains insufficiently explored. This study presents a 39-year (1985–2023) climatology of TEWs using a curvature vorticity-based tracking method applied to a downscaled ERA5 dataset, combined with a Lagrangian moisture source analysis. An average of 41 ± 5 TEWs per year is identified, with a pronounced peak during July–September. TEWs propagate westward at approximately 8 m/s, with the highest activity across the main development region of tropical cyclones. TEWs account for 1–7 % of annual rainfall across the basin, with peaks spatially coinciding with areas of highest wave activity. Moisture source diagnostics reveal three distinct TEW regimes. Near the African coast, moisture is primarily derived from the eastern tropical Atlantic and continental Africa, whereas waves in the central Atlantic and Caribbean region increasingly rely on long-distance zonal transport from the eastern and central tropical Atlantic, consistent with the wave lifecycle. The analysis also reveals the trade and easterly winds as the primary moisture transport mechanisms, while area-average moisture uptake and associated precipitation show no statistically significant positive long-term trends. Meanwhile, the mean water vapour residence time for TEW-related precipitation is about 3.6 days, slightly longer than for tropical cyclones. This study extends previous climatologies and contributes to enhancing the understanding of TEW-related hydroclimate processes in the tropical North Atlantic."

 This study assesses the contributions of extreme and non-extreme rainfall events to seasonal precipitation over Northwest India (NWI) and examines the underlying dynamical mechanisms. Our analysis reveals a notable increase (10 %) in overall seasonal rainfall of NWI during 2000–2023 period relative to 1971–2000. In addition, we also found that extreme rainfall events (EREs; R90s) have contributed more than 75 % of the total seasonal rainfall over majority of NWI, with some regions (Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat) extending the contributions beyond 90 %. Our comprehensive analysis reveals large scale atmospheric circulation as the key driver during EREs. Specifically, the Rossby wave induced trough elongation from Europe played a dominant role and is modulated by the negative configuration of the East Asian Polar and Subtropical Jet streams, which eventually facilitated downstream propagation. The resulting wave pattern featured an amplified barotropic ridge over the North Pacific, a distorted positive phase of the Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern, and a ridge (trough) over North Atlantic Ocean and Europe. This European trough slowly descended from upper to lower levels, elongated and merged with the pre-existing low over NWI. Such synoptic configuration enhanced the moisture transport from the equatorial Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea into NWI by strengthening the low-level jet and sustaining deep convection, leading to rainfall extremes. In concordance, the features of CAPE, Cloud base heights, Low level Cloud liquid water content, enhanced convergence and Moist Static Energy underscore the dominance of vigorous convective precipitation over NWI in the post 2000 period. These findings have severe implications for hydrological and ecological sectors."
