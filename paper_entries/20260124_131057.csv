Strong seasonality appears, driven by productivity and summer sea-ice loss. Emissions and burdens rise over time, with regional differences across the Arctic and aerosol species. 
 Changing Arctic climate conditions have accelerated sea ice retreat, altering ocean–atmosphere interactions and marine ecosystems. Reduced sea ice cover likely enhances emissions of primary marine organic aerosol (PMOA) through bubble bursting, with implications for aerosol–cloud interactions. This study examines the emission patterns, seasonality, and historical trends of key PMOA species (dissolved carboxylic acidic containing polysaccharides, PCHO; dissolved combined amino acids, DCAA; polar lipids, PL) within the Arctic from 1990 to 2019. Surface ocean concentrations of marine biomolecules, derived from a biogeochemistry model used in the ECHAM-HAM aerosol–climate model, exhibit pronounced seasonal cycles. PMOA emissions show strong variability, driven by marine productivity and sea-salt emissions, with maxima from May to September. Total PMOA emissions increased by about 12 %, and the burden rose by 4 % between 1990–2004 and 2005–2019. A 30 year summer trend (July–September) indicates a rapid decline in sea ice, accompanied by increasing concentrations of organic groups in inner-Arctic waters. Positive PMOA emission anomalies have become more frequent over the past 15 years, and total PMOA production has increased by 0.8 % yr−1 since 1990. Differences among biomolecular types persist, with PCHO showing the strongest increases in both emissions (1.3 % yr−1) and aerosol concentrations (0.8 % yr−1)."

We found that even highly oxidized particles can remain volatile, and a rare nitrogen-containing type emerges under cold, stagnant conditions. We interpret both as products of limited atmospheric processing and combustion-related sources. These findings help improve understanding of pollution formation and evolution. 
 Organic aerosols (OA) are key components of wintertime urban haze, but the relationship between their oxidation state and volatility – critical for understanding aerosol evolution and improving model predictions – remains poorly constrained. While oxidation–volatility decoupling has been observed in laboratory studies, field-based evidence under real-world conditions is scarce, particularly during severe haze episodes. This study presents a field-based investigation of OA sources and their volatility characteristics in Seoul during a winter haze period, using a thermodenuder coupled with a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS).Positive matrix factorization resolved six OA factors: hydrocarbon-like OA, cooking, biomass burning, nitrogen-containing OA (NOA), less-oxidized oxygenated OA (LO-OOA), and more-oxidized OOA (MO-OOA). Despite having the highest oxygen-to-carbon ratio (∼1.15), MO-OOA exhibited unexpectedly high volatility, indicating a decoupling between oxidation state and volatility. We attribute this to fragmentation-driven aging and autoxidation under stagnant conditions with limited OH exposure. In contrast, LO-OOA showed lower volatility and more typical oxidative behavior.Additionally, NOA – a rarely resolved factor in wintertime field studies – was prominent during cold, humid, and stagnant conditions and exhibited chemical and volatility features similar to biomass burning OA, suggesting a shared combustion origin and meteorological sensitivity.These findings provide one of the few field-based demonstrations of oxidation–volatility decoupling in ambient OA and highlight how source-specific properties and meteorology influence OA evolution. The results underscore the need to refine OA representation in chemical transport models, especially under haze conditions."

Using real-time instruments, we measured airborne particles and trace gases on the northern slope of the mountains. We found that burning biomass was a major source of these particles, which changed chemically as they travelled long distances. These changes were affected by photochemical and cloud processes, with important consequences for the regional climate and melting of glaciers. 
 Aerosol particles transported from South Asia, especially biomass burning (BB) emission related aerosols during pre-monsoon, have significant climate effect in the Himalayas. The details on complicated physicochemical properties and aging process of aerosols are important for understanding the climate effect. An Aerodyne high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer co-located with gas analyzers was deployed from 25 April  to 25 May 2022 to study the highly time-resolved chemical characteristics and aging process of submicron aerosols (PM1) on the northern slope of the Himalayas. The 10 min resolution mass concentration of PM1 varied from 0.1 to 12.2 µg m−3 during this study, with an average of 1.7 ± 1.6 µg m−3. Organic aerosols (OA) showed a dominant contribution (46.2 %) to PM1 followed by sulfate (20.8 %), black carbon (19.4 %), ammonium (8.5 %), nitrate (4.8 %) and chloride (0.4 %). Evolution of bulk OA in the f44 vs. f60 space showed clear aging process from less aged BB plumes to highly oxidized state in polluted period. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) on the high-resolution organic mass spectra resolved two oxygenated OA (OOA) factors, i.e., a less-oxidized OOA influenced by biomass burning (OOA-BB) and a more-oxidized OOA (MO-OOA). We performed a case study to explore the OOA formation mechanism during long-range transport. The results indicated aqueous-phase process and photochemical reaction together elevated OOA concentrations and aging processing, consistent with secondary inorganic aerosol production. This study underscores the significant occurrence of BB aerosols in Himalayas and provides insights into the oxidative processing in this remote region."

Bartington;Francis D. Pope;Yuqing Dai;Zongbo Shi,Enhancing Accuracy of Indoor Air Quality Sensors via Automated Machine Learning Calibration,"We developed a multi-stage AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) calibration framework to improve low-cost indoor PM2.5 sensor accuracy. Using chamber tests with varied emission sources, the method corrected drift, humidity effects, and non-linear responses, raising R2 above 0.9 and halving RMSE (Root Mean Square Error). The approach enables reliable, scalable indoor air quality monitoring for research and public health applications. 
 Indoor fine particles (PM2.5) exposure poses significant public health risks, prompting growing use of low-cost sensors for indoor air quality monitoring. However, maintaining data accuracy from these sensors is challenging, due to interference of environmental conditions, such as humidity, and instrument drift. Calibration is essential to ensure the accuracy of these sensors. This study introduces a novel automated machine learning (AutoML)-based calibration framework to enhance the reliability of low-cost indoor PM2.5 measurements. The multi-stage calibration framework connects low-cost field sensors to be deployed with intermediate drift-correction reference sensors and a reference-grade instrument, applying separate calibration models for low (clean air environment) and high (pollution events) concentration ranges. We evaluated the framework in a controlled indoor chamber using two different sensor models exposed to diverse indoor pollution sources under uncontrolled natural ambient conditions. The AutoML-driven calibration significantly improved sensor performance, achieving a strong correlation with reference measurements (R2 > 0.90) and substantially reducing error metrics (with normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) and symmetric mean absolute percentage error (sMAPE) roughly halved relative to uncalibrated data). Bias was effectively minimised, yielding calibrated readings closely aligned with the reference instrument. These findings demonstrate that our calibration strategy can convert low-cost sensors into a more reliable tool for indoor air pollution monitoring. The improved data quality supports atmospheric science research by enabling more accurate indoor PM2.5 monitoring, and informs public health interventions and evaluation by facilitating better indoor exposure assessment."

This study adapted the flux plane mass balance method to a rapidly deployable, operationally flexible, and user-friendly, human-portable telescoping pole-based system. Controlled release test results suggest that the pole method can be applied to moderate height sources at closer downwind distances with performance similar to other widely used mobile quantification methods. 
 Quantifying methane (CH4) emissions from anthropogenic sources is essential for compliance, inventory, and verification efforts. One established mass balance approach is the mobile flux plane method, in which emissions can be estimated from measurements of CH4 at various heights. Most traditional applications require either a drone or aircraft, both of which can be expensive, or limiting to deploy in all situations. To broaden applicability and improve practicality, we adapted the flux plane method using a long telescoping pole and backpack-mounted CH4 sensor. We explored accuracy through 44 controlled release experiments (0.2–5.6 kg CH4 h−1) from a 2.4 m stack. Measurements were taken at 6 heights (0.8–5.6 m) by walking transects 10–30 m downwind. The data yielded a mean relative error of −10.1 %, with 68 % of estimates within ±38.3 % of true values. Results are comparable to drone-based methods. We also tested an optimized Gaussian plume model using partial vertical profiles to address issues where the pole could not measure the top of the plume. This approach was slightly less precise than the flux plane method and had less bias. Overall, results show that multi-level, telescoping pole-based CH4 measurements combined with flux plane or Gaussian models can (i) quantify emissions from elevated sources in a logistically practical manner with results comparable to other widely used mobile quantification methods, and (ii) quantify sources emitting CH4 at low rates owing to the close-range capability of the method, complementing other mobile methods such as vehicle-based systems, aircraft, and satellites that generally measure higher-emitting sources."

Braun,Digital Elevation Models and Orthomosaics of 1989 aerial imagery of the Western Antarctic Peninsula and surrounding islands between 66–68° S,"We reconstruct historical topography for a rapidly warming Antarctic region with limited existing data. Using approximately 2000 aerial photographs from the year 1989 over the western Antarctic Peninsula and nearby islands, we created detailed elevation models and orthoimages that have high accuracy compared to recent satellite data. This open dataset aids tracking historical ice loss and its role in sea level rise. 
 We present a unique, timestamped, high-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and orthomosaic dataset, derived from aerial imagery that covers about 12 000 km2 area on the western Antarctic Peninsula and surrounding islands between 66–68° S. We used a film-based aerial image archive from 1989 acquired by the Institut für Angewandte Geodäsie (IfAG), which is kept in the Archive for German Polar Research at the Alfred Wegener Institute, Germany, to generate the historical DEMs and orthoimages. The reference elevation model of Antarctica (REMA) mosaic is used as a reference DEM to co-register our historical product on stable ground. We evaluated the vertical accuracy of the derived IfAG DEM with independent surface elevation data from ICESat-2 from the summer months of 2020 and 2021. Our historical DEMs have vertical accuracies better than 6 and 8 m with respect to modern elevation data, REMA, and ICESat-2, respectively. The late 20th century DEM and orthomosaic are very valuable observations in a data sparse region, and this dataset will help to quantify historical ice volume changes and inform geodetic mass balance estimates. The dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17949026 (Thota et al., 2025) and the results presented in this paper are based on version 1.2 of the dataset."

Many compounds were both emitted and deposited depending on the season and time of day. Emissions peaked in summer, while uptake was stronger in autumn. This unique long-term dataset improves our understanding of forest–atmosphere interactions and supports better air quality and climate models. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and ozone (O3) are key constituents of tropospheric chemistry, affecting both air quality and climate. Forests are major emitters of biogenic VOCs (BVOCs), yet large uncertainties remain regarding the diversity of exchanged compounds, the drivers of their bidirectional fluxes, and their in-canopy chemistry. Long-term and comprehensive in situ datasets remain scarce, limiting our understanding of these complex processes. We conducted a 3-year field campaign (2022–2024) at the Integrated Carbon Observation System mixed temperate forest station of Vielsalm (BE-Vie), combining vertical concentration profile and eddy covariance flux measurements above and below the canopy (concentration dataset: https://doi.org/10.18758/NVFBA74V, Verreyken et al., 2025c; flux dataset: https://doi.org/10.18758/KHV8ZXU2, Dumont et al., 2025a; concentration-turbulence profile dataset: https://doi.org/10.18758/BED4Q2VY, Dumont et al., 2025b). Using a PTR-ToF-MS and an open-source data-processing workflow, we identified 48 significantly exchanged VOCs. The vertical and diurnal gradients of the mixing ratios reflected the interplay between emission, deposition, chemistry, and transport. Combined with a profile of turbulence statistics, these observations offer an opportunity to investigate their behaviour within the canopy. The forest acted as a net VOC source in summer (∼ 1.25 µg m−2 s−1), while deposition dominated in autumn. Many oxygenated VOCs displayed bidirectional exchange. Monoterpenes, isoprene, and methanol were the most abundant flux contributors, but 15–30 (30–43) compounds were needed to account for 90 % of total emissions (depositions), depending on the season. Below-canopy BVOC and O3 fluxes reached ∼ 10 % of above-canopy ones, with proportionally enhanced below-canopy ozone uptake at night. This study provides one of the most detailed long-term datasets of VOC and O3 exchange in a temperate forest and serves as a key reference for improving process-based models of biogenic, physical, and chemical exchange in forest ecosystems."

It merges satellite and reanalysis products using a statistical uncertainty-based framework that minimizes reliance on gauge observations, making it particularly suitable for data-sparse regions. Evaluation using over 5,000 independent gauges shows that SUPER v2 achieves higher accuracy than existing products, supporting global drought monitoring and hydrological modeling. 
 The Statistical Uncertainty analysis-based Precipitation mERging (SUPER) methodology can optimally merge different precipitation datasets with minimal use of ground-based information and is therefore better suited for data-sparse regions. Although a proof-of-concept SUPER framework has already been introduced previously, it contains substantial uncertainties and is only available at a daily timescale, which is inadequate for land surface modeling. In response, we present here a new 3-hourly, 0.1-degree, global SUPER version 2 (v2) dataset, spanning 2000–2023. SUPER v2 is unique in three key aspects: i) it optimizes the number of input precipitation datasets, which reduces data redundancy and mitigates negative biases in extreme precipitation events; ii) it optimally evaluates its internal merging weights and filters out false-alarmed events without reliance on extensive gauge networks; and iii) it employs a multi-scale (i.e., monthly–daily–3-hourly) temporal correction/merging procedure that enhances the robustness of precipitation estimates. The SUPER v2 product is comprehensively evaluated using 5,972 independent gauges. Results show that it has a root-mean-squared-error of 3.64 mm d−1 and correlation coefficient of 0.68 [-] for daily precipitation estimates. These error metrics outperform traditional approaches over 81 % to 86 % of the validation gauges. The superiority of SUPER v2 with regards to rain/no-rain classification skill is even more evident, with Heidke’s Skill Score 22 % higher than commonly used datasets. Similar findings are also demonstrated in the 3-hourly SUPER v2 precipitation dataset. As such, SUPER v2 provides a unique opportunity for enhancing global-scale hydrology and land surface modeling — particularly for data sparse regions."

We measured body size and weight of common seafloor animals in southeast Greenland to create reliable conversion factors, allowing biomass to be estimated from non-destructive images. These data include key Vulnerable Marine Ecosystem species and provide a baseline to improve monitoring, support future research, and reduce disturbance to sensitive habitats. 
 Climate change and biodiversity loss are rapidly transforming Arctic marine ecosystems. Benthic ecosystems on Arctic shelves are important for biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Biomass in form of ash-free dry mass (AFDM) is often used as a proxy of ecosystem health but can be labour intensive and costly to obtain. This study addresses a key data gap by providing robust weight and body size to weight conversion factors for Arctic and boreal benthic fauna. We collected samples of common macro- and mega-benthic organisms in SE Greenland (59–67° N and 27–41° W) and calculated conversion factors for wet mass (WM) to dry mass (DM) (40 families) and to AFDM (39 families) and DM to AFDM (42 families) (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17714017) (Behrisch and Zwerschke, 2025). To improve sampling output from non-destructive image-based sampling we also calculated conversion factors between body size (length, diameter) and weight for a subset of families (Behrisch and Zwerschke, 2025). Our dataset includes several Vulnerable Marine Ecosystem (VME) indicator taxa for the Arctic region. The conversion factors for Atlantic-Arctic benthos presented here can serve as the foundation for a growing database, helping to unify datasets collected using different methodologies."

However, their assimilation has traditionally focused on retrieved profiles. This study implemented the direct assimilation of brightness temperatures from GMWRs with a machine learning-based bias correction scheme. The results show improvements in the low-level atmospheric structure and precipitation predictions. 
 The application of ground-based microwave radiometers (GMWRs), which provide high-quality and continuous vertical atmospheric observations, has traditionally focused on the indirect assimilation of retrieved profiles. This study advanced this application by developing a direct assimilation capability for GMWR radiance observations within the Weather Research and Forecasting Data Assimilation (WRFDA) system, along with a bias correction scheme based on the random forest technique. The proposed bias correction scheme effectively reduced the observation-minus-background (O−B) biases and standard deviations by 0.83 K (97.1 %) and 1.63 K (64.6 %), respectively. A series of 10 d experiments demonstrated that assimilating GMWR radiances improves both the initial conditions and the forecasts, with additional benefits from higher assimilation frequencies. In the initial conditions, hourly assimilation significantly enhanced low-level temperature and humidity fields, reducing the root-mean-square error (RMSE) for temperature by 6.32 % below 1 km and for water vapor mixing ratio by 1.98 % below 5 km. These improvements extended to forecasts, where 2 m temperature and humidity showed sustained benefits for over 12 h, and precipitation forecasts exhibited improvements to a certain extent. The time-averaged Fractions Skill Score (FSS) for 3 h accumulated precipitation within the 24 h forecasts increased by 0.02–0.04 (3.9 %–10.2 %) for thresholds of 3–6 mm."

However, models do a poor job of simulating the QBO in the lower stratosphere, for reasons that remain unclear. One possibility is that models do not completely represent how ozone influences the QBO-associated wind variations. Here we propose a multi-model framework for assessing how ozone influences the QBO in recent past and future climates. 
 The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) is the main mode of variability in the tropical stratosphere, influencing the predictability of other regions in the atmosphere through its teleconnections to the stratospheric polar vortices and coupling to surface tropical and extratropical variability.  However, climate and forecasting models consistently underestimate QBO amplitudes in the lower stratosphere, likely contributing to their failure to simulate these teleconnections. One underexplored contributor to model biases is missing representation of ozone-radiative feedbacks, which enhance temperature variability in the lower stratosphere, particularly at periods at and greater than the QBO (>28 months). While previous studies suggest that ozone-radiative feedbacks can impact QBO periods, amplitudes and the associated secondary circulation in the lower stratosphere, the reported impacts differ widely among models and are hard to interpret due to differences in methodology. To this end, here we propose a coordinated experimental protocol – held joint between the Atmospheric Processes and their Role in Climate (APARC) Quasi-Biennial Oscillation Initiative (QBOi) and Chemistry Climate Modeling Initiative (CCMI) activities – which is aimed at assessing the coupling between stratospheric ozone, temperature and the circulation. We use the proposed experiments to define the ozone feedback on the QBO in both present-day and idealized (abrupt quadrupling of carbon dioxide) climates. While primary focus is on the QBO, the proposed protocol also enables analysis of other aspects of ozone-radiative-dynamical coupling in the atmosphere, including impacts on the Brewer-Dobson Circulation and tropospheric eddy-driven jet responses to future climate change. Here we document the scientific rationale and design of the QUOCA Phase 1 experiments, summarize the data request, and give a brief overview of participating models. Preliminary results using the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies E2-2 climate model are used to illustrate sensitivities to certain methodological choices."

 Numerical weather prediction and climate models require continuous adaptation to take advantage of advances in high-performance computing hardware. This paper presents the port of the ICON model to GPUs using OpenACC compiler directives for numerical weather prediction applications. In the context of an end-to-end operational forecast application, we adopted a full-port strategy: the entire workflow, from physical parameterizations to data assimilation, was analyzed and ported to GPUs as needed. Performance tuning and mixed-precision optimization yield a 5.5× speed-up compared to the CPU baseline in a socket-to-socket comparison. The ported ICON model meets strict requirements for time-to-solution and meteorological quality, in order for MeteoSwiss to be the first national weather service to run ICON operationally on GPUs with its ICON-CH1-EPS and ICON-CH2-EPS ensemble forecasting systems.

Widespread urbanization has made untreated urban runoff a major pathway for environmental contamination that can pose a significant threat to aquatic ecosystems. While existing literature reviews have focused on the sources and composition of urban runoff or the toxicity of the single contaminants, a comprehensive understanding of the ecotoxicological effects of whole complex mixtures of urban runoff contaminants is lacking, particularly regarding their short- and long-term impacts across different trophic levels. This review uniquely synthesizes the effects of urban runoff mixtures, examining both organism- and molecular-level responses in aquatic species. In addition, we developed the UrbanRunoffRisk R package to automate and improve risk assessments of urban runoff mixtures. The tool integrates predicted environmental concentration (PEC) with EC50/LC50 values for key aquatic species, ensuring reliable and reproducible calculations. Our analysis reveals that most existing studies focus on organismal and physiological responses to acute exposures, with limited attention paid to molecular mechanisms or identification of the toxicants driving observed effects. By combining organismal and molecular insights with a mixture of toxicity assessment and model-based risk evaluation, this review provides a novel synthesis of urban runoff ecotoxicology. Future research should also explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of urban runoff mixtures and the development of practical and diverse risk assessment models.

Yet, current risk assessments rely mainly on linear extrapolations from laboratory toxicity tests and rarely capture multifaceted biodiversity, particularly genetic diversity, at the watershed scale. We integrated high-throughput mass spectrometry and environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding to assess cumulative chemical stressor impacts on multitrophic communities (protozoa, algae, fungi, invertebrate metazoan, and fish) across streams, rivers, and lakes of the 40,000 km2 Tai Lake Basin, eastern China. A total of 132 chemicals were detected, and cumulative ecological risk thresholds were exceeded at >70% of sites, indicating basin-wide chemical stress. Spatial heterogeneity in chemical composition and ecological risk were strongly associated with land-use intensity, particularly agricultural and urban development. eDNA metabarcoding revealed that community composition and sequence diversity mirrored chemical stressor distribution across sites. Sites with higher chemical stressors exhibited reduced sequence diversity and increased community similarity, while taxonomic diversity remained stable. Structural equation modeling showed that chemical effects on beta diversity were mediated through reduced sequence diversity, with no significant direct effects. These findings underscore the need to incorporate sequence-based biodiversity metrics into ecological risk frameworks and develop biodiversity-informed thresholds for freshwater ecosystems."

Despite its recognized value for crop nutrition, current inefficient manure application contributes ∼10% to global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Addressing this challenge, we investigated semiliquid manure slurry, which in some regions provides up to half of the N supplied to crops. Using meta-analysis and machine learning methodology, we predicted agricultural and environmental impacts of slurry use in different climate scenarios based on 1952 paired observations in global field experiments. Current suboptimal uses of slurry generate 7% (0.1 Tg N) higher nitrous oxide emissions than synthetic fertilizers. Under future warming scenarios and without optimization, these emissions are projected to increase by an additional 3–5% (∼0.2 Tg N) and total noncarbon dioxide (CO2) GHG emissions by 30% (600 Tg CO2 equivalents year–1). Current evidence identifies the combination of subsurface slurry application and nitrification inhibitors as an effective optimization strategy. This strategy may reduce non-CO2 GHG emissions by 30%, equivalent to an 8% reduction in the total agricultural GHG emissions. We estimated that this optimization, combined with a favorable slurry N-to-total N ratio, has the technological potential to increase global cereal production by up to 20% and restore organic carbon stocks in topsoil by 5% (3400 Tg carbon). Thus, optimizing slurry use should be a priority, as it contributes to climate change mitigation, food security, and soil fertility."

Here, we measured the N2 fixation rates of isolated Microcystis colonies, free-living plankton, and the whole plankton community during dense Microcystis blooms over a three year period in six diverse lakes across eastern North America including Lake Erie. For five of six lakes, rates within the colony fraction were greater than the rates measured for free-living plankton (p < 0.05). N2 fixation rates were inversely correlated with the rates of ammonium uptake by the colony fraction (p < 0.05), and in experiments, ammonium significantly reduced N2 fixation rates within the colony fraction by 50–85% (p < 0.001). In several lakes, the δ15N of isolated colonies was lower (p < 0.05) than that of free-living plankton presumably due to the preferential use of 14N2 by diazotrophic, colony-associated plankton. Cyanobacterial and noncyanobacterial nifH sequences were associated with the Microcystis colonies with the nifH-based diversity of both groups being lower in colonies compared to free-living plankton. Compared to nitrate, ammonium, and urea uptake, N2 fixation rates accounted for 1–76% of total N assimilation by the Microcystis colony fraction and averaged 18% across systems, suggesting this process could support the proliferation of Microcystis blooms."

This study developed a mechanistic toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TKTD) modeling framework to derive acute-to-chronic ratios (ACRs) for the benthic clam Ruditapes philippinarum exposed to sediment-associated Cu. To facilitate model development in the sediment context, we derived physiological parameters (ke, CIT, kk) using aqueous toxicity tests and used diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) measurements to represent Cu bioavailability in sediments. The sediment TKTD model accurately predicted Cu accumulation in clam tissues and adequately predicted toxicity, with a 10% deviation from observed effects. Using model-predicted 7-day LC50 and no-effect concentration, an ACR of 17 was determined for Cu-induced clam mortality. The framework was then applied to derive ACRs for other contaminants using literature-derived aqueous TKTD parameters, including cadmium (ACRCd: 11–87) and nanoplastic particles (ACRNPs: 1.9–69). The new approach was also effective for elucidating how environmental variables (e.g., salinity, nanoplastic size) influence ACR values, thus offering insight which may be difficult to achieve by traditional empirical approaches. The study demonstrates the utility of TKTD modeling as a transparent and reproducible mechanistic method for acute-to-chronic extrapolation of toxicity as used for risk assessment applications."

Herein, NCPs from different lake waters were extracted, with source- and concentration-dependent heterogeneities in formation potential, microheterogeneous distribution, and mechanism for •OH being explored. NCPs were composed of inorganic colloidal particles (ICPs) and organic colloidal particles (OCPs), and NCPs-mediated •OH was divided into free •OH and bound •OH. Results showed that, regardless of NCP sources and concentrations, apparent quantum yields of free •OH were 1.22–5.24 times lower than those of bound •OH, indicating high production potential and microheterogeneous distribution. It was indicated that ICPs primarily contributed to the production of bound •OH, while OCPs were the main components responsible for free •OH generation. Furthermore, water oxidation by valence band holes in ICPs acted as the primary pathway for bound •OH formation, while oxygen-mediated chain reactions driven by excited triplet states and superoxide anions contributed to free •OH formation. The microheterogeneous distribution of •OH exhibited distinct attenuation rates toward aquatic contaminants. This study highlights NCPs as important photochemical •OH sources that significantly influence the behaviors and fate of nutrients and contaminants in aquatic ecosystems."

However, it is not well characterized how the mixture of dissolved organic contaminants in rivers evolves longitudinally from source to mouth or how it is related to river catchment characteristics. We collected dry-weather water samples along two large, anthropogenically impacted German rivers, the Neckar and Spree, and used target and nontarget analyses to assess the concentration patterns of individual organic contaminants as well as the peak area patterns of nontarget anthropogenic features and the remaining nontarget “other” features. 81% of the target contaminants, 66% of the anthropogenic features, and 56% of the “other” features were detected in at least 50% of sites in both river catchments, indicating a high degree of chemical similarity despite catchment spatial separation. Contaminant concentrations and feature peak areas increased within and downstream of urbanized regions. Pharmaceuticals correlated most strongly with the annual volume of treated wastewater effluent in a catchment, whereas polymer-related chemicals correlated most strongly with urban land covers linked to industry and transportation. Feature-based molecular networks of sartans, hexa(methoxymethyl)melamine derivatives, and polyethylene glycols revealed a multitude of contaminants in the rivers that would be overlooked if relying on target or nontarget annotation methods alone.

Using diagnostic fragment ions at m/z 98.9837, 78.9587, and 98.9648, etc., we identified 41 O(F)PEs (tri/di/mono-OPEs, cyclic OPEs, OFPEs), including 14 first-reported compounds (confidence level ≥ 3). These compounds were ubiquitously detected across 16 spent ternary LIPB packs, indicating their pervasive occurrence. The predominant compounds–trimethyl phosphate, dimethyl hydrogen phosphate, and fluoro(methoxy)phosphinic acid–were found at concentrations up to 105 ng/g. Aging experiments demonstrated that unused LIPB cells already contained O(F)PEs, with their formation accelerated by electrochemical cycling and thermal aging, indicating the continuous accumulation of O(F)PEs during battery operation. Further environmental risk assessment reveals that O(F)PEs exhibit high mobility, indicating their potential for environmental diffusion.

Here, we demonstrate that redox-driven structural transformations unlock a dual pathway for U(VI) reduction. Comparative experiments using pristine mackinawite (FeS), partially oxidized FeS (O-FeS), and sulfur-enriched FeS (S-FeS) revealed that FeS and O-FeS reduce U(VI) primarily through oxidation of structural S(-II), whereas sulfidation-induced structural alterations in S-FeS activate otherwise inert Fe(II) as a coreductant, as evidenced by Fe(III) formation. This dual electron-transfer pathway shows pH dependence. At pH 6.5, U(VI) reduction to U(V)/U(IV) is nearly complete in S-FeS, while the reduction extent decreases to 34% at pH 8.5, due to the formation of a passivated surface layer rich in Fe(III) and sulfur that inhibits further electron transfer. These findings demonstrate that oxidation- and sulfidation-driven variations in FeS stoichiometry and structure regulate uranium reduction and immobilization pathways, with important implications for predicting the fate of redox-sensitive metal contaminants in dynamic subsurface environments."

Among these, perfluorinated and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) have been reported to exert male reproductive toxicity, yet comparative risks across individual PFAS remain unclear. In this study, we employed an innovative systematic review strategy, the Targeted Risk Assessment of Environmental Chemicals (TRAEC) strategy, integrating all available evidence from 25 epidemiological studies, 75 in vivo, and 43 in vitro experiments, alongside independent experiments, to assess the effects of multiple PFAS on semen quality and sex hormone levels. The integrated evidence indicated that PFAS exposure posed a moderate risk level to male reproductive health with a comprehensive risk score of 6.47. Among individual PFAS, exposure to perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS, risk score: 7.43) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA, risk score: 6.38) presented the highest risk of sperm abnormalities, followed by perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDoA, risk score: 6.29), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, risk score: 5.83), and perfluorohexyl sulfonic acid (risk score: 4.87), all of which are at moderate risk levels. And the risk of these PFAS compounds causing reproductive hormone abnormalities was at a low to moderate level, with the risk scores ranging from 3.79 (PFOA) to 6.74 (PFDoA). Additionally, PFAS exposure showed a relatively high risk of adversely affecting sperm progressive motility (risk score range: 5.23–5.62), particularly for PFOS (risk score: 5.57) and PFNA (risk score: 5.62). Risk for other sperm parameters was relatively lower (risk score range: 4.01–5.49). Notably, independent in vivo experiments confirmed that PFNA exposure significantly impaired sperm routine parameters and sperm dynamics across multiple mouse strains (including C57BL/6J, CC002, CC037, and CC057 strains). Our study identified PFOS and PFNA as particularly detrimental to male reproductive health across multiple dimensions, underscoring the urgent need for measures to reduce PFAS exposure and mitigate risks to male fertility."

The anthropogenic rise in atmospheric CO2 reduces calcification rates and enhances calcium carbonate dissolution, which increases ocean alkalinity, counteracts acidification, and stimulates ocean CO2 uptake. However, carbonate dissolution takes place primarily in the deep ocean, so this feedback is slow, maintaining ocean CO2 uptake over millennial timescales. Here, we present evidence that seawater alkalinity on the continental shelf is increasing on annual‐decadal timescales, at a rate that is orders of magnitude faster than the deep ocean feedback. Biogeochemical model analyses suggest this fast feedback results from calcium carbonate dissolution in the shelf seafloor driven by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Extrapolating these results to the global continental shelf suggests that shelf carbonate dissolution has been accelerating since the 1800s and may account for up to 10% of the missing ∼0.3 Pg C yr−1 in ocean model carbon budgets."

The perturbation experiments suggest that the undercurrent decadal variability is controlled by variable coastal sea‐ice freshwater fluxes, these driven by winds mechanically opening and closing coastal polynyas.

The reconstructed ozone patterns matched surface observations well. Ozone production analysis revealed nearly equal contributions from formaldehyde and NO2, with spatial variability reflecting changing chemical sensitivity regimes. The sensitivity of O3 to precursor reduction test suggested that VOC‐focused controls are more effective than NOx under current conditions.

However, it is not clear how seasonal to sub‐seasonal variations in surface melt forcings affect the dynamics of melt recharge into a firn aquifer and the accompanying refreezing processes. Here, we use a hydrological model to probe how different styles of seasonal melting influence the recharge of a firn aquifer and the structural changes of the unsaturated firn column above. We find that a simple subsurface energy balance can provide a good estimation for melt partitioning, however our results suggest that the early dynamics of the melt season dictates the timing of recharge. Further, we show that an increased magnitude of melt in a single season leads to deeper refreezing, and that seasons with intermittent melt events can create ice lenses at depth."

Sulfate is an important aerosol over the Southern Ocean, and models suggest dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is the largest source of sulfate during summer. However, sulfur isotopes of sulfate (δ34S(SO42−)) in Antarctic ice cores suggest a significant contribution from a previously unexplained non‐DMS source. Here we show that the fractional contribution from passive volcanic degassing (fvolc) explains observed δ34S(SO42−), and that a global chemical transport model underestimates fvolc across Antarctica. Underestimated fvolc implies that the model mischaracterizes sulfate sources in this important region. The discrepancy between observed and modeled sulfate sources can be reconciled by increasing passive volcanic sulfur degassing emissions and decreasing DMS emissions. Our results imply that current biases in emissions inventories could bias assessments of aerosol‐cloud interactions in the Southern Ocean region and globally."

This study develops a closure model for the rotation‐induced pressure‐strain correlation. In rotating boundary layers, quasi two‐dimensional turbulent eddies are identified as key contributors to modulating the magnitude of the pressure‐strain correlation. By involving the anisotropic characteristics of these eddies, the proposed model represents the rotation‐induced pressure‐strain correlation as a function of the turbulence Rossby number and the Reynolds stresses. Direct numerical simulations are performed to evaluate the performance of the closure model. The results show that our closure model is in good agreement with direct numerical simulations.

Using the high‐resolution WRF‐PALM nested model, we quantitatively evaluated the ABL disturbances caused by small‐scale islands. Sensitivity experiments with and without islands, conducted during both daytime and nighttime, were used to investigate the wake structures, their effects on near‐surface meteorology, and the underlying physical mechanisms. The results reveal notable diurnal variations in the wake structure. At night, orographic dynamics dominate, creating a wind sheltering effect in the leeward area, reducing wind speed, and forming a weak wind wake with downward motion near the surface. This reduces the upward kinematic turbulent sensible heat flux, inhibiting latent heat flux from the sea. During the day, thermal and dynamic forces contribute to a more complex wake structure, with accelerated airflows flanking the low‐speed wake on both sides. The convergence of wind streams induces upward motion and enhances wind‐driven mixing, thereby increasing turbulent sensible heat exchange within the wake zone. Even small islands induce substantial horizontal disturbances in the ABL, with the temperature wake at night extending 5.3 times the island's area and 5.9 times its length, reaching more than 15 km downstream. Thermal effects dominate over dynamic effects in influencing vertical ABL disturbances, increasing the disturbance heights of wind speed, potential temperature, and water vapor to 445 m, 665 m, and 675 m, respectively. These findings reveal the meteorological significance of small‐island wakes and their essential role in shaping local boundary‐layer processes."

However, due to the scarcity of in situ observations and the complex spatiotemporal variability of these sources, significant uncertainties remain in regional CH4 emission estimates. To address this, we conducted continuous atmospheric CH4 concentration measurements from 1 June 2023, to 31 May 2024, at a central YRD site. Using an atmospheric transport model and a Bayesian inversion framework, we quantified monthly and sub‐monthly CH4 emissions from different source categories, with a focus on waste treatment (including both landfill and wastewater). The results reveal the following key findings: (a) Substantial discrepancies were found between prior and posterior emissions across all categories. At the city scale, posterior annual CH4 emissions were estimated to be 87.4%, 64.6%, 109.5%, and 91.9% of prior emissions for all categories, waste treatment, rice paddy + wetland, and other sources, respectively, with waste treatment contributing the largest uncertainty. (b) Strong seasonal biases were observed, with waste treatment emissions peaking in August and reaching a minimum in March (a 2.6‐fold variation), while rice paddy emissions were overestimated in May and underestimated in August by a factor of two. (c) CH4 emissions from waste treatment exhibited high temperature sensitivity, increasing by 29%–31% per 10°C rise. Under future warming scenarios, waste treatment CH4 emission factors (EFs) will increase by up to 121.3% under SSP5‐8.5 by the end of the century (2091–2100), relative to 2023–2024 levels. In contrast, atmospheric pressure showed negligible influence (3.2% per 1 hPa) on waste treatment CH4 emissions. (d) More additional observations (i.e., satellite or multiple sites) are strongly suggested to resolve the prior spatial pattern of emissions, especially for fossil fuel‐related sources."

Chillrud,Surface Variable‐Based Machine Learning for Scalable Arsenic Prediction in Undersampled Areas,"In the United States, private wells are not federally regulated, and many households do not test for Arsenic (As). Chronic exposure is linked with multiple health outcomes, and risk can change sharply over short distances and with well depth. Coarse maps or sparse sampling often miss exceedances. Most existing models operate at ∼1 km resolution and use groundwater chemistry or detailed geologic logs, which limits their use in undersampled areas where improved guidance is most needed. We overcome these limitations by developing a machine learning model for Minnesota, USA, that predicts As exposure risk using only surficial variables from remote sensing and global data sets. Variables related to surface water hydrology and geomorphology are selected based on mechanistic links that control redox conditions and As mobilization. Local training was essential, and surficial geology variables that are more sensitive to local conditions were needed to maximize model accuracy. The resulting complete model was sufficiently sensitive to generate accurate and detailed risk maps and depth profiles of As concentrations above the 10 μg/L maximum contaminant level. Accuracy depended on local training data density. We identified a training data density of 0.07 wells/km2 as a practical target for stable county‐level performance. Maps of exceedance probabilities highlight priority areas for testing that are particularly important in rural communities that have received less sampling. These results support public health action by guiding where to install wells and where to test them, how much new sampling is needed, and where treatment outreach is most urgent."

Our study assessed how sociodemographic factors indicative of social vulnerability were associated with smoke from agricultural burns in Florida. We assessed census‐level sociodemographic variables among four counties adjacent to the Everglades Agricultural Area (n = 409 census tracts, 2016–2020). Smoke day counts from local agricultural fires were based on satellite plumes identified from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Hazard Mapping System. Primary analysis fit a negative binomial model with bidirectional stepwise regression, followed by an adjusted geospatial model with a Queen‐continuity adjacency matrix. Sensitivity analysis focused on rural‐only census tracts. Rural areas had higher concentrations of people of color and poverty compared to coastal urban areas. Median (Q1, Q3) smoke days by census tract was 36 (31, 45), with the highest concentrations in rural central and western regions. Primary model results skewed toward mostly urban tracts, where an interquartile ranges (IQR) increase in median household income was associated with a 12% decrease (95% confidence interval (CI) −14.5%, −5.2%) in smoke days. Among rural‐only census tracts, an IQR increase in percentage of residents living 200% below the poverty line and non‐English speaking residents were associated with 23% (95% CI: 1.2%, 37.7%) and 120% (95% CI: 20.5%, 176.5%) increases in smoke days, respectively. Sociodemographic factors associated with health and environmental vulnerability were context dependent. Within rural regions, poverty, race and ethnicity played more important roles in exposure risk, whereas wealth mitigated risk among urban areas."

 Conceptual engineering system design faces challenges from traditional methods and emerging AI tools to fully address its inherently complex, dynamic, and creativity-driven demands. iDesignGPT is a framework that integrates large language models with established design methodologies to enable dynamic multi-agent collaboration for problem refinement, information gathering, design space exploration, and evaluation. By incorporating design metrics such as coverage, diversity, and novelty, iDesignGPT provides quantitative insights for early-stage conceptual design. Performance evaluations across six public design challenges show that iDesignGPT achieves competitive novelty and consistently higher originality and modularity than GPT-4o zero-shot, GPT-4o chain-of-thought and Deepseek-r1, based on metrics and expert assessments. Two controlled user studies show positive reception across profiles and, for novice designers, lower mental demand than human-only design and clearer design flow with iDesignGPT. These results establish iDesignGPT as a practical framework for integrating language-model agents with established engineering design methods, enabling metrics-driven support for conceptual design by both expert and novice designers.

 The bacterial accessory genome, comprised of plasmids, phages, and other mobile elements, underpins the adaptability of bacterial populations. Pangenome (core and accessory) analysis of pathogens can reveal epidemiological relatedness missed by using core-genome methods alone. Employing a k-mer-based Jaccard Index approach to compute pangenome relatedness, we explore the population structure and epidemiology of Salmonella enterica serotype Hadar (Hadar), an emerging zoonotic pathogen in the United States (U.S.) linked to both commercial and backyard poultry. A total of 3384 U.S. Hadar genomes collected between 1990 and 2023 are analyzed here. Hadar populations underwent substantial shifts between 2019 and 2020 in the U.S., driven by the expansion of a lineage carrying a previously uncommon prophage-like element. Phylogenetic and pangenomic relatedness, coupled with epidemiological data, suggest this lineage emerged from extant populations circulating in commercial poultry, with subsequent dissemination into backyard poultry environments. We demonstrate the utility of pangenomic approaches for mapping vertical and horizontal diversity and informing complex dynamics of zoonotic bacterial pathogens.

 Spin-crossover complexes are promising candidates for molecular bits owing to their magnetic bistability. However, it’s a formidable challenge to turn densely packed spin-crossover molecules into high-density bits due to cooperative switching dynamics inherent in spin-crossover aggregates. Herein, coordination-field engineering is demonstrated by scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and density functional theory as an efficient strategy to modulate the cooperative dynamics of surface-confined spin-crossover chains. Within these chains, Ni centers exhibit collective spin transitions upon local stimuli. This spin-crossover cooperativity can be disrupted by coordination-field modification via hetero-metal/ligand doping, which converts partial switchable coordination centers into non-switchable nodes. These nodes divide the single-bit-like spin-crossover chain into multiple independently-switchable segments and thereby augment the bit density. One-by-one erasable write-in of these spin-crossover bits is achieved by scanning tunneling microscope tip manipulation. These results highlight how to precisely tweak the cooperative dynamics of the spin-crossover aggregates to advance their potential applications for high-density memory.

 Label-free optical detection of nanometer-scale bioparticles is highly desirable for noninvasive biological studies but challenging due to the weak scattering signals that are difficult to distinguish from the illumination background. Interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT) has enabled high-sensitivity imaging by detecting the interference between the particle’s scattered light and a reference beam. However, enhancing the detection sensitivity and the image contrast for small particles continues to be a challenge in iSCAT. Here, we introduce meta-amplified dark-field interferometric scattering microscopy (MAD-iSCAT), which leverages a plasmonic metasurface to drastically enhance nanoparticle detection sensitivity in iSCAT. By employing a metasurface comprising sub-diffraction plasmonic meta-atom arrays, MAD-iSCAT generates bright radiation modes that intensely scatter light toward the far field in the presence of a detection nanoparticle, substantially amplifying the sensitivity. In the absence of a nanoparticle, the metasurface produces minimal background due to the dark collective mode, resulting in improved image contrast. We present a theoretical analysis of amplified interferometric imaging using designed metasurfaces and experimentally demonstrate enhancements in contrast and signal-to-noise ratio for detecting dielectric nanoparticles, exosomes, and proteins. Our approach offers broad applications in label-free biosensing and optical mass spectrometry, enabling significantly improved throughput and sensitivity.

 Earthquakes and seismically-induced landslides accelerate carbon export from mountains by eroding hillslope soil carbon. However, a quantitative understanding of their net contribution to carbon cycling remains incomplete. Using the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan Earthquake which generated the largest landslide volume in recent history, we quantify its carbon mass balance accounting for storage, loss, and transport within the ensuing sediment cascade. Thanks to post-event revegetation and extensive intermontane sediment storage, we show that the earthquake boosted Longmenshan carbon mass by ~10%. Given the stability of these deposits and low rates of carbon export, we anticipate this landslide carbon will persist for centuries to millennia before gradually declining. In effect, we demonstrate that earthquakes and landslides function as capacitors, regulating carbon storage and discharge across mountain belts over time. This suggests frequent landslides in seismically-active mountains may lead to a net carbon sequestration, providing a critical and direct link between tectonics and the carbon cycle.

Two-dimensional sheet conductivity arises but is suppressed when twist angles lead to interfacial lattice aperiodicity. 
 Probing novel properties, arising from twisted interfaces, has traditionally relied on the stacking of exfoliated two-dimensional materials and the spontaneous formation of van der Waals bonds. So far, investigations involving intimate covalent or ionic bonds have not been a focus. Yet, we show here that an established technique, involving thermocompressional wafer bonding, works well for creating twisted non-van der Waals interfaces. We have successfully bonded z-cut lithium niobate single crystals to create ferroelectric oxide interfaces with strong polar discontinuities and have mapped the associated emergent interfacial conductivity. In some instances, a dramatic change in microstructure occurs, involving local dipolar switching. A twist-induced collapse in the capability of the system to effec8tively screen interfacial bound charge is implied. Importantly, this only occurs around specific moiré twist angles with sparse coincident lattices and associated short-range aperiodicity. In quasicrystals, aperiodicity is known to induce pseudo-bandgaps and we suspect a similar phenomenon here.

 Vehicle emission is a major source of urban ultrafine particles (UFPs), yet measurement and emission control for UFP lags significantly behind that of other pollutants. The China VI emission standard, one of the strictest globally, introduced the nation’s first particle number (PN) limits. This study focused on real-world PN emissions in the capital city Beijing, which adopted China VI ahead of the national schedule in 2019. Based on long-term particle number size distribution measurements and online UFP composition analysis, a pronounced decline in emission rates of vehicle-attributed PN from 2019 to 2023 was found, resulting in decreases of ~70% for atmospheric PN3–30 nm, ~48% for PN30–100 nm, and ~42% for PN>100 nm. These reductions substantially outpace those observed for PM2.5 and NO2. Early implementation of China VI, coupled with rapid electric vehicle adoption, are the primary drivers behind Beijing’s more pronounced PN mitigation (−44%) compared with nationwide (−33%). These findings highlight the effectiveness of more stringent vehicle emission standards and electric vehicle strategies in reducing atmospheric UFPs, shedding light on future vehicle emission regulations.

 The natural land carbon sink (SLAND) absorbs roughly 25–30% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, thus playing a critical role in offsetting climate warming. In the Global Carbon Budget (GCB), SLAND is estimated using model simulations that isolate the carbon response of land to environmental changes (i.e. rising atmospheric CO2, nitrogen deposition, and changes in climate). However, these simulations assume fixed pre-industrial land cover, failing to represent today’s human-altered landscapes. This leads to a systematic overestimation of forest area, and thus CO2 sink strength, in regions heavily altered by human activity. We present a new process-based approach to estimate SLAND using Dynamic Global Vegetation Models. Our corrected estimate reduces SLAND by ~20% (0.6 PgC yr-1) over 2015–2024, from 3.00 ± 0.94 to 2.42 ± 0.77 PgC yr-1. We incorporate this new SLAND estimate with emissions from land-use change from bookkeeping models, to estimate a net land sink of 1.19 ± 1.04 PgC yr-1, which aligns closely with atmospheric inversion constraints. This downward revision of SLAND reduces the magnitude of the budget imbalance for 2015–2024, indicating a more consistent partitioning of the global carbon budget."

 The Indo-Pacific Convergence Zone is a key carbon sink via silicate weathering, yet its glacial-interglacial carbon dioxide consumption remains unclear. Here we reconstruct silicate weathering fluxes over the past 700,000 years by combining the global geochemical numerical model GEOCLIM with machine learning algorithms to constrain silicate weathering history in the Indo-Pacific Convergence Zone. Our results show that during glacial periods, weathering fluxes peaked at approximately 1.86 × 1012 moles per year, drawing down about 9.3 ppmv of carbon dioxide. Exposure of continental shelves during low sea levels raised glacial weathering by 33%, but high-frequency positive rainfall anomalies amplified this increase by 54–130% (approximately 9.2–13.7 ppmv carbon dioxide). This underscores how sea-level change and hydrology control tropical shelf weathering. Our study provides critical insights into past climatic transitions, emphasizing the Indo-Pacific Convergence Zone’s role in regulating the global carbon cycle and offering constraints for future climate projections.

 A lack of historical land-use data hinders the appropriate assessment of ecosystem restoration potential. Here we integrate pollen and phytolith analysis, isotopic dating, historical records, and high-resolution satellite imagery to reconstruct five centuries of land-use and vegetation change in the karst landscapes of Southwest China. We show that prior to the 18th century, dense forests dominated the region under minimal human influence. However, the introduction of maize cultivation, rapid population growth, and extensive deforestation triggered a persistent shift toward open landscapes. This transformation is evidenced by a marked rise in pioneer fern spores (~11%) and an increase in herb pollen by 3.7–18.8%. In areas with severe historical human disturbance, ecological recovery remains difficult, and tree numbers have remained nearly unchanged over the past two decades, despite the absence of human intervention. Overlooking these historical land-use legacies in restoration efforts may possibly lead to unrealistic expectations, misguided interventions, and wasted resources.

 Sea level rise, coastal erosion and climate change are major stressors for coastal communities, whose expansion may be also limited by land scarcity and environmental issues. Floating cities may represent an interesting solution, but require further conceptual development, both in terms of technological means and architectural vision. Furthermore, their feasibility and sustainability still need to be explored more in depth. In view of these gaps, here we propose an innovative floating city vision, based on a comprehensive approach, including qualitative and quantitative analyses and ranging between all the above-mentioned topics. The concept is built around three pillars: resilience, sustainability, and urban welfare, corresponding to the three elements of water, nature, and man, respectively. A preliminary quantitative analysis about space, food and energy requirements confirms the feasibility of the floating city and provides a benchmark for future investigation on similar concepts.

 Glacier response to climate change results in rapid glacier water resource loss. Positive glacial regulatory processes (GRPs) are processes that buffer glacier water resource losses. Nevertheless, these processes are not systematically quantified, which may lead to uncertainty in glacier water resource sustainability assessments. Here, we employ a glacier water balance model to track glacier water resource transport trajectories and quantify contributions of positive GRPs across High Mountain Asia (HMA). The combined impacts of positive GRPs could mitigate ~236-255 Gt of HMA glacier water resource loss (~9%-13% of total mass loss) in the 21st century (2015-2100), suggesting underestimated glacier water resource sustainability. These contributions result from precipitation pattern transition (~0.9%-1.9%), nonlinear fluctuations in glacier dynamics (~4.7%-7.1%), rapid expansion of dead ice (~2.0%-2.4%), and retention of glacial meltwater by exposed depressions (~1.0%-1.3%). We highlight the importance of accurately assessing glacier water resource loss for water sustainability and sea level rise projections.

 Quantifying how rainwater infiltration modifies the stable isotope composition of soil pore water is essential for tracing water movement through the critical zone. We monitored intact soil columns under natural rainfall at high temporal resolution, jointly measuring seepage flux and the hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition of drainage water. The data reveal a robust, threshold-like pattern: faster seepage is consistently associated with more isotopically depleted drainage, behavior that is not readily explained by evaporation or simple mixing alone. We interpret this pattern as evidence for an interfacial hydrodynamic isotope fractionation process, in which transport dynamics and soil–water interfacial interactions partition water isotopologues without phase change. This framework refines how isotopes are used to infer soil water mixing and has implications for predicting recharge and ecosystem water use under a changing climate. In porous soil, physical transport processes and soil–water interactions can preferentially partition water isotopes during rainfall infiltration, resulting in interfacial hydrodynamic fractionation."

 Ship detection in remote sensing imagery is essential for diverse maritime-related tasks, including ocean surveillance, fisheries management, and environmental assessment. In operational scenarios, optical imagery provides rich texture cues under clear conditions, whereas synthetic aperture radar (SAR) enables reliable observation in nighttime and cloudy weather. However, cross-domain ship detection across optical and SAR modalities is still challenging due to discrepancies in imaging mechanisms, speckle noise, and background clutter, particularly in near-shore scenarios with similar reflection characteristics, together with the arbitrariness of ship orientation. To address these issues, we propose RotCD-Ship, a rotated cross-domain ship detection framework that bridges the domain gap between optical and SAR images while enabling accurate detection of arbitrarily oriented ships. Specifically, a domain knowledge-guided semantic prompt (DKSP) strategy based on SAR physical priors is introduced to suppress background clutter such as ship wakes and coastal interference. To handle modal divergence, we design a progressive feature alignment scheme that combines multi-scale local feature alignment (MSL-align) and global feature alignment (GF-align), enabling transfer of both fine-grained textures and high-level semantics across domains. Furthermore, a coarse-to-fine rotated region of interest (CF-RRoI) generator is developed to enhance localization precision of strip-like ships in SAR images by progressively refining orientation-aware proposals. Extensive evaluations on five public ship detection datasets show that RotCD-Ship significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving an average mAP improvement of 7.5% in the horizontal ship detection task and 5.5% in the oriented ship detection task compared to the best existing methods. In addition, large-scale tests on Gaofen-3 SAR images further verify the strong generalization in dense-ship and complex coastal environments, highlighting the practical applicability of our framework for all-weather maritime monitoring."

 Accurately and timely detecting road pavement damage helps monitor road deterioration extent, thereby guiding maintenance projects and ensuring traffic safety. Nevertheless, due to textural similarity and nested distribution between neighboring pavement damages, as well as the damages with the diversity sizes, irregular shapes, multiple categories, current methods have the limitation in the high-quality detection from road street-level images. To tackle these challenges, this paper develops a novel real-time anchor-free network with a one-stage processing architecture, named RPDNet, for precisely and accurately detecting pavement damages from streel-level road images. First, stacked with a layer-by-layer encoding structure boosted by a deformable fully-attentive module as the backbone extractor, the RPDNet can capture more fine-grained information and generate multiscale strong task-aware semantics, favoring significantly the discrimination noteworthy textural and geometric features. Then, by adopting a multi-level efficient aggregation neck, the RPDNet can promote informative spatial details and integrate the different-level damage encoding features, contributing to the light-weight and optimization of the whole architecture. Afterward, designed with a dual-large kernel module, embedded in a decoupled detection head with anchor-free guidance, the RPDNet can project the ranging dependency of salient and task-oriented pavement damage objects by adaptively aggregating information across large kernels in spatial-domain. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations confirmed that the RPDNet provided a promiseful solution for detecting pavement damages in industrial applications under complex street-level road conditions. Furthermore, comparative analysis with the latest anchor-based and anchor-free alternatives also proved the superiority and generalization of the RPDNet in pavement damage detection tasks. The assessment results displayed that the RPDNet obtained an average mAP@0.5, mAP@0.5:0.95, precision, and recall of 69.16%, 44.86%, 72.59%, and 60.41%, respectively, on two dataset.

 Underground resource extraction redistributes subsurface stress, inducing overburden movement and ground deformation. These geomechanical changes can cause ground fissures, slope failures, and collapses, resulting in resource loss, economic damage, safety risks, and environmental degradation. Therefore, accurate monitoring of surface deformation and understanding of deformation propagation mechanisms are crucial for sustainable resource extraction and geohazard mitigation. To this end, a fusion framework is proposed that integrates a three-dimensional physical model with Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology to monitor surface deformation and investigate deformation propagation. A mining area in China was selected as a case study. Sentinel-1A images were processed using Stacking-InSAR and Small Baseline Subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) techniques to derive surface deformation. InSAR-derived deformation was validated against GNSS measurements, yielding mean absolute errors (MAE) of 35.7 mm for Stacking-InSAR and 6.5 mm for SBAS-InSAR. Although SBAS-InSAR exhibits higher precision in coherent areas, it provides missing/invalid measurements in the central high-intensity deformation zone (cumulative deformation > 300 mm), indicating limited applicability under strong mining-induced disturbances. Concurrently, a large-scale three-dimensional physical model was constructed, and overburden strain and surface deformation were measured using distributed optical fiber sensing (DOFS) and digital close-range industrial photogrammetry (DCRIP). After scaling to the prototype, the physical-model surface deformation agrees well with the Stacking-InSAR measurements (mean relative error 17%–18%), confirming the reliability of the constructed physical model. Moreover, a prediction model was developed using synergistic monitoring data, achieving a root mean square error (RMSE) of 52.2 mm (i.e., 6.35% of the maximum deformation of 822.4 mm) and a standard deviation (STD) of 51.8 mm (6.30%) relative to the Stacking-InSAR results. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively bridges laboratory-scale observations and field-scale satellite measurements, thereby improving the understanding of underground-to-surface deformation propagation under mining-induced disturbances. Furthermore, this integration enables high-precision estimation of mining-induced deformation and supports coupled surface and underground deformation analysis."

 Salt-marsh Fairy circles (FC) are enigmatic, quasi-circular structures linked to interacting biogeophysical processes, yet they remain difficult to detect and quantify at scale from conventional RGB imagery. Limited labeled data, transient and variable FC appearance, and severe class-imbalance make single-model machine learning (ML) unreliable for quantitative monitoring. We propose a framework for automatic FC recognition and enumeration on 3-band imagery. A zero-shot foundation model (SAM) segments images into instance-level blocks. Novel distribution-pattern and geometric features, class-equalized losses, weighted resampling, and augmentation are applied within deep-learning (U-Net, Attention-U-Net, Swin-Unet) and ensemble-learning (Random Forest, XGBoost) models. The key innovation is an imbalance-aware Bayesian method that fuses pixel-wise probabilities across models; a counting algorithm then tallies FC instances. We evaluate eight pan-sharpened scenes covering four sites along China’s coast. No individual ML model or standard Bayesian fusion is fully satisfactory. The imbalance-aware Bayesian method improves over the best single model: tight scheme: κ rises from 0.69 to 0.76, F1-score from 70.9% to 75.8% (Class 1) and from 63.5% to 68.2% (Class 2), and AUC from 84.8% to 93.1% and from 78.5% to 84.8%; loose scheme: κ increases from 0.74 to 0.79, AUC from 85.1% to 90.3%, F1-score from 74.3% to 78.6%. The counting algorithm achieves RMSE 1.62 and MAPE 0.33% over 1,135 instances, outperforming DBSCAN. A 22-month case study on Chongming Island captures marsh expansion and dieback dynamics through shifts between FC classes. Our framework delivers reliable FC recognition and enumeration on a small dataset with severe class-imbalance, generalizing across salt-marsh types."

 Plastic greenhouses (PGs), as a typical form of facility agriculture, play a crucial role in stabilizing agricultural production and increasing crop yields, but their rapid expansion has raised environmental concerns. Accurate long-term PGs monitoring is therefore essential for scientific agricultural regulation and environmental sustainability. However, most existing studies have focused on local regions or single-year mapping, and long-term PGs mapping remains limited. Moreover, acquiring multi-year high-quality training samples and developing effective classification algorithms remain major challenges for reliable PGs extraction. To address these issues, we propose a novel PGs mapping framework that integrates automatic sample generation with multi-temporal noise correction (MTNC), and utilizes Landsat time-series images to efficiently and accurately map multi-year PGs distribution in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain. Specifically, high-quality training samples were automatically generated from multi-source land use/land cover and PGs products through spatial rules and sample migration, followed by preliminary classification with Random Forest. The initial predictions were then refined through the MTNC strategy, and the optimized labels were subsequently employed to train a segmentation network for robust PGs extraction. Accuracy assessments on two independent validation datasets demonstrate that the final PGs maps achieve overall accuracies above 90% and Kappa coefficients greater than 0.8 across all years. And cross-comparisons with existing PGs products at multiple spatial resolutions show a high level of spatial consistency (R2 = 0.91 with PGs-10 and 0.74 with PGs-3), further confirming the reliability of the proposed framework and the high quality of the final products."

Furthermore, two-step MR integrating inflammatory factor, immune cell phenotypes, and CSF metabolomics identified 25 potential mediators linking air pollution to neuropsychiatric diseases. MR analysis integrated with pathway enrichment revealed that pollutant exposure may induce neurotoxicity by 3 core mechanisms, including the activation of inflammatory pathways (e.g., Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt (PI3K-Akt)) and dysregulation of lipid metabolism (e.g., arachidonic acid and α-linolenic acid metabolism). Notably, transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), SSC-A on HLA-DR + CD8+ T cells, and arachidonate (20:4n6) showed substantial mediation effects, accounting for 14.8 %, 17.5 %, and 21.6 % of the associations between PM2.5 and Alzheimer's disease (AD), PM2.5 and schizophrenia, and NO2 and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), respectively. These biomarkers represent potential targets for early detection and intervention, highlighting increased risk associated with long-term exposure to air pollution. Collectively, our findings provide novel causal and mechanistic evidence that may inform both air quality regulation and the allocation of neuropsychiatric healthcare resources in high-risk populations."

 Aerosols play key role in cloud nucleation and atmospheric radiation processes, thus an accurate aerosol modeling is critical for numerical weather predictions. This study establishes an aerosol optical depth (AOD) 3D-Var data assimilation (DA) scheme for the CMA-MESO/CUACE weather prediction model, assimilates AOD retrievals derived from the Fengyun-4B (FY-4B) satellite, and evaluates the impacts of AOD DA on weather predictions through a month-long hindcast experiment. The AOD observation operator is built based on a look-up table, of which the aerosol optical properties (AOP) are computed for non-spherical dust with the invariant imbedding T-matrix method and for spherical anthropogenic aerosols with the Lorenz–Mie method, respectively. The month-long model results are evaluated using the AERONET measurements and ground-based weather observations across China. Results show a significant reduction of the bias of the AOD prediction by up to 0.2 by assimilating AOD retrievals. The improved AOD predictions further positively influence the modeling of the atmospheric thermal-dynamic structures. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of regional 2-m air temperature and 10-m wind speed predictions can be reduced by up to 0.7 K and 0.2 m s−1, respectively. The benefits of AOD DA demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed AOD assimilation scheme and the necessity of incorporating satellite AOD data for improving weather predictions."

 The Hadley circulation (HC) is the dominant meridional circulation in the tropics, and its interannual variability exerts a strong influence on the global climate system. While the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a well-known tropospheric driver, the stratospheric Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) also contributes to tropical variability. However, the mechanisms through which the QBO modulates HC variability remain unclear. Using reanalysis data and CMIP6 model outputs, this study demonstrates that the vertical structure of the QBO plays a crucial role in modulating the interannual variability of the HC during autumn, particularly over the western Pacific. When the QBO vertical structure index (QBOVI) is greater than 0, a secondary circulation forms, characterized by equatorial ascent and midlatitude descent. This circulation is associated with a cold anomaly in the lower stratosphere, which reduces static stability near the tropopause and strengthens the local HC over the western Pacific. Conversely, when the QBOVI is less than 0, the static stability in the upper troposphere is enhanced, leading to a weakening of the HC. The evaluation of six selected high-top CMIP6 models shows that the models fail to capture the observed relationship between the QBO vertical structure and the HC. This limitation may arise from biases in simulating the link between HC intensity and static stability, as well as from difficulties in reproducing the QBO's regulation of the thermal structure near the tropopause. Improving model representations of this modulation could enhance the simulation and prediction of interannual HC variability."

 A profiled hydrometeor classification algorithm (HCA) for the dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR) onboard the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission (GPM DPR-HCA) was developed using retrievals from a ground-based radar. A four-dimensional feature vector consisting of Ku- and Ka-band reflectivity, the dual-frequency ratio, and air temperature from the GPM DPR was selected as input features and collocated with hydrometeor classifications from the ground-based dual-polarization radar in Guangzhou (GZ) to generate a labeled dataset. The average feature vector of each class was taken as its centroid. Euclidean distances between a sample and the centroid vectors of hydrometeor classes were computed, and the class with the minimum distance was assigned to the sample. Applying the GPM DPR-HCA to a precipitation case demonstrated that the retrieved hydrometeor profiles agreed well with those from GZ radar. The algorithm was evaluated against the hydrometeor classification results of GZ radar and the GPM DPR-Official phase product. Assessment results showed that PODs exceeded 0.75 for liquid- and mixed-phase hydrometeors, whereas PODs were 0.66 for hail and 0.43 for low-density graupel among solid-phase classes due to substantial feature overlaps. Regional application over the Yangtze-Huai River Valley Region and South China revealed that wet snow, graupel, and ice crystals dominated the mid- and upper levels during stratiform events, while graupel and hail were more frequent in convective events. The accuracy and reliability of the GPM DPR-HCA make it a candidate for the development of hydrometeor classification products of spaceborne precipitation radars."

 Tropical cyclones (TCs) are typically associated with intense convection and heavy rainfall; however, their broader influence on concurrent heatwave (HW) and air-quality extremes remains poorly understood. This study examines the complex interactions between cyclone dynamics, HWs, and aerosols during the prolonged TC Biparjoy in June 2023. While the cyclone produced widespread rainfall over western and northwestern India, persistent HWs prevailed across the central-east and peninsular regions. The cyclone's slow movement over northwestern India reinforced subsidence and high-pressure anomalies, leading to a 2–4 °C rise in surface temperatures and an expansion of the extent and intensity of HWs. Satellite observations revealed elevated aerosol loading up to 5 km over the HW-affected regions, dominated by absorbing dust and polluted dust aerosols. Analysis of dust transport and circulation patterns showed that strong westerly winds trailing the cyclone entrained coarse dust aerosols (>1.0 μm) from the Middle East and Central Asia, contributing to the widespread vertical enhancement of aerosols across central and peninsular India. Aerosol Direct Radiative Forcing (ADRF) analysis showed positive atmospheric forcing and negative surface forcing, implying a radiative imbalance that may have intensified near-surface heating through feedback mechanisms. The results highlight a compound TC-HW-Aerosol event, wherein cyclone-induced subsidence and dust transport jointly amplified regional heat extremes and atmospheric warming despite concurrent rainfall elsewhere."

 The implementation of air pollution mitigation strategies requires not only high-quality continuous measurements of pollutants but also proper definitions of ways to differentiate between transported and locally produced contributions, as only the latter can be effectively reduced by authorities. To address this issue, we propose a new approach for partitioning monitored black carbon (BC) concentrations into city-produced (urban) and transported fractions using a combination of measured and modeled data. Two simultaneous measurement campaigns (warm season 2022 and cold season 2022/23) were conducted in two urban environments: Vilnius (Lithuania) and Warsaw (Poland). In the cold season in Warsaw, BC mass concentration was 90% higher than in the warm season, while in Vilnius, an increase of 44% was observed, as compared to the warm season. Aerosol optical properties showed more complex aerosol mixtures of dust, BC and brown carbon (BrC) during the cold season, forming larger particles. Single scattering albedo (SSA) anti-correlated with BCFF, proving that fossil fuel (FF) combustion contributes to the warming effect in both cities. A positive correlation between the population density of the emission areas of transported BC and the BC mass concentrations in Vilnius and Warsaw was found. The impact of transported BC on the local BC levels in the cities was of 53±8% and 36±28% in the cold season and of 23±7% and 13±21% in the warm season for Warsaw and Vilnius, respectively. Thus, the approach of BC partitioning showed that in the cold season, the two cities suffered from worse air quality, in part due to more transported BC."

Using paleographically constrained global mantle convection models, we reproduce the present-day location of the Hawaiian hot spot and the associated spatiotemporal geochemical evolution. The composition of the plume conduit shows conventional concentric zoning prior to the Hawaiian-Emperor Bend and gradually evolves to a north-south bilateral zoning pattern afterward, corresponding to the subparallel Loa-Kea trends. Further analysis suggests that the plume originates from ridges of large low-velocity province (LLVP) induced by the push of slabs. Upwelling at the intersections of ridges is more energetic than at the middle of the ridge, causing bottom-up splitting of plume conduit in the lower mantle that propagates upward, forming bilateral zoning and eventually two independent plumes. This process suggests that bilateral zoning is transient and more common in the Pacific than Africa due to the circum-Pacific subduction."

Current treatments fail to holistically address these pathophysiological axes. Here, we develop a reactive oxygen species (ROS)–responsive liposomal nanoplatform (LipoNCs@pGSDMB) that codelivers a polymeric stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist and a gasdermin B (GSDMB) plasmid for dual neuro-immune modulation. Upon tumor-selective activation in metastatic bone niches, this nanotherapy induces STING-driven immune priming and GSDMB-mediated pyroptosis, triggering potent antitumor responses. Crucially, LipoNCs@pGSDMB restore voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) expression in tumor cells, a prognostic biomarker identified through multiomics analysis of clinical specimens, thereby blocking calcium-dependent neurosignaling and disrupting prometastatic tumor-nerve cross-talk. In breast cancer bone metastasis models, this approach achieves 94% tumor suppression, complete pain resolution, and efficient bone restoration.

To dissect its tissue-specific functions, we generated a humanized floxedGpr75mouse model with conditional deletions in the brain and adipose tissue. Mice with brain-specific Gpr75 deletion using Nestin-Cre were resistant to diet-induced obesity, primarily through suppressed food intake and modest increases in energy expenditure. In contrast, adipocyte-specific deletion of Gpr75 had minimal effects on systemic metabolism but modestly enhanced mitochondrial oxygen consumption in brown adipose tissue under cold exposure. Gpr75 expression was up-regulated in key brain regions and down-regulated in white adipose tissue under high-fat diet conditions, supporting a predominant central role in metabolic adaptation. Histological and transcriptomic analyses further revealed depot-specific effects on adipocyte morphology and hepatic lipid accumulation in global knockouts. These findings position GPR75 as a critical regulator of central energy balance and provide a mechanistic framework for developing brain-targeted therapies against obesity."

However, the 2023 release of the US Environmental Protection Agency’s National Emissions Inventory (NEI) found that RWC contributes ~28% of total wintertime fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions, suggesting that ambient PM2.5concentrations could be substantially reduced if RWC were curtailed. Despite its contribution to PM2.5emissions, an assessment of the air quality, health, and distributional impacts of RWC using the updated NEI has not been performed. Here, we use a high-resolution (4 kilometers) air quality model and the updated NEI to evaluate wintertime RWC impacts over the contiguous United States. We find that RWC contributes 2.43 micrograms per cubic meter (21.9%) of winter population-weighted mean PM2.5concentrations, leading to ~8600 (confidence interval: 6500 to 9600) premature deaths annually. Moreover, nonwhite communities are disproportionately affected by RWC-related PM2.5and associated mortality, especially in urban areas. We suggest that policies targeting RWC could substantially reduce air pollution, improve health, and address distributional disparities."

Although functionally capable of clearing HIV-infected CD4+T cells in a tissue-mimetic environment, they show impaired cytotoxicity and transcriptional signs of exhaustion after infection. Conversely, HIV drives the reprogramming of immature CD16−CD69+NK cells toward a more cytotoxic and migratory effector phenotype.

Here, we demonstrate that RSV orchestrates the temporal and sequential regulation of distinct PCD pathways in human macrophages to optimize replication and dissemination. During early stages of infection, RSV activates the PI3K-Akt pathway to induce cFLIP expression, effectively suppressing TNF-driven extrinsic apoptosis. Simultaneously, viral degradation of ZDHHC9 prevents GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis downstream of NLRP3 activation, thereby sustaining an intracellular environment permissive to viral propagation. In contrast, following the completion of replication, RSV subverts caspase-1 signaling to trigger the intrinsic apoptotic cascade via the Casp-1–BID–APAF1–Casp-9 axis, and subsequently promotes GSDME-mediated secondary pyroptosis. This late-stage PCD reprogramming enables synchronized release of virions and pro-inflammatory cytokines, exacerbating pulmonary pathology. These findings delineate a temporally resolved strategy by which RSV balances early immune evasion with subsequent viral dissemination and immunopathology, and identify discrete stage-specific molecular targets for therapeutic intervention in RSV-induced lung disease."

Using a new reporter line, we achieved high-resolution mapping of this previously undercharacterized vertebrate visual circuit. Genetic disruption of Lrrn CAMs leads to disorganization of the circuit and impairments in brightness and contrast sensitivity, resulting in deficits in visually guided behavior. Additionally, ultrastructural circuit reconstruction and functional imaging analysis identified both its synaptic partners and revealed its critical role in luminance processing.

However, the increasing severity of fungicide resistance necessitates urgent clarification of its evolutionary mechanisms to optimize disease management and delay resistance development. The DddA-derived cytosine base editors (DdCBEs)–mediated base editing in oomycetes confirmed that thePsCytbS33Lmutation is sufficient to confer ametoctradin resistance inPhytophthora sojae. We clarified that low-resistant and medium-resistant mutants serve as transitional populations during the resistance evolution process, with high-resistant mutants eventually becoming the dominant population. We revealed the dynamic changes in mitochondrial heterogeneity under fungicide selection, proving that the gradual increase of mutated mitochondria drives resistance evolution. There is a trade-off between ametoctradin resistance and fitness. While thePsCytbS33Lmutation confers this resistance, it impairs mitochondrial function and thereby reduces fitness. Up-regulation ofTFAM1, however, can partially offset this fitness cost. Resistance evolution in plant pathogens involves not only standing variation but also de novo mutations, providing unique insights into the “chicken-and-egg” dilemma."

However, the impact of disrupting antiferroptotic pathways in the broader tumor microenvironment (TME), such as in immune cells, is still undefined and may complicate treatments. Here, we show that ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1/Aifm2) is critically required for regulatory T cell (Tregcell) resistance to ferroptosis and their immunosuppressive function within the TME. Compared to other canonical ferroptosis regulators such as GPX4 and NRF2, only FSP1 was induced upon T cell activation. Deletion ofAifm2in all T cells, or Tregcells specifically, enhanced tumor control by selectively disrupting Tregcell immunosuppression within tumors without inciting autoimmune pathology in mice. As opposed to deletion ofGpx4in all T cells, T cell deletion ofAifm2did not impair antigen-specific CD8+T cell responses. These results reveal an opportunity for targeting a regulator of ferroptosis that can not only directly target cancer cells but also simultaneously enhance anticancer immune responses without inciting autoimmunity."

Moreover, iTregs, but not thymic Tregs, derived from these mice fail to suppress colitis in adoptive transfer models, indicating compromised inhibitory capacity. AgedTdrd3-deficient mice also show spontaneous autoinflammation.

Huang,Molecular and structural basis of a subfamily of PrfH rescuing both the damaged and intact ribosomes stalled in translation,"In bacteria, mRNAs degradation and ribotoxin-induced RNA damage are two main events that lead to the stalling of protein translation. The ubiquitous trans-translation system and several alternative rescue factors rescue the stalled ribosomes caused by truncated mRNAs lacking the stop codons. On the other hand, protein release factor homolog (PrfH) is the only known factor to rescue the stalled ribosome damaged by ribotoxins. Here, we show that a subfamily of PrfH, exemplified by PrfH fromCapnocytophaga gingivalis(CgPrfH), rescues both types of stalled ribosomes. Biochemical assays demonstrate thatCgPrfH hydrolyzes the peptides attached to P-site transfer RNAs when in complex with both the damaged and intact ribosomes. Cryo-EM structures revealed thatCgPrfH uses distinct regions to recognize two stalled ribosomes to orient the GGQ motif for peptide hydrolysis. Thus, using a combination of bioinformatic, biochemical, and structural characterization, we have uncovered a family of ribosome rescue factors that have dual activities to resolve two distinct stalled protein translation events in bacteria."

Traditionally, these protocols have been implemented and validated with a single entanglement source, as in the paradigmatic Bell scenario. However, advancing these protocols to support more complex configurations involving multiple entanglement sources is key to building robust architectures and realizing large-scale quantum networks. Here, we show how to certify randomness in an entanglement-teleportation experiment, the building block of a quantum repeater displaying two independent sources of entanglement. Using the scalar extension method, we address the challenge posed by the nonconvexity of the correlation set, providing effective bounds on an eavesdropper’s knowledge of the shared secret bits. Our theoretical model characterizes the certifiable randomness within the network and is validated through the analysis of experimental data from a photonic quantum network."

The nuclear export protein (NEP) is essential for this process and also regulates viral RNA synthesis, implicating a direct interaction with the viral RNA polymerase. Here, we present a 2.5-Å cryogenic electron microscopy structure of NEP bound to the IAV polymerase and demonstrate that NEP alone is sufficient to promote vRNP export, with the viral matrix protein 1 enhancing export efficiency. NEP forms a four-helix bundle that binds at the interface of the PA C-terminal domain and PB1 N terminus of the polymerase. The NEP binding site at this interface overlaps with those for the host ANP32 and the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, indicating that it functions as a regulatory hotspot coordinating transitions of the viral polymerase between RNA synthesis and nuclear export, revealing a critical layer of control in the IAV replication cycle."

For thermoelectric devices, researchers principally focused on chemical reactivity and mechanical properties of material components, whereas precise control of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) remains elusive. Here, we propose an innovative strategy using negative-thermal-expansion (NTE) particles to regulate CTE and resolve interfacial incompatibility. Incorporating predesigned interface reaction–free NTE particles into Bi2Te3-based, Mg3Sb2-based, and PbTe-based materials effectively improves thermoelectric performance, alleviates thermal stress, and enhances interfacial stability across a broad temperature range (300 to 800 kelvin). Notably, the NTE-modified Mg3(Sb,Bi)2/Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3two-pair module achieves a record-high conversion efficiency (η) of 8.4% at ΔT= 350 K with a 71% interfacial thermal stress reduction, maintaining a stable interface and unchanged η throughout 1000-hour (42 days) thermal cycling. Our strategy establishes a universal approach for improving interfacial compatibility in high-temperature functional modules including thermal-barrier coatings and solar thermophotovoltaic devices."

However, phase architectures are typically fixed once formed, limiting adaptability. Here, we introduce a digital composite with reprogrammable solid-liquid phase architectures at voxel resolution. Each elastomeric voxel contains a liquid metal composite capable of electrically switching between nonvolatile solid and liquid states within seconds, analogous to rewriting data on a hard disk. High-throughput experiments and coupled modeling demonstrate precise tuning of viscoelastic and plastic properties, as well as programmable constitutive behaviors and strain distributions. A modular assembly strategy allows scalable 3D construction of reprogrammable composites into free-form, bulk geometries. By encoding phase states as digital inputs, the composite unlocks unprecedented access to real-time, voxel-level tuning of material properties."

Here, a metabolomic screen in naïve glioblastoma cells treated with dexamethasone revealed the accumulation ofN1-methylnicotinamide, a nicotinamideN-methyltransferase (NNMT) product, through glucocorticoid receptor activation. Using stable isotope-assisted metabolomics in patients with glioblastoma, we showed that nicotinamide conversion intoN1-methylnicotinamide exceeds that into NAD+, leading to a ~7-fold accumulation ofN1-methylnicotinamide in tumor compared to surrounding brain tissue. In orthotopic models, NNMT activity was enhanced by dexamethasone selectively in glioblastoma tumors but not in contralateral brain. Leveraging the tumor-specific activity of NNMT, we developed a novel11C-nicotinamide–based positron emission tomography (PET) approach to visualizing glioblastoma tumors. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that the dexamethasone-induced methionine-dependent nicotinamide methylation becomes detrimental for glioblastoma when combined with a methionine-restricted diet. These results show that steroids rewire methionine and nicotinamide metabolism, enabling the development of innovative PET imaging and metabolic therapies for glioblastoma."

Penadés,Bacteriophages mobilize bacterial defense systems via lateral transduction,"To counter challenges from bacteriophages (phages), bacteria use defense mechanisms that can reside on mobile genetic elements or within chromosomes. These immune systems are easily gained and lost, allowing adaptation to threats. However, the mechanism of mobilization of chromosomally encoded defense genes remains poorly understood. Here, we show that phage- and phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI)–mediated lateral transduction (LT), a highly efficient horizontal gene transfer mechanism, facilitates the transfer of these defense genes between bacteria. Using several bacterial models, we demonstrate that defense systems are often positioned near phage or PICI attachment sites, allowing them to exploit LT for their mobility. In addition, LT diversifies defense genes carried by prophages and PICIs, driving immune system evolution and turnover. These processes provide phage resistance to new bacterial hosts and profoundly affect population genomics. Our findings reveal LT as a crucial mechanism shaping bacterial evolution and influencing the trajectory of pathogenic clones in nature."

CD318 is expressed in myeloid dendritic cells and activated monocytes associated with immunoregulatory functions. Here, selective expression of CD318 on a subset of activated human CD8+T cells, but not CD4+T cells, is shown, defining suppressor function of this cell population. CD318+CD8 T cells exhibited reduced PD-1 and KLRG-1 expression, diminished interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor–α production, and potent suppression of autologous CD4 and CD8 T cell activation in vitro. Notably, CD8 T cells from patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) showed reduced CD318 induction compared with controls. Mechanistically, CD318 inhibited T cell receptor signaling independently of SHP2, while its induction required interleukin-2–dependent mTOR activation. These findings identify CD318 as a marker of human CD8+T cells with implications for immune regulation and autoimmunity."
