Here, we present a new compilation of PM2.5 and PM10 aerosol observations, focusing on the spatial variability across different observational stations, including composition, and demonstrate a method for comparing the data sets to model output. 
 Aerosol particles are an important part of the Earth climate system, and their concentrations are spatially and temporally heterogeneous, as well as being variable in size and composition. Particles can interact with incoming solar radiation and outgoing longwave radiation, change cloud properties, affect photochemistry, impact surface air quality, change the albedo of snow and ice, and modulate carbon dioxide uptake by the land and ocean. High particulate matter concentrations at the surface represent an important public health hazard. There are substantial data sets describing aerosol particles in the literature or in public health databases, but they have not been compiled for easy use by the climate and air quality modeling community. Here, we present a new compilation of PM2.5 and PM10 surface observations, including measurements of aerosol composition, focusing on the spatial variability across different observational stations. Climate modelers are constantly looking for multiple independent lines of evidence to verify their models, and in situ surface concentration measurements, taken at the level of human settlement, present a valuable source of information about aerosols and their human impacts complementarily to the column averages or integrals often retrieved from satellites. We demonstrate a method for comparing the data sets to outputs from global climate models that are the basis for projections of future climate and large-scale aerosol transport patterns that influence local air quality. Annual trends and seasonal cycles are discussed briefly and are included in the compilation. Overall, most of the planet or even the land fraction does not have sufficient observations of surface concentrations – and, especially, particle composition – to characterize and understand the current distribution of particles. Climate models without ammonium nitrate aerosols omit ∼ 10 % of the globally averaged surface concentration of aerosol particles in both PM2.5 and PM10 size fractions, with up to 50 % of the surface concentrations not being included in some regions. In these regions, climate model aerosol forcing projections are likely to be incorrect as they do not include important trends in short-lived climate forcers."
10.5194/acp-25-4703-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要探讨了加拉帕戈斯群岛大气中的一氧化二氮（N2O）浓度变化及其影响因素。通过在加拉帕戈斯排放监测站进行的15个月的连续测量，研究发现N2O的浓度受到季节性信风、局部人为排放以及来自东太平洋海洋排放热点的气团输送的影响。研究特别关注了秘鲁和智利沿海上升流系统作为海洋N2O排放源的作用。虽然论文没有直接提及卫星观测或特定的遥感技术，但其对大气成分（特别是温室气体）的监测和分析与大气环境遥感技术在空气质量监测和大气成分分析方面的应用密切相关。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术具有较强的关联性。,"['nitrous oxide', 'greenhouse gas', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition', 'marine emissions', 'trade winds', 'emission hotspots']",Timur Cinay;Dickon Young;Nazaret Narváez Jimenez;Cristina Vintimilla-Palacios;Ariel Pila Alonso;Paul B. Krummel;William Vizuete;Andrew R. Babbin,Marine emissions and trade winds control the atmospheric nitrous oxide in the Galapagos Islands,"We present the initial 15 months of nitrous oxide measurements from the Galapagos Emissions Monitoring Station. The observed variability in atmospheric mole fractions during this period can be linked to several factors: seasonal variations in trade wind speed and direction across the eastern Pacific, differences in the transport history of air masses sampled, and spatiotemporal heterogeneity in regional marine nitrous oxide emissions from the coastal upwelling systems of Peru and Chile. 
 Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas emitted by oceanic and terrestrial sources, and its biogeochemical cycle is influenced by  both natural processes and anthropogenic activities. Current atmospheric N2O monitoring networks, including tall-tower and flask measurements, often overlook major marine hotspots, such as the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. We present the first 15 months of high-frequency continuous measurements of N2O and carbon monoxide from the newly established Galapagos Emissions Monitoring Station in the region. Over this period, N2O mole fractions vary by approximately 5 ppb, influenced by seasonal trade winds, local anthropogenic emissions, and air masses transported from marine N2O emission hotspots. Notably, between February and April 2024, we observe high variability linked to the southward shift of the intertropical convergence zone and weakened trade winds over the Galapagos Islands. Increased variability during this period is driven by stagnant local winds, which accumulate emissions, and the mixing of air masses with different N2O contents from the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere. The remaining variability is primarily due to differences in air mass transport and heterogeneity in surface fluxes from the eastern tropical Pacific. Air masses passing over the Peruvian and Chilean upwelling systems – key sources of oceanic N2O efflux – show markedly higher N2O mole fractions at the station."

The average classification accuracy based on the validation set exceeded 85 %, and the R2; values for linear fitting with existing statistical data all surpassed 0.9, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed mapping method. 
 In recent years, the demand for rice in Africa has been growing rapidly, and, in order to meet this demand, the rice cultivation area is also expanding rapidly; thus, it is of great significance to monitor the rice cultivation in Africa. The spatial and temporal distribution of rice cultivation in Africa is complex, making it difficult to use phenology-based rice identification methods, and the existing rice distribution products of Africa are all made up of grid-based statistical data with a low resolution, unable to obtain accurate rice field location and available labels. To address these two difficulties, based on time series optical and dual-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, this study proposes a sample set construction method by means of fast-coarse-positioning-assisted visual interpretation and a feature-importance-guided supervised classification combining multiple temporal optical and SAR features to reduce the impact of rice diversity in Africa. Firstly, we use the time series statistical features of vertical transmit, horizontal receive (VH) data for fast coarse positioning and screening of possible rice areas and combine multiple auxiliary data for visual interpretation to construct the sample set; secondly, based on the complementary information in SAR data and optical data, the 20 m Africa rice distribution map of 2023 was completed by combining the object-oriented segmentation results of temporal optical images and the pixel-based classification results of temporal SAR data features after feature selection. The average classification accuracy of the proposed method for the validation set is more than 85 %, and the R2 of the linear fit to various existing statistical data is more than 0.9, which proves that the proposed method can achieve the spatial distribution mapping of rice under complex climatic conditions in a large region, providing crucial data support for rice monitoring and agricultural policy development.

However, the potential of GPS data has been limited by its partially fragmented availability and unreliable metadata. A new dataset, which spans the period from 1995 to 2021, offers consistently processed coordinate time series for 286 GPS sites and promises to enhance future geodynamic research. 
 For nearly 3 decades, geodetic Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements in Antarctica have provided direct observations of bedrock displacement, which is linked to various geodynamic processes, including plate motion, post-seismic deformation, and glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). Previous geodynamic studies in Antarctica, especially those pertaining to GIA, have been constrained by the limited availability of GNSS data. This is due to the fact that GNSS data are collected by a wide range of institutions and network operators, with the raw observational data either not publicly available or scattered across various repositories. Further, the metadata necessary for rigorous data processing have often not been available or reliable. Consequently, the potential of GNSS observations for geodynamic studies in Antarctica has not been fully exploited yet. Here, we present consistently processed coordinate time series for GNSS sites in Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic region for the time span from 1995 to 2021. The data set is composed of 286 continuous and episodic sites, with 258 sites having a time span longer than 3 years. The coordinate time series were obtained from a combination of four independent processing solutions using different GNSS software and products, allowing the identification of inconsistencies in individual solutions. From these, we infer a reliable and robust combined solution. A key issue was the thorough reassessment of station metadata to minimise artefacts and biases in the coordinate time series. The resulting data set provides coordinate time series with unprecedented spatiotemporal coverage, promising significant advancements in future geodynamic studies in Antarctica. The data set is freely available at  https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.967515 (Buchta et al., 2024a)."

Agricultural fires dominated emissions, while forest and grassland emissions decreased. Seasonal peaks occurred in late spring, with hotspots in northeast, southwest, and east China. The model emphasizes the importance of using localized emission factors and high-resolution fire estimates for accurate assessments. 
 During the past decades, wildfires have undergone rapid changes while both the extent of fire activities and the resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from wildfires in China have remained inadequately quantified. We established a wildfire emission model to generate the China Wildfire Emission Dataset (ChinaWED), which can be used to explore the recent dynamics at a national scale. This dataset is constructed at a monthly and kilometer scale under a consistent and quantifiable calculation framework, providing average annual estimates of wildfire-induced GHG emissions of 78.13 ± 22.46 Tg CO2, 279.47 ± 82.01 Gg CH4, and 6.26 ± 1.67 Gg N2O (Tg denotes teragrams and Gg gigagrams) for the past decade. We observed significant decreases in both wildfire occurrences and emissions within forests and grasslands. This trend, however, is counteracted by variations in agricultural fires, which constitute the primary type of fire, accounting for at least half of the national total fire emissions. The seasonal cycle of wildfire GHG emissions shows an evident apex that occurs during the transition from mid-spring to early summer. At the regional scale, northeast China, southwest China, and east China emerge as hotspots of wildfire-induced emissions. Our study offers new insights into China's wildfire dynamics and provides a detailed regional model for wildfire greenhouse gas emissions over China."

Yet, compared to established culture- or PCR-based techniques, metagenomic approaches for these purposes are rarely benchmarked or contextualized for practice. We performed shotgun sequencing experiments (n = 35) of mesocosms constructed from the water of a well-studied recreational and drinking water reservoir spiked with various fecal (n = 6 animal sources, 3 wastewater sources, and 1 septage source) and synthetic microbiome spike-ins (n = 1) introduced at predetermined cell concentrations to simulate fecal pollution events of known composition. We built source-associated genome databases using publicly available reference genomes and metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) recovered from short- and long-read sequencing of the fecal spike-ins, and then created an associated bioinformatic tool, called SourceApp, for inferring source attribution and apportionment by mapping the metagenomic data to these genome databases. SourceApp’s performance varied substantially by source, with cows being underestimated due to under sampling of cow fecal microbiomes. Parameter tuning revealed sensitivity and specificity near 0.90 overall, which exceeded all alternative tools. SourceApp can assist researchers with analyzing and interpreting shotgun sequencing data and developing standard operating procedures on the frontiers of metagenomic FST."

This study explores OA composition, sources, and atmospheric transformations in Beijing before and during the coal ban using online aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) and offline 14C measurements. Four primary factors (hydrocarbon-like, cooking, biomass burning, coal combustion OA) and one secondary factor (oxygenated OA, OOA) were resolved from ACSM. In response to the coal ban, OA concentrations generally decreased, but coal combustion OA decreased most strongly, consistent with the decreased fossil carbon contributions to OA (67 ± 3% before vs 55 ± 4% during the ban). Concurrently, the OOA fraction increased from 45 to 72%, due to a larger decrease in  concentrations of primary OA (POA; 59–88%)  compared to OOA (34%), highlighting the enhanced secondary aerosol formation during the coal ban period. This aligns with the 14C evidence of higher water-soluble carbon in fossil OA (which has mostly secondary sources). During the coal ban period, Ox concentrations doubled and were positively correlated with the OOA fraction, highlighting strong photochemical OA production. The results show that the reduction of POA from stringent clean air actions is partially offset by enhanced secondary OA formation."

This study addresses critical knowledge gaps regarding the ecotoxicological effects of TWP-derived contaminants, N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD) and its precursor, 6PPD-quinone (6PPD-Q), on soil-dwelling organisms. The findings demonstrated that 6PPD-Q accumulated at a higher concentration (6.77 ± 0.124 ng/g) in earthworms (Eisenia fetida) compared to 6PPD (5.41 ± 0.002 ng/g), triggering more severe oxidative stress and cellular homeostatic imbalance. Specifically, 100 ng/g of 6PPD-Q in soil significantly elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels by 180.77% and suppressed acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and Ca2+-ATPase activities by 17.14% and 44.70%, respectively. Notably, 6PPD-Q uniquely disrupted the nitrogen balance and disturbed energy supply by strongly inhibiting fatty acid degradation and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathways. Additionally, 6PPD-Q profoundly altered the abundance of key microbes and microbial network stability, affecting intestinal microbial functions such as bile secretion, hormone synthesis, and lipid digestion, thus exacerbating the energy metabolic imbalance in earthworms. This study deciphers the molecular toxicity mechanisms of TWP-derived contaminants in earthworms, providing crucial insights for developing risk assessment frameworks and mitigation strategies in soil ecosystems."

Applying a nontargeted analysis (NTA) approach, we sought to isolate occupationally related chemical exposures that were unique to nurses by flagging features that were different from office workers in abundance (mean; 95th percentile) or detection frequency. Of 9828 negative electrospray ionization (ESI-) and 6898 positive electrospray ionization (ESI+) detected chemical features, 1094 and 938, respectively, were higher in nurses, possibly due to workplace exposures. We deciphered the molecular structures of these chemical features by applying data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and targeted MS/MS approaches to pooled samples from each occupational group, and we annotated them using spectral MS/MS databases in MS-DIAL. Nurses had higher concentrations of 14 chemicals that we identified at Schymanski Level 1 (N = 6) or 2 (N = 8), as well as 20 tentatively identified chemicals without spectra. Several chemicals may be occupationally relevant for nurses, including a PFAS (6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid), tridecanedioic acid, salicylic acid, and the medications acetaminophen and theophylline.

Previous studies have demonstrated the adverse effects of pesticide exposure on lipid metabolism. However, population studies have focused primarily on individual pesticides and have short-term fluctuations, and the animal experiments used doses far higher than those exposed by the general population. In this study, urinary concentrations of metabolites of three classes of pesticides, including organophosphate, pyrethroid, and phenoxy carboxylic acid, were determined in 1858 participants of repeated cross-sectional biomonitoring programs from 2018 to 2022. We comprehensively analyzed the association of pesticide metabolites and pesticide exposure patterns with lipid metabolism biomarkers. The indirect effects of liver function markers in these associations were explored by using the structural equation model analysis. Generalized linear models showed that 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol and para-nitrophenol were positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride. In contrast, 3-phenoxybenzoic acid was negatively correlated with apolipoprotein B. Quantile g-computation and Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression showed a consistent gradual increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels but a gradual decrease in apolipoprotein B levels with increasing exposure to pesticide mixtures. By analyzing the exposure patterns of different categories of pesticides, we found that the population has a high level of exposure to organophosphate pesticides, which disrupts lipid metabolism more significantly than other pesticides. Liver function exhibited significant mediating effects in the association between pesticide exposure and lipid metabolism biomarkers. The results indicated that pesticide exposure was significantly associated with lipid metabolism, and this association may be modulated by improvements in liver function."

Here, we report that intact hydrophobic crystalline talc was mechanochemically changed into hydrophilic talc, by comminution using high‐energy ball milling. The weight fraction of water on the intact talc was close to zero, which gradually increased to approximately 0.13 with comminution. Then, we performed thermo‐mechanical‐chemical numerical modeling of thermal pressurization (TP) under seismic slip with parameterization of the water content of hydrophilic talc. In the comminuted hydrophilic talc model, the effective shear stress of the talc‐bearing fault patch converges to near zero, accompanied by pore pressure buildup due to seismic frictional heating and TP.

We find that the AMOC strength measured at OSNAP is not related to the variability of the AMOC strength at mid‐latitudes. Instead, our study reveals that the density at which the maximum overturning occurs at OSNAP is a key precursor of the mid‐latitude AMOC strength.

However, individual events strongly differ from each other. They can develop into a basin‐wide El Niño (as in 2023) or stay confined to the South American coast (as in 2017). The large event‐to‐event variability in combination with the rarity of events in the observational record limits our understanding of Coastal Niños. The Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble Project (CESM‐LE) simulates Coastal Niños realistically, including their phase‐locking to boreal spring and variable evolution. Conditions in the subtropical Pacific, equatorial wave dynamics and western tropical Pacific wind anomalies are identified as factors important for the evolution of Coastal Niños in the CESM‐LE. Coastal Niños in turn increase the probability of a basin‐wide El Niño in the following months."

Auroral emissions have also been observed at Venus, an unmagnetized planet, by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter (PVO) and ground‐based telescopes. By applying a linear relation, this study predicts the possible CO Cameron‐band emission brightness at Venus using electron observations from Venus Express (VEx). Our results suggest that to produce the PVO observations, electron acceleration is not required as in the case of discrete aurorae at magnetized planets; rather, the magnetic access of precipitating electrons to the lower atmosphere is the more limiting factor for auroral occurrence. This study helps better understand how aurorae can occur at an unmagnetized planet, in contrast to magnetized planets. It also has implications for future Venus mission design: auroral imaging can serve as a remote sensing tool to characterize the magnetization state of the Venus nightside atmosphere."

However, it also results in a weakening in mean atmospheric flow, thus facilitating a dryness across the ASM region (the dynamic effect). Therefore, the ultimate change in ASM precipitation stems from the balance of both the thermodynamic and dynamic effects. This study further examines the impact of rising CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ on ASM rainfall, by taking into account various climate states. Our results suggest that an increase in CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ during warm interglacial periods has a stronger influence from thermodynamic factors than from dynamic factors, resulting in an enhancement in ASM rainfall. In contrast, if CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ increases under cold glacial climate backgrounds, its dynamic impact dominates a reduction of rainfall in most ASM region."

Based on geostrophic balance, the so‐called geostrophic velocity in SWOT is estimated. Although the SWOT‐derived velocity is not true geostrophic velocity as it does not consider the separation of balanced and unbalanced motions, it offers valuable insights into both geostrophic and ageostrophic velocities. Here we propose a machine learning‐based model to infer the SSV using SWOT and drifter data. The result demonstrates the error between the geostrophic velocities from SWOT and the total velocities from the drifter are reduced by about 50%. Furthermore, the kinetic energy of inferred velocities aligns more closely with reanalysis data, particularly at low latitudes.

We interpret these mantle reflections as a fossil subduction zone within the eastern Yangtze Craton, which was probably linked with a buried Paleoproterozoic orogen beneath the Xuefengshan belt. Hence the Yangtze Craton should be formed by the collision or accretion of microcontinents prior to the Neoproterozoic.

Aerosol‐coupled simulations show that high aerosols activate more fog droplets during the formative stages and increase the longwave cooling. Cooling affects supersaturation and enhances the condensational growth of the fog droplets. This aerosol‐longwave cooling‐condensational growth relationship enhances fog water content during nighttime.

Results demonstrated that water‐retention capacity is more effective in relatively arid regions, whereas cooling capacity is more pronounced in humid regions, with both effects being largely season‐dependent. In addition, green space proportion significantly influences the relationship between AI and retention‐cooling performances, particularly for cooling capacity, which exhibits opposite trends between cold and warm seasons. Future projection analysis indicate that climate change scenarios could significantly alter retention‐cooling performances, potentially leading to notable deviations from the patterns observed during the historical periods across different climate zones, with an increasing dependence on changes in local climatic conditions.

SIFI detects both stress-indicators and stress response components through flexible domains within an easily accessible scaffold, before building linkage-specific ubiquitin chains at separate, sterically restricted elongation modules. Ubiquitin handover by a ubiquitin-like domain couples versatile substrate modification to linkage-specific ubiquitin polymer formation.

 Deep ocean circulation modulated glacial–interglacial climates through feedbacks to the carbon cycle and energy distribution. Past work has suggested that contraction of well-ventilated North Atlantic Deep Water during glacial times facilitated carbon storage in the deep ocean and drawdown of atmospheric CO2 levels. However, the spatial extent and properties of different water masses remain uncertain, in part due to conflicting palaeoceanographic proxy reconstructions. Here we combine five independent proxies to increase confidence and reconstruct Atlantic deep water distributions during the Last Glacial Maximum (around 21 thousand years ago) and the following Heinrich Stadial 1—a time when massive ice rafting in the North Atlantic interfered with deep water formation and caused global climate shifts. We find that North Atlantic Deep Water remained widespread in both periods, although its properties shifted from a cold, well-ventilated mode to a less-ventilated, possibly warmer, mode. This finding implies a remarkable persistence of deep water formation under these cold boundary conditions, sustained by compensation between the two formation modes. Our constraints provide an important benchmark for evaluating Earth system models, which can enhance confidence in future climate projections.

Here, the authors show that impaired ketogenesis in Leydig cells drives testicular aging, and boosting ketogenesis or supplementing with the ketone body BHB can help mitigate testicular aging. 
 Testicular aging commonly leads to testosterone deficiency and impaired spermatogenesis, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that Leydig cells are particularly vulnerable to aging processes in testis. Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies the expression of Hmgcs2, the gene encoding rate-limiting enzyme of ketogenesis, decreases significantly in Leydig cells from aged mice. Additionally, the concentrations of ketone bodies β-hydroxybutyric acid and acetoacetic acid in young testes are substantially higher than that in serum, but significantly diminish in aged testes. Silencing of Hmgcs2 in young Leydig cells drives cell senescence and accelerated testicular aging. Mechanistically, β-hydroxybutyric acid upregulates the expression of Foxo3a by facilitating histone acetylation, thereby mitigating Leydig cells senescence and promoting testosterone production. Consistently, enhanced ketogenesis by genetic manipulation or oral β-hydroxybutyric acid supplementation alleviates Leydig cells senescence and ameliorates testicular aging in aged mice. These findings highlight defective ketogenesis as a pivotal factor in testicular aging, suggesting potential therapeutic avenues for addressing age-related testicular dysfunction.

 Interlayer magnetic interactions play a pivotal role in determining the magnetic arrangement within van der Waals (vdW) magnets, and the remarkable tunability of these interactions through applied pressure further enhances their significance. Here, we investigate NiI2 flakes, a representative vdW magnet, under hydrostatic pressures up to 11 GPa. We reveal a notable increase in magnetic transition temperatures for both helimagnetic and antiferromagnetic states, and find that a reversible transition between helimagnetic and antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases at approximately 7 GPa challenges established theoretical and experimental expectations. While the increase in transition temperature aligns with pressure-enhanced overall exchange interaction strengths, we identify the significant role of the second-nearest neighbor interlayer interaction

 Current Aβ-targeting therapeutics for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) only slow cognitive decline due to poor understanding of AD pathogenesis. Here we describe a mechanism of AD pathogenesis in which the histone methyltransferase G9a noncanonically regulates translation of hippocampal proteins associated with AD pathology. Correspondingly, we developed a brain-penetrant inhibitor of G9a, MS1262, which restored both age-related learning & memory and noncognitive functions in multiple AD mouse models. Further, comparison of AD pathology-correlated mouse proteomes with those of AD patients found G9a regulates pathological pathways that promote Aβ and neurofibrillary tangles. This mouse-to-human overlap of G9a regulated AD-associated pathologic proteins supports at the molecular level the efficacy of targeting G9a translational mechanism for treating AD patients. Additionally, MS1262 treatment reversed the AD-characteristic expression or phosphorylation of multiple clinically validated biomarkers of AD that have the potential to be used for early-stage AD diagnosis and companion diagnosis of individualized drug effects.

 Long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) are increasingly recognized as being involved in human physiology and diseases, but there is a lack of mechanistic understanding for the majority of lncRNAs. We comparatively test proposed mechanisms of antisense lncRNA regulation at the X-chromosome Inactivation (XCI) locus. We find that due to stochasticity in transcription, different mechanisms based on the act of transcription regulate Xist and Tsix at different levels of nascent transcription. At medium levels, RNA polymerases transcribe Xist and Tsix on each strand at the same transcription site and deposit significant amounts of the histone mark H3K36me3, which inhibits Xist. At high levels of nascent transcription, many RNA polymerases transcribe Xist or Tsix resulting in transcriptional interference. Therefore, lncRNA expression variability is not just a quirk of transcription but an important aspect of regulation that allows multiple mechanisms to be employed by the same gene locus within the same cell population. This study reveals how stochastic transcription regulates Xist and Tsix through multiple mechanisms. Using single-cell imaging, the authors demonstrate that transcriptional interference occurs at high expression levels, while histone modifications regulate Xist at medium levels."

 Flexible thermoelectric devices enable direct energy conversion between heat and electrical energy, making them ideal for wearable electronics and personal thermal management. Yet, current devices lack functional module expansion, which limits the customization for diverse energy-harvesting heat sources and complicates their assembly to meet the specific power requirements of electrical appliances. Moreover, existing devices cannot be stacked to enhance thermoelectric cooling performance while maintaining flexibility and self-healing capabilities. Here, by selectively encapsulating liquid metal electrodes with carbon nanotube-doped self-healing materials with increased thermal conductivity, we substantially improve heat transfer across thermoelectric legs, thereby maximizing energy conversion efficiency. The device achieves a normalized power density of 3.14 μW⋅cm−2 ⋅ K−2, setting a benchmark for self-healing thermoelectric devices. Benefiting from self-healing materials and liquid metal, the device demonstrates both self-healing capabilities and modular assembly, greatly expanding the application scenarios of flexible thermoelectric devices in wearable power generation and refrigeration.

 The Sudan virus (SUDV) outbreaks in Uganda in 2022 and 2025 created public health concerns in-country and the entire East African region. There are currently no licensed countermeasures against SUDV. We developed a SUDV vaccine candidate based on a nanocarrier (LIONTM) complexed with an alphavirus-based replicon RNA. Here, we compare the protective efficacy of the LION-SUDV vaccine either encoding the SUDV glycoprotein (GP) alone or in combination with the Ebola virus (EBOV) GP (LION-Combination). A LION-EBOV vaccine which is protective against EBOV was also included to determine the potential for cross-protection against SUDV infection. Single-dose vaccinations were conducted three weeks before challenge with a lethal dose of guinea pig-adapted SUDV using a female guinea pig disease model. We demonstrate 100% survival and protection with the LION-SUDV and the LION-Combination vaccines, while the LION-EBOV vaccine achieved 50% protection. Antigen-specific humoral responses correlate with decreased virus replication and survival.

 Metabolic reprogramming of amino acids represents a vulnerability in cancer cells, yet the mechanisms underlying serine metabolism in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and leukemia stem/initiating cells (LSCs/LICs) remain unclear. Here, we identify RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification as a key regulator of serine biosynthesis in AML. Using a CRISPR/Cas9 screen, we find that depletion of m6A regulators IGF2BP3 or METTL14 sensitizes AML cells to serine and glycine (SG) deprivation. IGF2BP3 recognizies m6A on mRNAs of key serine synthesis pathway (SSP) genes (e.g., ATF4, PHGDH, PSAT1), stabilizing these transcripts and sustaining serine production to meet the high metabolic demand of AML cells and LSCs/LICs. IGF2BP3 silencing combined with dietary SG restriction potently inhibits AML in vitro and in vivo, while its deletion spares normal hematopoiesis. Our findings reveal the critical role of m6A modification in the serine metabolic vulnerability of AML and highlight the IGF2BP3/m6A/SSP axis as a promising therapeutic target.

 The transition to more sustainable diets is critical to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and meet the Paris Agreement commitments. In China, this transition is particularly urgent due to the double burden of malnutrition and environmental degradation. In this study, we explored the potential of alternative diets in China to enhance public health, ensure food affordability and reduce adverse environmental impacts. We assessed these patterns through a multi-objective diet optimization model combined with an agro-economic modelling framework that captures key socio-economic and biophysical dynamics in China. The proposed healthy, affordable and low-environmental-impact diets substantially improve dietary quality and are projected to reduce food expenditures by 20–28% (US$128–186 capita−1 in power purchasing parities of 2005) by 2050. These diets also bring environmental benefits, including a 3–11% (4–13 Mha) expansion of non-forest natural vegetation area and modest biodiversity gains by 2050, a 9–40% (3–13 Gt CO2-equivalent) reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a 5–12% (347–772 km3) decrease in freshwater withdrawals between 2020 and 2050.

 The changing character of mid-latitude cold air outbreaks in a warming climate remains unclear, primarily due to uncertainty associated with changing atmospheric dynamics. Here, we employ an event-based storyline approach in which the evolution of the large-scale atmospheric circulation is nudged to reanalysis data at different global warming levels based on historical and medium-to-high-emission scenario simulations. We thereby quantify the thermodynamic climate-change effects of pre-industrial, 2 °C and 4 °C warmer climates compared to present-day climate for three cold surges in East Asia during winter 2020/21. The strongest warming occurs over northeast Asia, reaching up to +12 °C in a + 4 °C warmer climate and caused by the advection of less cold air from winter ice-free regions in the Arctic, where surface air temperature increases by over +20 °C. In contrast, over southern China, a moderate cooling is found from pre-industrial to present-day climates, due to the observed increase in aerosol concentration, peaking by the mid-21st century and altering radiative balances. This cooling effect is likely to persist well into a + 2 °C-warmer climate; however, it may become undetectable at the end of the 21st century (+4 °C warming). Our findings underscore the important thermodynamic impact associated with Arctic amplification and cooling effect of aerosol-induced changes in the radiation budget under a high aerosol emission scenario on East Asian cold extremes."

 We report the drivers of spatiotemporal variability of ice nucleating particles (INPs) for mixed-phase orographic clouds (~−25 °C) in the Eastern Mediterranean. In the planetary boundary layer, pronounced INP diurnal periodicity is observed, which is mainly driven by biological (and to a lesser extent, dust) particles but not aerosols from biomass burning. The comparison of size-resolved and fluorescence-discriminated aerosol particle properties with INPs reveals the primary role of fluorescent bioaerosol. The presence of Saharan dust increases INPs during nighttime more than daytime, because of lower boundary layer height during nighttime which decreases the contribution of aerosols (including bioaerosols) from the boundary layer. INP diurnal periodicity is absent in the free troposphere, although levels are driven by the availability of bioaerosol and dust particles. Given the effective ice nucleation ability of bioaerosols and subsequent effects from ice multiplication at warm temperatures, the lack of such cycles in models points to important and overlooked drivers of cloud formation and precipitation in mountainous regions."

 As global change reshapes ecosystems, establishing conservation priorities is crucial for managing threatened areas with limited resources. Biodiversity hotspots, often defined by high endemism, are key in conservation management. However, these may not capture other dimensions of biodiversity, including functional and phylogenetic diversity or knowledge from Indigenous communities. Here, we demonstrate that different metrics identify different hotspots using simulated plant communities as a case study. We compiled existing data on 318 plant species, including functional trait data and Traditional Ecological Knowledge on Indigenous plant names and uses. We simulated 100,000 communities by randomly assembling species that naturally co-occur within an ecoregion, and calculated taxonomic, phylogenetic, functional, and Traditional Ecological Knowledge-based biodiversity metrics. The metrics cluster into two groups based on shared hotspot identification, with phylogenetic and functional metrics distributed between groups, and Traditional Ecological Knowledge-based metrics aligning with some metrics, but not all. This suggests that integrating Traditional Ecological Knowledge into conservation planning can expand the scope of biodiversity assessments and help recognize places of cultural significance that might otherwise be overlooked.

 We compare five daily MODIS-derived snow albedo products to terrain-corrected, in situ data from sites in California and Colorado, USA, and to snow albedo derived from airborne hyperspectral imagery over several basins in California and Colorado. The MODIS-derived products we consider are NASA standard products MOD10A1, MCD43A3, and MCD19A3D, along with STC-MODSCAG/MODDRFS and MODIS SPIReS. These products vary in their retrieval algorithms, including whether, for mixed pixels, they represent the albedo of snow within the pixel or the albedo of the whole pixel. When compared to in situ data, STC-MODSCAG/MODDRFS and SPIReS products have the highest accuracy (RMSE ≤0.093) and most spatially and temporally complete data records (∼99 %) because the algorithms each have independently developed gap filling and interpolation methods. The MOD10A1 and MCD43A3 products underestimate snow albedo (RMSE ≤0.248) because they incorporate non-snow land surfaces into their calculations and have less complete data records (∼76 %) due to less accurate snow detection and lack of interpolation. The MCD19A3D product has accuracy similar to STC-MODSCAG/MODDRFS and SPIReS (RMSE = 0.090) but the lowest data completeness of all datasets (56 %). We found similar performance trends when comparing the MODIS products to airborne hyperspectral data. Our analysis shows algorithms that account for fractional snow cover and incorporate all available spectral information result in the best snow albedo products across time and space. Similar algorithms applied to hyperspectral data can better resolve spectral features to retrieve optical properties of snow; hence we can expect improvements in snow albedo retrievals from future hyperspectral satellite missions."

 Style transfer has emerged as a prominent technique for transferring stylistic elements between images (e.g., a reference image and a map). However, current methods face two challenges when applied to create image maps, especially when the reference image and map are not spatially aligned (e.g., covering different regions). These challenges include aligning the semantic elements between maps and remote sensing images, and then balancing the photorealistic textures with cartographic symbolism to maintain cartographic quality. To address these challenges, we propose a flexible style transfer method from remote sensing images to maps, relaxing the requirement of strict spatial alignment between remote sensing images and maps. Our approach enables the generation of image maps with adjustable stylistic results, offering a balance between photorealism and symbolization. First, we analyze the semantic of the input map and the reference imagery including semantic classes and semantic relationships encoded by colors. Then we implement hierarchical control and parameter interpolation to enable style matching. We also compare the transfer results of our method to those of the baseline image style transfer methods across four aspects including visual similarity, graphic discriminability, semantic consistency, and overall readability. The evaluations show that our approach significantly enhances cartographic quality by flexibly balancing photorealism and symbolization, while offering the flexibility to generate image maps with varying preferences."

 Addressing the challenges of climate change requires accurate and high-resolution mapping of geospatial data, especially climate and weather variables. However, many existing geospatial datasets, such as the gridded outputs of the state-of-the-art numerical climate models (e.g., general circulation models), are only available at very coarse spatial resolutions due to the model complexity and extremely high computational demand. Deep-learning-based methods, particularly generative adversarial networks (GANs) and their variants, have proved effective for refining natural images and have shown great promise in improving geospatial datasets. This paper describes a conditional GAN-based stochastic geospatial downscaling method that can accommodate large scaling factors. Compared to most existing methods, the method can generate high-resolution accurate climate datasets from very low-resolution inputs. More importantly, the method explicitly considers the uncertainty inherent to the downscaling process that tends to be ignored in existing methods. Given an input, the method can produce a multitude of plausible high-resolution samples instead of one single deterministic result. These samples allow for an empirical exploration and inferences of model uncertainty and robustness. With a case study of gridded climate datasets (wind velocity and solar irradiance), we demonstrate the performances of the framework in downscaling tasks with large scaling factors (up to 64×) and highlight the advantages of the framework with a comprehensive comparison with commonly used and most recent downscaling methods, including area-to-point (ATP) kriging, deep image prior (DIP), enhanced super-resolution generative adversarial networks (ESRGAN), physics-informed resolution-enhancing GAN (PhIRE GAN), and an efficient diffusion model for remote sensing image super-resolution (EDiffSR)."

 Unsaturated alcohols with two functional groups (C=C and OH), such as prenol, are gaining attention as potential second-generation biofuels. As demand for sustainable energy sources grows, increased use of prenol in biofuel applications could lead to additional atmospheric emissions contributing to secondary pollution and affecting air quality. As the OH radical is the major oxidant during daytime and is highly reactive toward organic compounds, the OH-initiated oxidation of prenol needs to be investigated. Therefore, the reaction of prenol with OH was studied in the atmospheric simulation chamber THALAMOS (THermally Regulated Atmospheric Simulation Chamber), under atmospheric pressure and in the temperature range 273–353 K. The temperature-dependent rate coefficient, measured by the relative method, follows the Arrhenius equation: kprenol+OH(273−353K)=(1.43±0.28)×10−11×exp(691±59T) cm3 molecule−1 s−1. Our results were combined with literature data determined under combustion relevant temperatures, to provide the following expression: kprenol+OH(273−1290K)=1.46×10−10 ×(T300)−2.18 + 1.14 ×10−10 ×exp(−2961T) cm3 molecule−1 s−1 which covers a wide range of temperatures under atmospheric, but also cold (273–353 K) and traditional combustion conditions (900–1290 K). In addition to kinetic measurements, the reaction mechanism was investigated through product analysis. The major oxidation products, formed predominantly via the OH addition pathway, were acetone with a yield of 97 %, glycolaldehyde, and formaldehyde, with minor traces of 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanal. The H-atom abstraction was found to be less significant (<3 %), leading primarily to the formation of prenal. These findings were further supported by structure–activity relationship(SAR) calculations, which estimated the rate coefficient at room temperature and confirmed that the reaction proceeds mainly (∼97 %) via OH addition to the C=C double bond of prenol. To our knowledge, this work is the first determination of the Arrhenius equation over the temperature range 273–353 K for the reaction between prenol and hydroxyl radical."

 Methane emissions reduction has become a high priority due to its tractability relative to other greenhouse gases, and the potential for climate and air-quality benefits. However, regional methane sources have been difficult to ascertain, with discrepancies between top-down and bottom-up estimates. We combined mobile surveys with continuous atmospheric measurements at two fixed locations (one urban and one rural) in the southern San Joaquin Valley of California, USA, using ethane:methane (C2:C1) content and stable carbon isotope ratio (δ13CH4) as tracers for source type. In 6483 km of road surveys conducted over five field campaigns, 108 methane source events from 74 unique locations were sampled. C2:C1 was characteristically low for dairies and wastewater facilities, but was also near zero for many oil and gas sources, notably within a northeastern arc of high-density oil and gas fields. Natural gas sources within the Bakersfield urban area fell consistently within 2.3–4.2 % C2:C1. δ13CH4 was effective at separating dairy (−51.6 ± 3.1 ‰), wastewater (−45.4 ± 3.2 ‰), and thermogenic natural gas (−42.9 ± 1.8 ‰) sources. Oil and gas production sources were less consistent, with 50 % of observations within −45.8 to −42.7 ‰ (median: 43.8 ‰), but with the largest spans of δ13CH4 and C2:C1. The urban location experienced frequent methane enhancements attributed to both thermogenic and biogenic origins, whereas methane enhancements at the rural location enhancements were almost exclusively attributed to biogenic sources. Our results demonstrate considerable utility of diagnostic ethane and δ13CH4 measurements in partitioning several methane source types, with the caveat that oil and gas sources may contain wide-ranging C2:C1 and δ13CH4 due to thermal maturities and secondary processes (microbial and oxidation)."

 Plant litter could be a potential source of atmospheric volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Previous studies are mostly restricted to forest litter, but VOC budget of wetlands resulting from litter decomposition remains largely unexplored. Here we performed in-situ VOC flux measurements in a freshwater wetland and three treatments including A (no litter addition), B (1.15 kg litter m−2) and C (2.30 kg litter m−2) were designed to investigate impacts of litter decomposition on wetland-atmosphere exchange of VOCs. During year-round observation, average fluxes of net VOCs for B and C were 5.14 ± 2.75 μg m−2 h−1 and 7.85 ± 3.80 μg m−2 h−1, respectively, significantly higher than that of A (2.13 ± 2.41 μg m−2 h−1). These results suggested that freshwater wetlands were potential sources of atmospheric VOCs and that litter decomposition could enhance VOC release. The net VOC flux exhibited distinct seasonal patterns and was correlated with ambient temperature (p < 0.05). Moreover, the release or uptake of VOCs varied among different chemical groups. Specifically, non-methane hydrocarbons including alkanes, alkenes and aromatics showed positive net fluxes that increased with added litter. Halocarbons exhibited a negative net flux in A, but positive net fluxes in B and C. Oxygenated VOCs demonstrated negative net fluxes in both A and B, but switched to a positive flux in C. Positive net fluxes of volatile organic sulfide compounds were observed in three treatments. Based on the flux variations of specific VOC groups, our findings suggest that both temperature-dependent biotic and abiotic processes regulated the exchange of VOCs between freshwater wetland and atmosphere."

 Exposure to carcinogenic elongated mineral particles (EMPs), such as erionite, found in rocks and released into the air by construction, quarrying, or roading activities, poses a significant possible health risk due to their respirable size and potential for airborne dispersion. The detection of EMPs in the air is typically achieved by filter sampling and subsequent examination using a range of microscopic methods, including phase contrast microscopy (PCM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Such analyzes require the manual searching for fibers through many image fields and are both labor-intensive and time-consuming. Moreover, these methods do not result in conclusive particle identification, limiting their effectiveness in large-scale monitoring programmes. This paper introduces a novel methodology for the automated detection and quantification of EMPs using an automated SEM with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to identify fibers on pre-sampled polycarbonate (PC) filters. This method provides a streamlined workflow for fiber identification based on their size, morphology, and elemental composition. Performance evaluation (PE) standards were prepared by spiking filters with a series of known concentrations of one EMP, namely erionite, and fiber concentrations were measured using the automated SEM-EDS approach. Our results demonstrate a linear relationship (R2 = 0.98∗∗∗) between the erionite mass percentage in a bulk sample and the fiber counts in an aerosolized air volume, with a detection limit of 7.4 f/cc. The approach can be optimized based on the time available for analysis and the choice of detection limit suitable for the specific site and application. Additionally, the automated SEM-EDS method has been applied to real-world air samples collected from Auckland, New Zealand, showing promising results for fiber detection in complex environmental matrices."

Air pollutant mixture (NO2, NOx, PM2.5, PM10, and PM2.5-10) was estimated using a Land Use Regression model and converted into a joint air pollution score. Cox proportional-hazard models were used to examine their associations with death outcomes.ResultsDuring a median follow-up of 11.99 years, deaths due to all-cause, all-cancer, CVD, respiratory disease were 24,264, 12,602, 4903, and 1680, respectively. Per PA-level increment was associated with lower risk of all-cause, all-cancer, CVD, and respiratory disease death, with hazard ratios of 0.86 (0.84–0.87), 0.91 (0.89–0.93), 0.86 (0.82–0.89) and 0.70 (0.66–0.75), respectively. However, an interquartile increment in air pollutant mixture was associated with higher risk of the above death outcomes. Notably, PA's effect on decreasing mortality risk remained relatively robust across all strata of air pollutant mixture. The combination of high PA and lowest air pollutant mixture reduced mortality risk by 37%, 24%, 41% and 64% from all-cause, all-cancer, CVD, and respiratory disease, respectively.ConclusionsAt all levels of air pollutant mixture, PA was inversely related with mortality risk. PA might still be an appropriate strategy to lower all-cause and cause-specific mortality risk, even for individuals exposed to high-level air pollution in the UK."

 This study investigates the advantages of employing a nested High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model for simulating highly localized heavy rainfall events over the Indian Himalayan region, characterized by a complex terrain. Accurate weather prediction in such a region necessitates a model configuration that resolves the underlying terrain features, incorporates optimal physics combinations, and assimilates the most precise atmospheric state. A nested HRRR system with 5 km and 1 km resolutions was developed, incorporating all available quality observations through an hourly assimilation cycle. Three rainfall episodes from July–August 2023 were analyzed, focusing on spatial rainfall, diurnal variations, dynamic, thermodynamic, and microphysical properties. This nested HRRR system could effectively capture the rainfall intensity and location, as it is better tuned to the realistic atmospheric conditions through frequent assimilation of observations, and thereby, the dynamics and thermodynamics are modified. However, a lead or lag of 1–2 h is observed in the diurnal rainfall variation in both domains. The quantitative model evaluation for rainfall, using various statistical skill scores, demonstrates the better performance of the 1 km domain, emphasizing the impact of higher resolution and frequent updates to initial conditions on the high-impact weather simulation accuracy. The spatial verification with the Contiguous Rain Area (CRA) analysis method reveals that pattern errors dominate over displacement errors and highlights improved spatial accuracy. Overall, the comparison between the 5 km and 1 km domains underscores the importance of high-resolution models, combined with frequent updating of initial conditions, for accurately predicting highly localized, high-impact rainfall events over the Indian Himalayan region."
