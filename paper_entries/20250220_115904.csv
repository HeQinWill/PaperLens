Johnson,"Tropospheric aerosols over the western North Atlantic Ocean during the winter and summer deployments of ACTIVATE 2020: life cycle, transport, and distribution","We use the GEOS-Chem model to simulate aerosol distributions and properties over the western North Atlantic Ocean (WNAO) during the winter and summer deployments in 2020 of the NASA ACTIVATE mission. Model results are evaluated against aircraft, ground-based, and satellite observations. The improved understanding of life cycle, composition, transport pathways, and distribution of aerosols has important implications for characterizing aerosol–cloud–meteorology interactions over WNAO. 
 The Aerosol Cloud meTeorology Interactions oVer the western ATlantic Experiment (ACTIVATE) is a NASA mission to characterize aerosol–cloud interactions over the western North Atlantic Ocean (WNAO). Such characterization requires understanding of life cycle, composition, transport pathways, and distribution of aerosols over the WNAO. This study uses the GEOS-Chem model to simulate aerosol distributions and properties that are evaluated against aircraft, ground-based, and satellite observations during the winter and summer field deployments in 2020 of ACTIVATE. Transport in the boundary layer (BL) behind cold fronts was a major mechanism for the North American continental outflow of pollution to the WNAO in winter. Turbulent mixing was the main driver for the upward transport of sea salt within and ventilation out of BL in winter. The BL aerosol composition was dominated by sea salt, which increased in the summer, followed by organics and sulfate. Aircraft in situ aerosol measurements provided useful constraints on wet scavenging in GEOS-Chem. The model generally captured observed features such as continental outflow, land–ocean gradient, and mixing of anthropogenic aerosols with sea salt. Model sensitivity experiments with elevated smoke injection heights to the mid-troposphere (versus within BL) better reproduced observations of smoke aerosols from the western US wildfires over the WNAO in the summer. Model analysis suggests strong hygroscopic growth of sea salt particles and their seeding of marine BL clouds over the WNAO (< 35° N). Future modeling efforts should focus on improving parameterizations for aerosol wet scavenging, implementing realistic smoke injection heights, and applying high-resolution models that better resolve vertical transport."

Our year-long observations of aerosol physicochemical properties during the MOSAiC expedition reveal strong seasonal variations in aerosol chemical composition, where the short-term variability is heavily affected by storms in the Arctic. Local wind-generated particles are shown to be an important source of cloud seeds, especially in autumn. 
 Aerosols play a critical role in the Arctic's radiative balance, influencing solar radiation and cloud formation. Limited observations in the central Arctic leave gaps in understanding aerosol dynamics year-round, affecting model predictions of climate-relevant aerosol properties. Here, we present the first annual high-time-resolution observations of submicron aerosol chemical composition in the central Arctic during the Arctic Ocean 2018 (AO2018) and the 2019–2020 Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expeditions. Seasonal variations in the aerosol mass concentrations and chemical composition in the central Arctic were found to be driven by typical Arctic seasonal regimes and resemble those of pan-Arctic land-based stations. Organic aerosols dominated the pristine summer, while anthropogenic sulfate prevailed in autumn and spring under haze conditions. Ammonium, which impacts aerosol acidity, was consistently less abundant, relative to sulfate, in the central Arctic compared to lower latitudes of the Arctic. Cyclonic (storm) activity was found to have a significant influence on aerosol variability by enhancing emissions from local sources and the transport of remote aerosol. Local wind-generated particles contributed up to 80 % (20 %) of the cloud condensation nuclei population in autumn (spring). While the analysis presented herein provides the current central Arctic aerosol baseline, which will serve to improve climate model predictions in the region, it also underscores the importance of integrating short-timescale processes, such as seasonal wind-driven aerosol sources from blowing snow and open leads/ocean in model simulations. This is particularly important, given the decline in mid-latitude anthropogenic emissions and the increase in local ones."
10.5194/acp-25-2167-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了1980-2020年间，来自东西半球区域人为气溶胶排放对太平洋年代际变化的影响。具体来说，论文研究了亚洲地区化石燃料相关气溶胶排放增加以及北美和欧洲地区气溶胶排放减少对太平洋环流和海表温度变化的不同影响。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术或卫星观测，但它对人为气溶胶的关注以及对大气成分和气候影响的分析与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为遥感技术常被用于监测气溶胶的分布、排放和成分，从而评估其对气候的影响。,"['anthropogenic aerosols', 'aerosol emissions', 'climate change', 'regional aerosol forcing', 'Pacific climate', 'sea surface temperature', 'atmospheric composition']",Chenrui Diao;Yangyang Xu;Aixue Hu;Zhili Wang,Contrasting the roles of regional anthropogenic aerosols from the western and eastern hemispheres in driving the 1980–2020 Pacific multi-decadal variations,"Industrial aerosol increases in Asia and reductions in North America and Europe in 1980–2020 influenced climate changes over the Pacific Ocean differently. Asian aerosols caused El Niño-like temperature patterns and slightly weakened the natural variation in the North Pacific, while reduced  emissions of western countries led to extensive warming in middle–high latitudes of the North Pacific. Human impacts on the Pacific climate may change when emission reduction occurs over Asia in the future. 
 The multi-decadal variations in the Pacific climate are extensively discussed as being influenced by external forcings such as greenhouse gases (GHGs) and anthropogenic aerosols (AAs). Unlike GHGs, the potential impacts of AAs could be more complex because of the heterogeneity of spatial distribution during the past few decades. Here we show, using regional aerosol forcing large-ensemble simulations with the Community Earth System Model 1 (CESM1), that the increasing fossil-fuel-related aerosol emissions over Asia (EastFF) and the reduction in aerosol emissions over North America and Europe (WestFF) have remarkably different impacts on driving the Pacific circulations and sea surface temperature (SST) changes since the 1980s. EastFF excites a typical El Niño-like SST pattern in the tropical Pacific and weakens the climatological Pacific Walker circulation. WestFF induces a central Pacific (CP)-type El Niño-like SST pattern with warming in the middle region of the equatorial Pacific, which is consistent with the second leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) pattern of the observation. Over the North Pacific region, EastFF, located at low to middle latitudes, favors an Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO)-like SST pattern (horseshoe-like SST pattern in the North Pacific) through a teleconnection pathway between the tropical and extratropical Pacific but is overwhelmed by internal variability evolving from a positive phase to a negative IPO phase. In contrast, WestFF, located at middle to high latitudes, strongly affects the North Pacific via a west-to-east mid-latitude pathway and induces extensive warming. The competing effects of the heterogeneously distributed regional aerosol forcings are expected to exhibit different patterns in the near future, especially the redistribution of aerosol emissions within the domain of EastFF (i.e., from East Asia to South Asia) and changes in aerosol composition. The complex future changes in anthropogenic aerosol emissions are likely to introduce more profound impacts of aerosol forcing on the Pacific multi-decadal variations."
10.5194/acp-25-2147-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注的是在不同气候变化缓解策略下，中国未来大气活性氮沉降的时空演变。它使用空气质量模型，结合全球气候变化路径和国家排放控制情景，分析了到2060年代活性氮沉降的未来变化。研究重点在于清洁空气和碳中和政策如何影响活性氮沉降，以及排放控制如何减少从中国大陆到西太平洋的活性氮排放。虽然与大气环境相关，但该研究更侧重于化学传输模型和政策影响，而不是直接使用遥感技术（如卫星观测）进行大气成分分析。,"['reactive nitrogen deposition', 'air quality modeling', 'emission control scenarios', 'climate change pathways', 'oxidized nitrogen', 'reduced nitrogen']",Mingrui Ma;Jiachen Cao;Dan Tong;Bo Zheng;Yu Zhao,Spatial and temporal evolution of future atmospheric reactive nitrogen deposition in China under different climate change mitigation strategies,"We combined two global climate change pathways and three national emission control scenarios to analyze the future evolution of reactive nitrogen (Nr) deposition till the 2060s in China with air quality modeling. We show China’s clean air and carbon neutrality policies would overcome the adverse effects of climate change and efficiently reduce Nr deposition. The outflow of Nr fluxes from mainland China to the west Pacific would also be clearly reduced from continuous stringent emission controls. 
 Atmospheric reactive nitrogen (Nr) deposition plays a crucial role in linking air pollution to ecosystem risks. Previous modeling studies have indicated that climate change and pollution controls jointly result in significant changes in Nr deposition in China. However, it remains unclear how future emission reductions will influence Nr deposition under different climate pathways. Here, we investigated the spatiotemporal evolution and driving factors of future Nr deposition under various national clean air and climate policies. We applied WRF-CMAQ and assessed the historical (2010s, 2010–2014) pattern and future changes of Nr deposition till the 2060s (2060–2064) in China, by combining two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) global climate pathways and three national emission control scenarios. The results show that the implementation of clean air and carbon neutrality policies would greatly reduce oxidized nitrogen (OXN) deposition, mitigate the adverse perturbations of climate change, and reduce the outflow from Eastern China (EC; 20–45° N, 110–125° E) to the western Pacific. In Northern China (NC; 30–45° N, 110–125° E), the weakened atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC) would elevate the response of OXN deposition to a 20 % abatement of emissions (expressed as the ratio of percentage change of deposition to emissions) from 82.6 % in the 2010s to nearly 100 % in the 2060s. In contrast, the response of reduced nitrogen (RDN) deposition to NH3 emissions would decline, likely attributable to a more NH3-rich condition. The outcomes of this work broaden scientific understanding on how anthropogenic actions of air quality improvement and carbon emission reduction would reshape future Nr deposition and support effective policymaking to reduce associated ecological damage."

This study compares estimates from Finland, which use different methods and scales, and shows how well a global model estimates emissions within a country. The bottom-up estimates vary a lot, but constraining them with atmospheric CH4 measurements brought the estimates closer together. We also highlight the importance of quantifying natural emissions alongside anthropogenic emissions. 
 Accurate national methane (CH4) emission estimates are essential for tracking progress towards climate goals. This study investigated Finnish CH4 emissions from 2000–2021 using bottom-up and top-down approaches. We evaluated the ability of a global atmospheric inverse model CarbonTracker Europe – CH4 to estimate CH4 emissions within a single country. We focused on how different priors and their uncertainties affect the optimised emissions and showed that the optimised anthropogenic and natural CH4 emissions were strongly dependent on the prior emissions. However, while the range of CH4 estimates was large, the optimised emissions were more constrained than the bottom-up estimates. Further analysis showed that the optimisation aligned the trends of anthropogenic and natural CH4 emissions and improved the modelled seasonal cycles of natural emissions. Comparison of atmospheric CH4 observations with model results showed no clear preference between anthropogenic inventories (EDGAR v6 and CAMS-REG), but results using the highest natural prior (JSBACH–HIMMELI) agreed best with observations, suggesting that process-based models may underestimate CH4 emissions from Finnish peatlands or unaccounted sources such as freshwater emissions. Additionally, using an uncertainty estimate based on a process-based model ensemble for natural CH4 emissions seemed to be advantageous compared to the standard uncertainty definition. The average total posterior emission of the ensemble from one inverse model with different priors was similar to the average of the ensemble including different inverse models but similar priors. Thus, a single inverse model using a range of priors can be used to reliably estimate CH4 emissions when an ensemble of different models is unavailable."

Duran;Casey J. Wall;Nicholas J. Lutsko;Takuro Michibata;Po-Lun Ma;Yi Qin;Margaret L. Duffy;Brian Medeiros;Matvey Debolskiy,A new method for diagnosing effective radiative forcing from aerosol–cloud interactions in climate models,"We use satellite simulator data generated by global climate models to investigate how aerosol particles impact the radiative properties of liquid clouds. Specifically, we quantify the radiative perturbations arising from aerosol-driven changes in the number density of cloud droplets, the vertically integrated cloud water mass, and the cloud amount. Our results show that, in models, aerosol effects on the number density of cloud droplets contribute the most to anthropogenic climate forcing. 
 Aerosol–cloud interactions (ACIs) are a leading source of uncertainty in estimates of the historical effective radiative forcing (ERF). One reason for this uncertainty is the difficulty in estimating the ERF from aerosol–cloud interactions (ERFaci) in climate models, which typically requires multiple calls to the radiation code. Most commonly used methods also cannot disentangle the contributions from different processes to ERFaci. Here, we develop a new, computationally efficient method for estimating the shortwave (SW) ERFaci from liquid clouds using histograms of monthly averaged cloud fraction partitioned by cloud droplet effective radius (re) and liquid water path (LWP). Multiplying the histograms with SW cloud radiative kernels gives the total SW ERFaci from liquid clouds, which can be decomposed into contributions from the Twomey effect, LWP adjustments, and cloud fraction (CF) adjustments. We test the method with data from five CMIP6-era models, using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite instrument simulator to generate the histograms. Our method gives similar total SW ERFaci estimates to other established methods in regions of prevalent liquid cloud and indicates that the Twomey effect, LWP adjustments, and CF adjustments have contributed −0.34 ± 0.23, −0.22 ± 0.13, and −0.09 ± 0.11 W m−2, respectively, to the effective radiative forcing of the climate since 1850 in the ensemble mean (95 % confidence). These results demonstrate that widespread adoption of a MODIS re–LWP joint histogram diagnostic would allow the SW ERFaci and its components to be quickly and accurately diagnosed from climate model outputs, a crucial step for reducing uncertainty in the historical ERF."

Excellent agreement of the model and observations demonstrates the applicability of this approach to constrain photochemistry in such plumes. We identify limiting factors for the modeling accuracy and discuss spatial and spectral features of the distributions. 
 Biomass burning (BB) affects air quality and climate by releasing large quantities of gaseous and particulate pollutants into the atmosphere. Photochemical processing during daylight transforms these emissions, influencing their overall environmental impact. Accurately quantifying the photochemical drivers, namely actinic flux and photolysis frequencies, is crucial to constraining this chemistry. However, the complex radiative transfer within BB plumes presents a significant challenge for both direct observations and numerical models.This study introduces an expanded version of the 1D VLIDORT-QS radiative transfer (RT) model, named VLIDORT for photochemistry (VPC). VPC is designed for photochemical and remote sensing applications, particularly in BB plumes and other complex scenarios. To validate VPC and investigate photochemical conditions within BB plumes, the model was used to simulate spatial distributions of actinic fluxes and photolysis frequencies for the Shady wildfire (Idaho, US, 2019) based on plume composition data from the NOAA/NASA FIREX-AQ (Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality) campaign.Comparison between modeling results and observations by the CAFS (charged-coupled device actinic flux spectroradiometer) yields a modeling accuracy of 10 %–20 %. Systematic biases between the model and observations are within 2 %, indicating that the uncertainties are most likely due to variability in the input data caused by the inhomogeneity of the plume as well as 3D RT effects not captured in the model. Random uncertainties are largest in the ultraviolet (UV) spectral range, where they are dominated by uncertainties in the plume particle size distribution and brown carbon (BrC) absorptive properties.The modeled actinic fluxes show a decrease from the plume top to the bottom of the plume with a strong spectral dependence caused by BrC absorption, which darkens the plume towards shorter wavelengths. In the visible (Vis)  spectral range, actinic fluxes above the plume are enhanced by up to 60 %. In contrast, in the UV, actinic fluxes above the plume are not affected or even reduced by up to 10 %. Strong reductions exceeding an order of magnitude in and below the plume occur for both spectral ranges but are more pronounced in the UV."

Lee;Jie Gong;Guiping Liu,GNSS-RO residual ionospheric error (RIE): a new method and assessment,"Global Navigation Satellite System radio occultation data help monitor climate and weather prediction but are affected by residual ionospheric errors (RIEs). A new excess-phase-gradient method detects and corrects RIEs, showing both positive and negative values, varying by latitude, time, and solar activity. Tests show that RIE impacts polar stratosphere temperatures in models, with differences up to 3–4 K. This highlights the need for RIE correction to improve the accuracy of data assimilation. 
 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) observations play an increasingly important role in monitoring climate changes and numerical weather forecasts in the upper troposphere and stratosphere. Because the magnitudes of the RO bending angle are small at these altitudes, quantifying and removing residual ionospheric error (RIE) are critical to accurately retrieve atmospheric temperature and refractivity. Yet, RIEs remain poorly characterized in terms of the global geographical distribution and its variations with the local time and altitude influenced by the solar cycle and solar geomagnetic disturbances. In this study we developed a new method to determine RIE from the RO excess phase measurement on a profile-by-profile basis. The method, called the ϕex-gradient (dϕex/dht) method, is self-sufficient and based on the vertical derivative of the RO excess phase (ϕex) with respect to tangent height (ht), which can be applied to individual RO bending angle observations for RIE correction. In addition to the RIE in bending angle measurements, RIEs can also be found in the RO ϕex measurements in the upper atmosphere where an exponential dependence is expected. RIEs are likely to impact the RO temperature retrieval by inducing a small-scale variance that is solar-cycle-dependent. We found that the RIE values derived from the dϕex/dht method can be both positive and negative, which is fundamentally different from the κ method that produces only  positive RIE values. The new algorithm reveals a latitude-dependent diurnal variation with a larger daytime negative RIE (up to ∼ 3 µrad) in the tropics and subtropics. Based on the observed RIE climatology, a local-time-dependent RIE representation is used to evaluate its impacts on reanalysis data. We examined these impacts by comparing the data  from the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) data assimilation (DA) system with and without the RIE. The RIE impact on GEOS DA temperature is mainly confined to the polar regions of the stratosphere. Between 10 and 1 hPa the temperature differences are ∼ 1 K and exceed ∼ 3–4 K in some cases. These results further highlight the need for RO RIE correction in  modern DA systems."

The fast synchronous multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (FS MAX-DOAS) successfully obtains gas profiles. This work can also be integrated with mobile platforms for navigational observation research, which is crucial for making mobile MAX-DOAS profile measurements. 
 This study investigates a multi-elevation fast synchronous multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (FS MAX-DOAS) observation system that can rapidly acquire trace gas profiles. It modifies the conventional MAX-DOAS method by sequentially scanning at elevation angles using motors. The new system incorporates a two-dimensional area array charge-coupled device (CCD) grating spectrometer, telescopes with a small field of view (< 1°), a high-speed shutter switching module, and a multi-mode multi-core fiber to enable multi-channel spectroscopy and significantly enhance the time resolution of the collected spectra (one elevation cycle within 2 min). When selecting the spectrometer grating, the impact of the spectral resolution on the detection of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and formaldehyde (HCHO) by FS MAX-DOAS was simulated and analyzed. The optimal resolution range was determined to be 0.3–0.6 nm. The selection of the number of binning rows in the acquisition settings considers the signal-to-noise ratio of the pixels in each row to enhance the quality of the spectral data. Two-step acquisition is used for low elevation angles within one cycle to overcome the influence of variations in light intensity. A comparative test was conducted on outfield NO2 and HCHO measurements using differential optical absorption spectroscopy. Compared with the differential slant column densities (dSCDs) at each elevation angle measured by the MAX-DOAS system, the Pearson correlation coefficient of NO2 reached 0.9, while for HCHO it ranged mostly between 0.76 and 0.85. The results of the slant column concentration inversion indicate that the root mean square (rms) of the FS MAX-DOAS spectrum inversion can consistently be lower than that of MAX-DOAS over an extended period. The profile results show that the diurnal variation trend of the two systems was consistent, and because of the enhanced time resolution, the gas profile obtained by the former system can provide more detailed information. Compared with the near-ground NO2 concentration measured by the long-path DOAS (LP-DOAS) system, the daily variation trend shows a characteristic of being high in the morning and starting to decrease at noon, and the correlation coefficient between FS MAX-DOAS and LP-DOAS is higher (R = 0.901). The FS MAX-DOAS system can quickly and simultaneously obtain the vertical distribution profiles of NO2 and HCHO with high accuracy, providing a basis for mobile MAX-DOAS to achieve gas profile inversion."

A novel deep learning approach is developed to classify rain, snow, and graupel, achieving 93 % accuracy in real-world observations. The model remains robust to camera parameter variations and maintains reliable performance at wind speeds below 5 m/s, demonstrating strong potential for large-scale practical applications. 
 Urban surveillance cameras offer a valuable resource for high spatiotemporal resolution observations of ground hydrometeor phase (GHP), with significant implications for sectors such as transportation, agriculture, and meteorology. However, distinguishing between common GHPs—rain, snow, and graupel—present considerable challenges due to their visual similarities in surveillance videos. This study addresses these challenges by analyzing both daytime and nighttime videos, leveraging meteorological, optical, and imaging principles to identify distinguishing features for each GHP. Considering both computational accuracy and efficiency, a new deep learning framework is proposed. It leverages transfer learning with a pre-trained MobileNet V2 for spatial feature extraction and incorporates a Gated Recurrent Unit network to model temporal dependencies between video frames. Using the newly developed 94-hour Hydrometeor Phase Surveillance Video (HSV) dataset, the proposed model is trained and evaluated alongside 24 comparative algorithms. Results show that our proposed method achieves an accuracy of 0.9677 on the HSV dataset, outperforming all other relevant algorithms. Furthermore, in real-world experiments, the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 0.9301, as validated against manually corrected Two-Dimensional Video Disdrometer measurements. It remains robust against variations in camera parameters, maintaining consistent performance in both daytime and nighttime conditions, and demonstrates wind resistance with satisfactory results when wind speeds are below 5 m/s.

 Continuous ground-based remote sensing measurements were conducted during the Pallas Cloud Experiment (PaCE) 2022 campaign. Remote sensing instruments, including two ceilometers (models CL31 and CL61, Vaisala Oyj), a Doppler cloud radar (model RPG-FMCW-94, RPG Radiometer Physics GmbH), and a Doppler wind lidar (model StreamLine XR, HALO Photonics), were deployed at Kenttärova, Finland, a measurement station that is part of the Pallas Atmosphere–Ecosystem Supersite. The instruments operated continuously throughout the entire campaign, with the exception of a few technical interruptions and brief maintenance periods. The PaCE 2022 remote sensing measurements provided vertical profiles of atmospheric targets with high temporal and vertical resolution, extending from the ground up to an altitude of 10–15 km depending on instrument. By combining the data from these instruments and a numerical weather prediction model, cloud micro- and macrophysical properties—such as ice water content, ice effective radius, and target classification—were retrieved using the Cloudnet methodology.

In one method, we identify map patterns suggestive of folding based on pre-defined rules and apply a clustering algorithm to group those from the same fold together. In the other, we train a convolutional neural network to identify folds based on a set of training examples. We apply both methods to a set of synthetic maps and to real-world maps from two locations in France. 
 The increasing availability of large geological datasets and modern methods of data analysis facilitate a data science approach to geology in which inferences are drawn from geological data using automated methods based on statistics and machine learning. Such methods offer the potential for faster and less subjective interpretations of geological data than are possible from a human interpreter, but translating the understanding of a trained geologist to an algorithm is not straightforward. In this paper, we present automated workflows for detecting geological folds from map data using both unsupervised and supervised machine learning. For the unsupervised case, we use regular expression matching to identify map patterns suggestive of folds along lines crossing the map. We then use the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm to cluster these possible fold identifications into a smaller number of distinct folds. This clustering algorithm is chosen because it does not require the number of clusters to be known a priori. For the supervised learning case, we use synthetic models of folds to train a convolutional neural network to identify folds using map and topographic data. We test both methods on synthetic and real datasets, where they both prove capable of identifying folds. We also find that distinguishing folds from similar map patterns produced by topography is a major issue that must be accounted for with both methods. The unsupervised method has advantages, including the explainability of its results, and provides clearly better results in one of the two real-world test datasets, while the supervised learning method is more fully automated and likely more easily extensible to other structures. Both methods demonstrate the ability of machine learning to interpret folds on geological maps and have potential for further development targeting a wider range of structures and datasets."

The forecasting models were developed with reanalysis data and simulations on a European scale and transferred to the globe. We found that all approaches deliver highly accurate approximations of the physical dynamic at long time horizons, implying their usefulness to advance land surface forecasting with synthetic data. 
 The most useful weather prediction for the public is near the surface. The processes that are most relevant for near-surface weather prediction are also those that are most interactive and exhibit positive feedback or have key roles in energy partitioning. Land surface models (LSMs) consider these processes together with surface heterogeneity and, when coupled with an atmospheric model, provide boundary and initial conditions. They forecast water, carbon, and energy fluxes, which are an integral component of coupled atmospheric models. This numerical parametrization of atmospheric boundaries is computationally expensive, and statistical surrogate models are increasingly used to accelerate experimental research. We evaluated the efficiency of three surrogate models in simulating land surface processes for speeding up experimental research. Specifically, we compared the performance of a long short-term memory (LSTM) encoder–decoder network, extreme gradient boosting, and a feed-forward neural network within a physics-informed multi-objective framework. This framework emulates key prognostic states of the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) land surface scheme of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), ecLand, across continental and global scales. Our findings indicate that, while all models on average demonstrate high accuracy over the forecast period, the LSTM network excels in continental long-range predictions when carefully tuned, extreme gradient boosting (XGB) scores consistently high across tasks, and the multilayer perceptron (MLP) provides an excellent implementation time–accuracy  trade-off. While their reliability is context-dependent, the runtime reductions achieved by the emulators in comparison to the full numerical models are  significant, offering a faster alternative for conducting experiments on land surfaces."

The new model is evaluated against data from three different tracer gas experiments, and the promising results are an important first step towards using DERMA also for short-range dispersion modelling. 
 The Danish Emergency Response Model of the Atmosphere (DERMA) is a Lagrangian puff model originally developed for long-range dispersion modelling, on distances longer than roughly 50 km from the source. The model is used operationally as part of Danish emergency preparedness for the prediction of atmospheric dispersion in case of nuclear accidents, airborne spread of animal diseases, and ash from volcanic eruptions. To be able to simulate dispersion on shorter spatial scales, a new description of turbulent diffusion has been developed and implemented in DERMA, combining a stochastic particle approach with a classic puff model. Further, updates have been made to the parameterizations of the turbulent wind fluctuations and Lagrangian time scales, the boundary layer height, and the initial plume rise due to heat release. These improvements allow for a more realistic description of turbulent diffusion near the release location, while an updated version of the existing turbulence description is still used at longer distances. The new version of DERMA is evaluated against three different tracer gas experiments: the European Tracer Experiment (ETEX), the Øresund experiment, and the Kincaid experiment. The results indicate that the new particle-puff hybrid approach gives more accurate predictions, especially on shorter spatial scales while a small improvement is also observed for long-range dispersion."

The photodegradation rates of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were generally higher than those of dioxins and increased with substitution numbers of Cl atoms. A QSAR model correlating photodegradation rate constants of Cl-POPs and their structural parameters was established by using multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis and machine learning. The model results showed that soil–water partition coefficient (KOC), morgan fingerprint (mf_1747), and nucleophilicity index (NI) were the main factors affecting the photodegradation of Cl-POPs, confirming that the photodegradation of Cl-POPs with higher hydrophobicity and larger nucleophilic reactivity proceeded faster. According to the quenching experiment and theoretical calculation results, •O2– in the hydrophobic region contributed more to the strongly hydrophobic Cl-POPs, while the contribution of •OH was mainly concentrated in the weakly hydrophobic Cl-POPs.

However, it remains unclear how the heating-induced percent changes (%HIC) in DOM quantity and quality differ among soil types on a wide geographic scale. Here, we used dissolved organic carbon (DOC) quantification, absorption, and fluorescence spectroscopies, and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry to investigate the variations in %HIC in DOM quantity and quality of Chinese soil reference materials after heating at 250 and 400 °C. Our results reveal that as soil pH increased, %HIC in DOC content increased, while %HIC in aromaticity-related indices of DOM decreased for both heating temperatures. Moreover, the %HIC in DOM biolability and contents of aliphatics increased with soil pH for 250 °C heating but remained relatively stable for 400 °C heating. Results suggest that compared to those in acidic soil-dominated forests, wildfires in alkaline soil-dominated forests may cause greater DOM content and biolability in soils, which may facilitate postfire microbial recovery. These findings deepen our understanding of the site-specific impacts of wildfires on DOM and the subsequent implications for biogeochemical cycling and environmental quality across different geographic regions."

REEs adsorbed to aluminum-rich clays in weathering deposits represent important resources, but the mechanisms responsible for their retention and ease of extraction are unresolved. Disordered coordination and co-occurrence of multiple species pose challenges to investigating REE adsorption processes via established spectroscopic methods. In this study, we applied element-specific surface crystallography methods to obtain a new perspective on the complexity of REE adsorption mechanisms and affinities. Alumina (001) and (012) crystal surfaces were utilized to evaluate surface-specific controls on Nd(III) and Yb(III) adsorption behavior. The REEs displayed similar total adsorption to alumina (001) as a mixture of inner- and outer-sphere complexes, but Nd displayed a greater proportion of inner-sphere binding. Adsorption of ordered inner- and outer-sphere REE species was substantially lower on alumina (012). These distinct behaviors reflect differences in the surface functional group charging and topography of the two surfaces. However, alumina (012) also hosted a substantial population of disordered adsorbed species, especially for Nd, potentially associated with Al vacancy surface defects. The accumulation of light versus heavy REEs via adsorption in weathering deposits likely results from multiple, competing reactions affected by clay particle morphology. Leaching procedures for resource recovery should account for differential rates of desorption by coexisting inner- and outer-sphere REE surface complexes."

They may also be sites of microbial production of methylmercury (MeHg) and bioaccumulation of this neurotoxicant at the base of the food web. However, the environmental drivers controlling these mechanisms are unclear. We studied the pattern of MeHg bioaccumulation in zooplankton along the 200 km ETZ of a large North American estuary, the St. Lawrence Estuary (Québec, Canada). Our approach integrated the dynamic variation in ETZ geochemistry, focusing on MeHg speciation change, alongside ecological factors, including community composition and stable isotopic tracers of diet and habitat. MeHg bioaccumulation decreased with distance downstream along the ETZ, driven by the salinity gradient and traced by the isotopic signature of sulfur in zooplankton. MeHg speciation modeling suggested that complexation to dissolved organic matter may be used as a proxy of the trophic transfer of MeHg to zooplankton. Further, the binding of MeHg to organic matter was reduced by the presence of chloride, thus reducing the trophic transfer of MeHg. We propose a conceptual model for MeHg cycling in ETZ of large estuaries that hypothesizes that higher-level consumers in turbid upstream regions may face heightened risks of MeHg toxicity but that Hg levels diminish drastically as salinity increases."

This system enhanced ammonium removal efficiency significantly while maintaining low energy consumption, increasing from 94.36% at 0 V to 99.91% at 4 V. The improvement was primarily attributed to localized oxidation and restricted transport of ammonium ions. Specifically, the permeate carrier anode facilitated the indirect oxidation of ammonium through active chlorine via the breakpoint chlorination pathway, notably localized on the permeate side to prevent damage to the separation layer of the RO membrane and simultaneously avoid additional chemical additives. Furthermore, the restricted ammonium ion transport was responsible for its improved enthalpic barrier, as evidenced by both experimental investigation and Monte Carlo simulation. This rise in enthalpic barrier was primarily driven by the reverse electric field force across the RO membrane, coupled with the constrained ion migration near the membrane surface and ion diffusion within the membrane.

Mn doping not only facilitates N–H cleavage in the Eley–Rideal (E–R) pathway but also promotes the adsorption of NO and the cleavage of the N–O bond, lowering the energy barrier of the rate-determining step in the Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L–H) pathway. Thus, Mn doping facilitates the catalytic reaction along both potential pathways, which promotes the NH3–SCR reaction. Further analysis reveals that the doping of Mn introduces an unoccupied dxy orbital, which facilitates the interaction with the π orbital of NO, thereby augmenting NO adsorption. Moreover, Mn doping redistributes the electron density, enhancing the flexibility of electrons on the Fe atom and facilitating electron transfer from Fe to the π* orbital of Mn–N–O, thus promoting N–O cleavage.

Results reveal significantly elevated VOC emissions from polluted soils, with levels 2 orders of magnitude higher than those from their natural counterparts. Influences of light, soil water content, and temperature on VOC emissions were explored. Light exposure notably enhanced the emissions of certain VOCs, such as acetonitrile, from highly polluted industrial soils. Simultaneously, reductions in VOCs such as terpenes were observed, possibly driven by photochemical degradation processes. By comparison, soils from less polluted environments exhibited minimal changes in VOC emissions under light exposure, emphasizing the distinct behaviors of different soil types. Soil water content was inversely correlated with VOC emission rates, likely due to reduced soil porosity and permeability at higher moisture levels, whereas temperature exhibited intricate effects on soil emissions that  varied with VOC species.

However, the specific vorticity dynamics as an atmospheric precursor responsible for the northward propagation of ISOs remains unclear over the WNPSM. In this study, we utilized a multi‐timescale vorticity diagnosis to identify the key dynamics of ISOs in WNPSM. Our findings indicate that both vortex tilting and vortex advection play important roles in vorticity generation and the subsequent development of new convection, ultimately leading to ISO propagation. Vortex tilting is primarily driven by the interaction between intraseasonal vertical velocity shear and background easterly wind shear, which is consistent with the ISOs during Indian summer monsoon (ISM). However, the impact of vortex tilting is confined near the equator in the eastern region of the WNPSM because of the decreased easterly wind shear from the Indian Ocean to the WNP. Meanwhile, vortex advection is the result of the transport of intraseasonal vorticity by the background southerly wind, which is significant over the region of tropical WNPSM. In summary, this differs from the tilting alone that controls northward‐propagating ISOs during the ISM and is critical for advancing the unique framework for ISOs during the WNPSM."

Time lags, computed as the shifts that maximize correlation coefficients of the velocity between the unsteady and the corresponding steady scenarios at Δθ = Δθmax, are found to be significant and to extend 2 hr longer for α = 0° compared to α = 180°. These diurnal dynamics result in nonequilibrium conditions that are significantly affected by the flow history, and that behave differently over the two patches for the different α’s. Turbulence is found to be out of equilibrium with the mean flow, and the mean itself is found to be out of equilibrium with the thermal forcing. The sea surface heat flux is consistently more sensitive than its land counterpart to the time‐varying external forcing Δθ(t), and more so for synoptic forcing from land to sea (α = 180°).

Aladjem,Mechanism for local attenuation of DNA replication at double-strand breaks,"DNA double-strand breaks induce local genome maintenance and inhibition of replication initiation at nearby topologically associating domains without affecting global DNA synthesis. 
 DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) disrupt the continuity of the genome, with consequences for malignant transformation. Massive DNA damage can elicit a cellular checkpoint response that prevents cell proliferation1,2. However, how highly aggressive cancer cells, which can tolerate widespread DNA damage, respond to DSBs alongside continuous chromosome duplication is unknown. Here we show that DSBs induce a local genome maintenance mechanism that inhibits replication initiation in DSB-containing topologically associating domains (TADs) without affecting DNA synthesis at other genomic locations. This process is facilitated by mediators of replication and DSBs (MRDs). In normal and cancer cells, MRDs include the TIMELESS–TIPIN complex and the WEE1 kinase, which actively dislodges the TIMELESS–TIPIN complex from replication origins adjacent to DSBs and prevents initiation of DNA synthesis at DSB-containing TADs. Dysregulation of MRDs, or disruption of 3D chromatin architecture by dissolving TADs, results in inadvertent replication in damaged chromatin and increased DNA damage in cancer cells. We propose that the intact MRD cascade precedes DSB repair to prevent genomic instability, which is otherwise observed when replication is forced, or when genome architecture is challenged, in the presence of DSBs3–5. These observations reveal a previously unknown vulnerability in the DNA replication machinery that may be exploited to therapeutically target cancer cells.

 Neoantigen vaccines are under investigation for various cancers, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-driven lung cancers1,2. We tracked the phylogenetic history of an EGFR mutant lung cancer treated with erlotinib, osimertinib, radiotherapy and a personalized neopeptide vaccine (NPV) targeting ten somatic mutations, including EGFR exon 19 deletion (ex19del). The ex19del mutation was clonal, but is likely to have appeared after a whole-genome doubling (WGD) event. Following osimertinib and NPV treatment, loss of the ex19del mutation was identified in a progressing small-cell-transformed liver metastasis. Circulating tumour DNA analyses tracking 467 somatic variants revealed the presence of this EGFR wild-type clone before vaccination and its expansion during osimertinib/NPV therapy. Despite systemic T cell reactivity to the vaccine-targeted ex19del neoantigen, the NPV failed to halt disease progression. The liver metastasis lost vaccine-targeted neoantigens through chromosomal instability and exhibited a hostile microenvironment, characterized by limited immune infiltration, low CXCL9 and elevated M2 macrophage levels. Neoantigens arising post-WGD were more likely to be absent in the progressing liver metastasis than those occurring pre-WGD, suggesting that prioritizing pre-WGD neoantigens may improve vaccine design. Data from the TRACERx 421 cohort3 provide evidence that pre-WGD mutations better represent clonal variants, and owing to their presence at multiple copy numbers, are less likely to be lost in metastatic transition. These data highlight the power of phylogenetic disease tracking and functional T cell profiling to understand mechanisms of immune escape during combination therapies.

 Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform creative industries through supporting human creative ideation—the generation of new ideas1–5. However, limitations in model capabilities raise key challenges in integrating these technologies more fully into creative practices. Iterative tweaking and divergent thinking remain key to enabling creativity support using technology6,7, yet these practices are insufficiently supported by state-of-the-art generative AI models. Using game development as a lens, we demonstrate that we can make use of an understanding of user needs to drive the development and evaluation of generative AI models in a way that aligns with these creative practices. Concretely, we introduce a state-of-the-art generative model, the World and Human Action Model (WHAM), and show that it can generate consistent and diverse gameplay sequences and persist user modifications—three capabilities that we identify as being critical for this alignment. In contrast to previous approaches to creativity support tools that required manually defining or extracting structure for relatively narrow domains, generative AI models can learn relevant structure from available data, opening the potential for a much broader range of applications.

 A fundamental challenge for cancer vaccines is to generate long-lived functional T cells that are specific for tumour antigens. Here we find that mRNA–lipoplex vaccines against somatic mutation-derived neoantigens may solve this challenge in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a lethal cancer with few mutations. At an extended 3.2-year median follow-up from a phase 1 trial of surgery, atezolizumab (PD-L1 inhibitory antibody), autogene cevumeran1 (individualized neoantigen vaccine with backbone-optimized uridine mRNA–lipoplex nanoparticles) and modified (m) FOLFIRINOX (chemotherapy) in patients with PDAC, we find that responders with vaccine-induced T cells (n = 8) have prolonged recurrence-free survival (RFS; median not reached) compared with non-responders without vaccine-induced T cells (n = 8; median RFS 13.4 months; P  =  0.007). In responders, autogene cevumeran induces CD8+ T cell clones with an average estimated lifespan of 7.7 years (range 1.5 to roughly 100 years), with approximately 20% of clones having latent multi-decade lifespans that may outlive hosts. Eighty-six percent of clones per patient persist at substantial frequencies approximately 3 years post-vaccination, including clones with high avidity to PDAC neoepitopes. Using PhenoTrack, a novel computational strategy to trace single T cell phenotypes, we uncover that vaccine-induced clones are undetectable in pre-vaccination tissues, and assume a cytotoxic, tissue-resident memory-like T cell state up to three years post-vaccination with preserved neoantigen-specific effector function. Two responders recurred and evidenced fewer vaccine-induced T cells. Furthermore, recurrent PDACs were pruned of vaccine-targeted cancer clones. Thus, in PDAC, autogene cevumeran induces de novo CD8+ T cells with multiyear longevity, substantial magnitude and durable effector functions that may delay PDAC recurrence. Adjuvant mRNA–lipoplex neoantigen vaccines may thus solve a pivotal obstacle for cancer vaccination. In a phase 1 trial, patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who were treated with surgery and bespoke neoantigen mRNA vaccines combined with anti-PD-L1 and chemotherapy exhibited marked long-lived persistence of neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cell clones, which correlated with prolonged recurrence-free survival at a 3.2-year follow-up."

 The recognition of ligands by transmembrane proteins is essential for the exchange of materials, energy and information across biological membranes. Progress has been made in the de novo design of transmembrane proteins1–6, as well as in designing water-soluble proteins to bind small molecules7–12, but de novo design of transmembrane proteins that tightly and specifically bind to small molecules remains an outstanding challenge13. Here we present the accurate design of ligand-binding transmembrane proteins by integrating deep learning and energy-based methods. We designed pre-organized ligand-binding pockets in high-quality four-helix backbones for a fluorogenic ligand, and generated a transmembrane span using gradient-guided hallucination. The designer transmembrane proteins specifically activated fluorescence of the target fluorophore with mid-nanomolar affinity, exhibiting higher brightness and quantum yield compared to those of enhanced green fluorescent protein. These proteins were highly active in the membrane fraction of live bacterial and eukaryotic cells following expression. The crystal and cryogenic electron microscopy structures of the designer protein–ligand complexes were very close to the structures of the design models. We showed that the interactions between ligands and transmembrane proteins within the membrane can be accurately designed. Our work paves the way for the creation of new functional transmembrane proteins, with a wide range of applications including imaging, ligand sensing and membrane transport.

 High-grade gliomas (HGGs) are the leading cause of brain cancer-related death. HGGs include clinically, anatomically and molecularly distinct subtypes that stratify into diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs), such as H3K27M-altered diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, and hemispheric HGGs, such as IDH wild-type glioblastoma. Neuronal activity drives glioma progression through paracrine signalling1,2 and neuron-to-glioma synapses3–6. Glutamatergic AMPA receptor-dependent synapses between neurons and glioma cells have been demonstrated in paediatric3 and adult4 high-grade gliomas, and early work has suggested heterogeneous glioma GABAergic responses7. However, neuron-to-glioma synapses mediated by neurotransmitters other than glutamate remain understudied. Using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, in vivo optogenetics and patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models, we identified functional, tumour-promoting GABAergic neuron-to-glioma synapses mediated by GABAA receptors in DMGs. GABAergic input has a depolarizing effect on DMG cells due to NKCC1 chloride transporter function and consequently elevated intracellular chloride concentration in DMG malignant cells. As membrane depolarization increases glioma proliferation3,6, we found that the activity of GABAergic interneurons promotes DMG proliferation in vivo. The benzodiazepine lorazepam enhances GABA-mediated signalling, increases glioma proliferation and growth, and shortens survival in DMG patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models. By contrast, only minimal depolarizing GABAergic currents were found in hemispheric HGGs and lorazepam did not influence the growth rate of hemispheric glioblastoma xenografts. Together, these findings uncover growth-promoting GABAergic synaptic communication between GABAergic neurons and H3K27M-altered DMG cells, underscoring a tumour subtype-specific mechanism of brain cancer neurophysiology.

 Cancer cells have been shown to exploit neurons to modulate their survival and growth, including through the establishment of neural circuits within the central nervous system1–3. Here we report a distinct pattern of cancer–nerve interactions between the peripheral nervous system and gastric cancer. In multiple mouse models of gastric cancer, nociceptive nerves demonstrated the greatest degree of nerve expansion in an NGF-dependent manner. Neural tracing identified CGRP+ peptidergic neurons as the primary gastric sensory neurons. Three-dimensional co-culture models showed that sensory neurons directly connect with gastric cancer spheroids. Chemogenetic activation of sensory neurons induced the release of calcium into the cytoplasm of cancer cells, promoting tumour growth and metastasis. Pharmacological ablation of sensory neurons or treatment with CGRP inhibitors suppressed tumour growth and extended survival. Depolarization of gastric tumour membranes through in vivo optogenetic activation led to enhanced calcium flux in jugular nucleus complex and CGRP release, defining a cancer cell–peptidergic neuronal circuit. Together, these findings establish the functional connectivity between cancer and sensory neurons, identifying this pathway as a potential therapeutic target.

 Most current strategies for carbon management require CO2 removal (CDR) from the atmosphere on the multi-hundred gigatonne (Gt) scale by 2100 (refs. 1–5). Mg-rich silicate minerals can remove >105 Gt CO2 and sequester it as stable and innocuous carbonate minerals or dissolved bicarbonate ions3,6,7. However, the reaction rates of these minerals under ambient conditions are far too slow for practical use. Here we show that CaCO3 and CaSO4 react quantitatively with diverse Mg-rich silicates (for example, olivine, serpentine and augite) under thermochemical conditions to form Ca2SiO4 and MgO. On exposure to ambient air under wet conditions, Ca2SiO4 is converted to CaCO3 and silicic acid, and MgO is partially converted into a Mg carbonate within weeks, whereas the input Mg silicate shows no reactivity over 6 months. Alternatively, Ca2SiO4 and MgO can be completely carbonated to CaCO3 and Mg(HCO3)2 under 1 atm CO2 at ambient temperature within hours. Using CaCO3 as the Ca source, this chemistry enables a CDR process in which the output Ca2SiO4/MgO material is used to remove CO2 from air or soil and the CO2 process emissions are sequestered. Analysis of the energy requirements indicates that this process could require less than 1 MWh per tonne CO2 removed, approximately half the energy of CO2 capture with leading direct air capture technologies. The chemistry described here could unlock Mg-rich silicates as a vast resource for safe and permanent CDR. Reactions of Mg-rich silicates with calcium carbonates/sulfates result in the formation of materials that could potentially be used for low-cost carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere."

 Gas samples relevant to health1–3 and the environment4–6 typically contain many molecular species that span a huge concentration dynamic range. Mid-infrared frequency comb spectroscopy with high-finesse cavity enhancement has allowed the most sensitive multispecies trace-gas detections so far2,7–13. However, the robust performance of this technique depends critically on ensuring absorption-path-length enhancement over a broad spectral coverage, which is severely limited by comb–cavity frequency mismatch if strongly absorbing compounds are present. Here we introduce modulated ringdown comb interferometry, a technique that resolves the vulnerability of comb–cavity enhancement to strong intracavity absorption or dispersion. This technique works by measuring ringdown dynamics carried by massively parallel comb lines transmitted through a length-modulated cavity, making use of both the periodicity of the field dynamics and the Doppler frequency shifts introduced from a Michelson interferometer. As a demonstration, we measure highly dispersive exhaled human breath samples and ambient air in the mid-infrared with finesse improved to 23,000 and coverage to 1,010 cm−1. Such a product of finesse and spectral coverage is orders of magnitude better than all previous demonstrations2,7–20, enabling us to simultaneously quantify 20 distinct molecular species at above 1-part-per-trillion sensitivity varying in concentrations by seven orders of magnitude. This technique unlocks next-generation sensing performance for complex and dynamic molecular compositions, with scalable improvement to both finesse and spectral coverage.

Here we report an approach for in situ deposit stabilized ultrasmall CsPbI3 QD conductive solids, by constructing CsPbI3 QD/quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) perovskite heteroepitaxy. The well-aligned periodic array of edge-oriented ligands at heterointerface triggers a substantial octahedral tilting in a critical layer thickness of CsPbI3 QDs, which heightens the Gibbs free energy difference between the tilted-CsPbI3 and δ-CsPbI3 leading to thermodynamic stabilization of CsPbI3 QDs. The approach allows us to fabricate stabilized CsPbI3 QD conductive films with tunable emission covering the entire red spectral region from 600 nm to 710 nm. Here we report the pure-red PeLEDs with narrow electroluminescence peak centred at 630 nm, matching the Rec. 2100 standard for ultrahigh-definition display. The champion device exhibits a certified external quantum efficiency of 24.6% and a half-lifetime of 6,330 min, ranking as one of the most efficient and stable pure-red PeLED reported to date. The approach is also compatible with large-area manufacturing, enabling 1 cm2 PeLED to exhibit the best external quantum efficiency of 20.5% at 630 nm. A heteroepitaxial-strain-based strategy for enhancing the stability of perovskite quantum dots for spectrally narrow (pure) red LEDs is reported."

 Modular structure and function are ubiquitous in biology, from the organization of animal brains and bodies to the scale of ecosystems. However, the mechanisms of modularity emergence from non-modular precursors remain unclear. Here we introduce the principle of peak selection, a process by which purely local interactions and smooth gradients can drive the self-organization of discrete global modules. The process combines strengths of the positional and Turing pattern-formation mechanisms into a model for morphogenesis. Applied to the grid-cell system of the brain, peak selection results in the self-organization of functionally distinct modules with discretely spaced spatial periods. Applied to ecological systems, it results in discrete multispecies niches and synchronous spawning across geographically distributed coral colonies. The process exhibits self-scaling with system size and ‘topological robustness’1, which renders module emergence and module properties insensitive to most parameters. Peak selection ameliorates the fine-tuning requirement for continuous attractor dynamics in single grid-cell modules and it makes a detail-independent prediction that grid module period ratios should approximate adjacent integer ratios, providing a highly accurate match to the available data. Predictions for grid cells at the transcriptional, connectomic and physiological levels promise to elucidate the interplay of molecules, connectivity and function emergence in brains. The principle of peak selection is described, by which local interactions and smooth gradients drive self-organization of discrete global modules."

 SPO11 initiates meiotic recombination through the induction of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)1,2, but this catalytic activity has never been reconstituted in vitro3,4. Here, using Mus musculus SPO11, we report a biochemical system that recapitulates all the hallmarks of meiotic DSB formation. We show that SPO11 catalyses break formation in the absence of any partners and remains covalently attached to the 5′ broken strands. We find that target site selection by SPO11 is influenced by the sequence, bendability and topology of the DNA substrate, and provide evidence that SPO11 can reseal single-strand DNA breaks. In addition, we show that SPO11 is monomeric in solution and that cleavage requires dimerization for the reconstitution of two hybrid active sites. SPO11 and its partner TOP6BL form a 1:1 complex that catalyses DNA cleavage with an activity similar to that of SPO11 alone. However, this complex binds DNA ends with higher affinity, suggesting a potential role after cleavage. We propose a model in which additional partners of SPO11 required for DSB formation in vivo assemble biomolecular condensates that recruit SPO11–TOP6BL, enabling dimerization and cleavage. Our work establishes SPO11 dimerization as the fundamental mechanism that controls the induction of meiotic DSBs.

 The fusion of non-Abelian anyons is a fundamental operation in measurement-only topological quantum computation1. In one-dimensional topological superconductors (1DTSs)2–4, fusion amounts to a determination of the shared fermion parity of Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Here we introduce a device architecture5 that is compatible with future tests of fusion rules. We implement a single-shot interferometric measurement of fermion parity6–11 in indium arsenide–aluminium heterostructures with a gate-defined superconducting nanowire12–14. The interferometer is formed by tunnel-coupling the proximitized nanowire to quantum dots. The nanowire causes a state-dependent shift of the quantum capacitance of these quantum dots of up to 1 fF. Our quantum-capacitance measurements show flux h/2e-periodic bimodality with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 1 in 3.6 μs at optimal flux values. From the time traces of the quantum-capacitance measurements, we extract a dwell time in the two associated states that is longer than 1 ms at in-plane magnetic fields of approximately 2 T. We discuss the interpretation of our measurements in terms of both topologically trivial and non-trivial origins. The large capacitance shift and long poisoning time enable a parity measurement with an assignment error probability of 1%.

 The Spo11 complex catalyses the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), initiating meiotic recombination—a process that is essential for fertility and genetic diversity1,2. Although the function of Spo11 has been known for 27 years, previous efforts to reconstitute DSB formation in vitro have been unsuccessful. Here we biochemically characterize the mouse SPO11–TOP6BL protein complex, and show that this complex cleaves DNA and covalently attaches to the 5′ terminus of DNA breaks in vitro. Using a point-mutation strategy, we reveal that Mg2+ is essential for the DNA-cleavage activity of this complex in vitro, as confirmed by knock-in mice carrying a point mutation in SPO11 that disrupts its binding to Mg2+, thereby abolishing DSB formation. However, the activity of the SPO11 complex is ATP-independent. We also present evidence that the mouse SPO11 complex is biochemically distinct from the ancestral topoisomerase VI. Our findings establish a mechanistic framework for understanding the first steps of meiotic recombination. The in vitro characterization of a key event in the early stages of meiosis—the induction of double-strand DNA breaks by the SPO11–TOP6BL complex—provides insight into the catalytic mechanism and evolution of SPO11."

 Meiotic recombination starts with SPO11 generation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)1. SPO11 is critical for meiosis in most species, but it generates dangerous DSBs with mutagenic2 and gametocidal3 potential. Cells must therefore utilize the beneficial functions of SPO11 while minimizing its risks4—how they do so remains poorly understood. Here we report reconstitution of DNA cleavage in vitro with purified recombinant mouse SPO11 bound to TOP6BL. SPO11–TOP6BL complexes are monomeric (1:1) in solution and bind tightly to DNA, but dimeric (2:2) assemblies cleave DNA to form covalent 5′ attachments that require SPO11 active-site residues, divalent metal ions and SPO11 dimerization. SPO11 can also reseal DNA that it has nicked. Structure modelling with AlphaFold 3 suggests that DNA is bent prior to cleavage5. In vitro cleavage displays a sequence bias that partially explains DSB site preferences in vivo. Cleavage is inefficient on complex DNA substrates, partly because SPO11 is readily trapped in DSB-incompetent (presumably monomeric) binding states that exchange slowly. However, cleavage is improved with substrates that favour dimer assembly or by artificially dimerizing SPO11. Our results inform a model in which intrinsically weak dimerization restrains SPO11 activity in vivo, making it exquisitely dependent on accessory proteins that focus and control DSB formation. Reconstitution of recombinantly expressed SPO11–TOP6BL complex recapitulates its DNA cleavage function and together with structural modelling and biochemical experiments, provides insights into the regulation and mechanism of SPO11 activity."

 Online platforms are rife with racial discrimination1, but current interventions focus on employers2,3 rather than customers. We propose a customer-facing solution: changing to a two-point rating scale (dichotomization). Compared with the ubiquitous five-star scale, we argue that dichotomization reduces modern racial discrimination by focusing evaluators on the distinction between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ performance, thereby reducing how personal beliefs shape customer assessments. Study 1 is a quasi-natural experiment on a home-services labour platform (n = 69,971) in which the company exogenously changed from a five-star scale to a dichotomous scale (thumbs up or thumbs down). Dichotomization eliminated customers’ racial discrimination whereby non-white workers received lower ratings and earned 91 cents for each US dollar paid to white workers for the same work. A pre-registered experiment (study 2, n = 652) found that the equalizing effect of dichotomization is most prevalent among evaluators holding modern racist beliefs. Further experiments (study 3, n = 1,435; study 4, n = 528) provide evidence of the proposed mechanism, and eight supplementary studies support measurement and design choices. Our research offers a promising intervention for reducing customers’ subtle racial discrimination in a large section of the economy and contributes to the interdisciplinary literature on evaluation processes and racial inequality.

 Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, particularly transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), are promising for advanced electronics beyond silicon1–3. Traditionally, TMDs are epitaxially grown on crystalline substrates by chemical vapour deposition. However, this approach requires post-growth transfer to target substrates, which makes controlling thickness and scalability difficult. Here we introduce a method called hypotaxy (‘hypo’ meaning downward and ‘taxy’ meaning arrangement), which enables wafer-scale single-crystal TMD growth directly on various substrates, including amorphous and lattice-mismatched substrates, while preserving crystalline alignment with an overlying 2D template. By sulfurizing or selenizing a pre-deposited metal film under graphene, aligned TMD nuclei form, coalescing into a single-crystal film as graphene is removed. This method achieves precise MoS2 thickness control from monolayer to hundreds of layers on diverse substrates, producing 4-inch single-crystal MoS2 with high thermal conductivity (about 120 W m−1 K−1) and mobility (around 87 cm2 V−1 s−1). Furthermore, nanopores created in graphene using oxygen plasma treatment allow MoS2 growth at a lower temperature of 400 °C, compatible with back-end-of-line processes. This hypotaxy approach extends to other TMDs, such as MoSe2, WS2 and WSe2, offering a solution to substrate limitations in conventional epitaxy and enabling wafer-scale TMDs for monolithic three-dimensional integration.

 Machine learning research has achieved large performance gains on a wide range of tasks by expanding the learning target from mean rewards to entire probability distributions of rewards—an approach known as distributional reinforcement learning (RL)1. The mesolimbic dopamine system is thought to underlie RL in the mammalian brain by updating a representation of mean value in the striatum2, but little is known about whether, where and how neurons in this circuit encode information about higher-order moments of reward distributions3. Here, to fill this gap, we used high-density probes (Neuropixels) to record striatal activity from mice performing a classical conditioning task in which reward mean, reward variance and stimulus identity were independently manipulated. In contrast to traditional RL accounts, we found robust evidence for abstract encoding of variance in the striatum. Chronic ablation of dopamine inputs disorganized these distributional representations in the striatum without interfering with mean value coding. Two-photon calcium imaging and optogenetics revealed that the two major classes of striatal medium spiny neurons—D1 and D2—contributed to this code by preferentially encoding the right and left tails of the reward distribution, respectively. We synthesize these findings into a new model of the striatum and mesolimbic dopamine that harnesses the opponency between D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons4–9 to reap the computational benefits of distributional RL. D1- and D2-expressing striatal neurons encode separate parts of a learned reward distribution, paralleling modern approaches in machine learning."

 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of primary liver cancer, is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide1,2. HCC occurs typically from a background of chronic liver disease, caused by a spectrum of predisposing conditions. Tumour development is driven by the expansion of clones that accumulate progressive driver mutations3, with hepatocytes the most likely cell of origin2. However, the landscape of driver mutations in HCC is broadly independent of the underlying aetiologies4. Despite an increasing range of systemic treatment options for advanced HCC, outcomes remain heterogeneous and typically poor. Emerging data suggest that drug efficacies depend on disease aetiology and genetic alterations5,6. Exploring subtypes in preclinical models with human relevance will therefore be essential to advance precision medicine in HCC7. Here we generated a suite of genetically driven immunocompetent in vivo and matched in vitro HCC models. Our models represent multiple features of human HCC, including clonal origin, histopathological appearance and metastasis. We integrated transcriptomic data from the mouse models with human HCC data and identified four common human–mouse subtype clusters. The subtype clusters had distinct transcriptomic characteristics that aligned with the human histopathology. In a proof-of-principle analysis, we verified response to standard-of-care treatment and used a linked in vitro–in vivo pipeline to identify a promising therapeutic candidate, cladribine, that has not previously been linked to HCC treatment. Cladribine acts in a highly effective subtype-specific manner in combination with standard-of-care therapy.

 When two insulating, neutral materials are contacted and separated, they exchange electrical charge1. Experiments have long suggested that this ‘contact electrification’ is transitive, with different materials ordering into ‘triboelectric series’ based on the sign of charge acquired2. At the same time, the effect is plagued by unpredictability, preventing consensus on the mechanism and casting doubt on the rhyme and reason that series imply3. Here we expose an unanticipated connection between the unpredictability and order in contact electrification: nominally identical materials initially exchange charge randomly and intransitively, but—over repeated experiments—order into triboelectric series. We find that this evolution is driven by the act of contact itself—samples with more contacts in their history charge negatively to ones with fewer contacts. Capturing this ‘contact bias’ in a minimal model, we recreate both the initial randomness and ultimate order in numerical simulations and use it experimentally to force the appearance of a triboelectric series of our choosing. With a set of surface-sensitive techniques to search for the underlying alterations contact creates, we only find evidence of nanoscale morphological changes, pointing to a mechanism strongly coupled with mechanics. Our results highlight the centrality of contact history in contact electrification and suggest that focusing on the unpredictability that has long plagued the effect may hold the key to understanding it. Nominally identical materials are found to spontaneously order into triboelectric series over repeated processes, which is found to be driven by the act of contact itself using experiments as well as numerical simulations."

 The survival of malignant cells within tumours is often seen as depending on ruthless competition for nutrients and other resources1,2. Although competition is certainly critical for tumour evolution and cancer progression, cooperative interactions within tumours are also important, albeit poorly understood3,4. Cooperative populations at all levels of biological organization risk extinction if their population size falls below a critical tipping point5,6. Here we examined whether cooperation among tumour cells may be a potential therapeutic target. We identified a cooperative mechanism that enables tumour cells to proliferate under the amino acid-deprived conditions found in the tumour microenvironment. Disruption of this mechanism drove cultured tumour populations to the critical extinction point and resulted in a marked reduction in tumour growth in vivo. Mechanistically, we show that tumour cells collectively digest extracellular oligopeptides through the secretion of aminopeptidases. The resulting free amino acids benefit both aminopeptidase-secreting cells and neighbouring cells. We identified CNDP2 as the key enzyme that hydrolyses these peptides extracellularly, and loss of this aminopeptidase prevents tumour growth in vitro and in vivo.

 DNA damage promotes mutations that fuel cancer, ageing and neurodegenerative diseases1–3, but surprisingly, the causes and types of damage remain largely unknown. There are three identified mechanisms that damage DNA during transcription: collision of RNA polymerase (RNAP) with the DNA-replication machinery head-on and co-directionally4–6, and R-loop-induced DNA breakage7–10. Here we identify novel DNA damage reaction intermediates11,12 and uncover a fourth transcription-related source of DNA damage: endogenous DNA damage at sites of terminated transcripts. We engineered proteins to capture single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ends with 3′ polarity in bacterial and human cells. In Escherichia coli, spontaneous 3′-ssDNA-end foci were unexpectedly frequent, at one or more per cell division, and arose via two identifiable pathways, both of which were dependent on DNA replication. A pathway associated with double-strand breaks was suppressed by overexpression of replicative DNA polymerase (pol) III, suggesting competition between pol III and DNA damage-promoting proteins. Mapping of recurrent 3′-ssDNA-ends identified distinct 3′-ssDNA-end-hotspots, mostly unrelated to double-strand breaks, next to the 5′-CCTTTTTT transcription-terminator-like sequence. These 3′-ssDNA-termini coincide with RNA 3′-termini identified by DirectRNA sequencing13 or simultaneous 5′ and 3′ end RNA sequencing (SEnd-seq)14 and were prevented by a mutant RNAP that reads through terminators. Our findings reveal that transcription termination or pausing can promote DNA damage and subsequent genomic instability.

 Mitochondrial stress pathways protect mitochondrial health from cellular insults1–8. However, their role under physiological conditions is largely unknown. Here, using 18 single, double and triple whole-body and tissue-specific knockout and mutant mice, along with systematic mitochondrial morphology analysis, untargeted metabolomics and RNA sequencing, we discovered that the synergy between two stress-responsive systems—the ubiquitin E3 ligase Parkin and the metalloprotease OMA1—safeguards mitochondrial structure and genome by mitochondrial fusion, mediated by the outer membrane GTPase MFN1 and the inner membrane GTPase OPA1. Whereas the individual loss of Parkin or OMA1 does not affect mitochondrial integrity, their combined loss results in small body size, low locomotor activity, premature death, mitochondrial abnormalities and innate immune responses. Thus, our data show that Parkin and OMA1 maintain a dual regulatory mechanism that controls mitochondrial fusion at the two membranes, even in the absence of extrinsic stress.

 T cell-based immunotherapies hold promise in treating cancer by leveraging the immune system’s recognition of cancer-specific antigens1. However, their efficacy is limited in tumours with few somatic mutations and substantial intratumoural heterogeneity2–4. Here we introduce a previously uncharacterized class of tumour-wide public neoantigens originating from RNA splicing aberrations in diverse cancer types. We identified T cell receptor clones capable of recognizing and targeting neoantigens derived from aberrant splicing in GNAS and RPL22. In cases with multi-site biopsies, we detected the tumour-wide expression of the GNAS neojunction in glioma, mesothelioma, prostate cancer and liver cancer. These neoantigens are endogenously generated and presented by tumour cells under physiologic conditions and are sufficient to trigger cancer cell eradication by neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells. Moreover, our study highlights a role for dysregulated splicing factor expression in specific cancer types, leading to recurrent patterns of neojunction upregulation. These findings establish a molecular basis for T cell-based immunotherapies addressing the challenges of intratumoural heterogeneity.

 Chronic stress can change how we learn and, thus, how we make decisions1–5. Here we investigated the neuronal circuit mechanisms that enable this. Using a multifaceted systems neuroscience approach in male and female mice, we reveal a dual-pathway, amygdala–striatal neuronal circuit architecture by which a recent history of chronic stress disrupts the action–outcome learning underlying adaptive agency and promotes the formation of inflexible habits. We found that the projection from the basolateral amygdala to the dorsomedial striatum is activated by rewarding events to support the action–outcome learning needed for flexible, goal-directed decision-making. Chronic stress attenuates this to disrupt action–outcome learning and, therefore, agency. Conversely, the projection from the central amygdala to the dorsomedial striatum mediates habit formation. Following stress, this pathway is progressively recruited to learning to promote the premature formation of inflexible habits. Thus, stress exerts opposing effects on two amygdala–striatal pathways to disrupt agency and promote habit. These data provide neuronal circuit insights into how chronic stress shapes learning and decision-making, and help understanding of how stress can lead to the disrupted decision-making and pathological habits that characterize substance use disorders and mental health conditions. Adaptive decision-making often requires an understanding of our agency in a situation; however, chronic stress can disrupt agency and promote inflexible, habitual behaviour by turning off a brain pathway needed for agency and activating one that promotes habit."

 The complex life cycle of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum involves several major differentiation stages, each requiring strict control of gene expression. Fundamental changes in chromatin structure and epigenetic modifications during life cycle progression suggest a central role for these mechanisms in regulating the transcriptional program of malaria parasite development1–6. P. falciparum chromatin is distinct from other eukaryotes, with an extraordinarily high AT content (>80%)7 and highly divergent histones resulting in atypical DNA packaging properties8. Moreover, the chromatin remodellers that are critical for shaping chromatin structure are not conserved and are unexplored in P. falciparum. Here we identify P. falciparum Snf2L (PfSnf2L, encoded by PF3D7_1104200) as an ISWI-related ATPase that actively repositions P. falciparum nucleosomes in vitro. Our results demonstrate that PfSnf2L is essential, regulating both asexual development and sexual differentiation. PfSnf2L globally controls just-in-time transcription by spatiotemporally determining nucleosome positioning at the promoters of stage-specific genes. The unique sequence and functional properties of PfSnf2L led to the identification of an inhibitor that specifically kills P. falciparum and phenocopies the loss of correct gene expression timing. The inhibitor represents a new class of antimalarial transmission-blocking drugs, inhibiting gametocyte formation.

 The generation of large-scale entangled states is crucial for quantum technologies, such as quantum computation1, communication2 and metrology3. Integrated quantum photonics that enables on-chip encoding, processing and detection of quantum light states offers a promising platform for the generation and manipulation of large-scale entangled states4,5. Generating entanglement between qubits encoded in discrete variables within single photons is challenging, owing to the difficulty of making single photons interact on photonic chips6–11. Devices that operate with continuous variables are more promising, as they enable the deterministic generation and entanglement of qumodes, in which information is encoded in light quadratures. Demonstrations so far have been limited to entanglement between two qumodes12–20. Here we report the deterministic generation of a continuous-variable eight-mode entanglement on an integrated optical chip. The chip delivers a quantum microcomb that produces multimode squeezed-vacuum optical frequency combs below the threshold. We verify the inseparability of our eight-mode state and demonstrate supermode multipartite entanglement over hundreds of megahertz sideband frequencies through violation of the van Loock–Furusawa criteria. By measuring the full matrices of nullifier correlations with sufficiently low off-diagonal noises, we characterize multipartite entanglement structures, which are approximate to the expected cluster-type structures for finite squeezing. This work shows the potential of continuous-variable integrated photonic quantum devices for facilitating quantum computing, networking and sensing.

 Glaciers are indicators of ongoing anthropogenic climate change1. Their melting leads to increased local geohazards2, and impacts marine3 and terrestrial4,5 ecosystems, regional freshwater resources6, and both global water and energy cycles7,8. Together with the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, glaciers are essential drivers of present9,10 and future11–13 sea-level rise. Previous assessments of global glacier mass changes have been hampered by spatial and temporal limitations and the heterogeneity of existing data series14–16. Here we show in an intercomparison exercise that glaciers worldwide lost 273 ± 16 gigatonnes in mass annually from 2000 to 2023, with an increase of 36 ± 10% from the first (2000–2011) to the second (2012–2023) half of the period. Since 2000, glaciers have lost between 2% and 39% of their ice regionally and about 5% globally. Glacier mass loss is about 18% larger than the loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet and more than twice that from the Antarctic Ice Sheet17. Our results arise from a scientific community effort to collect, homogenize, combine and analyse glacier mass changes from in situ and remote-sensing observations. Although our estimates are in agreement with findings from previous assessments14–16 at a global scale, we found some large regional deviations owing to systematic differences among observation methods. Our results provide a refined baseline for better understanding observational differences and for calibrating model ensembles12,16,18, which will help to narrow projection uncertainty for the twenty-first century11,12,18.

Here, authors resolve the DUR3 structure, clarify how urea is specifically recognized, and elucidate the proton-driven urea transport mechanisms of DUR3. 
 Urea is a primary nitrogen source used as fertilizer in agricultural plant production and a crucial nitrogen metabolite in plants, playing an essential role in modern agriculture. In plants, DUR3 is a proton-driven high-affinity urea transporter located on the plasma membrane. It not only absorbs external low-concentration urea as a nutrient but also facilitates nitrogen transfer by recovering urea from senescent leaves. Despite its importance, the high-affinity urea transport mechanism in plants remains insufficiently understood. In this study, we determine the structures of Arabidopsis thaliana DUR3 in two different conformations: the inward-facing open state of the apo structure and the occluded urea-bound state, with overall resolutions of 2.8 Å and 3.0 Å, respectively. By comparing these structures and analyzing their functional characteristics, we elucidated how urea molecules are specifically recognized. In the urea-bound structure, we identified key titratable amino acid residues and proposed a model for proton involvement in urea transport based on structural and functional data. This study enhances our understanding of proton-driven urea transport mechanisms in DUR3. DUR3 absorbs low-concentration urea from soil and recycles urea from senescent leaves.

 The dynamic study of coacervates in vitro contributes our understanding of phase separation mechanisms in cells due to complex intracellular physiology. However, current researches mainly involve the use of exogenous auxiliary agents to form multi-compartmental coacervates with short-term stability. Herein, we report the endogenous self-organizing of multi-component coacervates (HA/PDDA/BSA/DMAEMA) induced by a dynamic stimulation process of protein-mediated photopolymerization. As polymerization proceeds, the cycled structural evolution and maturation from coacervate droplets into multi-compartmental coacervates, coacervate vesicles and coacervate droplets are revealed, which are driven by electrostatic interaction and osmotic pressure difference supported by dynamic and thermodynamic control. Specially, by regulating the light stimulation time, a type of multi-compartmental coacervates can be widely obtained with high structural stability over 300 days. Being a promising artificial cell model, it shows the special characteristic of compartmentalized encapsulation of substrates, efficiently improving enzymatic interfacial catalytic efficiency of organelle-like communication. Our study holds great potential for advancing the understanding of the structural evolution mechanism of membraneless organelles and provides an instructive technique for constructing multi-compartmental coacervates with long-term stability.

 Limited by large batch differences and inferior polymerization degree of current polymer acceptors, the potential high efficiency and stability advantages of all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) cannot be fully utilized. Alternatively, largely π-extended and structurally definite oligomer acceptors are effective strategies to realize the overall performance of polymer acceptors. Herein, we report a linear tetramer acceptor namely 4Y-BO with identical molecular skeleton and comparable molecular-weight relative to the control polymer acceptor PY-BO. The structurally definite tetramer shows refined film-forming kinetics and improved molecular ordering, offering uniform crystallinity with polymer donor and hence well-defined fibrous heterojunction textures. Encouragingly, the PM6:4Y-BO devices achieve an efficiency up to 19.75% (certified efficiency:19.58%), largely surpassing that of the control PM6:PY-BO device (15.66%) and ranks the highest among solar cells based on oligomer and polymer acceptors.

 Meaningful variation in internal states that impacts cognition and behavior remains challenging to discover and characterize. Here we leverage trial-to-trial fluctuations in the brain-wide signal recorded using functional MRI to test if distinct sets of brain regions are activated on different trials when accomplishing the same task. Across three different perceptual decision-making experiments, we estimate the brain activations for each trial. We then cluster the trials based on their similarity using modularity-maximization, a data-driven classification method. In each experiment, we find multiple distinct but stable subtypes of trials, suggesting that the same task can be accomplished in the presence of widely varying brain activation patterns. Surprisingly, in all experiments, one of the subtypes exhibits strong activation in the default mode network, which is typically thought to decrease in activity during tasks that require externally focused attention. The remaining subtypes are characterized by activations in different task-positive areas. The default mode network subtype is characterized by behavioral signatures that are similar to the other subtypes exhibiting activation with task-positive regions. These findings demonstrate that the same perceptual decision-making task is accomplished through multiple brain activation patterns.

Here, the authors build an encoding model to partition variability, revealing heterogeneous source contributions to individual units and state-dependent changes of variability across the visual hierarchy. 
 Influenced by non-stationary factors such as brain states and behavior, neurons exhibit substantial response variability even to identical stimuli. However, it remains unclear how their relative impact on neuronal variability evolves over time. To address this question, we designed an encoding model conditioned on latent states to partition variability in the mouse visual cortex across internal brain dynamics, behavior, and external visual stimulus. Applying a hidden Markov model to local field potentials, we consistently identified three distinct oscillation states, each with a unique variability profile. Regression models within each state revealed a dynamic composition of factors influencing spiking variability, with the dominant factor switching within seconds. The state-conditioned regression model uncovered extensive diversity in source contributions across units, varying in accordance with anatomical hierarchy and internal state. This heterogeneity in encoding underscores the importance of partitioning variability over time, particularly when considering the influence of non-stationary factors on sensory processing. How various factors dynamically influence neuronal variability is a longstanding question.

Here the authors show that the lipogenic enzyme FASN enhances mutp53 protein stability to drive tumor growth by promoting mutp53 palmitoylation. 
 The tumor-suppressive function of p53 is frequently disrupted by mutations in cancers. Missense mutant p53 (mutp53) protein often stabilizes and accumulates to high levels in cancers to promote tumorigenesis through the gain-of-function (GOF) mechanism. Currently, the mechanism of mutp53 accumulation and GOF is incompletely understood. Here, we identify the lipogenic enzyme FASN as an important regulator of mutp53 accumulation and GOF. FASN interacts with mutp53 to enhance mutp53 palmitoylation, which inhibits mutp53 ubiquitination to promote mutp53 accumulation and GOF. Blocking FASN genetically or by small-molecule inhibitors suppresses mutp53 palmitoylation to inhibit mutp53 accumulation, which in turn inhibits the growth of mutp53 tumors in orthotopic and subcutaneous xenograft tumor models and transgenic mice, as well as the growth of human tumor organoids carrying mutp53. Our results reveal that mutp53 palmitoylation is an important mechanism underlying mutp53 accumulation and GOF, and targeting FASN is a potential therapeutic strategy for cancers carrying mutp53.

Here, using cryo-EM, the authors captured the occlusion of the BK channel pore by the N-terminus of the β2 subunit. 
 BK channels are large-conductance calcium (Ca2+)-activated potassium channels crucial for neuronal excitability, muscle contraction, and neurotransmitter release. The pore-forming (α) subunits co-assemble with auxiliary (β and γ) subunits that modulate their function. Previous studies demonstrated that the N-termini of β2-subunits can inactivate BK channels, but with no structural correlate. Here, we investigate BK β2-subunit inactivation using cryo-electron microscopy, electrophysiology and molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the β2 N-terminus occludes the pore only in the Ca2+-bound open state, via a ball-and-chain mechanism. The first three hydrophobic residues of β2 are crucial for occlusion, while the remainder of the N-terminus remains flexible. Neither the closed channel conformation obtained in the absence of Ca2+ nor an intermediate conformation found in the presence of Ca2+ show density for the N-terminus of the β2 subunit in their pore, likely due to narrower side access portals preventing their entry into the channel pore. The accessory β2 subunit was proposed to inactivate BK channels via the ball-and-chain model, but structural evidence was missing.

 Skeletal muscle is a heterogenous tissue comprised primarily of myofibers, commonly classified into three fiber types in humans: one “slow” (type 1) and two “fast” (type 2A and type 2X). However, heterogeneity between and within traditional fiber types remains underexplored. We applied transcriptomic and proteomic workflows to 1050 and 1038 single myofibers from human vastus lateralis, respectively. Proteomics was conducted in males, while transcriptomics included ten males and two females. We identify metabolic, ribosomal, and cell junction proteins, in addition to myosin heavy chain isoforms, as sources of multi-dimensional variation between myofibers. Furthermore, whilst slow and fast fiber clusters are identified, our data suggests that type 2X fibers are not phenotypically distinct to other fast fibers. Moreover, myosin heavy chain-based classifications do not adequately describe the phenotype of myofibers in nemaline myopathy. Overall, our data indicates that myofiber heterogeneity is multi-dimensional with sources of variation beyond myosin heavy chain isoforms.

 Coastal subsidence exacerbates relative sea level rise, making low-lying areas vulnerable to flooding. In Hawai’i, the contribution of vertical land motion has not been fully studied. This is critical for urban O’ahu, where infrastructure is on low-lying coastal areas with varying sedimentary consolidation. Here we processed Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data from 2006–2024 for the Hawaiian Islands, referencing them with Global Navigation Satellite System measurements to calculate subsidence rates. We also created a two-meter resolution digital elevation model for coastal O’ahu using 2007–2013 Federal Light Detection and Ranging data, which included hydro-enforcement and gap filling with reprocessed data. Using this elevation data and vertical land motion measurements, we numerically modeled flood exposure. Results suggest that while island-wide subsidence on O’ahu is about 0.6 ± 0.6 mm/yr, the south shore has localized rates exceeding 25.0 ± 1.0 mm/yr. This subsidence, which is much faster than Hawaii’s long-term sea level rise rate (1.54 mm/yr since 1905), could expand flood exposure by up to 53% by 2050 in the Mapunapuna industrial region. Accounting for subsidence compresses the timeline for flood preparedness by up to 50 years, emphasizing the need to integrate these insights into planning and policy for sustainable development and flood mitigation.

 The vertical diffusivity in the ocean is known to vary widely across the global ocean, and understanding this variation is essential for simulating water mass transformation and global ocean circulation. Here, we propose an approach combining a global ocean circulation model with a steady-state tracer model to estimate the global distribution of vertical diffusivity, including in the deep ocean. This method reveals very small values in most regions of the upper ocean and patchy high values in localized areas, as well as higher values in the deeper ocean. These results highlight the necessity of larger mixing coefficients than those suggested by observational estimates in the deep ocean to realistically reproduce observed temperature and salinity distributions in models. This discrepancy regarding the deep ocean mixing warrants further investigation through both model and observational studies.

 Observations of mesoscale eddy structures rely heavily on satellite altimetry data. However, due to altimetry's coarse spatial resolution, the fine structure of eddy dynamics remains mysterious. Using high spatiotemporal resolution observations from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), we reveal the fine structure and hourly dynamics of the eddy surface flow velocities, as well as the horizontal eddy transport processes. The sea surface flow field retrieved by the dense optical flow algorithm from the GOCI was consistent with the results derived from satellite altimetry data but had a much higher spatial resolution (500 m), which makes it feasible to capture the fine structure of eddy dynamics. Additionally, the hourly observations exposed rapid variations of the eddy kinetic energy and the horizontal advection transport of surface phytoplankton.

 Planting density and leaf angle are important factors related to rice growth and yield through interplant competition. Despite the necessity of understanding the dynamics of interplant competition according to planting density and leaf angle, detailed physiological changes throughout the growth cycle remain less clear due to the requirement for field surveys that are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and its physiological quantum yield (ΦF) have shown its capability for plant physiological investigations and can provide new opportunities for improved monitoring of crop physiological dynamics. However, it is uncertain whether ΦF can quantify the impact of agronomic differences on the vegetative and reproductive growth of crops. In this study, we aim to explore whether ΦF can quantify physiological dynamics in rice of different leaf angle distributions under varying planting density levels. We conducted an experiment of four different planting densities (11.2×104, 15.2×104,18.2×104, 24.2×104 hills/ha) with two cultivars of different leaf angle distributions (i.e., erectophile and semi-erectophile leaf angle distribution) in a rice paddy. We measured ΦF and collected agronomic data to monitor plant physiological and structural changes. ΦF quantified the downregulation of photosynthetic activity at higher planting density plots during the vegetative growth period (a significant correlation between ΦF and rate of LAI increase, R2 = 0.62, p-value<0.05) and indicated differences in grain yield, which was dominantly driven by the limited carbon sink (a significant correlation between ΦF and yield, R2 = 0.44, p-value<0.1). Particularly, ΦF showed different patterns of the planting density impact on yield between the two cultivars confirming the effect of leaf angle distribution on the interplant competition or the light. Our findings showed that ΦF not only captures the difference in vegetative growth but also in reproductive growth and grain yield. This study demonstrated the importance of ΦF for physiological investigations in agroecosystems and the potential for estimating crop productivity during the grain-filling stage as well as for improved crop yield estimation."

 Gully erosion cause soil organic matter loss, which poses a grave threat to food security and regional ecological sustainability. Remote sensing monitoring and information extraction of gully erosion are of great significance to protect cultivated land resources and agricultural production. To improve the extraction accuracy of gully erosion, multi-level random forest (RF) extraction model based on object-based image analysis (OBIA) is proposed to extract gully erosion information.

 This paper Introduces a novel method for Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) image classification using a Complex-Valued Multiscale Attention Vision Transformer (CV-MsAtViT). The model incorporates a complex-valued multiscale feature fusion mechanism, a complex-valued attention block, and a Complex-Valued Vision Transformer (CV-ViT) to effectively capture spatial and polarimetric features from PolSAR data. The multiscale fusion block enhances feature extraction, while the attention mechanism prioritizes critical features, and the CV-ViT processes data in the complex domain, preserving both amplitude and phase information. Experimental results on benchmark PolSAR datasets, including Flevoland, San Francisco, and Oberpfaffenhofen, show that CV-MsAtViT achieves superior classification accuracy, with an overall accuracy (OA) of 98.35% on the Flevoland dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art models like PolSARFormer. The model also demonstrates efficient computational performance, minimizing the number of parameters while preserving high accuracy.

 Numerical models frequently cannot accurately predict warm-sector heavy rainfall (WSHR) in South China, which presents a challenge in forecasting severe weather events in the region. Considering the substantial impact of complex orography on the forecasting of WSHR in South China, to improve the accuracy of numerical models in predicting WSHR, this study utilized the non-hydrostatic mesoscale numerical model Weather Research Forecast (WRF) to simulate a WSHR event in the Pearl River Delta from 12:00 UTC on May 9, 2022, to 12:00 UTC on May 11, 2022. The modulation effect of Turbulent Orographic Form Drag (TOFD) on the prediction accuracy of the WSHR was investigated through sensitivity tests. The simulations suggest that TOFD improved the forecasting accuracy for WSHR in South China. TOFD significantly impacted the intensity and location of WSHR in the Pearl River Delta region. After incorporating TOFD, the forecast accuracy of WSHR improved in some regions (such as Guangzhou). Specifically, in the Pearl River Delta region, the TS score for 6-h heavy precipitation (>100 mm) increases by 91.12 %. The precipitation center shifts eastward, and the area affected by WSHR expands. Furthermore, the incorporation of TOFD in the simulations resulted in a delay of the WSHR onset time by 1–2 h and an extension of its duration by 1 h. Both these improvements brought the model results closer to actual observations. Additionally, with the inclusion of TOFD, the weakening of southerly winds has led to enhanced wind field convergence and stronger moisture convergence, resulting in increased moisture. In warm and moist atmospheric environments, there was an extended period of energy accumulation, resulting in a thicker mixed layer, increased negative buoyancy, and intensified upward airflow. As the system continued to move eastward, incorporating TOFD resulted in a further eastward positioning of the WSHR. Additionally, the intensity of the WSHR was stronger and the duration of intense precipitation was longer. The study highlights the critical role of TOFD in the realistic representation of WSHR by numerical models for South China."

 The optical properties of brown carbon (BrC) and their correlation with chemical characteristics remained inadequately understood in different regions worldwide. This study investigated the correlations and estimated the subsequent radiative effects using real-time measurements during wintertime in the Sichuan Basin, China. The average light absorption of BrC (AbsBrC) at 370 nm constituted 35.5 ± 8.2 % of total absorption, significantly higher than those at 470 nm (20.9 ± 4.3 %), 590 nm (14.0 ± 2.5 %), and 660 nm (7.7 ± 2.1 %) (p < 0.001). The contributions of various organic aerosol (OA) sources to AbsBrC varied by wavelength, with biomass-burning OA (BBOA) and semi-volatile oxygenated OA (SVOOA) exhibiting the higher Abs (14.4 Mm−1 and 13.5 Mm−1), absorption Ångström exponents (AAE) (4.81 and 4.35), and contributions to AbsBrC (24.4 % and 22.8 %). Additionally, secondary BrC likely formed from BBOA through aqueous-phase reactions during winter. The transport of BBOA and SVOOA from northern regions (i.e., Guang'an in Sichuan and Hechuan in Chongqing) significantly contributed to elevated Abs370,BrC levels. The mean simple forcing efficiency for BrC (SFEBrC) was 60.5 W g−1, accounting for 14 % of SFEBC in the 370–880 nm range during winter. Overall, this study enhanced the understanding of AbsBrC and its evolution with sources, providing a more accurate assessment of its radiative effects, and emphasized the importance of biomass burning emissions."

 An accurate numerical weather prediction (NWP) model for the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) has remained a demand of society, agriculture, energy sectors, policy makers, and urban planners. Even miniscule inaccuracies in initial and boundary conditions and associated parameterizations can cause errors in NWP forecasts. The combination of factors such as synoptic scale airmass exchange, convergence, lifting, subsidence, convection initiation, and cloud formation cause frontal systems to be particularly complex with respect to ABL kinematics and thermodynamics. Though previous studies provided extensive information on surface fronts, empirical evidence of the horizontal and vertical variability in front-relative daytime ABL thermodynamic features remained underexplored. We investigated the impacts of frontal passages on daytime ABL thermodynamics during summer and winter across three regions of the continental US using in-situ aircraft measurements of state variables. Results revealed that ABL moisture heterogeneity during frontal passages may occur due to terrain heterogeneity, front-induced precipitation and subsequent soil moisture impacts, and synoptic scale mixing near frontal boundaries. The vertical contrasts in moisture between the ABL and overlying free troposphere were larger in the warm sectors than the cold sectors for most cases due to cold air advection and enhanced turbulent mixing near the front. The vertical contrasts in moisture did not yield a clear pattern based on sector, meaning that the vertical moisture structures in our cases depended on the properties of the individual airmasses. Our findings on front-relative ABL thermodynamic features provide unprecedented information which could help improve parameterizations for more accurate NWP for frontal ABL regimes."

Moreover, suitable reservoirs and seals required for economic H2accumulations to form are readily available in rift-inversion orogens but are likely absent during bulk serpentinization in rift settings.

These states are associated with destructive behaviors in layered oxide cathodes, including local structural distortion, cationic disordering, and oxygen gas evolution. In this study, we suppress first-cycle voltage hysteresis and irreversible O2evolution in Li-rich oxide cathodes through covalency competition induced by the substitution of electropositive groups. We found that the nonequivalent electron distribution within an asymmetric MA-O-MBbackbone (metal-to-metal charge transfer via oxygen ligands) increases electron density on electronegative transition metal ions, preventing them from reaching unstable oxidation states within an operating voltage range. This phenomenon is observed across diverse transition metal combinations, providing insights into controlling unnecessary oxygen redox activity. Our findings open new avenues for controlling intrinsic redox chemistry and enabling the rational design of high–energy density Li-rich oxide cathodes."

To test this proposal, we introduced algal particulate matter (APM) to marine sediments underlying a modern marine oxygen minimum zone with bottom-water oxygen concentrations approximating those of the late Neoproterozoic water column. We found that under anoxia, APM significantly stimulated microbial eukaryote gene expression, particularly genes involved in anaerobic energy metabolism and phagocytosis, and increased the relative abundance of 18SrRNA from known predatory clades. We additionally confirmed that APM promoted the reproduction of benthic foraminifera under anoxia with higher-than-expected net growth efficiencies. Overall, our findings suggest that algal biomass exported to the Neoproterozoic benthos stimulated the ecology of benthic predatory protists under anoxia, thereby creating more modern food webs by enhancing the transfer of fixed carbon and energy to eukaryotes occupying higher trophic levels, including the earliest benthic metazoans."

Yet, wildfires rely on the availability of ignition and fuel, which are underrepresented in fire forecast and prediction practices. By analyzing satellite measurements and atmospheric reanalysis, here we show that near-surface weather only partially captures wildfire occurrence and intensity across the daily to seasonal timescales. Beyond near-surface weather, convection and fuel abundance play a complementary role in regulating burning processes. Specifically, enhanced atmospheric convection is identified for over 40% of the low-human-impact regions and 61% of global burnable areas during wildfire ignition and spreading periods. Meanwhile, 56% of shrublands and 54% of grasslands see higher fuel load with actual occurrence of fire. Our results highlight the role of convection and fuel in wildfire forecast, prompting a revisit of wildfire prediction under intertwined atmospheric and terrestrial changes."

However, the exact time course and regional distribution of reinstatement and transformation during recognition memory have remained unclear. We applied representational similarity analysis to human intracranial electroencephalography to track the spatiotemporal dynamics underlying the reinstatement and transformation of memory traces. Specifically, we examined how reinstatement and transformation of item-specific representations across occipital, ventral visual, and lateral parietal cortices contribute to successful memory formation and recognition. Our findings suggest that reinstatement in temporal cortex and transformation in parietal cortex coexist and provide complementary strategies for recognition. Further, we find that generalization and differentiation of neural representations contribute to memory and probe memory-specific correspondence with deep neural network (DNN) model features. Our results suggest that memory formation is particularly supported by generalized and mnemonic representational formats beyond the visual features of a DNN."

However, its clinical translation is impeded by poor performance of lysosomal escape and tumor targeting. This challenge is especially prominent in glioblastoma (GBM) therapy, necessitating the penetration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Leveraging the intrinsic tumor-targeting and BBB traversing capability of human H-ferritin, we designed a series of ferritin variants with positively charged cavity and truncated carboxyl terminus, termed tHFn(+). These nanocarriers respond to weak acid and disassemble in endosomal compartments, exposing the internal positive charges to facilitate the lysosomal escape of loaded small interfering RNA (siRNA). Functioning as universal siRNA nanocarriers, tHFn(+) significantly enhanced the uptake of different siRNAs and suppressed gene expressions associated with GBM progression. Furthermore, tHFn(+) traversed the BBB and targeted glioma in vivo by binding to its receptors (e.g., transferrin receptor 1). tHFn(+)-delivered siRNAs exhibited exceptional therapeutic effects against glioma in vivo, advancing RNAi therapeutics beyond GBM for the treatment of various diseases."

Typically, the industrially zeolite-catalyzed methanol dehydration to DME occurs at temperatures above 423 kelvin. Improving catalytic reactivity and reducing energy consumption are urgently needed but remain challenging. Here, we report an unexplored associative strategy to realize DME formation at room temperature and the generation of olefins even at 413 kelvin, which is achieved by coinjecting basic acetone to manipulate the local chemical microenvironment of the methanol reactant inside the H-ZSM-5 zeolite. The crucial role of acetone in accelerating methanol direct dehydration to DME is highlighted as the obvious destabilization effect for the adsorbed methanol cluster with strong hydrogen bonds and the subsequent traction of water during DME formation. These findings offer more insights into the rational design of reaction systems by manipulating the local surroundings to regulate catalytic performances and should represent a large step forward in methanol conversion technology."

We show that for exchange rates spanning more than four orders of magnitude, one can still selectively excite spins undergoing exchange while suppressing static resonances. Generalizing this approach, to selectively excite (or selectively preserve) only members of an ensemble that have undergone exchange or rearrangement, has the potential to improve the analytical power of many spectroscopic techniques."

Disrupting histone recycling to either the leading or lagging strand induces asymmetric histone inheritance, affecting epigenome maintenance and cellular identity. However, the order and kinetics of these effects remain elusive. Here, we use inducible mutants to dissect the early and late consequences of impaired histone recycling. Simultaneous disruption of both leading (POLE4) and lagging strand (MCM2-2A) recycling pathways impairs the transmission of parental histones to newly synthesized DNA, releasing some parental histones to the soluble pool. Subsequently, H3K27me3 accumulates aberrantly during chromatin restoration in a manner preceding gene expression changes. Loss of histone inheritance and the ensuing chromatin restoration defects alter gene expression in embryonic stem cells and challenge differentiation programs and cell viability. Our findings demonstrate the importance of efficient transmission of histone-based information during DNA replication for maintaining chromatin landscapes, differentiation potential, and cellular viability."

Herein, we show that TPE-Gal, which contains a tetraphenylethene unit and a galactose moiety, offers a promising molecular therapy designed to light up and eliminate senescent cells through a hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by β-galactosidase, an enzyme overexpressed in senescent cells. The reaction produces TPE-OH, which, in turn, increases reactive oxygen species levels within the senescent cells, leading to noninflammatory apoptosis of senescent cells. This targeted clearance mechanism helps to alleviate osteoporosis symptoms and promotes bone injury healing.

To address this, we used immunopeptidomic analysis and RNA sequencing on five metastatic OC samples, which identified 311 cryptic peptides (40 to 83 per patient). Despite comprising less than 1% of total peptides, cryptic peptides from noncoding transcripts emerged as the predominant antigen class when compared to the other major classes of known tumor-specific and tumor-associated antigens in OC samples. Notably, nearly 70% of the prioritized cryptic peptides elicited T cell activation, as evidenced by increased 4-1BB and IFN-γ expression in autologous CD8+T cells.

However, in the wound-induced hair neogenesis (WIHN) model of skin regeneration, wounds regenerate hair follicles if tissue rigidity is optimal. Although WIHN depends on Wnt signaling, whether Wnt performs a mechanoregulatory role that contributes to regeneration remains uncharacterized. Here, we demonstrate that Wnt signaling affects mechanosensitivity at both cellular and tissue levels to drive WIHN. Atomic force microscopy revealed an attenuated substrate rigidity response in epidermal but not dermal cells of healing wounds. Super-resolution microscopy and nanoneedle probing of intracellular compartments in live human keratinocytes revealed that Wnt-induced chromatin remodeling triggers a 10-fold drop in nuclear rigidity without jeopardizing the nucleocytoskeletal mechanical coupling. Mechanistically, Wnt signaling orchestrated a massive reorganization of actin architecture and recruited adherens junctions to generate a mechanical syncytium—a cohesive contractile unit with superior capacity for force coordination and collective durotaxis. Collectively, our findings unveil Wnt signaling’s mechanoregulatory role that manipulates the machinery of mechanotransduction to drive regeneration."

Here, we unveil a single-protein mechanism for ionic strength sensing and mitigation in animal cells, one that is notably different from the analogous high osmolarity glycerol kinase cascade in yeast. The Rel family transcription factor NFAT5 directly senses intracellular ionic strength using a C-terminal prion-like domain (PLD). In response to elevated intracellular ionic strength, this PLD is necessary and sufficient to coordinate an adaptive gene expression program by recruiting the transcriptional coactivator BRD4. The purified NFAT5 PLD forms condensates in response to elevated solution ionic strength in vitro, and human NFAT5 alone is sufficient to reconstitute a mammalian transcriptional response to ionic stress in yeast. We propose that ion-sensitive conformational changes in a PLD directly regulate transcription to maintain ionic strength homeostasis in animal cells."

Consequently, establishing the appropriate microglial numbers during development is crucial for ensuring normal cortical function. Here, we uncovered a dynamic relationship between pyramidal cells and microglia that tunes microglial numbers and development through distinct phases of mouse postnatal development. Changes in pyramidal cell activity during development induce differential release of activity-dependent proteins such as Activin A, which, in turn, adjusts microglial numbers accordingly. Decoupling of this relationship not only changes microglial numbers but has a long-term consequence on their role as synaptic organizers, which ultimately affects cortical function.

Calin,The mutational landscape and functional effects of noncoding ultraconserved elements in human cancers,"The mutational landscape of phylogenetically ultraconserved elements (UCEs), especially those in noncoding DNAs (ncUCEs), and their functional relevance in cancers remain poorly characterized. Here, we perform a systematic analysis of whole-genome and in-house targeted UCE sequencing datasets from more than 3000 patients with cancer of 13,736 UCEs and demonstrate that ncUCE somatic alterations are common. Using a multiplexed CRISPR knockout screen in colorectal cancer cells, we show that the loss of several altered ncUCEs significantly affects cell proliferation. In-depth functional studies in vitro and in vivo further reveal that specific ncUCEs can be enhancers of tumor suppressors (such as ARID1B) and silencers of oncogenic proteins (such as RPS13). Moreover, several miRNAs located in ncUCEs are recurrently mutated. Mutations in miR-142 locus can affect the Drosha-mediated processing of precursor miRNAs, resulting in the down-regulation of the mature transcript. These results provide systematic evidence that specific ncUCEs play diverse regulatory roles in cancer."

The current approaches are difficult in effectively inducing TLS formation, let alone fully exploiting its anticancer efficacy. Here, a biomimetic nanovesicle (ADU-S@M1) is constructed to target tumors and then to produce abundant activated antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in situ by polarizing the tumor-associated macrophages toward M1 phenotype and promoting dendritic cell maturation. These activated APCs effectively initiate the TLS de novo neogenesis by acting as lymphoid tissue inducer cells that secrete lymphotoxin α and tumor necrosis factor α while normalizing the intratumoral vasculatures. In addition, they induce robust in situ adaptive immune responses by presenting the antigens released from the M1 cell–destroyed tumors and transporting them to the nearby TLS. Therefore, the development of tumors in mice, especially immune-cold tumors, was efficiently prevented, providing a promising strategy for promoting cancer immunotherapy."

Most α-helical membrane proteins require protein-conducting insertases known as translocons to assist in their membrane insertion and folding. While the sequence-dependent propensities for a helix to either translocate through the translocon or insert into the membrane have been codified into numerical hydrophobicity scales, the corresponding propensity to partition into the membrane interface remains unrevealed. By engineering diagnostic glycosylation sites around test peptide sequences inserted into a host protein, we devised a system that can differentiate between water-soluble, surface-bound, and transmembrane (TM) states of the sequence based on its glycosylation pattern. Using this system, we determined the sequence-dependent propensities for transfer from the translocon to a TM, interfacial, or extramembrane space and compared these propensities with the corresponding probability distributions determined from the sequences and structures of experimentally determined proteins."

Previous estimates on internal tides focused regionally spanning a decade, leaving a knowledge gap regarding their long-term global behavior, especially over centuries. Because of limited long-term observations, a critical question arises: How will global warming affect internal tides? Using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and the High-Resolution Empirical Tidal (HRET) model, we identify a robust accelerating trend in globally averaged internal tide speeds. This trend, increasing from historical rates (0.4 centimeters per second per decade) to future projections (2.0 centimeters per second per decade), is primarily driven by intensified upper-ocean stratification, with background currents playing a secondary role. Our findings suggest that internal tides propagate faster in a warming climate, potentially influencing energy cascade and marine biological productivity."

In this work, we reveal that poorly understood TRAM-LAG1-CLN8 domain (TLCD)–containing proteins are phospholipid remodeling enzymes. We demonstrate that TLCD1 is an evolutionarily conserved lysophosphatidylethanolamine acyltransferase, which regulates cellular phospholipid composition and generates previously undescribed fatty acid and thiamine (vitamin B1) esters as its secondary products. Furthermore, we establish that human TLCD protein CLN8, mutations of which cause fatal neurodegenerative Batten disease, is a lysophosphatidylglycerol acyltransferase. We show that CLN8 catalyzes the essential step in the biosynthesis of bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate, a phospholipid critical for lysosome function. Our study unveils a family of acyltransferases integral to cellular membrane phospholipid homeostasis and human disease."
