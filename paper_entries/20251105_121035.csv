10.1088/1748-9326/adfbff,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要探讨了平流层气溶胶注入（SAI）这种太阳气候干预措施对奢侈作物（如葡萄、咖啡和可可）生长条件的影响。论文通过比较有SAI和没有SAI的气候模拟结果，评估了SAI是否能有效维持或改善这些作物的生长条件。研究发现，尽管SAI可以稳定或降低地表温度，但由于自然变率的影响，不同模拟结果之间存在较大差异，尤其是在降水和湿度方面。因此，SAI并不一定能稳定地改善奢侈作物的生长条件。论文强调了在评估SAI对奢侈作物潜在影响时，考虑自然变率的重要性。总的来说，该研究关注的是气候干预对农业的影响，而非直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI)', 'Climate Change', 'Agroclimatic Indices', 'Luxury Crops', 'Temperature', 'Precipitation', 'Humidity']",Ariel L Morrison;Elizabeth A Barnes;James W Hurrell;Daniel M Hueholt,Macroclimate growing conditions for luxury crops after stratospheric aerosol injection,"Luxury crops such as grapes, coffee, and cacao have immense economic and cultural importance in many regions. Climate change is affecting growing conditions across the globe. Natural climate variability may exacerbate the impact of increasing temperature and shifting precipitation patterns, leading to large interannual variations in yields, potentially resulting in revenue loss. Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), a form of solar climate intervention, has been proposed to potentially slow or reduce future surface temperature increases. Few studies have assessed how SAI may affect luxury crop growing conditions; none have done so in the context of natural variability. We compare daily and monthly output from two 10-member SAI simulations with a non-SAI simulation to assess how luxury crop growing conditions may change with and without SAI. For each year from 2036–2045 we use a composite of agroclimatic indices to determine whether a year has suitable conditions. We find that these SAI scenarios do not robustly preserve luxury crop growing conditions, despite stabilizing or reducing surface temperature increases compared to a scenario without SAI. Natural variability leads to a large spread in outcomes across ensemble members, due in large part to highly variable precipitation and humidity responses to SAI between members. In only six of the 18 regions assessed here do growing conditions improve in all climate realizations under SAI compared to the non-SAI scenario. Here, reducing disease risk is a key way that SAI improves luxury crop growing conditions. There is also a large inter-ensemble member spread in 2036–2045 revenue under SAI, underscoring the importance of including natural variability when assessing SAI’s potential influence on luxury crops. The signal is strongest in the SAI scenario with a lower temperature target, highlighting that scenario choice is also crucial in determining suitability for growing luxury crops under SAI."

Impacts of wildfires on forest carbon uptake are substantially varied by tree compositions, however, the loss of carbon uptake capability across different forest types remains uncertain. Here, we tracked post-fire changes in gross primary production (GPP) across five forest types in Siberia, namely, evergreen needleleaf forests (ENF), deciduous needleleaf forests (DNF), deciduous broadleaf forests (DBF), mixed forests (MF), and woody savannas (WSVN), using satellite-based observation data from 2001 to 2023. Results revealed substantial reductions in GPP after wildfire followed by gradual recovery except DBF. The GPP changes one year after wildfire (ΔGPP1yr) and recovery rates of GPP notably differed by forest types. In ENF, ΔGPP1yr reached −63.4 g C m−2yr−1, which is larger than that in MF, DNF, and WSVN by −20.6, −31.3, and −42.7 g C m−2 yr−1, respectively. Consistently, the GPP recovery rate is the lowest in ENF, at 63.7%. Furthermore, significant decreasing trends in 5-year mean of ΔGPP1 yr in DNF, MF, and WSVN exceed −1.0 g C m−2yr−1 yr−1, indicating intensified impacts of increased wildfire intensity and/or extent on forest carbon. Our findings highlight the urgent need for establishing fire management and forest recovery strategies adapted to different forest types to enhance ecosystem resilience."

Marine enhanced rock weathering (mERW) seeks to accelerate this process by distributing fast-weathering silicate minerals like olivine in coastal environments, thus targeting deliberate carbon dioxide removal. However, the efficiency and environmental impact of mERW remain uncertain, as experimental studies are not capable of tracking the CO2 sequestration rate and ecological effects over sufficiently long timescales. Natural coastal environments with olivine-rich sands enable insight into long-term weathering and may serve as analogues envisioned for mERW applications. Papakōlea Beach (Hawai’i) is one of the few beaches across the world with olivine-rich sands (>80% by weight), thus providing a unique mERW analogue. We examined in situ weathering and biogeochemical cycling at Papakōlea as well as in the nearby mixed volcanic/coral sands of Richardson Ocean Park. Flow-through sediment incubations examined olivine dissolution kinetics, alkalinity release, and the fate of weathering products. High-resolution scans of weathered grains characterized olivine dissolution and surface alteration processes. Alkalinity generation from Papakōlea’s olivine sands and carbonate dissolution in Richardson Ocean Park was observed alongside dissolved inorganic carbon increases, suggesting CO2 sequestration occurs in this near-shore marine setting. However, complex biogeochemical interactions impede a precise quantification of olivine dissolution. Our findings highlight the complexity and challenges of monitoring, reporting, and verification for mERW applications in dynamic coastal settings."

The objective of this study was to quantify the spatial and temporal variability of HMFs to inform managed aquifer recharge (MAR), accounting for water rights, instream flow requirements, and coastal inflows. Texas, USA, was selected as the study area due to its climate-driven water stress, rising water demand, and the availability of detailed data on legal constraints. Volumes of HMFs (defined as ⩾ 95th percentile) were calculated for 190 streamflow monitoring gages in all 23 river basins in Texas (1968–2022). Water availability models and coastal inflow requirements were used to consider limitations to HMF availability for permitted use, including water rights, environmental flows, and coastal inflows for select major river basins. Results show that HMFs averaged 31% of total flows across all stations in the state. Of these HMFs, 52% of flows were unappropriated (not reserved for water rights holders), representing 12% of total flows. The mean annual volume of unappropriated HMFs was 81 Mm3 (∼0.07 million acre-feet). Mean annual unappropriated HMF volumes increased by a factor of 100 from semi-arid West Texas to humid southeast Texas, with variability driven by basin climate and watershed size. Environmental flow requirements generally did not significantly reduce the unappropriated HMFs as they were accommodated by flow reserved for downstream senior water rights. However, coastal inflow requirements limited permittable HMF volumes, especially in the semiarid Colorado River basin which includes high urban water demand up-basin. When considering volumes of HMFs that may be considered ‘available’, it is essential to consider limitations to the amount of flows that could be permitted. This study provides a template for assessing HMFs for MAR that considers water rights, environmental flows, and coastal inflow requirements that could be generally applied in many regions (particularly the western US) to address climate extremes."

This paper systematically reviews the existing literature on stranded assets, presenting four core findings. First, the notion of stranded assets has matured from a narrow focus on ‘impaired assets’ to a comprehensive framework encompassing stranded resources, stranded capital, and stranded paper, driven by factors including unburnable carbon constraints, transition-risk policies, physical climate damages, and environmental liability attribution. Second, scale assessments typically combine top–down scenario design under stringent carbon budgets with bottom–up model construction. Third, stranded assets inflict significant financial shocks on fossil fuel upstream and downstream firms and transmit risk to the broader financial system via institutional investor exposures and systemic vulnerabilities; uneven regional risk distribution and intergenerational and international equity concerns may further trigger political risks. Finally, mitigation strategies involve portfolio optimization, accelerated renewable energy deployment, enhanced climate risk disclosure, and macroprudential policy tools. Future research should deepen the comprehensive quantification of multiple asset types, conduct micro-level empirical analyses, implement short-term dynamic monitoring, and develop equitable distribution mechanisms to support precise risk management and effective low-carbon transition decision-making."

Here, we assessed historic and recent remnant woody vegetation loss and protection across Queensland, Australia’s most biodiverse state. By comparing the proportion of remnant woody vegetation loss with the extent of formally PAs across 13 bioregions and 116 subregions, we generate a balanced evaluation of conservation progress and apply a risk classification framework. We found that Queensland has lost 21.4% of its original woody vegetation since European colonisation, with only 9.6% currently protected. Importantly, one-fifth of this loss occurred between 2000 and 2018, despite protection more than doubling during the same period. Our results show that protection gains were concentrated in low-risk regions, while areas with considerable historical loss, such as the Brigalow Belt and Mulga Lands, continued to experience clearing and low protection gains. By 2018, 44% of subregions fell into high or very high-risk categories, while only 15% were classified as not at risk. The risk status for most subregions remained unchanged, which suggests that limited conservation progress has been achieved in high-pressure landscapes. Our findings highlight the limitations of using protected area expansion alone as a metric of conservation progress. A balance-sheet approach tracking both protection and loss can provide a more robust framework for evaluating conservation outcomes. This type of balance-sheet framework can support more effective conservation planning, including restoration and stricter land-clearing controls. Our results offer practical insights for aligning national actions with global biodiversity targets, such as those outlined in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework."

This study investigated the link between the recent (1980–2020) decline in freshwater availability and anthropogenic climate change using formal detection and attribution analysis. Water availability, defined as the difference between precipitation (P) and evapotranspiration (E), is assessed using a simple yet efficient Budyko-based hydrological model. Using the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology Earth System Model which is tailored to perform well in simulating climate in this region, we demonstrate that observed water availability decline (−5.60 mm yr−1, p < 0.001) falls decisively outside the range of natural climate variability (−0.50–0.48 mm yr−1 from 1000 control simulations). The spatial correlation between observations and historical simulations exceeds 99.7% of natural variability patterns, providing strong evidence for anthropogenic influence. States like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal, home to one-third of the country’s population, show significant decreases in freshwater availability beyond those expected from natural climate variability alone and are consistent with anthropogenic climate change."

Fertilized soils are a major source of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent GHG. Reducing N2O emissions is a key interest for many countries, including Denmark, where approximately 90% of N2O emissions originate from agricultural soils. Although the link between nitrogen (N) fertilization and N2O emissions is well-known, quantitative evidence for the efficiency of mitigation options in the relevant local context is scarce. This is often due to high flux variation over time scales ranging from hours to a few days. Previous studies have mostly neglected to perform measurements that could to account for this variation. Furthermore, reducing N2O fluxes can result in increased losses through ammonia (NH3) volatilization and N leaching, as well as reduced yields. Thus, establishing tangible mitigation strategies requires a holistic understanding of N2O fluxes in the context of the annual, field-scale N balance, translation of findings into modeling approaches, use of models to identify emission hotspots, and scaling interventions from the field to regional and national levels. Here, we introduce the SmartField initiative, which aims to reduce national N2O emissions in Denmark by 20%–30% by 2030 by testing and providing verified, field-tested mitigation options. The initiative includes accurate and transparent N2O emissions accounting at the field, farm, and national levels and a setup to test management technologies for N2O emissions. It also involves developing a monitoring, reporting, and verification system for N2O emissions based on a Tier 3 methodology. Furthermore, SmartField collaborates closely with farmers, value chain actors, and policy makers to identify synergies and trade-offs between reducing GHG emissions and their effects on the environment, food production, and farm profitability."

This study examines a more recent and noteworthy case in late summer 2021 in which substantial sea ice loss followed a period of surface meteorological extremes in the Beaufort Sea region of the Arctic. We focus on the period from mid-August to mid-September 2021 that coincided with the Office of Naval Research THINICE Pilot Field Campaign and investigate stormy and windy conditions with respect to air-sea processes impacting sea ice conditions. We find that during the stormy first half of the campaign, cyclone-induced energy fluxes into the marginal ice zone and surrounding waters preconditioned the ice pack for more rapid melt later in the campaign. The second half of the campaign, in contrast, was marked by non-cyclone wind events that enhanced turbulent (namely sensible) heat fluxes into the ice and upper ocean that increased melt. Moreover, this latter period had enhanced advection of the Beaufort Sea ice pack into above-freezing waters, increasing bottom melt to >1 cm d−1 over the remainder of the campaign. While findings are shown to vary by surface type and at relatively small (i.e. ice-floe) scales, insights are offered on the roles of late summer coupled processes on rapid ice loss events in today’s Arctic environment."

FOSW remains an emerging technology with significant uncertainty surrounding its future development. We estimate the electricity output, levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and levelized cost of transmission (LCOT) for two locations in California where offshore wind projects are currently planned (Humboldt and Morro Bay). We use data collected in a prior extensive expert elicitation, complemented by publicly available data. Assuming a 30 year lifetime and a 5.69% discount rate for the offshore components, and a 60 year lifetime and 4.40% discount rate for onshore transmission infrastructure, and under the ranges of input values provided by the experts, we find that the 2035 median levelized costs of energy and transmission (LCOE + LCOT) range from $95 to $121 per MWh. Operation and maintenance costs, turbines, and floating foundations are the largest contributors to levelized costs. In addition to a base-case analysis, we perform single-parameter sensitivity analyses and show that the results are highly sensitive to discount rate, lifetime, and farm power density. To further understand the overall uncertainty, we perform a Monte Carlo simulation assuming uniform distributions for each component-cost, finding combined LCOE + LCOT ranging from $95 to $200 per MWh. For all scenarios, transmission represents a small portion of total project costs. This analysis emphasizes the importance of strategic planning and investment in FOSW to meet California’s renewable energy goals."

Attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for tropospheric O3 is determined using surface measurements rather than satellite-derived column values. Using the Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping demographic and health variables, we identify underserved counties, those that lack adequate ambient air quality monitoring. We present a comprehensive method for optimizing AQS site placement by integrating satellite data from NASA’s Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring Pollution instrument, demographic indicators, and population density. We introduce the Integrated AQS Placement Index (IIAP), which combines normalized demographic overlap, satellite-measured HCHO or NO2 column values, and population density to prioritize future monitoring locations. Our analysis reveals significant monitoring gaps in the Eastern and Southeastern United States, notably in the ‘isoprene volcano’ region, as well as clusters along the I-95 corridor in the Northeast. These areas are characterized by high population, high concentrations of HCHO, which is an under-monitored carcinogen, and vulnerable demographic profiles. We identify existing AQS sites that could benefit from expanded species monitoring as an economical approach to comprehensive coverage.

In this study, we use a high-resolution, convection-permitting ensemble from the UK climate projections local dataset to explore how the spatiotemporal characteristics of heavy rainfall events may evolve across the UK. Adopting an event-based framework, we analyse 5 km hourly rainfall data from 12 ensemble members and compare changes in future rainfall events to those derived from applying intensity-based scaling factors alone. This comparison allows us to identify aspects of rainfall change that are not captured by shifts in intensity distributions. Our results show that short-duration winter events become increasingly localised, with peak intensities increasing by up to 47%, amplifying flash flood potential. In summer, rainfall events exhibit expanded spatial extents—expanding by 25%–40%—magnifying total precipitation volumes. While we find small changes in the number of clustered events (i.e. heavy rainfall events that occur within a 21 day window), there are large changes to the contribution these have to seasonal precipitation, particularly in summer (7%–11% in the baseline to 11%–16% in future period). These findings highlight new insights into how heavy rainfall may change under future climate conditions, identifying aspects of change beyond intensity increases alone that are relevant for informing current practice for flood risk estimation."

Furthermore, the ozone simulated by them are also obviously less sensitive to natural precursors than to anthropogenic sources. 
 Ozone (O3) is a Short-lived Climate Forcer (SLCF) that contributes to radiative forcing and indirectly affects the atmospheric lifetime of methane, a major greenhouse gas. This study investigates the sensitivity of global O3 to precursor gases in a clean atmosphere, where hydroxyl (OH) radical characteristics are more spatially uniform than in present-day conditions, using data from the PiClim experiments of the Aerosols and Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP) within the CMIP6 framework. We also evaluate the O3 simulation capabilities of four Earth system models (CESM2-WACCM, GFDL-ESM4, GISS-E2-1-G, and UKESM1-0-LL). Our analysis reveals that the CESM and GFDL models effectively capture seasonal O3 cycles and consistently simulate vertical O3 distribution. While all models successfully simulate O3 responses to anthropogenic precursor emissions, CESM and GFDL show limited sensitivity to enhanced natural NOx emissions (e.g., from lightning) compared to GISS and UKESM.The sensitivities of O3 to its natural precursors (NOx and VOCs) in GISS and UKESM models are substantially lower than their responses to anthropogenic emissions, particularly for lightning NOx sources. These findings refine our understanding of O3 sensitivity to natural precursors in clean atmospheres and provide insights for improving O3 predictions in Earth system models."

Using Sentinel-5P TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) data, we derived SO2 fluxes and estimated total emissions of 1.8 ± 0.2 Mt SO2, 19.4 ± 1.8 Mt CO2, 0.123 ± 0.005 Mt CO, 0.05 ± 0.01 Mt HCl, and 0.013 ± 0.002 Mt HF over the course of the eruption. These results are consistent with the mass balance derived from petrologic degassing estimates. This study demonstrates that high- and low-resolution FTIR and DOAS spectrometers, integrated within global monitoring networks, can provide quantitative constraints on volcanic gas composition and fluxes over large distances. Such capabilities are directly applicable to volcanic crisis monitoring, complementing dedicated networks, satellite observations and supporting improved assessments of volcanic impacts on the atmospheric composition at regional scales."

PM10 was higher in the northwest, lower in the northeast; urban areas had higher OP. Most sites showed peak PM10 and OP in winter, lowest in summer. Traffic, biomass burning, and coal combustion were major OP contributors. 
 The oxidative potential (OP) of particulate matter is a key driver of PM10-induced adverse health effects, triggering oxidative stress and inflammatory responses that increase respiratory and cardiovascular disease risks. To evaluate PM10 and its OP characteristics across China, samples were collected from twelve representative monitoring stations from June 2022 to May 2023. A deep learning model combining Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks (CNN-LSTM) was employed to reconstruct anomalous PM10 data, achieving R2 values of 0.8840 for test sets. Significant spatial variations in PM10 were observed, with highest concentrations in the northwestern regions (Xi'An: 98.20±52.92µgm-3, Dunhuang: 90.36±54.72µgm-3), the lowest in the northeast (Longfengshan: 40.04±24.04µgm-3, Dalian: 40.35±15.66µgm-3), and elevated levels in suburban areas (average: 85.43±46.69µgm-3). Urban sites showed the highest OP values (0.61±0.21nmolH2O2m-3), with significantly higher PM10 concentrations in northern regions compared to southern ones (p<0.05). Most sites exhibited peak PM10 and OP levels in winter and lowest in summer. Source apportionment using Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) revealed dust (13.2 %–27.4 %), secondary aerosols (6.9 %–36.2 %), traffic (16.6 %–21.4 %), and biomass burning (22 %–39.3 %) as main contributors to PM10.  Mass-normalized OP (OPm) analysis revealed traffic, biomass burning, and coal combustion sources showing consistently high values (0.008–0.022 nmol H2O2 µg−1). These findings highlight the need to control traffic, biomass burning, and coal combustion sources and other major sources to reduce OP and protect public health."

Mid-chain 3-OH-FAs were linked to microorganisms and regional secondary processes, while long-chain species were more associated with biomass burning and local secondary formation. These findings highlight distinct source pathways of 3-OH-FAs and provide insights into airborne endotoxins in urban environments. 
 Endotoxins, integral components of Gram-negative bacteria, are released into the atmosphere during bacterial fragmentation and pose health risks. This study investigated 3-hydroxy fatty acids (3-OH-FAs, C8–C18) in inhalable particles (PM10) from urban Tianjin, a coastal megacity in northern China, to estimate endotoxin levels utilizing ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS). Results revealed seasonal and altitudinal variations in 3-OH-FAs and endotoxin levels. Total endotoxin concentrations averaged 21.5 ng m−3 at near ground (2 m) and 16.1 ng m−3 at a higher altitude (220 m), corresponding to total 3-OH-FAs (C10–C18) concentrations of 2.8 and 2.0 ng m−3, respectively. Maximum endotoxin level (26.5 ng m−3) occurred near ground during winter, attributed to enhanced near-surface emissions. Bioactive endotoxins peaked at 12.4 ng m−3 near ground in winter, exceeding the exposure threshold, while averaging 8.1 ng m−3 in other seasons. Short- and mid-chain 3-OH-FAs (C8–C13) exhibited significant correlations with meteorological factors (e.g., temperature, humidity, and wind speed) at both altitudes, indicating regulation through microbial growth dynamics and photochemical processes. Long-chain homologues (C14–C18) were affected by both meteorological conditions and particulate pollutants (e.g., organic carbon, K+, Ca2+), reflecting mixed influences from natural sources (e.g., soils) and anthropogenic activities (e.g., combustion). These findings advance understanding of dynamic variations in airborne endotoxins within complex urban environments, providing critical data for assessing health risks associated with particulate pollution and informing urban air quality management strategies."

However, the crop production losses (CPL) caused by O3 exposure reached the highest values in China. The emission control measures largely decreased the O3 damage to crop in China instead of SS and SA. 
 Wildfire smoke often aggravates the ozone (O3) pollution and negatively affect crop yields. To date, the global impact of fire-sourced O3 exposure on crop yields still remained unknown. To address this issue, a multi-stage model was developed to quantify the global wildfire-induced ambient O3 concentrations in the future scenarios. The results suggested that the relationship between observed K+ and levoglucosan levels with simulated fire-sourced maximum daily average 8 h (MDA8) O3 concentration reached 0.67 and 0.73, respectively, indicating the robustness of fire-sourced O3 estimate. In both of historical and future scenarios, Sub-Sahara Africa (SS: 14.9±8.4 (historical) and 18.3±9.6 (mean of the future scenarios) µg m−3) and South America (SA: 4.0±2.5 and 4.7±3.2 µg m−3) showed the highest fire-sourced MDA8 O3 concentrations among all of the regions. However, the crop production losses (CPL) caused by O3 exposure reached the highest values in China due to very high total crop yields and relatively high wildfire-induced MDA8 O3 levels. Moreover, CPL in China was sensitive to emission scenario, indicating the effective emission control could largely decrease fire-sourced O3 damage to crop. In contrast, both of SS and SA even showed the higher CPL in low-carbon scenario (SSP1-2.6), suggesting more stringent control measures are required to offset the wildfire contribution. Our findings call for attention on the threat to future global food security from the absence of pollution mitigation and the persistence of global warming."

We have studied the impact and future trends of climate change in the Yangtze River Delta region and found that the intensification of climate change will exacerbate the impact of TCs on O3 in the Yangtze River Delta, requiring strengthened monitoring and early warning. 
 Tropical cyclones (TCs) have a significant impact on ozone (O3) in coastal regions by affecting atmospheric circulation and meteorological conditions. This paper investigates the impact and its future changing trends in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region. It was found that regional O3 pollution usually occurred before TCs made landfall and after they dissipated in 2018–2022. We classified the weather patterns (SWPs) from June to September during 2018–2022 into four main categories. As pollution levels increase within the TCs weather pattern, regional temperatures rise, relative humidity decreases, and wind speeds weaken, creating a favorable environment for O3 formation and accumulation. The annual O3 concentration series is reconstructed based on changes in SWP frequency and intensity, quantifying the impact of various SWPs on future O3 variations. The analysis focuses on the number of days with the TCs weather pattern and their contribution to O3 variation. Under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, future YRD O3 concentrations from June to September will increase to varying degrees relative to historical average O3 concentrations, with average increases of approximately 1.88 and 6.86 µg m−3, respectively. Under all future scenarios, the number of days with TC weather pattern increases to varying degrees, and the frequency of TCs increases significantly. The contribution of TCs weather pattern to O3 changes is increasing compared to the historical period. This shows that the intensification of climate change will intensify the impact of TCs on O3 in the YRD, and monitoring and early warning need to be strengthened."

We observed that PM2.5 particles predominantly exhibited spherical, irregular, and chain-like morphologies, with carbonaceous species, minerals, and trace elements. 
 Light-absorbing organic carbon, collectively known as brown carbon (BrC), significantly influences climate and air quality, particularly in urban environments like Dhaka, Bangladesh. Despite their significance, the contributions and transformation pathways of phenolic compounds – major precursors of brown carbon (BrC) – are still insufficiently understood in the South Asian megacities. This study addresses this gap by investigating the surface morphology of PM2.5, quantifying seven phenolic BrC precursors, and exploring the aqueous-phase formation pathway of nitrophenols at two urban sites (Dhaka South and Dhaka North) from July 2023 to January 2024. Phenolic compounds, including phenol, methylphenols, methoxyphenol, hydroxyphenol, and nitrophenol were identified and quantified using gas chromatography–flame ionization detector (GC-FID). PM2.5 surface morphology and elemental composition were analyzed via Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy – Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (FESEM-EDX), and functional groups were characterized using Attenuated Total Reflectance – Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). Results revealed that PM2.5 particles were predominantly spherical or chain-like with carbonaceous elements (C, O, N, S), mineral dust, and trace metals. The dominant functional groups included aromatic conjugate double bond, carbonyl, and nitro group. Aqueous-phase nitration of 2-hydroxyphenol under acidic conditions, analyzed via UV-Vis spectroscopy, demonstrated an alternative nitrophenol formation pathway. Among the detected compounds, 2-hydroxyphenol and 4-nitrophenol showed the highest average concentrations (2.31 ± 1.39 and 2.20 ± 1.21 µg m−3, respectively). Seasonal variations showed elevated nitrophenol levels during winter, especially in Dhaka South (4.54 ± 2.94 µg m−3). These findings highlight the quantification of phenolic precursors and the role of aqueous-phase reactions in BrC formation, providing valuable insights for future atmospheric modeling and air quality management strategies in South Asia."

Our large-eddy simulations with sectional aerosol–hydrometeor microphysics support this, reproducing observed size distributions and showing how SIP accelerates aggregation, enhancing surface precipitation. 
 Secondary ice production (SIP) was investigated in a cumulus congestus system observed during the Secondary Production of Ice in Cumulus Experiment (SPICULE) campaign. Large-eddy simulations were performed using UCLALES–SALSA, a model that explicitly resolves aerosol–hydrometeor interactions through a sectional representation of aerosols, cloud droplets, rain droplets, and ice crystals. Two scenarios were compared: one including only immersion freezing as an ice formation process, and another incorporating additional SIP mechanisms – namely droplet shattering, rime splintering, and ice–ice collisional breakup.The SIP-inclusive simulation reproduced the evolution of the observed cloud microphysical structure in both warm and mixed-phase regions. Ice–ice collisional breakup generated substantially more secondary ice particles than droplet shattering; however, it was only initiated after droplet shattering provided a sufficient initial ice particle population to meet the SIP triggering conditions. Droplet shattering was triggered by the presence of large supercooled droplets, defined by an integral raindrop diameter exceeding 3.5 mm L−1 at temperatures below 265 K. Once formed, secondary ice particles enhanced riming and accretion, leading to auto-catalytic amplification of SIP through ice–ice breakup. This feedback rapidly depleted cloud liquid water within approximately 10 min.Enhanced updrafts were identified in SIP-active regions, suggesting invigoration in the upper mixed-phase levels. SIP also intensified precipitation via the ice phase, resulting in a 26 % increase in domain-mean cumulative precipitation. The simulations reproduced key aspects of the observed ice multiplication, supporting the adequacy of the SIP representation in the model framework."

Surprisingly, despite their intensity, the smoke did not rise very high but lingered at flight cruising altitudes, causing widespread pollution. This study shows how two different pathways lifted smoke into the lower stratosphere and reveals new insights into how wildfires affect air quality and climate, challenging what we thought we knew about fire and atmospheric impacts. 
 The climate-altering potential of wildfires through their emissions into the stratosphere has only recently been realized following the major wildfire outbreaks in Canada and Australia. The 2023 Canadian wildfire season stood out for its extended burned area and duration, by far exceeded the previous record-breaking events, including the Australian “Black Summer” in terms of the emitted power and pyroCb count with a total number of 142 Canadian pyroCb events over the season. The incessant fire activity all across Canada produced a succession of smoke injections into the lower stratosphere. Here, we use various satellite data sets, airborne and ground-based observations together with chemistry-transport model simulations to show that despite the exceptional vigor of the 2023 Canadian wildfires, the depth of their stratospheric impact was surprisingly shallow and limited to the lowermost stratosphere. Conversely, the incessant fire activity featuring a long succession of moderate-strength pyroCb events, combined with numerous episodes of synoptic-scale smoke uplift through the warm conveyor belt, led to unparalleled levels of pollution at commercial aircraft cruising altitudes throughout the season."

This reveals that convection reaches higher but that deep convection occurs less often in the time period from 2011 to 2020 than in the 1980s. Thus, convective transport towards the upper troposphere has declined as an adaptation to climate change. 
 Convective transport leads to a rapid vertical redistribution of tracers. This has a major influence on the composition of the upper troposphere (UT), a highly climate-sensitive region. It is not yet clear how the convective transport is affected by climate change. In this study, we applied a new tool, the so-called convective exchange matrix, in historical simulations with the chemistry–climate model EMAC (ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry) to investigate the trends in convective transport. The simulated deep convection is penetrating higher but occurs less frequently from 2011 to 2020 than from 1980 to 1989. The increase in the vertical extent of convection is highly correlated with a rise in the tropopause height. The upward transport of air mass increased on average to height levels of 130 hPa and above, but convection transported material less efficiently to the upper troposphere in general from 2011 to 2020 in comparison to the 1980s. These findings give rise to new opportunities to investigate long-term simulations performed by EMAC with regard to the effects of convective transport. Furthermore, they might provide a first insight into the trends in atmospheric convective transport due to changing atmospheric conditions and might serve as an estimate for the convective feedback to climate change."

This study presents the setup of the model together with its numerous inputs and evaluates its performance in comparison with observations from the CO2 sensor network. 
 Urban areas are significant contributors to global CO2 emissions, requiring detailed monitoring to support climate neutrality goals. This study presents a high-resolution modeling framework using GRAMM/GRAL, adapted for simulating atmospheric CO2 concentrations from anthropogenic and biospheric sources and sinks in Zurich, Switzerland. The framework resolves atmospheric concentrations at the building scale, and it employs a detailed inventory of anthropogenic emissions as well as biospheric fluxes, which were calculated using the Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (VPRM). Instead of simulating the full dynamics of meteorology and atmospheric transport, the dispersion of CO2 is precomputed for more than 1000 static weather situations, from which the best match is selected for any point in time based on the simulated and measured meteorology in and around the city. In this way, time series over multiple years can be produced with minimal computational cost. Measurements from a dense network of mid-cost CO2 sensors are used to validate the model, demonstrating its capability to capture spatial and temporal CO2 variability. Applications to other cities are discussed, emphasizing the need for high-quality input data and tailored solutions for diverse urban environments.

The fingerprint markers of microplastic sources are very limited. We examine the concentration, size distribution, eco-health risks, and production of reactive oxygen species of microplastics from five typical sources, especially neglected rural sources. Our results could provide a scientific foundation for developing efficient management strategies. 
 Research on atmospheric microplastics (MPs) from typical sources is limited, constraining the targeted management of pollution. Here, the source profiles of eight types of common MPs and three classes of plasticizers (i.e., phthalates, benzothiazole and its derivatives, and bisphenol A) emitted from five living sources, including Plastic Burning (PB), Fruit-bag Burning, Road Traffic (RT), Agricultural Film, and Livestock Breeding (LB), were determined in PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters ≤ 2.5 µm) and PM10 (≤ 10 µm) in the Guanzhong Plain, northern China. PB exhibits high proportions of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and 2-hydroxy benzothiazole (HOBT), with PMMA being more abundant in PM2.5–10 (aerodynamic diameters between 2.5 and 10 µm). FB exhibits a higher proportion of di-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP) in PM2.5–10 than in PM2.5. RT shows a distinguishable profile with high abundances of rubber. The abundance of 2-benzothiazolyl-N-morpholinosulfide (OBS) in PM2.5–10 was twice that in PM2.5 for RT. Polystyrene (PS) is the most abundant MP in AF. LB shows the distinguishing feature of benzothiazoles, especially OBS and N-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazolesulfenamide (CBS). The eco-health risk assessments reveal that combustion-derived MPs (Plastic Burning and Fruit-bag Burning) indicate the highest ecological risk (Level III). Elevated hazard indices to human health were observed in LB and PB, primarily attributed to bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). Notably, PMMA, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene (PE), bisphenol A (BPA), and phthalates (PAEs) emerged as key drivers of oxidative stress of PMs. This study advances the understanding of atmospheric MPs, offering critical insights for source tracking and risk assessment to mitigate their eco-health effects."

Therefore, we investigate if CMLs could be used to estimate evaporation, even though they have not been designed for this purpose. Our results illustrate the potential for using CMLs to estimate evaporation, especially given their global coverage, but also outline some major drawbacks, often a consequence of unfavourable design choices for CMLs. 
 Scintillometers are used to estimate path-integrated evaporation and sensible heat fluxes. Commercial microwave links (CMLs), such as are used in cellular telecommunication networks, are similar line-of-sight instruments that also measure signal intensity of microwave signals, just like microwave scintillometers do. However, CMLs are not designed to capture scintillation fluctuations. Here, we investigate if and under what conditions CMLs can be used to obtain the structure parameter of the refractive index, Cnn, which would be a first step in computing turbulent heat fluxes with CMLs using scintillation theory. We use data from three collocated microwave links installed over an 856 m path at the Ruisdael Observatory near Cabauw, the Netherlands. Two of these links are 38 GHz CMLs formerly employed in telecom networks in the Netherlands, a Nokia Flexihopper and an Ericsson MiniLink. We compare Cnn estimates obtained from the received signal intensity of these links, sampled at 20 Hz, with those obtained from measurements of a 160 GHz microwave scintillometer (RPG-MWSC) sampled at 1 kHz and with those of an eddy-covariance system. After comparison of the unprocessed Cnn, we rejected the Ericsson MiniLink because its 0.5 dB power quantization (i.e. the discretization of the signal intensity) was found to be too coarse to be applied as a scintillometer. Based on the power spectra of the Nokia Flexihopper and the microwave scintillometer, we propose two methods to correct for the white noise present in the signal of the Nokia Flexihopper: (1) we apply a high-pass filter and subtract a low quantile of the resulting variances of the Nokia Flexihopper and (2) we correct for the noise by comparing with a microwave scintillometer (MWS) and select the parts of the power spectra where the Nokia Flexihopper behaves in correspondence with scintillation theory, also considering different crosswind conditions, and correct for the underrepresented part of the scintillation spectrum based on theoretical scintillation spectra. The comparison and noise determination with the microwave scintillometer provide the best-possible Cnn estimates for the Nokia Flexihopper, although this method is not feasible in operational settings for CMLs. Both of our proposed methods show an improvement in Cnn estimates in comparison to uncorrected estimates, albeit with larger uncertainty than when using the reference instruments. Our study illustrates the potential for using CMLs as scintillometers but also outlines some major drawbacks, most of which are related to unfavourable design choices made for CMLs. If these were overcome, given their global coverage, there is potential for CMLs to perform large-scale evaporation monitoring."

Velazco;Hirofumi Ohyama;Thorsten Warneke;Frank Hase;Tobias Borsdorff,Five years of GOSAT-2 retrievals with RemoTeC: XCO2 and XCH4 data products with quality filtering by machine learning,"The Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite-2 (GOSAT-2) is a satellite dedicated to measuring concentrations of greenhouse gases from space. Since its launch, the increase of CH4 and CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere is clear. The datasets obtained from GOSAT-2 are used in the Copernicus atmospheric services to monitor the climate, in light of the Paris Agreement. Here we present robust datasets of these gases from GOSAT-2, including a novel machine learning approach to data quality filtering. 
 Accurately measuring greenhouse gas concentrations to identify regional sources and sinks is essential for effectively monitoring and mitigating their impact on the Earth's changing climate. In this article we present the scientific data products of XCO2 and XCH4, retrieved with RemoTeC, from the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite-2 (GOSAT-2), which span a time range of 5 years. GOSAT-2 has the capability to measure total columns of CO2 and CH4 to the necessary requirements set by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), who define said requirements as accuracy<10 ppb and <0.5 ppm for XCH4 and XCO2 respectively, and stability of <3ppbyr-1 and <0.5ppmyr-1 for XCH4 and XCO2 respectively.Central to the quality of the XCO2 and XCH4 datasets is the post-retrieval quality flagging step. Previous versions of RemoTeC products have relied on threshold filtering, flagging data using boundary conditions from a list of retrieval parameters. We present a novel quality filtering approach utilising a machine learning technique known as Random Forest Classifier (RFC) models. This method is developed under the European Space Agency's (ESA) Climate Change Initiative+ (CCI+) program and applied to data from GOSAT-2.  Data from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) are employed to train the RFC models, where retrievals are categorized as good or bad quality based on the bias between GOSAT-2 and TCCON measurements. TCCON is a global network of Fourier transform spectrometers that measure telluric absorption spectra at infrared wavelengths. It serves as the scientific community's standard for validating satellite-derived XCO2 and XCH4 data.  Our results demonstrate that the machine learning-based quality filtering achieves a significant improvement, with data yield increasing by up to 85 % and RMSE improving by up to 30 %, compared to traditional threshold-based filtering. Furthermore, inter-comparison with the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) indicates that the quality filtering RFC models generalise well to the full dataset, as the expected behaviour is reproduced on a global scale.Low systematic biases are essential for extracting meaningful fluxes from satellite data products. Through TCCON validation we find that all data products are within the breakthrough bias requirements set, with RMSE for XCH4 < 15 ppb and XCO2 < 2 ppm. We derive station-to-station biases of 4.2 ppb and 0.5 ppm for XCH4 and XCO2 respectively, and linear drift of 0.6 ppb yr−1 and 0.2 ppm yr−1 for XCH4 and XCO2 respectively.For XCH4, GOSAT-2 and TROPOMI are highly correlated with standard deviations less than 18 ppb and globally averaged biases close to 0 ppb. The inter-satellite bias between GOSAT and GOSAT-2 is significant, with an average global bias of −15 ppb. This is comparable to that seen between GOSAT and TROPOMI, consistent with our findings that GOSAT-2 and TROPOMI are in close agreement."

Repasky;Matthew Hayman;Robert A. Stillwell;Scott M. Spuler,Mixed layer height retrievals using MicroPulse Differential Absorption Lidar,"Two methods were developed to measure the mixed layer height, an important variable for weather forecasting and air quality studies. An aerosol-based method and a thermodynamic method were tested using a lidar system that can measure vertical profiles of aerosols, humidity, and temperature. Each method performed best under different conditions. Together, they provide a path toward more reliable mixed layer height monitoring with a single instrument. 
 Accurate measurement of the mixed layer height (MLH) is a key observational capability necessary for many studies in weather forecasting, air quality assessment, and surface-atmosphere exchange. However, continuous MLH monitoring with backscatter lidars remains challenging under complex atmospheric conditions, including cloudy conditions and in the presence of residual layers. This study evaluates two complementary MLH retrieval algorithms using a single MicroPulse Differential Absorption Lidar (MPD): an aerosol-based approach that analyzes aerosol backscatter gradients with a wavelet technique and a thermodynamic technique based on the vertical structure of virtual potential temperature profiles. Both techniques were compared against MLH estimates from radiosondes, a Doppler wind lidar, and a high-resolution weather model using data from the M2HATS field campaign in Tonopah, NV, USA, supplemented by a smaller dataset from Boulder, CO, USA. The aerosol method achieved high temporal resolution and agreement with radiosonde MLH estimates under convective conditions (R2= 0.819–0.919), but its MLH estimates deviated from other methods during morning and evening transitions due to residual layer interference. The thermodynamic method avoided these problems but had coarser resolution and degraded instrument performance beneath clouds (R2= 0.661–0.845). Because lidar generally cannot penetrate clouds, conditions with clouds at or below the MLH are not considered, while those with clouds above the MLH are retained. The study highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each method. Together, they offer a path toward more reliable automatic MLH monitoring with a single instrument by capturing when different MLH definitions converge."
10.5194/amt-18-6053-2025,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,该研究论文探讨了标准气体混合物钢瓶中二氧化碳（CO2）摩尔分数的变化，这种变化是由于吸附/解吸和热扩散分馏效应引起的。研究发现，随着钢瓶压力下降，CO2的摩尔分数会因热扩散效应而产生偏差。这对于使用标准气体混合物校准大气CO2观测系统至关重要，因为CO2值的偏差会影响长期观测的一致性。该研究强调了在精确校准CO2观测时，需要同时考虑热扩散分馏和吸附/解吸效应，并建议重新评估世界气象组织（WMO）关于更换标准气体混合物的建议。,"['CO2', 'Standard gas mixtures', 'Calibration', 'Atmospheric CO2 observations', 'Adsorption/desorption', 'Thermal diffusion fractionation']",Nobuyuki Aoki;Shigeyuki Ishidoya,CO2 deviation in a cylinder due to consumption of a standard gas mixture,"In this study, offsets of CO2 values due to thermal diffusion effect were observed in the outflowing gas from cylinders finding that the CO2 mole fraction in a cylinder deviate by this effect as the pressure dropped. This result suggests that the deviation in the CO2 value in the cylinder is caused not only by the adsorption and desorption effects but also by the thermal diffusion fractionation effect. 
 The CO2 molar fraction in standard gas mixtures is known to deviate as a result of adsorption/desorption to/from the inner surface of a high-pressure cylinder and thermal diffusion fractionation caused by the temperature distribution in the cylinder. This deviation reduces the consistency of atmospheric CO2 observations, because the standard gas mixtures are used to calibrate all measurement systems for precise CO2 observations. To maintain the consistency of CO2 values over the long term, a quantitative understanding of the deviations in the CO2 molar fraction in a standard gas mixture is needed. Thus far, this understanding has not been achieved sufficiently well, because the contribution of thermal diffusion fractionation is less well understood than that of adsorption/desorption. In this study, offsets of 0.013 ± 0.015 and −0.014 ± 0.011 µmol mol−1 were observed in the outflowing gas from horizontally and vertically positioned cylinders, respectively, at a flow rate of 0.080 L min−1. These offsets are attributed to thermal diffusion effects, which diluted and enriched the CO2 molar fraction by −0.045 µmol mol−1 (horizontal cylinder) and 0.048 µmol mol−1 (vertical cylinder) as the relative pressure dropped to 0.03. In the experiments at same flow rate, the adsorption/desorption effect enriched the CO2 molar fraction by 0.06 µmol mol−1 (horizontal cylinder) and 0.10 µmol mol−1 (vertical cylinder). Therefore, attention should be paid to both thermal diffusion fractionation and adsorption/desorption effects for precise calibration of long-term observations of CO2 molar fractions, although past studies have ignored the contribution of thermal diffusion fractionation at the low flow rates (< 0.3 L min−1) examined in this study. Furthermore, the deviation of the CO2 molar fraction depends only on the pressure relative to the initial pressure of the cylinder. This result suggests that the recommendation by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to replace the standard gas mixture once the cylinder pressure drops to 2 MPa needs to be revised."

Using the Joint Effort for Data assimilation Integration (JEDI), this impact study provides critical insights into the necessity of enhanced GNSS-RO observations for NWP applications. 
 The international collaborative Radio Occultation Modeling EXperiment (ROMEX) project marks the first time using a large volume of real data to assess the impact of increased Global Navigation Satellite System radio occultation (GNSS-RO) observations beyond current operational levels, moving past previous theoretical simulation-based studies. The ROMEX project enabled the use of approximately 35 000 daily RO profiles – nearly triple the number typically available to operational centers, which is about 8000 to 12 000 per day. This study investigates the impact of increased RO profiles on numerical weather prediction (NWP) with the Joint Effort for Data assimilation Integration (JEDI) and the global forecast system (GFS), as part of the ROMEX effort. A series of experiments were conducted assimilating varying amounts of RO data along with a common set of other key observations. The results confirm that assimilating additional RO data further improves forecasts across all major meteorological fields, including temperature, humidity, geopotential height, and wind speed, for most of vertical levels. These improvements are significantly evident in verification against both critical observations and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses, with beneficial impacts lasting up to 5 d. Conversely, withholding RO data resulted in forecast degradations. The results also suggest that forecast improvements scale approximately logarithmically with the number of assimilated profiles, and no evidence of saturation was observed. Biases in the forecast of temperature and geopotential height over the lower stratosphere are discussed, and they are consistent with findings from other studies in the ROMEX community."

 A range of leaching protocols have been used to measure the soluble fraction of aerosol trace elements worldwide, and therefore these measurements may not be directly comparable. This work presents the first large-scale international laboratory intercomparison study for aerosol trace element leaching protocols. Eight widely-used protocols are compared using 33 samples that were subdivided and distributed to all participants. Protocols used ultrapure water, ammonium acetate, or acetic acid (the so-called “Berger leach”) as leaching solutions, although none of the protocols were identical to any other. The ultrapure water leach resulted in significantly lower soluble fractions, when compared to the ammonium acetate leach or the Berger leach. For Al, Cu, Fe and Mn, the ammonium acetate leach resulted in significantly lower soluble fractions than those obtained with the Berger leach, suggesting that categorizing these two methods together as “strong leach” in global databases is potentially misleading. Among the ultrapure water leaching methods, major differences seemed related to specific protocol features rather than the use of a batch or a flow-through technique. Differences in trace element solubilization among leach solutions were apparent for aerosols with different sources or transport histories, and further studies of this type are recommended on aerosols from other regions. We encourage the development of “best practices” guidance on analytical protocols, data treatment and data validation in order to reduce the variability in soluble aerosol trace element data reported. These developments will improve understanding of the impact of atmospheric deposition on ocean ecosystems and climate."

Waser;Christian Ginzler,Countrywide digital surface models and vegetation height models from historical aerial images,"Millions of aerial photographs represent an enormous resource for geoscientists. In this study, we used freely available historical stereo images covering Switzerland (1979–2006) to derive four countrywide digital elevation models (DSMs) at a 1 m spatial resolution. Our DSMs achieved sub-metric accuracy compared to reference data and high image matching completeness, demonstrating the feasibility of capturing surface change at a high spatial resolution over different land cover classes. 
 Historical aerial images, captured by film cameras in the previous century, are valuable resources for quantifying Earth's surface and landscape changes over time. In the post-war period, these images were often acquired to create topographic maps, resulting in the acquisition of large-scale aerial photographs with stereo coverage. Photogrammetric techniques applied to these stereo images enable the extraction of 3D information to reconstruct digital surface models (DSMs) and orthoimages.Here, we present a highly automated photogrammetric approach for generating countrywide DSMs of Switzerland, at a 1 m resolution, from approximately 32 000 scanned aerial stereo images acquired between 1979 and 2006, with known exterior and interior orientation. We derived four countrywide DSMs for the epochs 1979–1985, 1985–1991, 1991–1998, and 1998–2006. From the DSMs, we generated corresponding countrywide vegetation height models (VHMs). We assessed the quality of the historical DSMs at the country scale and within six representative study sites, evaluating the vertical accuracy and the completeness of image matching across different land cover types.Mean completeness ranged from 64 % for “glacial and perpetual snow” to 98 % for “sealed surfaces”, with a value of 93 % for the “closed forest” class. Across Switzerland, the median elevation accuracy of the historical DSMs compared with a reference digital terrain model (DTM) on sealed surface points ranged from 0.08 to 0.16 m, with a normalized median absolute deviation (NMAD) of around 0.8 m and a maximum root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.20 m. Similar accuracies are obtained when comparing historical DSMs with measured geodetic points.The VHMs generated in this study enabled the detection of major changes in forest areas due to windstorm damage, forest dynamics, and growth. This work demonstrates the feasibility of generating accurate, very-high-resolution DSM time series (spanning three decades) and VHMs from historical aerial images of the entire surface of Switzerland in a highly automated manner. The VHMs are already being used to estimate countrywide biomass changes. The countrywide DSMs and VHMs for the four epochs, along with auxiliary data, are available online at https://doi.org/10.16904/envidat.528 (Marty et al., 2024) and can be used to quantify long-term elevation changes and related processes across different surfaces."

After rigorous quality control, the dataset achieved an average completeness rate of 70 %. Validation against ERA5 PWV products showed strong agreement (mean bias: 0.88 mm; RMS error: 2.59 mm), while comparisons with radiosonde profiles yielded a mean bias of 0.90 mm and an RMS error of 3.06 mm, confirming its accuracy and reliability. Spatial analysis of China coastal PWV showed that minimum values decrease with increasing latitude, while maximum values are concentrated in the subtropical and tropical monsoon climate zones. Temporal patterns exhibited prominent annual and semi-annual cycles, particularly in higher latitudes. PWV showed a strong positive correlation with sea surface temperature (SST; r= 0.76), with a 1 K SST increase leading to a 2.4 mm (7 %) PWV rise.

The data are consistent with satellite-based observations and are made available for use in future geophysical and climate-related research. 
 Repeated absolute gravity measurements, conducted once or twice per year, have proven valuable for quantifying slow vertical land motion with a precision better than 0.4 µGal yr−1 (1 µGal = 10−8 m s−2) after a decade or more. This precision is comparable to vertical velocity estimates derived from continuously operating space-based geodetic techniques such as the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Furthermore, absolute gravimeters are particularly well suited for long-term studies, as their measurements are based on fundamental length and time standards (laser and atomic clock) and remain independent of terrestrial reference frame realizations, unlike GNSS. Consequently, an absolute gravimeter can return years or even decades later and provide relevant measurements, provided the initial gravity data are well documented and the ground gravity marker remains undisturbed. Following this line of thinking, we have compiled and consistently reprocessed absolute gravity measurements collected between 1998 and 2022 in Brest, on the French Atlantic coast, near its century-long tide gauge station. The entire dataset has been reanalyzed in accordance with international recognized standards for instrumental and modelling corrections. This effort has yielded a 25-year time series of absolute gravity values, which we present and document for future studies, along with details on our reprocessing methodology.

 Winter precipitation forecasts of phase and amount are challenging, especially in Northeast United States where mixed precipitation events from various synoptic systems frequently occur.

The computed global ambiguity-fixed precise point positioning time series are fully consistent among the members, and are subsequently published as a single product (https://doi.org/10.24400/170160/20250414, Santamaría-Gómez et al., 2025). At the time of writing (August 2025), the SPOTGINS dataset includes 5768 daily series from May 2000 to present. This product facilitates a range of research activities, including but not limited to the precise monitoring of the Earth's deformation. A comparison of the SPOTGINS series with published series from the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory solution shows no significant difference in quality."

 Observing sea level and its variations is of great importance for many scientific, societal and economic issues. This data paper presents a new coastal high resolution Sea Level Anomaly (SLA) product, ALTICAP (ALTimetry Innovative Coastal Approach Product), derived from along track satellite altimetry. To enable as many coastal applications as possible, collocated altimetric significant wave height and wind data are also provided, as well as quality flags and the geophysical corrections applied to the SLA. Covering all ocean regions between 0 and 500 km from land, and between 66° S and 66° N, this dataset contains five years (February 2016 to July 2021) of 20 Hz altimetry measurements from the Jason-3 mission. The altimetric standards and geophysical corrections used to compute the SLA have been selected following a round robin study based on 22 of the most recent algorithms available. The processing solution adopted was a compromise between the capability of each algorithm to provide the best sea level solution over the entire strip between 0 and 200 km from the coast and a guarantee of product continuity in the future."

Traditional methods cannot resolve cases with sharp discontinuities in hydraulic/mechanical properties across those layers. Here we present a new space-time method that can handle such discontinuities. This approach is coupled with trace element transport. Our study reveals that the layering of rocks significantly influences the formation of fluid-rich channels and the material distribution adjacent to discontinuities. 
 The flow of fluids within porous rocks is an important process with numerous applications in Earth sciences. Modeling the compaction-driven fluid flow requires the solution of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations that account for the fluid flow and the solid deformation within the porous medium. Despite the nonlinear relation of porosity and permeability that is commonly encountered, natural data show evidence of channelized fluid flow in rocks that have an overall layered structure. Layers of different rock types have discontinuous hydraulic and mechanical properties. We present numerical results obtained by a novel space-time method, which can handle discontinuous initial porosity (and permeability) distributions efficiently. The space-time method enables straightforward coupling to models of mass transport for trace elements. Our results indicate that, under certain conditions, the discontinuity of the initial porosity influences the distribution of incompatible trace elements, leading to sharp concentration gradients and large degrees of elemental enrichment. Finally, our results indicate that the enrichment of trace elements depends not only on the channelization of the flow but also on the interaction of fluid-filled channels with layers of different porosity and permeability."

This study investigates the impact of the cold‐pole bias on Southern Hemisphere springtime stratosphere‐troposphere coupling and how this impact is affected by interactive ozone using a pair of Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) simulations with and without interactive chemistry. The cold‐pole bias in the GEOS simulations delays the poleward and downward progression of the ASPV and stratosphere‐troposphere coupling in spring by 1–2 months, causing severe underestimation of stratosphere‐troposphere coupling in October–November. Consequently, the simulations poorly capture or completely miss the observed springtime tropospheric predictability from ASPV conditions in late winter/early spring.

Using a cloud–topped boundary layer model, we examine how evaporative fraction (EF, a proxy for SM) influences cloud mass flux (CMF). We then use logistic regression to relate CMF to precipitation. The results are consistent with the previous analysis: in semi‐arid areas, increased humidification with increased EF dominates CMF strength, yielding net positive feedbacks; in humid areas, reductions in convective velocity with increasing EF dominate the CMF, yielding net negative feedbacks.

Seismicity concentrated around this deeper anomaly, exhibiting a pulsatory temporal pattern, suggests a fluid‐driven role in the deformation processes.

The first two factors indicate an important role for geological history, in terms of creating a strong foreland and assembling sufficiently radiogenic lithologies. Slow convergence is generally incompatible with uplift outpacing erosion to develop thick mountain belts, but this paradox is resolved by, and explains, most lithium deposits being formed late in the history of mountain belts, at times of slowing convergence rates.

However, as a key forcing driver on meteorological changes in downstream eastern China (EC), the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is seldom analyzed in connection with O3 pollution over EC. In the present study, based on the observational O3 and meteorological data over 2015–2021, the role of the TP thermal forcing in shaping the intra‐seasonal oscillation (ISO) of O3 pollution in EC is investigated for the season of East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). The ISO of O3 pollution during EASM is identified with the maximum daily 8‐hr averaged (MDA8) O3 concentrations in a bimodal pattern in South China (SC), the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLYR), and the North China Plain (NCP), and a unimodal pattern in northeastern China. The first O3 peak in SC, MLYR, and NCP coincides with the northward advance of EASM, whereas the second peak occurs in reverse order with the southward retreat of EASM. The TP thermal forcing with the location and intensity shifts regulates the ISO of O3 pollution through the impact on the advance and retreat of the EASM, which alters the regional cloud cover and downward solar radiation in EC, affecting the O3 production change in the ISO of EASM.

However, the source‐resolved contributions to such events, particularly under varying weather patterns, are not well understood. In this study, we apply the GEOS‐Chem adjoint model to quantify the long‐term (2014–2020) sensitivities of PM2.5 and ozone to precursor emissions by chemical species, sector, and region across 88 PM2.5 and 197 ozone heavy pollution episodes in the central Yangtze River Delta (YRDC), eastern China. We find agricultural NH3, residential organic carbon (OC), industrial primary particles, and industrial SO2 were major contributors to heavy PM2.5 pollution, while local industrial aromatics, ≥C4 alkanes, and ≥C3 alkenes were important for ozone. Coordinated NOX emission reductions between regions are essential for mitigating both PM2.5 and ozone heavy pollution. Heavy PM2.5 pollution was highly sensitive to meteorological factors. Strong winds transported PM2.5 from upwind areas with poor air quality into YRDC, elevating the PM2.5 sensitivity to regional emission sources. Using T‐mode principal component analysis with K‐means clustering, we classified the dominant synoptic circulation patterns associated with heavy pollution episodes and assessed emission sensitivities under each regime. Specific emission controls under various synoptic circulations should be tailored for effectively eliminating heavy air pollution. This study advances our knowledge of heavy air pollution formation and provides a scientific basis for designing more targeted and weather‐adaptive mitigation policies to safeguard air quality and public health."

However, the limited understanding of the molecular characteristics of this organic P hampers our ability to comprehend its environmental stability and cycling processes. To address this knowledge gap, this study synthesized various BBS‐DOMs and used FT‐ICR‐MS to analyze their molecular characteristics and potential environmental stabilities. Herein, CHOP compounds (the capital letters in these compound names indicate their elemental compositions) were the dominant organic P component in most BBS‐DOMs, followed by CHONP and CHONSP compounds. However, high content of N in biomass enabled CHONP compounds to become the primary component during the burning process. Furthermore, CHOP compounds exhibited higher polarity and aliphaticity, lower molecular mass and aromaticity than CHONP and CHONSP compounds. Among these compounds, CHOP compounds predominantly existed as hydrolysis‐available P (phosphate esters with three P‐O‐C/H groups), accounting for >76% of the total organic P. Differently, CHONP and CHONSP compounds exhibited comparable oxidation‐available P (containing P‐C bond or incompletely oxidized P) and hydrolysis‐available P levels. These findings suggested that CHOP compounds had a lower environmental stability and shorter turnover cycle than CHONP and CHONSP compounds. Additionally, the (cellulose + hemicellulose)/lignin ratio of biomass and the burning temperature co‐regulated the aromatic degree and available state of organic P compounds in BBS‐DOMs. This study provides critical molecular‐level insights into the biogeochemical process of atmospheric P from biomass burning."

 Somatically acquired mutations in the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme UBA1 within hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) were recently identified as the cause of the adult-onset autoinflammatory syndrome VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X linked, autoinflammatory, somatic)1. UBA1 mutations in VEXAS lead to clonal expansion within the HSPC and myeloid, but not lymphoid, compartments. Despite its severity and prevalence, the mechanisms whereby UBA1 mutations cause multiorgan autoinflammation and hematologic disease are unknown. Here, we employ somatic gene editing approaches to model VEXAS-associated UBA1 mutations in primary macrophages and HSPCs. Uba1-mutant macrophages exposed to inflammatory stimuli underwent aberrant apoptotic and necroptotic cell death mediated by Caspase-8 and RIPK3-MLKL, respectively. Accordingly, in mice challenged with TNF or LPS, the UBA1 inhibitor TAK-243 exacerbated inflammation in a RIPK3-Caspase-8-dependent manner. In contrast, Uba1 mutation in HSPCs induced an unfolded protein response and myeloid bias independently of RIPK3-Caspase-8. Mechanistically, aberrant cell death of Uba1-mutant macrophages coincided with a kinetic defect in Lys63/Met1 (i.e., linear) polyubiquitylation of inflammatory signaling complexes. Collectively, our results link VEXAS pathogenesis with that of rarer monogenic autoinflammatory syndromes; highlight specific ubiquitin-associated defects stemming from an apical mutation in the ubiquitylation cascade; and support therapeutic targeting of the inflammatory cell death axis in VEXAS."

 Cooperative catalysis, in which multiple catalytic units operate synergistically, underpins a variety of synthetically and mechanistically important organic reactions1–4. Despite its potential utility in new reactivity contexts, approaches to the discovery of cooperative catalysts have been limited, typically relying on serendipity or on prior knowledge of single-catalyst reactivity1,5. Systematic searches for unanticipated types of catalyst cooperativity must contend with vast combinatorial complexity and are therefore not undertaken6–10. Here, we describe a pooling–deconvolution algorithm, inspired by group testing11, that identifies cooperative catalyst behaviors with low experimental cost while accommodating potential inhibitory effects between catalyst candidates. The workflow was validated first on simulated cooperativity data, and then by experimentally identifying previously documented cooperativity between organocatalysts in an enantioselective oxetane-opening reaction. The workflow was then applied in a discovery context to a Pd-catalyzed decarbonylative cross-coupling reaction, enabling the identification of several ligand pairs that promote the target transformation at substantially lower catalyst loading and temperature than previously reported with single ligand systems."

 Antiferromagnetic (AF) van der Waals (vdW) magnets combine the advantages of vdW magnets with the functionality of AF spintronics, offering unique opportunities for ultrafast and robust spintronic devices. However, the lack of approaches to locally and deterministically manipulate their order parameter, the Néel-vector, remains a key limitation. Here, we achieve Néel vector control in bilayers of the vdW AF CrSBr, via an effect we term lateral exchange bias (LEB). We exploit the single-crystalline registry formed by terraced CrSBr samples, where the bilayer Néel vector is controlled by LEB from neighboring, odd-layered flakes, whose nonzero magnetization we manipulate using magnetic fields. Using this control, we achieve non-volatile manipulation of magnetic domains and domain walls in AF CrSBr bilayers, establishing a powerful toolkit for controlling atomically thin AFs at the nanoscale. Our results challenge conventional views on exchange bias and provide a previously unexplored mechanism for achieving atomic-scale control of AF order. Our findings pave the way for the development of advanced spintronic architectures and quantum technologies based on vdW magnets.

 How individuals process and respond to uncertainty has important implications for cognition and mental health. Here, we use computational phenotyping to examine inter-individual differences in uncertainty processing in relation to neurometabolites and trait anxiety in humans. We introduce a categorical state-transition extension of the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter to model individuals’ evolving beliefs about transition probabilities in a four-choice probabilistic sensorimotor learning task with a reversal. Using 7-Tesla Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, we measure neurotransmitter levels in the primary motor cortex. Model-based results reveal dynamic belief updating in response to environmental changes. We further find region-specific relationships between baseline primary motor cortex glutamate+ glutamine levels and prediction errors and volatility beliefs. High trait anxiety is associated with faster post-reversal responses. This study establishes a direct neurochemical correlate of hierarchical belief updating, identifying motor cortex glutamate + glutamine as an important neural marker of inter-individual differences in uncertainty processing.

Theoretical minimum risk exposure levels of all risk factors could reduce 2043 major illness prevalence by 2 percentage points (95% uncertainty intervals: 1.3, 2.7) compared to the continuing trends (base-case) scenario; under a 10% improvement in all risk factors, we project a 0.3 percentage points (0.2, 0.4) reduction in major illness.

Here, the authors show that rotational mixing uniquely explains this depletion using spectra from NGC 188 subgiants. 
 The Lithium-Dip is a severe lithium depletion observed in mid-F (6200-6650 K) dwarfs, which has puzzled astronomers since it was discovered in 1986. Proposed mechanisms include effects related to rotation, magnetic fields, diffusion, gravity waves, and mass loss. Which, if any, of these is realistic remains unclear. Here we show that mixing due to shear induced by stellar angular momentum loss is the unique mechanism driving the lithium depletion. Each mechanism leaves a different signature in the subsurface lithium distribution. The deepening surface convection zones of subgiants of NGC 188 evolving out of the Lithium-Dip dredge up the subsurface material and thus reveal the signature of the responsible mechanism, rotation. Subgiants can also be used more generally, thereby improving fundamental understanding of stellar evolution. Rotational mixing may be the dominant lithium-depleting mechanism in a wide range of solar-type stars, including in the Sun. Our results may further reconcile the cosmological lithium discrepancy.

Here the authors propose and realize a fiber array architecture that enables independent and highly parallel control of single qubits in a neutral atom array. 
 Arrays of single atoms trapped in optical tweezers are increasingly recognized as a promising platform for scalable quantum computing. In both the fault-tolerant and NISQ eras, the ability to individually control qubits is essential for the efficient execution of quantum circuits. Time-division multiplexed control schemes based on atom shuttling or beam scanning have been employed to build programmable neutral atom quantum processors, but achieving high-rate, highly parallel gate operations remains a challenge. Here, we propose a fiber array architecture for atom quantum computing capable of fully independent control of individual atoms. The trapping and addressing lasers for each individual atom are emitted from the same optical waveguide, enabling robust control through common-mode suppression of beam pointing noise. Using a fiber array, we experimentally demonstrate the trapping and independent control of ten single atoms in two-dimensional optical tweezers, achieving individually addressed single-qubit gates with an average fidelity of 0.9966(3). More significantly, we perform simultaneous arbitrary single-qubit gates on four randomly selected qubits, resulting in an average fidelity of 0.9961(4).

 Older adults with HER2-positive early breast cancer are underrepresented in clinical trials, and the benefit of chemotherapy in this population remains uncertain. We evaluated the HER2DX genomic assay within the randomized RESPECT trial (NCT01104935), which compared adjuvant trastuzumab with or without chemotherapy in patients aged 70–80 years. In this prespecified translational analysis (Trans-RESPECT), HER2DX scores were available for 154 patients. The HER2DX risk score classified 74.0% as low risk and 26.0% as high risk. Ten-year relapse-free and overall survival were higher in the low-risk group. HER2DX remained independently associated with overall survival in multivariable analysis. The HER2DX immune, luminal, and proliferation signatures that compose the risk score were also prognostic. While the HER2DX pCR score was not prognostic overall, exploratory subgroup analyses suggested a potential survival benefit from chemotherapy in the pCR-high group. HER2DX offers prognostic value and may guide chemotherapy use in older patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.

 Bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ) are complex psychiatric disorders with overlapping features. Their heterogeneity may arise from interactions between genetic variants and environmental or epigenetic modifiers. Allele-specific expression (ASE), an imbalance in expression between gene alleles, provides a key mechanism linking these interactions to disease. We conducted transcriptomic and genomic analyses in phenotype-discordant monozygotic twins to investigate ASE in psychiatric risk. Nine ASE-affected long non-coding RNAs were identified, including LINC02449, which showed a consistent allele-specific shift in BD/SZ patients favoring the alternative G allele at rs149707223. Functional analyses revealed that overexpression of the LINC02449 G allele in mice induced social deficits and repetitive behaviors. These phenotypes were associated with enhanced excitatory transmission within the mPFC-NAc circuit, mediated by the synaptic regulator CPLX1. Our findings demonstrate that ASE-driven dysregulation of LINC02449 contributes to synaptic and behavioral abnormalities, underscoring ASE as a potentially important regulatory mechanism in BD and SZ pathogenesis.

 Symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) in legume-rhizobia represents a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to chemical nitrogen fertilizers in agriculture. Identifying key factors involved in nodule senescence, is crucial for enhancing SNF by effectively extending the lifespan of nodules. Here, we reveal that sulfur (S), an essential element for SNF, plays a major regulatory role in the senescence of soybean (Glycine max) nodules. Blocking S input into the symbiosome by knocking out either S transporter genes SULTR2;1 or SULTR3;5, resulted in a significant decrease in glutathione levels. This reduction impairs the capacity for reactive nitrogen species scavenging, thereby accelerating nodule senescence. Notably, reducing reactive nitrogen species (RNS) production in rhizobia or increasing S input in soybean nodules through genetic manipulation, can effectively mitigate high nitrogen-induced nodule senescence. Our findings demonstrate that SULTR-mediated S input is a pivotal step in regulating nodule senescence, and provide insights for developing strategies to enhance SNF in legumes by delaying nodule senescence.

 Climate boundaries are planetary boundaries for the climate system: limits within which humanity can sustainably prosper. Here we introduce a modelling framework to analyse global warming, ocean acidification, sea-level rise and Arctic sea-ice melt. Using a reduced-form model, we map out anthropogenic CO2 emissions, carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation management pathways compatible with these boundaries. We define safety levels as the probability to stay within one or several boundaries considering physical uncertainty. If CO2 emissions peak in 2030, net-zero CO2 is reached in 2050, and carbon dioxide removal capacity is 10 PgC yr−1, without solar radiation management, remaining within the global warming boundary of 2 °C exhibits a safety level of 80%. When all four boundaries are considered together, the safety level drops to 35%.

 Lightning plays a crucial role in the Earth’s biogeochemical cycle. Frequent lightning activity over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) has been attributed to shipping emissions through aerosol–cloud interactions in modeling studies but lacks observational confirmation. Here, we present observational evidence linking frequent lightning to the response of deep clouds to ship-emitted sulfate aerosols. These aerosols cause higher cloud tops in mid-to-high clouds, smaller cloud droplet sizes at the bases of low clouds, and increased ice water content with smaller ice particles in deep clouds along shipping lanes, resulting in more lightning strikes than in surrounding areas. The 2020 fuel regulation, which reduced SO₂ emissions by 66% over the BoB, led to lower cloud tops, reduced ice water content, larger cloud droplets, and consequently an 11% decline in lightning frequency during the period of 2020–2023 relative to its climatology. Our findings indicate that shipping emissions contribute at least 17% to the lightning frequency in the BoB region. This study provides observational evidence that changes in shipping emissions—particularly those driven by recent regulations—can significantly influence lightning frequency by altering the microphysical properties of deep clouds. It underscores the broader atmospheric impact of maritime policies, extending beyond local radiative effects to influence convective processes and natural hazards."

 The Russian invasion of Ukraine has disrupted crop exports and global food security, overshadowing critical nutrient asymmetry and the associated environmental risks. Here we demonstrate that following nutrient shortages after independence in 1991, fertilizer use increased over 2000-2021, but has decreased sharply following the invasion in early 2022. Input-output balances of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) for staple crops (wheat, maize and sunflower) highlight soil P and K mining since 1991, increasing N surpluses during 2000-2021 and large NPK deficits since the war began in 2022. Based on analysis of five scenarios for 2030, we show how an Integrated Nutrient Management Plan for Ukraine combining manure recycling, precision fertilization and legume expansion is urgently needed, and would maintain crop productivity, significantly reduce nutrient surpluses and improve nutrient use efficiencies up to 80–89%, substantially curtailing environmental pollution and soil degradation.

 Mars’ sedimentary rocks record Gyrs of environmental change. New data enable global analyses of paleo-environment relevant physical properties of these rocks, including layer thickness and accumulation rate. Here, using plane-fitting techniques on orbital imagery and elevation models, we find that sedimentary layer thicknesses of post-3.5 Ga rocks across the Martian surface show coherent variations at  ~1000 km-scale that are inconsistent with simple volcanic and climatic hypotheses for formation, which are consistent with global compositional homogeneity at orbital scales. These data combined with analyses of outcrop age and total rock volume revealed a global decrease in layer thickness that predates the eventual drop off in preserved sedimentary rock volume per Myr. These constraints confirm a diachronous transition in Mars’ global sedimentary rock record while also highlighting a regional dichotomy in young sedimentary rock deposits that has not been quantified before.

 Deep-sea methane seepage and associated microbial activities are a crucial part of balancing the global methane budget. However, there is a limited understanding of the various response mechanisms of prokaryotic microorganisms in methane seepage sediments from different depths, which hinders the accurate characterization of the cold seep methane budget. This study investigated the diversity, ecological clustering, and community assembly processes of microorganisms from different sediment depths in methane seepage sediments from the Haima Cold Seep. The results show that a significant correlation was observed between methane, sulfate, total inorganic carbon, total organic carbon, and depth in methane seepage environments (P < 0.05). We also determined that sediment depth affected the carbon, and sulfur cycling processes, particularly at 10 and 70 cm of the sediment. The methane leakage region was dominated by deterministic processes in the vertical profiles.

 The early warning of heatwaves using seasonal forecasting systems has the potential to mitigate economic losses and risk to life. Because of the limited reliability and computational expense of dynamical forecasting systems, efforts in recent years have turned to exploiting Machine Learning. Here, an inexpensive approach to forecasting summer heatwaves over Europe is developed, using an optimisation-based feature selection framework to detect a combination of variables, domains and time-lags used to skilfully predict heatwaves. The purely data-driven forecasts are shown to match, and in places outperform, the skill of the state-of-the-art dynamical multi-model products. Moreover, low skill over Scandinavia, a long-term issue common to most dynamical systems, is improved in our data-driven approach. This work also highlights that the greatest contribution to skill comes from predictors at 4-7 weeks time-lag (e.g. mid-March), and identifies predictors which can form the basis for future studies on mechanisms.

From the historical to future eras, tropical cyclone genesis shifts northwards across seasons, with an increased likelihood of genesis adjacent to major coastlines. Proportional increases in genesis exceed 100% during the winter monsoon season and up to 50% during the summer monsoon season. Relative humidity and vertical wind shear become increasingly important influences on tropical cyclone genesis, particularly during the summer monsoon and autumn seasons. There are also increased likelihoods of tropical cyclones making their first landfall along the coastlines of the Philippines and Indonesia during the winter monsoon and spring seasons, and along mainland Southeast Asian coastlines during the summer monsoon and autumn seasons.

 Accurate estimation of leaf spectral properties or biochemical parameters from canopy-level reflectance has long posed a significant challenge in quantitative remote sensing due to the inherent variability and complexity of canopy structures. This study presents 3D-Diff, an innovative differentiable three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer approach for retrieving leaf and soil spectral properties using remote sensing imagery with known 3D canopy structures. Implemented within the LESS (LargE-Scale remote sensing data and image Simulation) model, 3D-Diff employs computer graphics-derived differentiable modeling to compute reflectance derivatives relative to scene parameters during forward simulation. A gradient-based optimization algorithm then minimizes discrepancies between simulated and observed images to estimate scene parameters. Validations using both virtual experiments and real measurements demonstrated robust performance across varying parameter quantities. Notably, the results show that the reflectance/transmittance of all scene parameters were accurately estimated with maximum RMSE of 0.015 for virtual experiments, including non-directly-observed elements, and maximum RMSE of 0.096 for real measurements. Spatial resolution significantly affected accuracy, with relative RMSE values of 0.07 % (0.05 m) and 1.4 % (2.5 m) for a dense virtual forest scene. Although computationally slower than analytic models, this work establishes differentiable radiative transfer as a promising framework for fine-scale vegetation mapping, enabling simultaneous multi-parameter retrieval while maintaining physical interpretability."

 Seagrass meadows directly and indirectly provide a wide range of ecosystem services, but their close proximity to anthropogenic activities renders them highly vulnerable. Regardless of their vulnerability and importance as ecosystem health indicators, intertidal seagrasses, unlike their subtidal relatives, have yet to be assessed at continental scales, and current global estimates of seagrass extent either do not mention intertidal seagrasses or combine them with subtidal seagrasses. Here, we present a first of its kind map of intertidal seagrasses in Europe using a harmonised methodology. Over a total intertidal area of 15,100 km2, we found that seagrasses cover an area comparable to the combined areas of Paris and Lisbon: 212 ± 18.8 km2. The proportion of available intertidal area covered by seagrass decreased towards higher latitudes (from ∼5.4 % at 35°N to ∼0 % at 58°N). Regardless of this pattern, the top three hotspots of seagrass covered the full latitudinal range of Europe, notably in the North Frisian Wadden Sea (Germany), Arcachon Bay (France) and Ria Formosa (Portugal). Furthermore, we showed latitudinal gradients in seagrass cover, with higher cover in low latitudes and lower cover in high latitudes. Finally, an almost linear change in intertidal seagrass peak timing (day of the year of maximum seagrass cover) with latitude was found, with peak timing later the further south.

 Estimation of surface longwave cloud radiative forcing (LWCRF) is crucial for understanding cloud-climate interactions but remains challenging due to the complexity of radiative transfer simulations and the difficulty in accuracy evaluation. Using only five readily available parameters: digital elevation model, column water vapor, cloud top temperature, cloud optical thickness, and cloud fraction ratio, this study develops a lightweight algorithm to estimate LWCRF, defined as the contribution of clouds to surface downward longwave radiation. The algorithm achieves a theoretical RMSE (root-mean-square error) of 5.47 W/m2 under rigorous radiative transfer-based testing. When applied to the CERES CRS (Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System, Clouds and Radiative Swath) data which is based on pixel-level Langley Fu-Liou radiative transfer simulations, it exhibits an RMSE of 12.03 W/m2 across 812 million global samples, demonstrating strong consistency in spatial patterns. This work provides a practical and efficient alternative when numerous inputs required by radiative transfer model are unavailable. This advancement allows for easy assessment of the impact of clouds on the global radiation balance, thereby advancing the understanding of how much clouds warm or cool the Earth."

 HawkEye was an ocean color instrument onboard SeaHawk, the first dedicated Ocean Color CubeSat, launched in 2018 to provide targeted high spatial resolution (∼130 m) images of open ocean, coastal, inland, and estuarine waters with eight spectral bands in the visible NIR region. This study presents the first comprehensive assessment of HawkEye standard Level-2 remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) products. A total of 51 cloud-free HawkEye scenes over 15 globally distributed inland and coastal water sites with contrasting optical conditions were found to be suitable for match-up analysis, spanning two years. Compared to Rrs from ocean color component of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET- OC) and in situ hyperspectral measurements from coastal Georgia waters (USA), HawkEye Rrs accuracy varied between 31 and 61 % for Median Symmetric Accuracy (MdSA) depending on the wavelength. The Rrs at 510 nm was the most accurate (31 % MdSA), and the accuracy decreased towards the blue bands, with 412 nm being the least accurate (61.7 % MdSA). HawkEye Rrs is more accurate in low Chlorophyll-a waters compared to high Chlorophyll-a waters. HawkEye products accuracy improved with a site-specific atmospheric correction (e.g. the Management Unit of the North Sea Mathematical Models (MUMM) correction improved results in two turbid coastal waters tested). HawkEye Rrs product accuracy was comparable with ocean color sensors, OLCI, AQUA and VIIRS. These results thus indicate that HawkEye imagery is suitable for aquatic remote sensing applications. Further, the results serve as a reference and offer potential areas of improvement for future ocean color CubeSat missions."

 Rivers are among the most dynamic components of the surface water cycle and play a vital role in the global hydrological system. Under the combined pressures of climate change and human activities, river meander migration has intensified, leading to localized channel cutoff events with significant ecological and management implications. Although numerous studies have documented changes in river migration, they have predominantly addressed local-scale channel dynamics, and automated methods for detecting large-scale channel cutoff events are still lacking. In this study, we propose a scalable method that integrates multi-temporal river-extent mapping with morphological analysis to detect channel cutoffs across broad spatial domains. Our technique identifies closed loops formed by intersecting river centerlines from different periods, thereby reducing false positives from bifurcations and enhancing computational efficiency. We applied the method to five major rivers, the Amazon, Tarim, Yellow, Red, and Ganges, spanning diverse climatic, hydrological, and geomorphic settings. Validation against manual inventories yielded a median F1-score of 0.86 (with a peak of 0.90 for the Yellow River), demonstrating high accuracy and robustness. Cutoff frequency and morphology varied markedly: the hyper-arid Tarim River exhibited the highest frequency (9.2 events per 100 km), with a limited spatial extent, while the Amazon showed a lower frequency (0.6 events per 100 km) but larger events (intersection lengths >2 km; loop areas >0.8 km2). This study presents a generalizable and computationally efficient framework for monitoring river cutoff dynamics, providing a robust foundation for advancing our understanding of river evolution and informing sustainable river management worldwide."

 Estimating plant biomass in wetland ecosystems using remote sensing and mathematical models is crucial for assessing carbon sequestration potential and for wetland conservation, management, and research. This study proposes a two-step framework for aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation in the Qilihai Wetland by integrating UAV LiDAR, hyperspectral images, and 2.5 m-resolution ZY-1 02E satellite imagery. First, biomass was estimated for seven regions using UAV data by comparing support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and random forest (RF) models to identify the optimal estimation model. The results showed that RF achieved the highest prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.922), with canopy height, vegetation type, and several narrowband indices identified as key predictors, while SVM performed the poorest (R2 = 0.616). Second, UAV-derived biomass was applied to the satellite image to compare five models (SVM, XGBoost, GBM, RF, and the convolutional neural network (CNN)). CNN achieved the best performance (R2 = 0.806), outperforming RF (R2 = 0.721) and significantly surpassing the accuracy of direct field–satellite modeling (R2 = 0.434). The high-resolution AGB map revealed clear spatial heterogeneity, with higher biomass in mixed regions of Phragmites australis and Typha orientalis and in communities closer to water sources. By integrating the predictive capabilities of CNN with the interpretability of RF, this two-step framework significantly enhanced the robustness and ecological relevance of biomass estimation. The findings underscore the pivotal role of multi-source data fusion in improving the accuracy of wetland AGB estimates. Moreover, the high-resolution biomass distribution map provides essential guidance for the conservation, management, and ecological restoration of the Qilihai Wetland."

 Natural forest above-ground biomass (AGB) accumulation alters both the three dimensional (3D) structural and spectral characteristics of forest stands. The laser scanning and five-angle multispectral systems mounted on the newly launched Chinese Terrestrial Ecosystem Carbon Inventory Satellite (TECIS, also known as “Goumang”) enable the simultaneous capture of both structural and spectral information of forest. In this study, we developed a novel method to estimate forest AGB at footprint level by incorporating full-waveform laser return intensity (LRI) and forest background reflectivity obtained from the TECIS system. Forest background reflectivity was derived using five-angle multispectral imaging from the TECIS system, which significantly influences both the bidirectional reflectivity factor and the full-waveform LRI of forest stands through a geometric-optical model. In addition, we retrieved vertical profiles of gap fraction and leaf area volume density from TECIS full-waveform LRI data. By doing so, we proposed a forest AGB estimation model that incorporates forest background reflectivity, 3D structural features, and tree shape factor information. Our results showed that incorporating forest background reflectivity improved forest AGB estimation accuracy, capturing 85 % (n = 20, p < 0.01) of the variance in field-based AGB, with the coefficient of determination (R2) increasing from 0.39 to 0.66 and the root mean square error (RMSE) decreasing from 28.12 t/ha to 17.77 t/ha. Finally, we generated a continuous AGB map using a Random Forest model, achieving an R2 of 0.63 and an RMSE of 14.21 t/ha. This study demonstrates the significant potential of the TECIS system for forest AGB estimation by leveraging simultaneous structural and spectral observations.

We examine horizontal and vertical land motions (VLM) recorded by GNSS from 2001 to 2025, accounting for the effects of tectonic deformation, glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), and surface mass loading. The observed horizontal velocities display a relatively uniform magnitude of 34.8 ± 0.2 mm/yr in the ITRF2014 reference frame, and 1.1 ± 0.2 mm/yr in the South China Block reference frame, consistent with regional plate tectonic motion. We identify coseismic offsets associated with the 2004 Mw 9.1–9.3 Sumatra–Andaman earthquake, the 2011 Mw 9.1 Tohoku earthquake, and the 2012 Mw 8.6 Wharton Basin earthquake, as well as postseismic deformation following the 2004 event. These observations highlight the far-field influence of major regional earthquakes on crustal deformation in Hong Kong. Analysis of VLM reveals localized subsidence at sites impacted by urbanization and land reclamation. After correcting for surface mass loading, residual vertical rates at stations situated away from urban areas indicate consistent uplift ranging from 0.28 ± 0.10 mm/yr to 0.44 ± 0.15 mm/yr, which is in good agreement with GIA model predictions.

 Light-absorbing carbonaceous aerosols, comprising black carbon (BC) and brown carbon (BrC), significantly influence air quality and radiative forcing. Unlike traditional approaches that use a fixed value of absorption Ångström exponent (AAE), this study investigated the absorption and optical properties of carbonaceous aerosols in Beijing for both local emission and regional transport events during a wintertime pollution event by using improved AAE results that employs wavelength-dependent AAE (WDA). By calculating the difference of BC AAE at different wavelengths using Mie theory and comparing the calculated results to actual measurements from an Aethalometer (AE31), a more accurate absorption coefficient of BrC can be derived. Through the analysis of air mass sources, local emission was found dominated the pollution events during this study, accounting for 81 % of all cases, while regional transport played a minor role. Carbonaceous aerosols exhibited a continuous increasing trend during midday, which may be attributed to the re-entrainment of nighttime-accumulated carbonaceous aerosols to the surface during the early planetary boundary layer (PBL) development phase, as the mixed layer rises, combined with the variation of PBL and anthropogenic activity. At night, variations in the PBL height, in addition to anthropogenic activities, effectively contributed to surface aerosol concentrations, leading to peak surface aerosol values during local pollution episodes. The diurnal variation of AAE470/880 exhibited a decreasing trend, with a total decrease of approximately 12 %. Furthermore, the BrC fraction showed a constant diurnal variation, suggesting that the declining AAE470/880 was primarily influenced by BC, possibly due to enhanced traffic contributions."

 Tibetan Plateau sensible heating (TPSH) effect is recognized as a key driver of the South Asian climate; however its role in regulating the regional dust burdens over South Asia during the pre-monsoon season remains unclear. Using long-term reanalysis and/or observational dust and TPSH data, we show that the dust optical depth at 550 nm (DOD550) over South Asia is significantly positively correlated with TPSH at the interannual scale. DOD550 over South Asia increases (decreases) by 20 % (12 %) in the strongest (weakest) TPSH years. The phenomenon of TPSH-dust relationships is reinforced by sensitivity experiments by altering TPSH from global climate models. Further mechanism analysis reveals that TPSH perturbation induces regional circulation anomalies over South Asia, which features a low-tropospheric cyclonic response around the Tibetan Plateau. This cyclonic anomaly strengthens the prevailing northwesterly winds, increasing regional dust emissions and transportation over South Asia.

 Reanalysis data, while widely used to study rainfall mechanisms, requires rigorous uncertainty assessment, especially over complex terrains such as the Sichuan Basin (SCB). This study evaluates the performance of ERA5 in capturing low-level winds associated with SCB nocturnal rainfall, using hourly wind profiles from four wind profiler radars. Analysis confirms key features of SCB rainfall dynamics previously identified using reanalysis and model outputs, including nocturnal flow enhancement over the Yungui Plateau (YGP) and its positive correlation with low-level vorticity in the SCB, which ERA5 generally reproduces. However, substantial discrepancies emerge between ERA5 and observations, particularly in the vertical structure of low-level winds. ERA5 underestimates the height of the maximum wind speed over the YGP while overestimating its magnitude. This creates distinct vertical wind structures during SCB nocturnal rainfall events: observations exhibit an elevated peak (“prominent nose”), whereas ERA5 shows a stronger but lower-altitude maximum (“flatter nose”). Correspondingly, ERA5 overestimates lower-level intensity of the circulation over SCB and fails to reproduce the observed increase in circulation with height. These vertical structure biases highlight limitations in ERA5's representation of terrain-modulated nocturnal flows, emphasizing that uncritical use of reanalysis may misrepresent key mechanisms driving SCB rainfall. Our results underscore the necessity for enhanced observational data collection and analysis to constrain uncertainties in reanalysis and model outputs, thereby improving their reliability for applications such as low-level aviation and wind energy assessment, particularly over complex terrains."

Among TCs of its kind, FREDDY has the longest lifetime, unprecedented travelled distance, singular trajectory, and multiple landfalls. This research aims to understand the role of southeastern Africa weather systems on the unusual behavior of FREDDY. For achieving this purpose, data from the fifth generation of atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5) provided by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), such as, sea surface temperatures (SSTs), ocean heat content (OHC), mean sea level pressure (SLP), wind at different levels, and relative humidity were used, including historical TC tracks from 1857 to 2025. Different weather systems were synchronized with FREDDY's manifestation. Results indicate that FREDDY's lifetime was influenced by the combination of warm waters from the Southwestern Indian Ocean (SWIO), whose SSTs varied from 26.6 °C to 29.7 °C at the TC center, and the southern subtropical High Pressure Systems (HPS), which enhanced moisture to the cyclone in the continent, through its confluent winds at low levels. Besides, the Subtropical Jet Streams (SJS) had contributed to its singular trajectory, leading to multiple landfalls. The upper Trough and upper Ridge associated with the SJS, positioned respectively over the southern Africa and southern Madagascar, had determined the back-and-forth movement of FREDDY through the Mozambique Channel, hitting both countries, Mozambique and Madagascar. These findings provide important clues for cyclone monitoring at national and regional levels, and may help anticipate interventions for minimizing the negative impacts of future similar scenarios."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108592,True,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文探讨了全球变暖背景下热带和亚热带地区海陆风增强及其对空气污染物再循环的影响。研究发现，过去二十年中，由于海风的增强，海陆风事件显著增加。海陆风事件的增加和海风的增强削弱了空气污染物的再循环，从而恶化了污染状况。此外，海陆风事件的增加与强风天数的减少、背景风的减弱以及陆地与海洋之间昼夜温差的增大密切相关。虽然该研究没有直接提及遥感技术，但其关注的空气污染物扩散、海陆风等现象可以通过卫星观测和大气成分分析等遥感手段进行监测和研究，因此与大气环境遥感技术具有较强的相关性。,"['air pollutant recirculation', 'sea-land breeze', 'air quality', 'atmospheric transportation and diffusion', 'thermal contrast', 'background winds']",Jia Li;Zhilin Zeng;Donghai Wang;Zhaoming Liang,Increased tropical and subtropical sea-land breeze and its impact on air pollutant recirculation under global warming,"•A significant increasing trend occurred for the tropical and subtropical sea-land breeze (SLB) events over past two decades, mainly due to the strengthening of sea breeze. •The increasing SLB events and strengthening sea breeze significantly weakened air pollutant recirculation, implying the deterioration of pollution. •The increasing SLB events and strengthening sea breeze were strongly correlated with decreasing strong wind days, weakening background winds, and growing daytime land-sea thermal contrast. 
 Sea-land breezes (SLB), as a typical boundary layer circulation, significantly impact the transportation and diffusion of pollutants in coastal regions. This study utilizes observational data and reanalysis dataset to explore the primary variation trend of tropical and subtropical SLB events and its impact on air pollutant recirculation in recent two decades, as well as the key influencing factors for the variation trend of tropical and subtropical SLB events. Results show that there is a significant increasing trend for the SLB events in most tropical and subtropical regions (63.3 % of stations) over past two decades, in terms of both frequency and intensity. The increasing trend in the SLB events was primarily attributed to a dramatic strengthening of sea breeze rather than land breeze. The combination of the increasing SLB frequency and the strengthening sea breeze significantly weakened air pollutant recirculation (−0.0293 per decade), thereby deteriorating the transportation and diffusion conditions of pollutants in the tropical and subtropical coastal regions over past two decades. In addition, the increase in the frequency of SLB events and the intensification of sea breeze strength are highly correlated with the reduction in strong wind days, the weakening of background winds, and the growing daytime land-sea thermal contrast. Among them, the growing daytime thermal contrast stemmed from a greater rise of temperature near the land surface than that near the sea surface."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108601,False,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文主要关注天津市PM2.5中硝酸盐的来源和形成路径，通过同位素分析和PMF模型，揭示了初级排放的硝酸盐对总硝酸盐的显著贡献。研究表明，忽略初级硝酸盐的影响可能导致对羟基自由基氧化路径贡献的过高估计，以及对生物质燃烧贡献的低估。虽然该研究涉及空气质量和大气成分分析，但它侧重于地面观测和化学分析，与大气环境遥感技术（如卫星观测）的关联性不强。,"['PM2.5', 'Nitrate', 'Isotopic analysis', 'Source apportionment', 'Air pollution', 'Biomass burning']",Hao Xiao;Qin-Kai Li;Shi-Yuan Ding;Xiao-Dong Li,Isotopic inference of atmospheric nitrate sources and formation pathways: Significant biases introduced by non-negligible primary nitrate emissions,"•Primary emissions may be a significant source of nitrate in PM2.5in Tianjin. •Ignoring the effects of primary nitrate may lead to an overestimation of the •OH pathway. •Disregarding primary nitrate may lead to an underestimation of the contribution of biomass burning. 
 Oxygen (δ18O) and nitrogen isotopes (δ15N) are reliable methods for tracing the formation pathways and sources of nitrate (NO3−) in the atmosphere, while neglecting of primary NO3− contributions from these isotopic approaches. Here, we collected PM2.5 in summer and winter in Tianjin, the concentrations of water-soluble inorganic ions, metal element, organic carbon, and elemental carbon, as well as the δ15N and δ18O values of NO3− in PM2.5 were measured. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model revealed that primary NO3− accounted for 22.1 % of total NO3− in summer (14.5 % from biomass burning and 7.6 % from sea salt) and 24.8 % in winter (22.5 % from biomass burning and 2.3 % from dust), indicating that NO3− in PM2.5 in Tianjin is not solely derived from the secondary transformation of NOx. Notably, after correcting for primary NO3− contributions, the estimated contribution of the •OH oxidation pathway decreased by 22.4 % in summer and 21.3 % in winter. This suggests that disregarding primary NO3− may lead to an overestimation of the contribution of •OH pathway. Furthermore, the Bayesian isotope mixing (MixSIAR) model highlighted biomass burning as a major NO3− source in Tianjin, contributing over 20 % in summer and over 30 % in winter. Critically, failing to account for primary NO3− could result in a substantial underestimation the contribution of biomass burning. Our results demonstrated that primary NO3− was the important sources in PM2.5 in Tianjin, and neglecting primary NO3− could result in misestimation of formation pathways and sources of NO3− by isotopic methods."

 Tropical cyclones (TCs) are among the most destructive weather phenomena, causing severe social and economic damage through extreme rainfall, strong winds, and storm surges. Wind and pressure fields, which define TCs’ structure and impact, are spatial variables whose accurate estimation is essential for improved analysis and prediction. However, high-precision observations are limited by cost and coverage, and numerical or reanalysis models are computationally intensive. Parametric models based on radial symmetry also struggle to represent the asymmetry and diversity of real TCs. This study proposes a random forest model that estimates TC pressure fields by learning the nonlinear relationship between wind and pressure. Trained on ERA5 reanalysis data, the model captures spatial patterns such as pressure asymmetry, land–sea contrasts, and shows high explanatory power and low error, especially for intense TCs and within the gale-force wind radius. Comparison with parametric and other data-driven models confirms its superior spatial accuracy. An experiment using satellite-based two-dimensional wind data demonstrates the model’s ability to estimate pressure fields from real time inputs, supporting its use in disaster response and early warning."
