Borgmeyer;Y. Kupper;M. J. Rossi;J. S. Luterbacher;C. Ludwig,Characterization of Biobased Polymers at the Gas–Solid Interface─Analysis of Surface and Bulk Properties during Artificial Degradation,"Accurately assessing the interfacial composition and reactivity of (bio)polymers under controlled but environmentally relevant conditions remains challenging. This study explores the evolution of surface functionalities of novel polyesters Poly(Butylene Xylose) (PBX) and Poly(Alkyl Xylose Amide) (PAXA) under artificial degradation conditions. Employing a Knudsen Flow Reactor (KFR) and a gas-titration approach, we systematically analyze the chemical transformations occurring at the polymer’s solid–gas interface. Both polymers are derived from the same functionalized lignocellulosic sugar building block, Diglyoxylic Acid Xylose (DGAX). Virgin (V), long-term UV (UV), and short-term Ozone (O3) exposures induce specific but differing alterations in molecular integrity and surface reactivity, resulting in notable shifts in material properties and polymer structure. Contrary to the assumption that degradation increases specific surface area (SSA) and reactivity, our results reveal cases where the SSA decreases, with reactivity either increasing or decreasing based on the reactive groups available at the interface. Both polymers exhibited increased water affinity, acidification, and ozone reactivity following UV exposure. Interfacial reactivity, assessed with trifluoroacetic acid, hydroxylamine, and nitrogen dioxide, increased for PBXUV but decreased for PAXAUV. Surface hydroxyl groups in PAXA reduced 5-fold under short-term ozone and long-term UV exposure, while bulk transport kinetics of hydroxylamine altered with long-term degradation, though ozone exposure left transport mechanisms unaffected. This combined interfacial and bulk analysis approach advances our understanding of (bio)plastic degradation. It examines the role of degraded polymers as potentially more or less reactive vectors for chemicals and organisms upon environmental release while also demonstrating that polymer degradation initiates significantly earlier than previously assumed."

The TPA biodegradation pathway has been well documented for the microbial biodegradation and assimilation of PET; however, the PET biodegradation process by marine microorganisms via the EG biodegradation pathway is less understood. Here, we demonstrate how the marine bacteria Pseudomonas chengduensis BC1815’s membrane-anchored PET esterase (OF113_10420) breaks down PET. We also explain the characteristics of this enzyme and demonstrate that the strain assimilates PET via the EG biodegradation pathway. In addition to depolymerizing PET, PET esterase (OF113_10420) hydrolyzes BHET and MHET to generate EG more efficiently in alkaline circumstances. It has been discovered that P. chengduensis BC1815 cells exhibiting surface-displayed PET esterase (OF113_10420) have the potential to function as cell biocatalysts for the breakdown of PET. Additionally, we look into the microbial communities that have PET esterase linked to the EG biodegradation pathway, primarily those belonging to the phyla Proteobacteria and Actinobacteriota. Consequently, research on the microbial absorption and biodegradation of PET via the EG metabolism route increases our knowledge of the bioremediation of PET pollution in the marine environment and contributes to our understanding of the environmental destiny of PET pollutants in the marine environment."

By studying the uptake and accumulation of heavy metals in unicellular organisms, we gain insights into potential risks associated with low-dose heavy metal exposure in aquatic environments. Thus, to investigate the accumulation characteristics of Mo, Ag, Cd, Sn, Sb, Hg, Tl, and Pb mixtures in single Tetrahymena thermophila cells, we developed a label-free approach for the simultaneous absolute quantification of multiple metals in a single cell using mass cytometry. Our results demonstrated the dynamic changes in metal concentrations in T. thermophila, and the competition between metals in uptake and excretory pathways resulted in heterogeneous accumulation and bioconcentration of these metals. Additionally, our findings revealed the limited capacity of T. thermophila to excrete Cd and Hg, suggesting a higher risk for T. thermophila cells when exposed to Cd and Hg over an extended period. Therefore, the current study provides valuable data for a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of low-dose heavy metals on aquatic ecosystems."

In this study, we collected information on reproductive history, sociodemographic profiles, lifestyle, and residential details of 10,153 couples at risk of pregnancy. Each participant’s 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year average O3 exposure levels were estimated using a previously developed randomized trees model. We used discrete-time Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the fecundability odds ratio (FOR) for each 10 μg/m3 change in the O3, adjusting for a set of demographics, lifestyle, and environmental covariables. We observed that a 10 μg/m3 increase in the annual average level of exposure to O3 was associated with a 16% reduction in fecundity (FOR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.82–0.85). We also observed a 40% increase in the odds of infertility (OR: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.34–1.46) for each 10 μg/m3 rise in the annual mean of O3 exposure. After adjustment for fine particulate matter, the strong association between O3 exposure of fecundity to O3 persisted. Given the increasing epidemic of infertility, we strongly advocate for heightened consideration of O3’s impact on reproductive health, as it may partially counterbalance the health benefits gained from improved PM2.5 levels in a middle-income setting."

Compared to traditional static flux chambers, the developed system is fully automated, eliminating the need for continuous operator intervention in the field. The cylindrical stainless-steel chamber (6.28 L) is equipped with internal sensors for temperature, pressure, and humidity, and a low-cost PID sensor for VOC detection (0.001–40 ppm). VOC flux is determined over 10 min measurement cycles, with two micro diaphragm pumps purging the chamber to reset concentrations. An Arduino Uno microcontroller manages the system, enabling local data storage (SD card) and a LoRa module to send real-time data to the cloud using IoT systems. Powered by a 12 V battery, rechargeable via a photovoltaic panel, the system ensures continuous operation. The prototype costs less than 1.5 k€, significantly cheaper than commercial devices. Accuracy and repeatability were assessed through lab-scale emission tests under dynamic conditions using various aliphatic and aromatic VOCs. Results closely matched those from a commercial gas analyzer and a Comsol Multiphysics numerical model, confirming the system reliability. These findings support its potential as a cost-effective alternative for continuous VOC monitoring at contaminated sites."

Time-integrated offline sampling methods for airborne FTOHs generally require sampling times of hours to weeks. Thus, integrated methods fail to capture the real-time dynamic behavior of sources, sinks, and exposure. Herein, we demonstrate the use of iodide chemical ionization mass spectrometry (I-CIMS) in capturing the real-time concentration dynamics of 6:2 FTOH in air during floor stripping and waxing in a university laboratory. Peak 6:2 FTOH concentrations during application of floor wax were 456.9, 406.3, and 263.2 ng m–3, respectively, for three layers of wax (60 s averages). Additionally, the average 6:2 FTOH emission factor per wax layer was 5.10 ± 0.17 μg m–2. We estimate a range of potential inhalation exposures from 1.6 to 460 ng kg–1, depending on ventilation and workplace practices.

Kavanagh;Caitlin M. Chalk;Thomas J. Jones;David J. C. Dennis,The Hidden Internal Flow Dynamics of Shear‐Thinning Magma in Dikes,"The viscosity of magma has a first‐order control on the explosivity and hazards of a volcanic eruption, and the detection of diking within the subsurface may indicate an eruption is imminent. As magma approaches the surface it is highly likely it will have a non‐Newtonian shear‐thinning rheology (apparent viscosity decreases as shear rate increases), yet most dike models assume magma is a simple Newtonian fluid. Here we use laser light and particle image velocimetry to image flow within a scaled experimental dike hosting a shear‐thinning fluid. The results show that the internal flow dynamics of shear‐thinning magma in dikes are very different to Newtonian dikes. The velocity of shear‐thinning flow radiates out toward the dike margin at similar magnitude across the dike plane; this is very different to the jet flow and recirculation characteristic of the Newtonian dike model at the same conditions. A linear relationship between tip velocity and inlet Reynolds number Rein ${\text{Re}}_{\text{in}}$ in the viscous regime (Rein≲0.4 ${\text{Re}}_{\text{in}}\mathit{\lesssim }0.4$) is confirmed to also apply to shear‐thinning fluids, and transitional flow (0.4≲Rein≲100 $0.4\mathit{\lesssim }{\text{Re}}_{\text{in}}\mathit{\lesssim }100$) is generated experimentally for the first time. These findings suggest that magma rheology (Newtonian or shear‐thinning) cannot be recognized from external factors, such as the dike tip velocity. These results mark a step‐change in dike modeling, introducing a new physical framework to test the petrological and geochemical evidence of magma ascent dynamics in dikes leading to volcanic eruptions."

Silver,Supplementing Enhanced Weathering With Organic Amendments Accelerates the Net Climate Benefit of Soil Amendments in Rangeland Soils,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (carbon dioxide removal (CDR)) that combines decreased greenhouse gas emissions with atmospheric CO2 reduction is needed to limit climate change. Enhanced rock weathering (ERW) of ground silicate minerals is an emerging CDR technology with the potential to decrease atmospheric CO2. However, there are few multi‐year field studies and considerable uncertainty in field‐rates of ERW. We explored combining finely ground metabasaltic rock with other soil CDR technologies (compost and biochar amendments) to stimulate carbon (C) sequestration. The combined ground rock (GR), compost, and biochar amendment had the greatest increases in soil C stocks over 3 years (15.3 ± 4.8 Mg C ha−1). All other treatments slowed or reversed background C losses, with GR‐only treatments reducing rates of soil C loss relative to the control but still losing soil C over time. Ground rock amendments lowered nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions by 11.0 ± 0.6 kg CO2e ha−1 yr−1 and increased methane (CH4) consumption by 9.5 ± 3.5 to 18.4 ± 4.4 kg CO2e ha−1 yr−1; while noteworthy, emissions reductions were an order of magnitude smaller than organic C sequestration with compost amendments. The combined amendment yielded the greatest estimated net ecosystem benefit (3 year relative changes in soil C, estimated ERW rates, and greenhouse gas emissions) of −86.0 ± 24.7 Mg CO2e ha−1. Benefits were dominated by soil organic C gains, directly from organic amendments and indirectly from increased plant growth. Weathering rates were <10% of the theoretical potential.

With a backward Lagrangian particle‐tracking experiment in a data‐assimilative model of the Southern Ocean (B‐SOSE), we address the long‐standing question of the extent to which SAMWs originate from densification of southward‐flowing subtropical waters versus lightening of northward‐flowing Antarctic waters sourced by Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) upwelling. Our analysis evidences the co‐occurrence of both sources in all SAMW formation areas, and strong inter‐basin contrasts in their relative contributions. Subtropical waters are the main precursor of Indian Ocean SAMWs (70%–75% of particles) but contribute a smaller amount (< ${< } $40% of particles) to Pacific SAMWs, which are mainly sourced from the upwelled CDW. By tracking property changes along particle trajectories, we show that SAMW formation from northern and southern sources involves contrasting drivers: subtropical source waters are cooled and densified by surface heat fluxes, and freshened by ocean mixing. Southern source waters are warmed and lightened by surface heat and freshwater fluxes, and they are made either saltier by mixing in the case of Indian SAMWs, or fresher by surface fluxes in the case of Pacific SAMWs. Our results underscore the distinct climatic impact of Indian and Pacific SAMWs formation, involving net release of atmospheric heat and uptake of atmospheric freshwater, respectively; a role that is conferred by the relative contributions of subtropical and Antarctic sources to their formation."

Before the monsoon onset, the dominant synoptic‐scale systems around the SCS are the eastward‐propagating equatorial Kelvin waves. After the SCSSM onset, while the Kelvin waves remain largely unaltered, the transitions from mixed Rossby‐gravity waves to tropical depression (TD)‐type waves become more pronounced. Such distinctive features of the tropical waves before and after SCSSM onset are attributable to the adjustments in atmospheric mean flow. An anomalous low‐level cyclone develops around the SCS after the monsoon onset. The convergence and shear of this anomalous low‐level cyclone contribute to the barotropic energy conversion from the mean flow to the synoptic‐scale systems, which is conducive to the development of TD‐type waves and genesis of tropical cyclones."

However, these asymmetric structures are often not well represented in the initialization of most operational forecasting models. In this study, we investigate the impact of initial vortex inner‐core asymmetries on TC intensification by conducting a series of idealized numerical experiments. We find that initial wavenumber‐1 asymmetries, which are closely linked to the vertical tilt of TC vortices, play a critical role in determining the timing of intensification onset. Specifically, TC intensification occurs only when the wavenumber‐1 asymmetries reach a specific configuration relative to the axisymmetric circulation. When the initial vortex lacks or inaccurately represents wavenumber‐1 asymmetries, additional time is required for adjustment of the vertical structure of TC vortices. This study suggests that better representation of wavenumber‐1 asymmetry in the initial structure of TC vortices could help improve TC intensity forecasts in numerical models."

These data are interpreted to record periods when interior meltwaters are exported to the ice sheet margins as a result of ice acceleration and thinning. An assessment of coincidence between 234U‐230Th dates, ranging from 16 to 256 ka, and peaks in Southern Ocean temperature yields a statistically significant correlation. Additional comparison of precipitate dates and climate data finds that calcite formation and ice acceleration cluster within periods of enhanced millennial scale climate variability as well as high global ice volume. This sensitivity to background climate is consistent with the hypothesis that these factors exert some control on ice sheet response to changes in climate."

Estimating NCCN using aerosol optical properties is essential for obtaining continuous NCCN data. This study highlights the significant impact of relative humidity (RH) on NCCN estimation through aerosol optical data, especially at low supersaturations (SS). When RH exceeds a threshold (e.g., 60% at 0.2% SS), NCCN estimation shifts from underestimation to overestimation, with the overestimation degree increasing with RH. Including RH in the estimation formula can effectively reduce this bias, although the aerosol optical hygroscopicity parameter is found to have a minimal effect on NCCN estimation. Based on these insights, a new parameterization scheme for NCCN estimation is proposed, which can significantly reduce NCCN estimation bias when using wet aerosol optical data at high RH levels (40%–90%)."

 Adult zebrafish robustly regenerate injured hearts through a complex orchestration of molecular and cellular activities. However, this remarkable process, which is largely non-existent in humans, remains incompletely understood. Here, we utilize integrated spatial transcriptomics (Stereo-seq) and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to generate a spatially-resolved molecular and cellular atlas of regenerating zebrafish heart across eight stages. We characterize the cascade of cardiomyocyte cell states responsible for producing regenerated myocardium and explore a potential role for tpm4a in cardiomyocyte re-differentiation. Moreover, we uncover the activation of ifrd1 and atp6ap2 genes as a unique feature of regenerative hearts. Lastly, we reconstruct a 4D “virtual regenerating heart” comprising 569,896 cells/spots derived from 36 scRNA-seq libraries and 224 Stereo-seq slices. Our comprehensive atlas serves as a valuable resource to the cardiovascular and regeneration scientific communities and their ongoing efforts to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying vertebrate heart regeneration.

Here authors show in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa murine infection model that an alginate-itaconate metabolic interplay, creating metabolic synchrony between the host and the pathogen plays a role in mitigating harmful inflammation. 
 Disease tolerance mitigates organ damage from non-resolving inflammation during persistent infections, yet its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show, in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia mouse model, that disease tolerance depends on the mitochondrial metabolite itaconate, which mediates cooperative host-pathogen interactions. In P. aeruginosa, itaconate modifies key cysteine residues in TCA cycle enzymes critical for succinate metabolism, inducing bioenergetic stress and promoting the formation biofilms that are less immunostimulatory and allow the bacteria to integrate into the local microbiome. Itaconate incorporates into the central metabolism of the biofilm, driving exopolysaccharide production—particularly alginate—which amplifies airway itaconate signaling. This itaconate-alginate interplay limits host immunopathology by enabling pulmonary glutamine assimilation, activating glutaminolysis, and thereby restrain detrimental inflammation caused by the inflammasome. Clinical sample analysis reveals that P. aeruginosa adapts to this metabolic environment through compensatory mutations in the anti-sigma-factor mucA, which restore the succinate-driven bioenergetics and disrupt the metabolic synchrony essential for sustaining disease tolerance. Persistent infections force the host to develop compensatory mechanisms to prevent organ damage, which are collectively called disease tolerance.

 Climate-driven warming affects the reproduction of oviparous ectotherms. However, whether oviparous ectotherms possess a protection mechanism against heat stress for oocyte development, which is essential for maintaining the continuity of animal populations, is largely unknown. Under high temperatures, female mud crabs (Scylla paramamosain) typically have well-formed ovaries, while a few crabs were found to experience oocyte development failure. To investigate the heat stress protection mechanism of oocyte development in mud crabs, we construct a chromosome-level genome of this species and identify an enhancer of the vitellogenin receptor (VtgR) that stimulates its expression under high temperatures. Lacking this enhancer due to an intronic deletion leads to low VtgR expression in abnormal crabs, resulting in abnormal vitellogenic oocyte formation in these individuals when exposed to high temperatures. Furthermore, we identify a similar heat stress protection mechanism in zebrafish. Disruption of Lrp13, a VtgR-like protein in zebrafish, results in impaired vitellogenin absorption and ovarian degeneration in zebrafish exposed to high temperatures. Our results reveal a VtgR-mediated mechanism that protects vitellogenic oocyte formation against heat stress in mud crabs and zebrafish, contributing to their heat adaptability during oocyte development.

 The polar regions are biologically productive and play a critical role in regional and global biogeochemical cycling. A key nutrient is dissolved silicon, required for the growth of siliceous phytoplankton, diatoms, which form an important component of polar ecosystems. Glacial weathering is thought to be an important dissolved silicon source to coastal waters, especially critical in regions experiencing seasonal silicon limitation of diatom growth. However, complex physical and biogeochemical interactions in fjords and coastal regions modulate the downstream supply of dissolved and particulate nutrients, including silicon. Here, we review the biogeochemical complexities of glaciated margins and the insights into this system that silicon isotope geochemistry offer. We show that stable and radioisotopic measurements and biogeochemical numerical modelling provide a quantitative mechanistic understanding of subglacial silica mobilisation and its cycling across the land-ocean continuum. Subglacial weathering produces isotopically light amorphous silica, which dissolves in seawater to release dissolved silicon. Our findings show that isotopically light, detrital silica, likely containing glacial material, reaches the ocean and there could support a substantial proportion of diatom productivity, especially in the Arctic. Outstanding questions about silicon cycling in these crucial environments will be addressed through novel and cross-discipline approaches that overcome traditionally viewed ecosystem boundaries.

The formation and growth rates were higher during the warm period. Nucleation particles (14 nm – 25 nm) preserved no seasonal variations but were significantly increased on periods with NPF activity. NPF activity was enhanced by the presence of condensable sinks that favored nanoparticle formation. Both the growth and the formation rates were positively correlated with solar radiation, temperature and wind speed.

 Research on atmospheric visibility and haze events is vital for human health and sustainable societal development. This study aims to construct long-term daily-scale visibility and fog-haze datasets for China using machine learning models, analyze their spatiotemporal evolution characteristics, identify key influencing factors of visibility. The results show that the LightGBM model achieves high accuracy (R2 = 0.79, RMSE = 4.03 km), representing a 7.04 % improvement in R2 and 0.6 km reduction in RMSE compared to the baseline model, while maintaining robust stability across both seasonal (R2 = 0.77–0.79, RMSE = 3.83–4.18 km) and spatial scales (R2 = 0.58–0.76, RMSE <4 km). Atmospheric visibility showed an initial decline followed by an upward trend from 2001 to 2023, reaching its lowest point in 2015 (20.77 km) and recovering to 21.26 km by 2023. Visibility was lowest in winter (20.33 km) and highest in summer (22.32 km), with low-value areas concentrated in eastern and central city clusters. Overall, a declining trend was observed, with an annual average decrease of 0.03–0.08 km. From 2000 to 2013, the annual average visibility decreased by 0.09–0.13 km, with the decline area accounting for 22.56 %–55.38 %. From 2013 to 2023, the annual average visibility increased by 0.03–0.13 km, with the increase concentrated in the central and eastern regions (area ratio of 12.7 %–39.1 %), while the western regions continued to show a downward trend (area ratio of 8 %–35.3 %). SO₂, relative humidity, and surface pressure are the most important variables affecting atmospheric visibility, with contributions of 17.43 %, 13.29 %, and 10.58 %, respectively. The thresholds for these variables are 11.4 μg/m3, 74.9 %, and 998 hPa. The frequency of haze in China increased from 9.97 days in 2001 to 20.3 days in 2013 and then decreased to 11.03 days by 2023. Overall, there is an average annual decrease of 0.5 days, with the spatial pattern showing a decline in the eastern and central regions, and an increase in the western region. Specifically, light haze and alert haze decreased by 0.75 and 0.2 days per year, respectively, while mild haze increased by 0.32 days per year. The area without haze has continuously decreased by 11.89 %, while the area with low-frequency haze has increased by 12.91 %. The area with high-frequency haze first increased and then decreased, showing an overall reduction of 1.03 %, mainly concentrated in city clusters in the eastern and central regions.

 Moisture plays a key role in the energetics of hurricanes. Using a convolutional autoencoder, a state-of-the-art deep learning approach to spatial pattern classification, with k-means we identified four representative clusters of total column water vapor (TCWV) patterns around North Atlantic hurricanes. These four clusters exhibit distinct spatial distributions of TCWV in terms of amount, symmetry, and areal extent. Cluster 1 has a compact, symmetric, and moderate moisture pattern which we refer to as medium moisture symmetrical. Cluster 2 is high moisture symmetrical as these hurricanes have an abundance of moisture with a widespread and symmetric pattern. Cluster 3 is low moisture asymmetrical as it represents the driest conditions especially in the northwest. Cluster 4 has high moisture near the center but exhibits a pattern with the strongest contrast between dryness in the northwest and wetness in the southeast, thus we label it high moisture asymmetrical. Each cluster has distinct geographical and temporal distributions, indicating differences in dynamic and thermodynamic environmental conditions associated with each cluster's moisture pattern. Additionally, hurricane intensity, size, and precipitation features vary among the four clusters, characteristics which are closely associated with the moisture and environmental conditions of each cluster. Our study's application of a deep learning method in classifying spatial patterns of moisture around hurricanes highlights the importance of moisture conditions in a hurricane's evolution."

Our study reveals that SOBIR1-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN KINASE 1 (SOAK1), a member of the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK)-V subfamily with a transmembrane domain, negatively regulates multiple RLP-mediated immune responses. SOAK1 constitutively interacts with SOBIR1 and modulates SOBIR1-dependent immune signaling. SOAK1 directly phosphorylates SOBIR1 at serine-406, substantially impairing its ability to transphosphorylate itself and BAK1. The conservation of serine-406 residue among various flowering plants suggests that phosphorylation at this site plays a critical role in regulating plant immunity. Conversely, SOBIR1 also phosphorylates SOAK1 primarily at serine-73, inhibiting SOAK1’s kinase activity and derepressing SOBIR1 activity.

Additionally, Nef inhibits the shedding of at least some cellular ADAM10 substrates, resulting in their accumulation on HIV-1 virions. Whereas Nef+HIV-1 replicated only marginally better in the absence of ADAM10, the propagation of Nef−HIV-1 was notably rescued in ADAM10−T cell lines. Crucially, Nef−HIV-1 also benefited from the absence of ADAM10 in primary CD4+T cells. Collectively, our results indicate that ADAM10 negatively affects both laboratory-adapted and primary HIV-1 strains by shedding the ectodomains of viral and cellular transmembrane proteins from virions and that Nef rescues virus replication by counteracting ADAM10."
10.1126/sciadv.adt4881,False,Science Advances,该研究论文主要关注衰老T细胞中mTORC1的持续激活如何影响老年人的疫苗反应。研究发现，初始反应的幼稚CD4+T细胞密度会影响滤泡辅助T细胞（TFH）的命运决定，并且随着年龄的增长而下降。较低的初始细胞密度导致更持续的mTORC1活性，从而损害CXCR5的维持，最终影响老年人的疫苗效果。该研究主要集中在免疫学和细胞生物学领域，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,[],Xiaorong Lin;Yanhua Du;Shuo Kan;Junjie Chen;Yunxue Yin;Linlin Li;Jingwen Chen;Wenrong Jiang;Wenqiang Cao;Chulwoo Kim;Liang Chen;Shiwen Wang;Jorg J. Goronzy;Jun Jin,Sustained mTORC1 activation in activated T cells impairs vaccine responses in older individuals,"T cell aging contributes to the lower vaccine efficacy in older adults, yet the molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, we show the density of initially responding naïve CD4+T cells is instructive in T follicular helper (TFH) cell fate decisions and declines with age. A lower number of initially responding cells did not affect TFH differentiation at peak responses after immunization but accounted for an increased contraction phase manifesting as a larger loss of CXCR5 expression. Mechanistically, cells activated at a lower initial density had more sustained mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activities that impair CXCR5 maintenance. YAP-dependent regulation of SLC7A5 involved in the cell density–dependent regulation of mTORC1 activities and TFH loss. Old mice fed with a leucine-restricted diet after peak responses showed smaller TFH loss and improved humoral immune responses. Attenuating mTORC1 signaling after peak response is a strategy to boost vaccine responses in older individuals."
