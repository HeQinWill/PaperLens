10.5194/amt-18-1115-2025,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,该研究论文主要探讨了利用卫星遥感技术探测飞机尾迹云（contrails）的局限性。论文指出，由于尾迹云通常较窄且光学厚度较低，导致卫星难以完全观测到它们。研究通过模拟图像和探测算法，评估了当前2公里分辨率的卫星成像仪对尾迹云的观测能力，发现只有约一半的尾迹云可以被观测到。然而，研究也表明，对气候影响较大的尾迹云更容易被卫星探测到。该研究强调了在利用卫星观测数据评估航空业对气候的影响时，需要考虑尾迹云的可观测性问题，并指出更高分辨率的红外成像仪可以提高探测效率。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术，特别是卫星观测和大气成分分析（尾迹云）密切相关。,"['contrails', 'satellite observations', 'radiative forcing', 'infrared imagers', 'climate impact', 'aviation', 'remote sensing']",Oliver G. A. Driver;Marc E. J. Stettler;Edward Gryspeerdt,Factors limiting contrail detection in satellite imagery,"Contrails (clouds caused by planes) play a large role in the climate warming caused by aviation. Satellites are a good tool to validate modelled impact estimates. Many contrails are either too narrow or too disperse to detect. This work shows that only around half of contrails are observable but that the most climatically important are easier to detect. It supports the use of satellites for contrail observation but highlights the need for observability considerations for specific applications. 
 Contrails (ice clouds, originally line-shaped after initiation by aircraft exhaust) provide a significant warming contribution to the overall climate impact of aviation. This makes reducing them a key target for future climate strategies in the sector. Identifying pathways for contrail reduction requires accurate models of contrail formation and life cycle, which in turn need suitable observations to constrain them. Infrared imagers on geostationary satellites provide widespread contrail observations, with sufficient time resolution to observe the evolution of their properties. However, contrails are often narrow and optically thin, which makes them challenging for satellites to identify. Quantifying the impact of contrail properties on observability is essential to determine the extent to which satellite observations can be used to constrain contrail models and to assess the climate impact of aviation.In this work, contrail observability is tested by applying a simple contrail detection algorithm to synthetic images of linear contrails in an otherwise clear sky against a homogeneous ocean background. Only (46±2) % of a modelled population of global contrail segments is found to be observable using current 2 km resolution satellite-borne imagers, even in this maximally observable case. By estimating the radiative forcing of individually modelled contrails, it is found that a significantly higher portion of contrail forcing is detectable using the same 2 km resolution imager – (72±2) % of instantaneous long-wave (LW) forcing – because more easily observable contrails have a larger climate impact. This detection efficiency could be partly improved by using a higher-resolution infrared imager, which would also allow contrails to be detected earlier in their life cycle. However, even this instrument would still miss the large fraction of contrails that are too optically thin to be detected.These results support the use of contrail detection and lifetime observations from existing satellite imagers to draw conclusions about the relative radiative importance of different contrails under near-ideal conditions. However, there is a highlighted need to assess the observability of contrails where the observation conditions may vary by application. These observability factors are shown to change in response to climate action, demonstrating a need to consider the properties of the observing system when assessing the impacts of proposed mitigation strategies."

This dataset incorporates six key drought indices, including multi-scale versions, facilitating early detection and monitoring of droughts. Through the provision of consistent and reliable data, CHM_Drought enhances our understanding of drought patterns, aiding in effective water management and agricultural planning. 
 Drought indices are crucial for assessing and managing water scarcity and agricultural risks; however, the lack of a unified data foundation in existing datasets leads to inconsistencies that challenge the comparability of drought indices. This study is dedicated to creating CHM_Drought, an innovative and comprehensive long-term meteorological drought dataset with a spatial resolution of 0.1° and with data collected from 1961 to 2022 in mainland China. It features six pivotal meteorological drought indices: the standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), evaporative demand drought index (EDDI), Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), self-calibrating Palmer drought severity index (SC-PDSI), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), of which the SPI, SPEI, and EDDI contain multi-scale features for periods of 2 weeks and 1–12 months. The dataset features a comprehensive application of high-density meteorological station data and a complete framework starting from basic meteorological elements (the China Hydro-Meteorology dataset, CHM). Demonstrating its robustness, the dataset excels in accurately capturing drought events across mainland China, as evidenced by its detailed depiction of the 2022 summer drought in the Yangtze River basin. In addition, to evaluate CHM_Drought, we performed consistency tests with the drought indices calculated based on Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and CN05.1 data and found that all indices had high consistency overall and that the 2-week-scale SPI, SPEI, and EDDI had potential early-warning roles in drought monitoring. Overall, our dataset bridges the gap in high-precision multi-index drought data in China, and the complete CHM-based framework ensures the consistency and reliability of the dataset, which contributes to enhancing the understanding of drought patterns and trends in China.

 Extreme precipitation events can lead to devastating floods, loss of life and severe infrastructure damage and are expected to increase in a warming world, highlighting the urgent need to quantify current-day and future extremes. Although intense precipitation extremes are generally better represented by high-resolution climate models, large ensemble datasets are lacking. Yet, these are very essential for estimating uncertainties of future trends. Here, the EURO-SUPREME dataset, with DOI: doi.org/10.26050/WDCC/EURCORDEX_prec (Van de Vyver et al., 2024), is presented that includes extreme precipitation events from the EURO-CORDEX 0.11° ensemble (coupled to CMIP5) for accumulated precipitation depths ranging from 1 hour to 72 hours. More specifically, the data are provided by a 35-member ensemble of historical and future (RCP8.5) annual-maxima on the EURO-CORDEX domain, covering 4984 simulation years in total. The resource is designed to enable climate-model benchmarking and support various state-of-the-art scientific research efforts and climate-change risk assessments. We provide a validation of the EURO-SUPREME dataset for various countries in Europe and investigate the changes in intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation under different global warming levels. Furthermore, we disentangle the RCM and GCM contributions to the biases. Finally, we provide a practical application of using EURO-SUPREME as a benchmark for high-resolution convection-permitting models for Belgium."

By using multidirectional mean sea surface data, it reduces the impact of ocean dynamics and provides detailed global gravity anomaly change rates. This model provides critical insights into seafloor structures and ocean mass distribution, contributing to research in marine geophysics and oceanography. The dataset is freely available on Zenodo. 
 Satellite altimetry is a vital tool for global ocean observation, providing critical insights into ocean gravity and its gradients. Over the past 6 years, satellite data from various space agencies have nearly tripled, facilitating the development of high-precision ocean gravity anomaly and ocean vertical gradient of gravity anomaly (VGGA) models. This study constructs a global ocean VGGA model named SDUST2023VGGA using multidirectional mean sea surface (MSS). To address computational limitations, the global ocean is divided into 72 sub-regions. In each sub-region, the DTU21 MSS model and the CNES-CLS22 mean dynamic topography (MDT) model are used to derive the geoid. To mitigate the influence of long-wavelength signals on the calculations, the study subtracts the long-wavelength geoid derived from the XGM2019e_2190 gravity field model from the (full-wavelength) geoid, resulting in a residual (short-wavelength) geoid. To ensure the accuracy of the VGGA calculations, a weighted least-squares method is employed using residual geoid data from a 17′×17′ area surrounding the computation point. This approach effectively accounts for the real ocean environment, thereby enhancing the precision of the calculation results. After combining the VGGA models for all sub-regions, the model's reliability is validated against the SIO V32.1 VGGA (named curv) model. The comparison between the SDUST2023VGGA and the SIO V32.1 model shows a residual mean is −0.08 Eötvös (E) and the RMS is 8.50 E, demonstrating high consistency on a global scale. Analysis of the differences reveals that the advanced data processing and modeling strategies employed in the DTU21 MSS model enable SDUST2023VGGA to maintain stable performance across varying ocean depths, unaffected by ocean dynamics. The effective use of multidirectional MSS allows for the detailed capture of ocean gravity field information embedded in the MSS model. Analysis across diverse ocean regions demonstrates that the SDUST2023VGGA model successfully reveals the internal structure and mass distribution of the seafloor.

The model has a high skill level in simulating sea ice production driving the AABW source water formation and AABW properties when assessed against observations. A model experiment shows a significant impact of ice shelf melting on the AABW characteristics. 
 The Ross Sea in the Southern Ocean is a key region for the formation of the Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) that supplies the lower limb of the global overturning circulation and contributes to 20 %–40 % of the total AABW production. AABW primarily originates from polynyas characterized by strong sea ice production and ocean convection that lead to the formation of Dense Shelf Water (DSW), the precursor of AABW. The production and characteristics of DSW in the Ross Sea and AABW in the surrounding ocean are significantly affected by ice shelf meltwater transported from the nearby Amundsen Sea. The scarcity of long-term observations in the Ross Sea hinders the understanding of DSW and AABW variability, and numerical models are needed to explore the multi-scale variations in these water masses and the forcing mechanisms. In this work, a coupled high-resolution ocean–sea ice–ice shelf model is developed for the Ross Sea and Amundsen Sea, named the Ross Sea and Amundsen Sea Ice–Sea Model (RAISE). Detailed descriptions of the model configurations are provided. This study represents an attempt to thoroughly evaluate the DSW properties and associated ocean–sea ice–ice shelf coupling processes among modeling studies in the Southern Ocean, using multiple datasets including satellite-based observations and hydrographic measurements from the World Ocean Database, Argo profilers and seal-tag sensors. In particular, the modeled temporal variations in DSW properties in polynyas and key export passages are compared with long-term mooring observations, which are rarely seen in studies of the DSW temporal variability before. RAISE demonstrates a high skill level in simulating the observed sea ice production rates in the Ross Sea polynyas, and the modeled spatial and temporal variability in DSW are significantly and strongly correlated with observations. RAISE can also effectively capture the observed long-term freshening trend of DSW prior to 2014 and the rebounding of DSW salinity after 2014. RAISE shows an overestimate of DSW density in the Ross Sea, which is associated with an underestimate of ice shelf melting rates in the Amundsen Sea, missing ice shelf calving processes and subglacial discharge in the model. A sensitivity experiment simulating increased freshwater discharge from these processes can significantly improve the simulation of DSW properties."

It can preserve not only standard but also extreme rainfall statistics across various timescales. Notably, compared to traditional frequency analysis methods, the BL model requires only half the record length (or even shorter) to achieve similar consistency in estimating sub-hourly rainfall extremes. This makes it a valuable tool for modelling rainfall extremes with short records. 
 The Bartlett–Lewis (BL) model is a stochastic framework for representing rainfall based upon  Poisson cluster point process theory. This model has been used for over 30 years in the stochastic modelling of daily and hourly rainfall time series. Historically, the BL model was known to underestimate sub-daily rainfall extremes, but recent advancements have addressed this issue, making it a viable alternative to traditional rainfall frequency analysis methods, such as those based on annual maxima time series. Despite its potential, calibrating the BL model is a not a trivial task. The model's formulation is complex, and calibrating it involves a nonlinear optimisation process that can be numerically unstable, which has limited its broader application. To promote the use of the BL model and demonstrate its capabilities in modelling sub-hourly rainfall – both standard and extreme statistics – we have developed an open-source Python package called pyBL. This paper details the design of the BL model and summarises the key features of the pyBL package. It includes a brief explanation of how to use the package in selected user scenarios. In addition, we report on scientific experiments that resemble real-world situations to showcase pyBL's ability to model sub-hourly rainfall extremes with short records and its flexibility in utilising records of various timescales and lengths."

Parsons,Hydro-geomorphological modelling of leaky wooden dam efficacy from reach to catchment scale with CAESAR-Lisflood 1.9j,"Leaky wooden dams are a type of natural flood management intervention that aims to reduce flood risk downstream by temporarily holding back water during a storm event and releasing it afterwards. These structures alter the river hydrology, and therefore the geomorphology, yet often this is excluded from numerical models. Here we show that by not simulating geomorphology, we are currently underestimating the efficacy of these structures to reduce the flood peak and store water. 
 Leaky wooden dams (LDs) are woody structures installed in headwater streams that aim to reduce downstream flood risk through increasing in-channel roughness and decreasing river longitudinal connectivity in order to desynchronise flood peaks within catchments. Hydrological modelling of these structures omits sediment transport processes since the impact of these processes on flow routing is considered negligible in comparison to in-stream hydraulics. Such processes are also excluded on the grounds of computational expense. Here we present a study that advances our ability to model leaky wooden dams through a roughness-based representation in the landscape evolution model CAESAR-Lisflood, introducing a flexible and representative approach to simulating the impact of LDs on reach and broader catchment-scale processes. The hydrological and geomorphological sensitivity of the model is tested against grid resolution and variability in key parameters such as leaky dam gap size and roughness. The influence of these parameters is also tested in isolation from grid resolution whilst evaluating the impact of simulating sediment transport on computational expense, model domain outputs, and internal geomorphological evolution. The findings show that simulating sediment transport increased the volume of water stored in the test reach (channel length of 160 m) by up to an order of magnitude, whilst it reduced discharge by up to 31 % during a storm event (6 h, 1-in-10-year event). We demonstrate how this is due to the leaky dam acting to induce geomorphic change and thus increasing channel roughness. When considering larger grid resolutions, however, our results show that care must be due to overestimations of localised scour and deposition in the model and that behavioural approaches should be adopted when using CAESAR-Lisflood in the absence of robust empirical validation data."

However, the microbial mechanism underlying MP-induced SOC and nutrient dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the impacts of two common MPs (polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride) on microbial hierarchical groups (bacteria, fungi, and protists) and the cascading effects on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nutrient dynamics in two typical agricultural soils (Mollisol and Ultisol). Our results showed that MP inputs consistently reduced NO3––N concentration but increased the content of DOC and specific dissolved organic matter (DOM) components. Despite divergent responses of microbial hierarchical groups to MPs, MP inputs consistently strengthened the connectivity and cross-trophic associations of microbial multitrophic networks. Protistan nodes belonging to Cercozoa, Ciliophora, and Chlorophyta played essential roles in maintaining network connectivity in MP-treated soils. The enhanced network connectivity and cross-trophic associations primarily explained variations in soil DOC and nutrient turnover. These findings collectively indicate that MP inputs trigger DOC and nutrient turnover by enhancing the potential multitrophic interactions and species connectivity within soil micro-food webs.

Cues that lead animals to respond differently to MPs are key factors driving MP ingestion, yet they remain poorly understood. Here, we quantified the susceptibility of three fish species to different types of MPs across different social contexts. Our results showed that bass were more attracted to MPs that resembled food visually, whereas carp tended to select MPs that shared olfactory cues with food. Goldfish relied more on oral processing to make foraging decisions on MPs. Structural differences in the oropharynx supported these discriminated oral processes. Enlarged group size and fasting time altered the foraging behaviors of MPs of goldfish and bass, both of which were suction-feeding species. Such behavioral changes, regardless of whether fish ultimately ingested or rejected MPs, could pose indirect costs to fish. However, changed group sizes and fasting times did not affect the intake of MPs by the filter-feeding carp. We also proposed four pathways causing the MP-induced evolutionary trap and discussed the potential of fish to escape this trap. Our results contribute to  experimental and theoretical understanding of the ecological risks posed by MPs to aquatic species."

To account for this, size-standardization of contaminant concentrations within fish samples is a common practice. Standardized concentrations are often estimated using within-sample regression models, also known as power series regression (referred to here as sampling event regressions, or SERs). This approach requires higher sample sizes than mixed effect models (MEMs), which are suited for this application but are not as commonly used. Herein we compare SERs to three MEM approaches; restricted maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and approximate Bayesian inference with nested Laplace approximation (INLA). We did this for two contaminants: mercury (Hg), a contaminant known to bioaccumulate, and arsenic (As), where the bioaccumulative potential is less understood. The MEM approaches generated size-standardized concentrations for small populations (e.g., <5 fish) and/or populations that lacked the range of sizes required for SER estimates, with comparable residual and root mean squared error to SER estimates. INLA was determined to be the best method in most cases because it was computationally less intensive than other approaches and showed consistent performance across a range of scenarios with sample-size limitations.

Despite the ecological and economic significance of coastal environments, monitoring efforts to identify PFAS in these regions are limited. Bivalves have been used as biomonitors for many pollutants, but their effectiveness in reflecting environmental PFAS contamination and the mechanisms of PFAS bioaccumulation is poorly understood. This study examined the impact of biological, chemical, and ecological variables on PFAS bioaccumulation in two bivalve species (i.e., Eastern oyster and Atlantic ribbed mussel) and developed a statistical model to predict the PFAS content in wild bivalves. Overall, the summed PFAS concentration in the bivalves closely mirrors that in water. We observed higher bioaccumulation factors for some perfluoroalkyl sulfonamides and branched PFAS isomers than for terminal PFAS of equivalent chain length. The isomer distribution and precursor-to-terminal compound ratios provide compelling evidence that the biotransformation of PFAS precursors likely drives these elevated factors. Additionally, the bioaccumulation factors of PFAS decrease with increasing organism size and age, suggesting that smaller and younger bivalves have greater bioaccumulation potential and are more susceptible to PFAS contamination. These findings provide critical information that guides the use of bivalves as biomonitors to evaluate PFAS contamination in aquatic environments."

In this study, the mice received a 28-day subchronic oral exposure to PFOA. The results of spatial mass spectrometry imaging indicated that the eye-enriched PFOA dispersed into the subretina primarily through the outer BRB (oBRB), which subsequently resulted in significantly increased apoptosis and decreased thickness of multiple oBRB-associated layers. BRB integrity and function were compromised due to decreased expression of the tight junction (TJ). Mechanistically, PFOA outcompeted lysophosphatidic acid to bind strongly with lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPAR1) in its antagonism, abolishing its ability to stimulate the TJ assembly-related signaling pathway. This subsequently attenuated phosphorylation of the myosin light chain, rendering insufficient contraction of the actomyosin cytoskeleton, leading to decreased TJ assembly and BRB leakage. This, in turn, facilitated PFOA translocation across the BRB and accumulation within the subretinal space. Our findings suggest that oBRB is particularly vulnerable to PFOA, which targets directly LPAR1 to disable its function of maintaining TJ assembly cascades, leading to adverse visual effects."

Here we employ a multisector energy system model of the contiguous United States to study competition among low-carbon hydrogen production options and the interplay between the electricity and hydrogen sectors in a net-zero energy system. When hydrogen storage is available without constraints and electrolyzers are grid-connected, they account for most hydrogen production, while providing demand-side flexibility to the electricity system. This decreases battery storage deployment to achieve similar shares of variable renewable energy (VRE) in the power system. When electrolyzers are not grid-connected but rely on islanded VRE power to produce “green” H2, we find that power system flexibility and the share of electrolytic hydrogen are reduced, all else equal. Without hydrogen storage, natural gas-based hydrogen (i.e., “blue” H2) accounts for most hydrogen production, although increasing flexibility of blue H2 can enable some electrolytic H2 production. Finally, we find that hydrogen deployment does not substantially drive energy transmission expansion, although there is a modest increase in CO2 transmission when blue H2 is deployed in regions with limited CO2 storage."

Combining known events at these facilities with in situ controlled releases, we observe that all CMS technologies generally struggle in identifying short-duration (<30 min) or low emission rate (relative to baseline) events.

Overall, DGVMs underestimated China's afforestation area by an average of 26.88%, leading to a 29.46% underestimation in LAI increase. Our findings confirm a significant greening trend in China and highlight the need for improved land use data representation in DGVMs."

We reveal that a cancel effect of the interaction lowers the observed IPO–AMV contemporaneous correlation. When only retaining the one‐way modulation (the IPO forces the AMV or the reversed one) in the observational LIM, their correlation peaks nearly simultaneously, consistent with the fast IPO–AMV interaction in model experiments. We further demonstrate that the fast interaction is associated with both tropical and extratropical processes.

The in situ observations from the Swarm spacecraft show a rapid depletion of plasma density in the dawn and dusk sectors following the storm. The in situ data are further complemented by the ground‐based total electron content maps. Both the in situ and the ground‐based observations show significant depletion of electron density during the super storm in regions above 50° magnetic latitude. The density depletion originates from a polar hole in the morning high latitude sector. It is suggested that the strong convection speed under substantial solar wind forcing leads to chemical composition changes and rapid recombination in the ionosphere. The region of depleted plasma density is not confined to the polar cap but expands to auroral and mid‐latitude regions. The depleted plasma density lasts for about 3 days before it recovers to the pre‐storm levels.

A global analysis reveals that Titan's dunes become more narrowly spaced and increasingly more regular along a continuous eastward transport path, starting east of the Xanadu region, around the equator, and terminating abruptly at Xanadu's western margin. Xanadu is a rugged, tectonically active, water‐ice‐rich region with low topography and a thin layer of atmospherically deposited organic‐rich material. Our results demonstrate that windblown grains must withstand long transport distances. Furthermore, environmental conditions along the eastern margin of Xanadu set a template over which dunes evolve, only gradually modified as sediment supply or availability increases downwind.

During periods when Northern Hemisphere ice sheets remain, Arctic sea ice maintains a large extent in summer, and annual mean surface air temperatures are low enough to outweigh the warming expected from summer insolation intensity and greenhouse gases alone. This indicates that glacial ice sheets, due to their high albedo and their role as a heat sink, suppress the accumulation of heat in the Arctic Ocean in summer and the associated warming feedback. The results suggest a need to consider the history of remnant ice sheets and the duration of ice‐free periods to explain different Arctic climate responses within and between interglacials."

These results suggest that tropical cyclone outer size and structure typically remain unchanged until after extratropical transition end. In those minority of cases with strong expansion during extratropical transition, increases in tropical cyclone outer winds begin first in the lower troposphere during extratropical transition and build upwards over time. This broadening of the azimuthal‐mean outer winds is also associated with an increasingly asymmetric outer wind field with the strongest winds concentrated downstream of the tropical cyclone.

Due to limited measurements, the physical characteristics of OOS aerosols under high relative humidity (RH) and subsequent cloud activation potential remain unclear. In this study, we measured phase state, surface tension and morphology of mixtures containing inorganic salts (sodium chloride (NaCl) and ammonium salfate (AS)) and OOS under high RH (>99.5%), and investigated their cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity. We found that the κCCN of the studied OOS ranged from 0.15 to 0.37, showing a negative relationship with molar volume. κCCN and chemistry‐derived κChem agreed well for mixtures containing OOS with short carbon chain length (≤4), which could be explained by the ideal solution because of the liquid phase and slight surface tension reduction compared to that of water. However, κChem overpredicted κCCN by 35% and 17% on average for NaCl–OOS and AS–OOS with long carbon chain length (seven and eight), respectively, which was the opposite of results from inorganic–dicarboxylic acid mixtures we previously reported. Although surface tension notably decreased by 25%–44%, inorganic–OOS mixtures exhibited core‐shell morphology and the OOS shell suppressed water uptake, whereas inorganic–dicarboxylic acid particles exhibited homogeneous state thus not inhibiting water uptake.

These turbulent motions, in turn, energize and kick‐up sand particles, influencing sediment transport and ultimately the formation and migration of dunes—with knock‐on consequences for dust emission. While feedback between flow and form have been studied at the scale of dunes, research has not examined how the development of an Internal Boundary Layer (IBL) over the entire dune field influences sediment‐transporting turbulence. Here, we deploy a large‐eddy simulation of an ABL encountering a natural roughness transition: the sand dunes at White Sands National Park, New Mexico. We analyze turbulence producing motions and how they change as the IBL grows over the dune field. Frequency spectrum and Reynolds shear stress profiles show that IBL thickness determines the largest scales of turbulence. Moreover, the developing IBL enhances the frequency, magnitude and duration of sweep and ejection events—turbulence producing motions whose peaks systematically migrate away from the wall as the IBL thickens. Because sweep and ejection events are known to drive sediment transport, our findings provide a mechanism for coupling the co‐evolution of the landscape and the ABL flow over it. More broadly, our results have implications for how roughness transitions influence the transport of pollutants, particulates, heat, and moisture."

We found that the dynamic dust source in East Asia in 2001–2020 demonstrates a pronounced monthly and annual variability, showing wider spatial distribution in March than that in July and lower probability of dust uplifting in summer than that in spring.

The East Asian dust source function generally increases with increasing surface bareness threshold, whereas that in the western Taklimakan Desert and central Gobi Desert decreases with coarse topography calculation resolution.

Earth system models simulate climate change impacts on physical and biogeochemical properties of future oceans under varying emissions scenarios. Coupling these simulations with an ensemble of global marine ecosystem models has indicated broad decreases of fish biomass with warming. However, regional details of these impacts remain much more uncertain. Here, we employ CMIP5 and CMIP6 climate change impact projections using two Earth system models coupled with four regional and nine global marine ecosystem models in 10 ocean regions to evaluate model agreement at regional scales. We find that models developed at different scales can lead to stark differences in biomass projections. On average, global models projected greater biomass declines by the end of the 21st century than regional models. For both global and regional models, greater biomass declines were projected using CMIP6 than CMIP5 simulations. Global models projected biomass declines in 86% of CMIP5 simulations for ocean regions compared to 50% for regional models in the same ocean regions. In CMIP6 simulations, all global model simulations projected biomass declines in ocean regions by 2100, while regional models projected biomass declines in 67% of the ocean region simulations. Our analysis suggests that improved understanding of the causes of differences between global and regional marine ecosystem model climate change projections is needed, alongside observational evaluation of modeled responses."

Seven PM10 stations were used to evaluate the changes in PM10 concentrations over different time intervals (10‐min, hourly, and daily).

The findings of this study demonstrated that the traditional methods that use daily or hourly averages underestimate the atmospheric PM10 concentrations during short convective dust events and therefore lower the estimated exposure. There is a need to consider shorter time intervals to capture the PM concentrations accurately and highlight the importance of real‐time monitoring and accurate characterization of short‐duration events to assess their impacts on air quality and human health."

 Inducing superconducting correlations in chiral edge states is predicted to generate topologically protected zero energy modes with exotic quantum statistics1–6. Experimental efforts so far have focused on engineering interfaces between superconducting materials—typically amorphous metals—and semiconducting quantum Hall7–11 or quantum anomalous Hall12,13 systems. However, the strong interfacial disorder inherent in this approach can prevent the formation of isolated topological modes14–17. An appealing alternative is to use low-density flat band materials in which the ground state can be tuned between intrinsic superconducting and quantum anomalous Hall states using only the electric field effect. However, quantized transport and superconductivity have not been simultaneously achieved. Here we show that rhombohedral tetralayer graphene aligned to a hexagonal boron nitride substrate hosts a quantized anomalous Hall state at superlattice filling ν = −1 as well as a superconducting state at ν ≈ −3.5 at zero magnetic field. Gate voltage can also be used to actuate non-volatile switching of the chirality in the quantum anomalous Hall state18, allowing, in principle, arbitrarily reconfigurable networks of topological edge modes in locally gated devices. Thermodynamic compressibility measurements further show a topologically ordered fractional Chern insulator at ν = 2/3 (ref. 19)—also stable at zero magnetic field—enabling proximity coupling between superconductivity and fractionally charged edge modes. Finally, we show that, as in rhombohedral bi- and trilayers20–22, integrating a transition metal dichalcogenide layer to the heterostructure nucleates a new superconducting pocket20–24, while leaving the topology of the ν = −1 quantum anomalous Hall state intact. Our results pave the way for a new generation of hybrid interfaces between superconductors and topological edge states in the low disorder limit.

 Metastasis is the spread of cancer cells from primary tumours to distant organs and is the cause of 90% of cancer deaths globally1,2. Metastasizing cancer cells are uniquely vulnerable to immune attack, as they are initially deprived of the immunosuppressive microenvironment found within established tumours3. There is interest in therapeutically exploiting this immune vulnerability to prevent recurrence in patients with early cancer at risk of metastasis. Here we show that inhibitors of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1), including aspirin, enhance immunity to cancer metastasis by releasing T cells from suppression by platelet-derived thromboxane A2 (TXA2). TXA2 acts on T cells to trigger an immunosuppressive pathway that is dependent on the guanine exchange factor ARHGEF1, suppressing T cell receptor-driven kinase signalling, proliferation and effector functions. T cell-specific conditional deletion of Arhgef1 in mice increases T cell activation at the metastatic site, provoking immune-mediated rejection of lung and liver metastases. Consequently, restricting the availability of TXA2 using aspirin, selective COX-1 inhibitors or platelet-specific deletion of COX-1 reduces the rate of metastasis in a manner that is dependent on T cell-intrinsic expression of ARHGEF1 and signalling by TXA2 in vivo. These findings reveal a novel immunosuppressive pathway that limits T cell immunity to cancer metastasis, providing mechanistic insights into the anti-metastatic activity of aspirin and paving the way for more effective anti-metastatic immunotherapies. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase 1 releases T cells from immunosuppression by platelet-derived thromboxane A2, thereby enhancing the immune response against metastasis."

 The electroluminescence performance of heavy-metal-free blue quantum dot (QD) light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) is much lower than that of state-of-the-art cadmium-based counterparts. Ecofriendly ZnSeTe QDs are an ideal alternative to cadmium-based blue QDs1,2, but face issues with colour impurity and inferior stability caused by the aggregated tellurium (Ten≥2) that dominates compositional inhomogeneity3,4. Here we developed an isoelectronic control strategy using congeneric sulfur coordinated with triphenyl phosphite (TPP-S) to construct homogeneous ZnSeTeS QDs with pure-blue emissions and near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield. TPP with low electron-donating capability promotes the reactivity balance among anionic precursors, favouring the growth of QDs with uniform composition. The acceptor-like S with high electronegativity weakens the hole localization of the Te atoms by interfering with their surrounding carriers, thereby suppressing the formation of Ten≥2 isoelectronic centres. Furthermore, the congeneric S increases the configurational entropy of the QDs and eliminates the stacking faults and oxygen defects, leading to improved structural stability and reduced non-radiative carrier density. Consequently, the resulting pure-blue QLEDs based on core–shell ZnSeTeS/ZnSe/ZnS QDs emitting at 460 nm show a high external quantum efficiency of 24.7%, a narrow linewidth of 17 nm, and long operational half-lifetime (T50) close to 30,000 hours at 100 cd cm−2, rivalling state-of-the-art cadmium-based blue QLEDs.

 Mergers of binary neutron stars emit signals in both the gravitational-wave (GW) and electromagnetic spectra. Famously, the 2017 multi-messenger observation of GW170817 (refs. 1,2) led to scientific discoveries across cosmology3, nuclear physics4–6 and gravity7. Central to these results were the sky localization and distance obtained from the GW data, which, in the case of GW170817, helped to identify the associated electromagnetic transient, AT 2017gfo (ref. 8), 11 h after the GW signal. Fast analysis of GW data is critical for directing time-sensitive electromagnetic observations. However, owing to challenges arising from the length and complexity of signals, it is often necessary to make approximations that sacrifice accuracy. Here we present a machine-learning framework that performs complete binary neutron star inference in just 1 s without making any such approximations. Our approach enhances multi-messenger observations by providing: (1) accurate localization even before the merger; (2) improved localization precision by around 30% compared to approximate low-latency methods; and (3) detailed information on luminosity distance, inclination and masses, which can be used to prioritize expensive telescope time. Additionally, the flexibility and reduced cost of our method open new opportunities for equation-of-state studies. Finally, we demonstrate that our method scales to long signals, up to an hour in length, thus serving as a blueprint for data analysis for next-generation ground- and space-based detectors.

 The phytohormone auxin (Aux) is a principal endogenous developmental signal in plants. It mediates transcriptional reprogramming by a well-established canonical signalling mechanism. TIR1/AFB auxin receptors are F-box subunits of an ubiquitin ligase complex; after auxin perception, they associate with Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors and ubiquitinate them for degradation, thus enabling the activation of auxin response factor (ARF) transcription factors1–3. Here we revise this paradigm by showing that without TIR1 adenylate cyclase (AC) activity4, auxin-induced degradation of Aux/IAAs is not sufficient to mediate the transcriptional auxin response. Abolishing the TIR1 AC activity does not affect auxin-induced degradation of Aux/IAAs but renders TIR1 non-functional in mediating transcriptional reprogramming and auxin-regulated development, including shoot, root, root hair growth and lateral root formation. Transgenic plants show that local cAMP production in the vicinity of the Aux/IAA–ARF complex by unrelated AC enzymes bypasses the need for auxin perception and is sufficient to induce ARF-mediated transcription. These discoveries revise the canonical model of auxin signalling and establish TIR1/AFB-produced cAMP as a second messenger essential for transcriptional reprograming. cAMP produced by the TIR1/AFB receptors of the main endogenous developmental plant hormone auxin acts as a true second messenger, revising the established paradigm of transcriptional auxin signalling."

 Recent evidence indicates that the emergence of stone tool technology occurred before the appearance of the genus Homo1 and may potentially be traced back deep into the primate evolutionary line2. Conversely, osseous technologies are apparently exclusive of later hominins from approximately 2 million years ago (Ma)3,4, whereas the earliest systematic production of bone tools is currently restricted to European Acheulean sites 400–250 thousand years ago5,6. Here we document an assemblage of bone tools shaped by knapping found within a single stratigraphic horizon at Olduvai Gorge dated to 1.5 Ma. Large mammal limb bone fragments, mostly from hippopotamus and elephant, were shaped to produce various tools, including massive elongated implements. Before our discovery, bone artefact production in pre-Middle Stone Age African contexts was widely considered as episodic, expedient and unrepresentative of early Homo toolkits. However, our results demonstrate that at the transition between the Oldowan and the early Acheulean, East African hominins developed an original cultural innovation that entailed a transfer and adaptation of knapping skills from stone to bone. By producing technologically and morphologically standardized bone tools, early Acheulean toolmakers unravelled technological repertoires that were previously thought to have appeared routinely more than 1 million years later. Bone tools shaped by knapping found within Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania precede any other evidence of systematic bone tool production by more than 1 million years."

 Mesenchymal plasticity has been extensively described in advanced epithelial cancers; however, its functional role in malignant progression is controversial1–5. The function of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell plasticity in tumour heterogeneity and clonal evolution is poorly understood. Here we clarify the contribution of EMT to malignant progression in pancreatic cancer. We used somatic mosaic genome engineering technologies to trace and ablate malignant mesenchymal lineages along the EMT continuum. The experimental evidence clarifies the essential contribution of mesenchymal lineages to pancreatic cancer evolution. Spatial genomic analysis, single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of EMT clarifies its contribution to the emergence of genomic instability, including events of chromothripsis. Genetic ablation of mesenchymal lineages robustly abolished these mutational processes and evolutionary patterns, as confirmed by cross-species analysis of pancreatic and other human solid tumours. Mechanistically, we identified that malignant cells with mesenchymal features display increased chromatin accessibility, particularly in the pericentromeric and centromeric regions, in turn resulting in delayed mitosis and catastrophic cell division. Thus, EMT favours the emergence of genomic-unstable, highly fit tumour cells, which strongly supports the concept of cell-state-restricted patterns of evolution, whereby cancer cell speciation is propagated to progeny within restricted functional compartments. Restraining the evolutionary routes through ablation of clones capable of mesenchymal plasticity, and extinction of the derived lineages, halts the malignant potential of one of the most aggressive forms of human cancer.

 The Antarctic ozone ‘hole’ was discovered in 1985 (ref. 1) and man-made ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) are its primary cause2. Following reductions of ODSs under the Montreal Protocol3, signs of ozone recovery have been reported, based largely on observations and broad yet compelling model–data comparisons4. Although such approaches are highly valuable, they do not provide rigorous statistical detection of the temporal and spatial structure of Antarctic ozone recovery in the presence of internal climate variability. Here we apply pattern-based detection and attribution methods as used in climate-change studies5–11 to separate anthropogenically forced ozone responses from internal variability, relying on trend pattern information as a function of month and height. The analysis uses satellite observations together with single-model and multi-model ensemble simulations to identify and quantify the month–height Antarctic ozone recovery ‘fingerprint’12. We demonstrate that the data and simulations show compelling agreement in the fingerprint pattern of the ozone response to decreasing ODSs since 2005. We also show that ODS forcing has enhanced ozone internal variability during the austral spring, influencing detection of forced responses and their time of emergence. Our results provide robust statistical and physical evidence that actions taken under the Montreal Protocol to reduce ODSs are indeed resulting in the beginning of Antarctic ozone recovery, defined as increases in ozone consistent with expected month–height patterns.

 Mammalian behaviour and physiology undergo major changes in early life. Young animals rely on conspecifics to meet their needs and start showing nutritional independence and sex-specific social interactions at weaning and puberty, respectively. How neuronal populations regulating homeostatic functions and social behaviours develop during these transitions remains unclear. We used paired transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiling to examine the developmental trajectories of neuronal populations in the hypothalamic preoptic region, where cell types with key roles in physiological and behavioural control have been identified1–6. These data show a marked diversity of developmental trajectories shaped by the sex of the animal, and the location and behavioural or physiological function of the corresponding cell types. We identify key stages of preoptic development, including early diversification, perinatal emergence of sex differences, postnatal maturation and refinement of signalling networks, and nonlinear transcriptional changes accelerating at the time of weaning and puberty. We assessed preoptic development in various sensory mutants and find a major role for vomeronasal sensing in the timing of preoptic cell type maturation. These results provide new insights into the development of neurons controlling homeostatic functions and social behaviours and lay ground for examining the dynamics of these functions in early life.

 Peptide hormones, a class of pharmacologically active molecules, have a critical role in regulating energy homeostasis. Prohormone convertase 1/3 (also known as PCSK1/3) represents a key enzymatic mechanism in peptide processing, as exemplified with the therapeutic target glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)1,2. However, the full spectrum of peptides generated by PCSK1 and their functional roles remain largely unknown. Here we use computational drug discovery to systematically map more than 2,600 previously uncharacterized human proteolytic peptide fragments cleaved by prohormone convertases, enabling the identification of novel bioactive peptides. Using this approach, we identified a 12-mer peptide, BRINP2-related peptide (BRP). When administered pharmacologically, BRP reduces food intake and exhibits anti-obesity effects in mice and pigs without inducing nausea or aversion. Mechanistically, BRP administration triggers central FOS activation and acts independently of leptin, GLP-1 receptor and melanocortin 4 receptor. Together, these data introduce a method to identify new bioactive peptides and establish pharmacologically that BRP may be useful for therapeutic modulation of body weight.

 Seawater electrolysis powered by renewable electricity provides an attractive strategy for producing green hydrogen1–5. However, direct seawater electrolysis faces many challenges, primarily arising from corrosion and competing reactions at the anode caused by the abundance of halide ions (Cl−, Br−) in seawater6. Previous studies3,6–14 on seawater electrolysis have mainly focused on the anode development, because the cathode operates at reducing potentials, which is not subject to electrode dissolution or chloride corrosion reactions during seawater electrolysis11,15. However, renewable energy sources are intermittent, variable and random, which cause frequent start–shutdown operations if renewable electricity is used to drive seawater electrolysis. Here we first unveil dynamic evolution and degradation of seawater splitting cathode in intermittent electrolysis and, accordingly, propose construction of a catalyst’s passivation layer to maintain the hydrogen evolution performance during operation. An in situ-formed phosphate passivation layer on the surface of NiCoP–Cr2O3 cathode can effectively protect metal active sites against oxidation during frequent discharge processes and repel halide ion adsorption on the cathode during shutdown conditions. We demonstrate that electrodes optimized using this design strategy can withstand fluctuating operation at 0.5 A cm−2 for 10,000 h in alkaline seawater, with a voltage increase rate of only 0.5% khr−1. The newly discovered challenge and our proposed strategy herein offer new insights to facilitate the development of practical seawater splitting technologies powered by renewable electricity.

Such peptides might provide a source of natural antibiotics that could lead to biotechnology applications and therapeutic interventions. 
 For decades, antigen presentation on major histocompatibility complex class I for T cell-mediated immunity has been considered the primary function of proteasome-derived peptides1,2. However, whether the products of proteasomal degradation play additional parts in mounting immune responses remains unknown. Antimicrobial peptides serve as a first line of defence against invading pathogens before the adaptive immune system responds. Although the protective function of antimicrobial peptides across numerous tissues is well established, the cellular mechanisms underlying their generation are not fully understood. Here we uncover a role for proteasomes in the constitutive and bacterial-induced generation of defence peptides that impede bacterial growth both in vitro and in vivo by disrupting bacterial membranes. In silico prediction of proteome-wide proteasomal cleavage identified hundreds of thousands of potential proteasome-derived defence peptides with cationic properties that may be generated en route to degradation to act as a first line of defence. Furthermore, bacterial infection induces changes in proteasome composition and function, including PSME3 recruitment and increased tryptic-like cleavage, enhancing antimicrobial activity. Beyond providing mechanistic insights into the role of proteasomes in cell-autonomous innate immunity, our study suggests that proteasome-cleaved peptides may have previously overlooked functions downstream of degradation. From a translational standpoint, identifying proteasome-derived defence peptides could provide an untapped source of natural antibiotics for biotechnological applications and therapeutic interventions in infectious diseases and immunocompromised conditions. Proteasomal degradation of cellular proteins generate defence peptides constitutively and in response to bacterial infection. Such peptides might provide a source of natural antibiotics that could lead to biotechnology applications and therapeutic interventions."

 Artificial intelligence (AI) edge devices1–12 demand high-precision energy-efficient computations, large on-chip model storage, rapid wakeup-to-response time and cost-effective foundry-ready solutions. Floating point (FP) computation provides precision exceeding that of integer (INT) formats at the cost of higher power and storage overhead. Multi-level-cell (MLC) memristor compute-in-memory (CIM)13–15 provides compact non-volatile storage and energy-efficient computation but is prone to accuracy loss owing to process variation. Digital static random-access memory (SRAM)-CIM16–22 enables lossless computation; however, storage is low as a result of large bit-cell area and model loading is required during inference. Thus, conventional approaches using homogeneous CIM architectures and computation formats impose a trade-off between efficiency, storage, wakeup latency and inference accuracy. Here we present a mixed-precision heterogeneous CIM AI edge processor, which supports the layer-granular/kernel-granular partitioning of network layers among on-chip CIM architectures (that is, memristor-CIM, SRAM-CIM and tiny-digital units) and computation number formats (INT and FP) based on sensitivity to error. This layer-granular/kernel-granular flexibility allows simultaneous optimization within the two-dimensional design space at the hardware level. The proposed hardware achieved high energy efficiency (40.91 TFLOPS W−1 for ResNet-20 with CIFAR-100 and 28.63 TFLOPS W−1 for MobileNet-v2 with ImageNet), low accuracy degradation (<0.45% for ResNet-20 with CIFAR-100 and for MobilNet-v2 with ImageNet) and rapid wakeup-to-response time (373.52 μs).

 The mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) governs the entry of pyruvate—a central metabolite that bridges cytosolic glycolysis with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation—into the mitochondrial matrix1–5. It thus serves as a pivotal metabolic gatekeeper and has fundamental roles in cellular metabolism. Moreover, MPC is a key target for drugs aimed at managing diabetes, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and neurodegenerative diseases4–6. However, despite MPC’s critical roles in both physiology and medicine, the molecular mechanisms underlying its transport function and how it is inhibited by drugs have remained largely unclear.

 Amphibians are the most threatened vertebrates, yet their resilience to rising temperatures remains poorly understood1,2. This is primarily because knowledge of thermal tolerance is taxonomically and geographically biased3, compromising global climate vulnerability assessments. Here we used a phylogenetically informed data-imputation approach to predict the heat tolerance of 60% of amphibian species and assessed their vulnerability to daily temperature variations in thermal refugia. We found that 104 out of 5,203 species (2%) are currently exposed to overheating events in shaded terrestrial conditions. Despite accounting for heat-tolerance plasticity, a 4 °C global temperature increase would create a step change in impact severity, pushing 7.5% of species beyond their physiological limits. In the Southern Hemisphere, tropical species encounter disproportionally more overheating events, while non-tropical species are more susceptible in the Northern Hemisphere. These findings challenge evidence for a general latitudinal gradient in overheating risk4–6 and underscore the importance of considering climatic variability in vulnerability assessments. We provide conservative estimates assuming access to cool shaded microenvironments. Thus, the impacts of global warming will probably exceed our projections. Our microclimate-explicit analyses demonstrate that vegetation and water bodies are critical in buffering amphibians during heat waves. Immediate action is needed to preserve and manage these microhabitat features. A 4 °C global temperature increase would push 7.5% of amphibian species beyond their physiological limits."

 To survive in dynamic environments with uncertain resources, animals must adapt their behaviour flexibly, choosing strategies such as persevering with a current choice, exploring alternatives or disengaging altogether. Previous studies have mainly investigated how forebrain regions represent choice costs and values as well as optimal strategies during such decisions1–5. However, the neural mechanisms by which the brain implements alternative behavioural strategies such as persevering, exploring or disengaging remain poorly understood. Here we identify a neural hub that is critical for flexible switching between behavioural strategies, the median raphe nucleus (MRN). Using cell-type-specific optogenetic manipulations, fibre photometry and circuit tracing in mice performing diverse instinctive and learnt behaviours, we found that the main cell types of the MRN—GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-expressing), glutamatergic (VGluT2+) and serotonergic neurons—have complementary functions and regulate perseverance, exploration and disengagement, respectively. Suppression of MRN GABAergic neurons—for instance, through inhibitory input from lateral hypothalamus, which conveys strong positive valence to the MRN—leads to perseverative behaviour. By contrast, activation of MRN VGluT2+ neurons drives exploration. Activity of serotonergic MRN neurons is necessary for general task engagement. Input from the lateral habenula that conveys negative valence suppresses serotonergic MRN neurons, leading to disengagement. These findings establish the MRN as a central behavioural switchboard that is uniquely positioned to flexibly control behavioural strategies. These circuits thus may also have an important role in the aetiology of major mental pathologies such as depressive or obsessive-compulsive disorders. Behavioural experiments in mice demonstrate that GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-expressing), glutamatergic and serotonergic neurons in the median raphe nucleus have distinct and complementary functions in regulating decision-making resulting in flexible behavioural strategies."

 The current opioid overdose epidemic highlights the urgent need to develop safer and more effective treatments for chronic pain1. Cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) is a promising non-opioid target for pain relief, but its clinical use has been limited by centrally mediated psychoactivity and tolerance. We overcame both issues by designing peripherally restricted CB1 agonists that minimize arrestin recruitment. We achieved these goals by computationally designing positively charged derivatives of the potent CB1 agonist MDMB-Fubinaca2. We designed these ligands to occupy a cryptic pocket identified through molecular dynamics simulations—an extended binding pocket that opens rarely and leads to the conserved signalling residue D2.50 (ref. 3). We used structure determination, pharmacological assays and molecular dynamics simulations to verify the binding modes of these ligands and to determine the molecular mechanism by which they achieve this dampening of arrestin recruitment. Our lead ligand, VIP36, is highly peripherally restricted and demonstrates notable efficacy in three mouse pain models, with 100-fold dose separation between analgesic efficacy and centrally mediated side effects. VIP36 exerts analgesic efficacy through peripheral CB1 receptors and shows limited analgesic tolerance. These results show how targeting a cryptic pocket in a G-protein-coupled receptor can lead to enhanced peripheral selectivity, biased signalling, desired in vivo pharmacology and reduced adverse effects. This has substantial implications for chronic pain treatment but could also revolutionize the design of drugs targeting other G-protein-coupled receptors. A peripherally restricted CB1 agonist (VIP36) targeting a cryptic receptor pocket was developed, showing high efficacy in mouse pain models with minimal side effects and tolerance, potentially revolutionizing chronic pain treatment and GPCR drug design."

 Pathogen genomics can provide insights into underlying infectious disease transmission patterns1,2, but new methods are needed to handle modern large-scale pathogen genome datasets and realize this full potential3–5. In particular, genetically proximal viruses should be highly informative about transmission events as genetic proximity indicates epidemiological linkage. Here we use pairs of identical sequences to characterize fine-scale transmission patterns using 114,298 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected through Washington State (USA) genomic sentinel surveillance with associated age and residence location information between March 2021 and December 2022. This corresponds to 59,660 sequences with another identical sequence in the dataset. We find that the location of pairs of identical sequences is highly consistent with expectations from mobility and social contact data. Outliers in the relationship between genetic and mobility data can be explained by SARS-CoV-2 transmission between postcodes with male prisons, consistent with transmission between prison facilities. We find that transmission patterns between age groups vary across spatial scales. Finally, we use the timing of sequence collection to understand the age groups driving transmission. Overall, this study improves our ability to use large pathogen genome datasets to understand the determinants of infectious disease spread.

Ziegler;Bojie Fu;Zhenzhong Zeng,Impact of Amazonian deforestation on precipitation reverses between seasons,"Reversed precipitation responses to Amazon deforestation show that deforestation leads to precipitation increases in the wet season and decreases in the dry season. 
 Tropical deforestation was found to cause large reductions in precipitation using a range of observation-based datasets1. However, the limitations of satellite-based space-for-time statistical analysis have hindered understanding of the roles of reshaped mesoscale atmospheric circulation and regional precipitation recycling at different scales. These effects are considered nonlocal effects, which are distinct from the local effects governed by deforestation-induced reductions in evapotranspiration (ET). Here we show reversed precipitation responses to Amazon deforestation across wet and dry seasons. During the wet season, deforested grids experienced a noteworthy increase in precipitation (0.96 mm month−1 per percentage point forest loss), primarily attributed to enhanced mesoscale atmospheric circulation (that is, nonlocal effect). These nonlocal increases weaken with distance from deforested grids, leading to significant precipitation reductions in buffers beyond 60 km. Conversely, during the dry season, precipitation decreases in deforested grids and throughout all analysis buffers, with local effects from reduced ET dominating. Our findings highlight the intricate balance between local effects and nonlocal effects in driving deforestation–precipitation responses across different seasons and scales and emphasize the urgent need to address the rapid and extensive loss of forest in the Amazon region. Reversed precipitation responses to Amazon deforestation show that deforestation leads to precipitation increases in the wet season and decreases in the dry season."

 Whole-genome duplication (WGD) is widespread across eukaryotes and can promote adaptive evolution1–4. However, given the instability of newly formed polyploid genomes5–7, understanding how WGDs arise in a population, persist, and underpin adaptations remains a challenge. Here, using our ongoing Multicellularity Long Term Evolution Experiment (MuLTEE)8, we show that diploid snowflake yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) under selection for larger multicellular size rapidly evolve to be tetraploid. From their origin within the first 50 days of the experiment, tetraploids persisted for the next 950 days (nearly 5,000 generations, the current leading edge of our experiment) in 10 replicate populations, despite being genomically unstable. Using synthetic reconstruction, biophysical modelling and counter-selection, we found that tetraploidy evolved because it confers immediate fitness benefits under this selection, by producing larger, longer cells that yield larger clusters. The same selective benefit also maintained tetraploidy over long evolutionary timescales, inhibiting the reversion to diploidy that is typically seen in laboratory evolution experiments. Once established, tetraploidy facilitated novel genetic routes for adaptation, having a key role in the evolution of macroscopic multicellular size via the origin of evolutionarily conserved aneuploidy. These results provide unique empirical insights into the evolutionary dynamics and impacts of WGD, showing how it can initially arise due to its immediate adaptive benefits, be maintained by selection and fuel long-term innovations by creating additional dimensions of heritable genetic variation.

 Haematopoietic stem cells maintain blood production throughout life1. Although extensively characterized using the laboratory mouse, little is known about clonal selection and population dynamics of the haematopoietic stem cell pool during murine ageing. We isolated stem cells and progenitors from young and old mice, identifying 221,890 somatic mutations genome-wide in 1,845 single-cell-derived colonies. Mouse stem cells and progenitors accrue approximately 45 somatic mutations per year, a rate only approximately threefold greater than human progenitors despite the vastly different organismal sizes and lifespans. Phylogenetic patterns show that stem and multipotent progenitor cell pools are established during embryogenesis, after which they independently self-renew in parallel over life, evenly contributing to differentiated progenitors and peripheral blood. The stem cell pool grows steadily over the mouse lifespan to about 70,000 cells, self-renewing about every 6 weeks. Aged mice did not display the profound loss of clonal diversity characteristic of human haematopoietic ageing. However, targeted sequencing showed small, expanded clones in the context of murine ageing, which were larger and more numerous following haematological perturbations, exhibiting a selection landscape similar to humans. Our data illustrate both conserved features of population dynamics of blood and distinct patterns of age-associated somatic evolution in the short-lived mouse. Isolating and studying haematopoietic stem cells in young and aged mice demonstrates evolutionary processes related to blood production and provides a framework for interpreting future work using laboratory mice to study stem cell ageing."

 Tropical forest canopies are the biosphere’s most concentrated atmospheric interface for carbon, water and energy1,2. However, in most Earth System Models, the diverse and heterogeneous tropical forest biome is represented as a largely uniform ecosystem with either a singular or a small number of fixed canopy ecophysiological properties3. This situation arises, in part, from a lack of understanding about how and why the functional properties of tropical forest canopies vary geographically4. Here, by combining field-collected data from more than 1,800 vegetation plots and tree traits with satellite remote-sensing, terrain, climate and soil data, we predict variation across 13 morphological, structural and chemical functional traits of trees, and use this to compute and map the functional diversity of tropical forests. Our findings reveal that the tropical Americas, Africa and Asia tend to occupy different portions of the total functional trait space available across tropical forests. Tropical American forests are predicted to have 40% greater functional richness than tropical African and Asian forests. Meanwhile, African forests have the highest functional divergence—32% and 7% higher than that of tropical American and Asian forests, respectively. An uncertainty analysis highlights priority regions for further data collection, which would refine and improve these maps. Our predictions represent a ground-based and remotely enabled global analysis of how and why the functional traits of tropical forest canopies vary across space. Data from a variety of sources—including satellite, climate and soil data, as well as field-collected information on plant traits—are pooled and analysed to map the functional diversity of tropical forest canopies globally."

 More than ten ergot alkaloids comprising both natural and semi-synthetic products are used to treat various diseases1,2. The central C ring forms the core pharmacophore for ergot alkaloids, giving them structural similarity to neurotransmitters, thus enabling their modulation of neurotransmitter receptors3. The haem catalase chanoclavine synthase (EasC) catalyses the construction of this ring through complex radical oxidative cyclization4. Unlike canonical catalases, which catalyse H2O2 disproportionation5,6, EasC and its homologues represent a broader class of catalases that catalyse O2-dependent radical reactions4,7. We have elucidated the structure of EasC by cryo-electron microscopy, revealing a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced) (NADPH)-binding pocket and a haem pocket common to all haem catalases, with a unique homodimeric architecture that is, to our knowledge, previously unobserved. The substrate prechanoclavine unprecedentedly binds in the NADPH-binding pocket, instead of the previously suspected haem-binding pocket, and two pockets were connected by a slender tunnel. Contrary to the established mechanisms, EasC uses superoxide rather than the more generally used transient haem iron–oxygen complexes (such as compounds I, II and III)8,9, to mediate substrate transformation through superoxide-mediated cooperative catalysis of the two distant pockets. We propose that this reactive oxygen species mechanism could be widespread in metalloenzyme-catalysed reactions. The unique structure and mechanism of chanoclavine synthase (EasC), a haem catalase that uses superoxide for substrate transformation in ergot alkaloid biosynthesis, are revealed in this study, challenging established catalase mechanisms."

However, only recently has there been convincing experimental evidence, mainly using ultracold atomic Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs) coupled to electromagnetic fields. There, various guises of the supersolid were created using atoms coupled to high-finesse cavities5,6, with large magnetic dipole moments7–13, and spin–orbit-coupled, two-component systems showing stripe phases14–16. Here we provide experimental evidence of a new implementation of the supersolid phase in a driven-dissipative, non-equilibrium context based on exciton–polaritons condensed in a topologically non-trivial, bound state in the continuum (BiC) with exceptionally low losses, realized in a photonic-crystal waveguide. We measure the density modulation of the polaritonic state indicating the breaking of translational symmetry with a precision of several parts in a thousand. Direct access to the phase of the wavefunction allows us to also measure the local coherence of the supersolid. We demonstrate the potential of our synthetic photonic material to host phonon dynamics and a multimode excitation spectrum. Experimental evidence is presented for a new implementation of supersolidity in a driven-dissipative, non-equilibrium context realized in a photonic-crystal waveguide, demonstrating the breaking of translational symmetry with exceptionally low losses."

 The preference for a particular thermal range is a key determinant of the distribution of animal species. However, we know little on how temperature preference behaviour evolves during the colonization of new environments. Here we show that at least two distinct neurobiological mechanisms drive the evolution of temperature preference in flies of the genus Drosophila. Fly species from mild climates (D. melanogaster and D. persimilis) avoid both innocuous and noxious heat, and we show that the thermal activation threshold of the molecular heat receptor Gr28b.d precisely matches species-specific thresholds of behavioural heat avoidance. We find that desert-dwelling D. mojavensis are instead actively attracted to innocuous heat. Notably, heat attraction is also mediated by Gr28b.d (and by the antennal neurons that express it) and matches its threshold of heat activation. Rather, the switch in valence from heat aversion to attraction correlates with specific changes in thermosensory input to the lateral horn, the main target of central thermosensory pathways and a region of the fly brain implicated in the processing of innate valence1–5. Together, our results demonstrate that, in Drosophila, the adaptation to different thermal niches involves changes in thermal preference behaviour, and that this can be accomplished using distinct neurobiological solutions, ranging from shifts in the activation threshold of peripheral thermosensory receptor proteins to a substantial change in the way temperature valence is processed in the brain. A study using flies of the genus Drosophila adapted to life in diverse thermal environments shows how evolution has shaped temperature preference by acting on both molecular heat receptors and thermosensory circuits in the flies."

Lippman,<i>Solanum</i> pan-genetics reveals paralogues as contingencies in crop engineering,"Gene duplication and subsequent paralogue diversification are major obstacles to genotype-to-phenotype predictability. 
 Pan-genomics and genome-editing technologies are revolutionizing breeding of global crops1,2. A transformative opportunity lies in exchanging genotype-to-phenotype knowledge between major crops (that is, those cultivated globally) and indigenous crops (that is, those locally cultivated within a circumscribed area)3–5 to enhance our food system. However, species-specific genetic variants and their interactions with desirable natural or engineered mutations pose barriers to achieving predictable phenotypic effects, even between related crops6,7. Here, by establishing a pan-genome of the crop-rich genus Solanum8 and integrating functional genomics and pan-genetics, we show that gene duplication and subsequent paralogue diversification are major obstacles to genotype-to-phenotype predictability. Despite broad conservation of gene macrosynteny among chromosome-scale references for 22 species, including 13 indigenous crops, thousands of gene duplications, particularly within key domestication gene families, exhibited dynamic trajectories in sequence, expression and function. By augmenting our pan-genome with African eggplant cultivars9 and applying quantitative genetics and genome editing, we dissected an intricate history of paralogue evolution affecting fruit size. The loss of a redundant paralogue of the classical fruit size regulator CLAVATA3 (CLV3)10,11 was compensated by a lineage-specific tandem duplication. Subsequent pseudogenization of the derived copy, followed by a large cultivar-specific deletion, created a single fused CLV3 allele that modulates fruit organ number alongside an enzymatic gene controlling the same trait. Our findings demonstrate that paralogue diversifications over short timescales are underexplored contingencies in trait evolvability. Exposing and navigating these contingencies is crucial for translating genotype-to-phenotype relationships across species. Gene duplication and subsequent paralogue diversification are major obstacles to genotype-to-phenotype predictability."

This study demonstrates the ability to halt the HER at Volmer step, where protons migrate to the unsaturated bond of AN on a self-supported CuO@Cu heterostructure. The CuO@Cu catalyst exhibits nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency (FE) over the entire range of potentials tested from −0.1 to −0.4 V vs. RHE, demonstrating remarkable stability over 1000 h at a constant current density of 0.2 A cm−2. CuO is identified as the active component driving the reaction, while the metallic Cu facilitates efficient electron transfer. Theoretical simulations and experimental evidences indicate that a synergistic hydrogenation process contributes to the AN reduction reaction (ARR), which involves both surface hydrogen migration and proton addition from solution. This study provides an insight into understanding of ARR process, and suggests an efficient strategy to enhance the electrochemical hydrogenation of organic molecules by regulating the Volmer step. The competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) presents a major challenge in achieving the selective acetonitrile reduction reaction (ARR) to ethylamine. Here, the authors report halting HER at the Volmer step on a CuO@Cu heterostructure, significantly promoting the selective ARR."

 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection depletes CD4 T-cells, and long-term persistence of latent virus prevents full clearance of HIV even in the presence of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), Here we present the HIV-1-induced lineage tracing (HILT) system, a model that irreversibly marks infected cells within a humanized mouse model, which detects rare latently infected cells. Immunodeficient mice transplanted with genetically modified hematopoietic stem cells develop a human immune system, in which CD4 T-cells contain a genetic switch that permanently labels cells infected by HIV-1 expressing cre-recombinase. Through single-cell RNA sequencing of HILT-marked cells during acute infection and post-ART treatment, we identify distinct CD4+ T-cell transcriptional lineages enriched in either active or latent infections. Comparative gene expression analysis highlights common pathways modulated in both states, including EIF2, Sirtuin, and protein ubiquitination. Critical regulators of these pathways, including JUN, BCL2, and MDM2, change to opposite directions in the two states, highlighting gene expression programs that may support HIV persistence across T-cell lineages and states.

 Noninvasive visualization of the distribution and persistence of mRNA vaccine antigen expression in mammalian systems has implications for the development and evaluation of future mRNA vaccines. Here, we genetically fuse E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR) to the delta furin diproline modified SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S2P∆f) mRNA vaccine and image its expression in female mice and male non-human primates using [18F]fluoropropyl-trimethoprim ([18F]FP-TMP). Whole body positron emission tomography (PET) imaging revealed transient expression of the vaccine antigen in the injection site and draining lymph nodes (dLNs). Fusion of eDHFR did not impact S2P immunogenicity and no humoral or cellular immune response was detected against eDHFR in either species. In this work, we show that eDHFR can be used as an mRNA-encoded PET reporter gene to monitor the spatiotemporal dynamics of mRNA vaccine antigen expression in vivo. This technique could be applied in clinical translation of future mRNA vaccines or therapeutics. mRNA vaccines have been successfully developed, but a better understanding of in vivo distribution of the encoded antigen may aid further improvements.

 Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) belonging to lineage 2.3.4.4b emerged in Chile in December 2022, leading to mass mortality events in wild birds, poultry, and marine mammals and one human case. We detected HPAIV in 7,33% (714/9745) of cases between December 2022–April 2023 and sequenced 177 H5N1 virus genomes from poultry, marine mammals, a human, and wild birds spanning >3800 km of Chilean coastline. Chilean viruses were closely related to Peru’s H5N1 outbreak, consistent with north-to-south spread down the Pacific coastline. One human virus and nine marine mammal viruses in Chile had the rare PB2 D701N mammalian-adaptation mutation and clustered phylogenetically despite being sampled 5 weeks and hundreds of kilometers apart. These viruses shared additional genetic signatures, including another mammalian PB2 adaptation (Q591K, n = 6), synonymous mutations, and minor variants. Several mutations were detected months later in sealions in the Atlantic coast, indicating that the pinniped outbreaks on the west and east coasts of South America are genetically linked. These data support sustained mammal-to-mammal transmission of HPAIV in marine mammals over thousands of kilometers of Chile’s Pacific coastline, which subsequently continued through the Atlantic coastline.

 Virtual library docking can reveal unexpected chemotypes that complement the structures of biological targets. Seeking agonists for the cannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1R), we dock 74 million tangible molecules and prioritize 46 high ranking ones for de novo synthesis and testing. Nine are active by radioligand competition, a 20% hit-rate. Structure-based optimization of one of the most potent of these (Ki = 0.7 µM) leads to ‘1350, a 0.95 nM ligand and a full CB1R agonist of Gi/o signaling. A cryo-EM structure of ‘1350 in complex with CB1R-Gi1 confirms its predicted docked pose. The lead agonist is strongly analgesic in male mice, with a 2-20-fold therapeutic window over hypolocomotion, sedation, and catalepsy and no observable conditioned place preference. These findings suggest that unique cannabinoid chemotypes may disentangle characteristic cannabinoid side-effects from analgesia, supporting the further development of cannabinoids as pain therapeutics.

 In structural bioinformatics, the efficiency of predicting protein similarity, function, and evolutionary relationships is crucial. Our approach proposed herein leverages protein energy profiles derived from a knowledge-based potential, deviating from traditional methods relying on structural alignment or atomic distances. This method assigns unique energy profiles to individual proteins, facilitating rapid comparative analysis for both structural similarities and evolutionary relationships across various hierarchical levels. Our study demonstrates that energy profiles contain substantial information about protein structure at class, fold, superfamily, and family levels. Notably, these profiles accurately distinguish proteins across species, illustrated by the classification of coronavirus spike glycoproteins and bacteriocin proteins. Introducing a separation measure based on energy profile similarity, our method shows significant correlation with a network-based approach, emphasizing the potential of energy profiles as efficient predictors for drug combinations with faster computational requirements.

 The histone H3K36-specific methyltransferase ASH1L plays a critical role in development and is frequently dysregulated in human diseases, particularly cancer. Here, we report on the biological functions of the C-terminal region of ASH1L encompassing a bromodomain (ASH1LBD), a plant homeodomain (ASH1LPHD) finger, and a bromo-adjacent homology (ASH1LBAH) domain, structurally characterize these domains, describe their mechanisms of action, and explore functional crosstalk between them. We find that ASH1LPHD recognizes H3K4me2/3, whereas the neighboring ASH1LBD and ASH1LBAH have DNA binding activities. The DNA binding function of ASH1LBAH is a driving force for the association of ASH1L with the linker DNA in the nucleosome, and the large interface with ASH1LPHD stabilizes the ASH1LBAH fold, merging two domains into a single module. We show that ASH1L is involved in embryonic stem cell differentiation and co-localizes with H3K4me3 but not with H3K36me2 at transcription start sites of target genes and genome wide, and that the interaction of ASH1LPHD with H3K4me3 is inhibitory to the H3K36me2-specific catalytic activity of ASH1L.

 Classical plume models offer insights into intraplate volcanism and seamount chain formation by assuming a cylindrical upwelling of hot materials from the core-mantle boundary. The interaction of mantle plumes with ridges or subducting slabs disrupts typical plate tectonics, leading to distinctive tectonic phenomena such as ridge jumps or slab stagnation. However, thermal plume models sometimes fall short in explaining perplexing tectonic features, necessitating consideration of compositional heterogeneities within mantle plumes. Here, using multimode waveform tomography, we identify a large, vertically divergent low-velocity anomaly in the upper mantle beneath the Coral Sea in the southwestern Pacific, which circumvents the remnants of subducting slabs toward northeastern Australia with intraplate volcanism, and the Woodlark rift, the most rapidly extending continental rift. Our findings furnish seismic evidence for the widespread propagation of a thermochemical mantle plume spanning over 10° at depths of 270–410 km, facilitating its simultaneous contacts with slabs and rifts.

 Fractured rock petrophysical studies rarely use temporal constraints, thus hindering fracture-related permeability and connectivity estimation during past geofluid migration. Here we present a conceptual approach, using a stochastic method incorporating absolute ages to reconstruct fracture arrays back in geological time. Generating ‘grown’ discrete fracture network models, we simulate the hydraulic behaviour of fractured rock volumes from the late-Cretaceous/Palaeocene to the Devonian, via progressive fracture back-stripping. We reveal that for the examined rock mass, maximum principal permeability increased through time from 9.47e-14 m2 to 4.44e-13 m2 (~3 orders of magnitude) along with the maximum horizontal permeability orientation shifting from NE-SW to NW-SE. Similarly, the connectivity metric increased with fracture saturation, peaking in the mid-Cretaceous. For comparison, dated offshore hydrocarbon secondary migration potentially coincides with our results. Back-stripping of time-constrained fracture sets is therefore a powerful method to investigate and quantify the dynamic evolution of petrophysical properties through geological time.

 Deep tectonic tremor occurs repeatedly at the base of a forearc mantle wedge corner, where a highly fluid-pressurized serpentinite shear zone is thought to develop. However, the deformation mechanisms that accommodate these tremors within the shear zone remain unclear. Here, we present observations of deformation experiments on water-saturated serpentinite conducted at pressure–temperature conditions relevant to the tremor zone. We find that increasing pore fluid pressure gradually decreases sample strength and leads to a transition in the deformation mechanism from frictional sliding on several fault surfaces to distributed extensional and extensional–shear fracturing. Combined with field observations of a shallow mantle-wedge-derived serpentinite shear zone, our experimental results suggest that numerous brittle failures developing simultaneously throughout the shear zone generate bursts of tectonic tremor. Furthermore, the recurrence interval of the tremors is likely controlled by the time required for the fractures to be hydrothermally sealed through serpentine precipitation.

 Close-range remote sensing technologies show great potential to support national forest inventories (NFIs). Mobile laser scanning (MLS) has performed especially well in recent studies, as it is capable of fast data acquisition while still delivering accurate information on NFI-relevant variables (e.g. tree position, diameter at breast height [DBH]). However, the performance of MLS acquisition under challenging conditions (e.g. steep terrain, dense understorey vegetation) has rarely been addressed. Here, on 29 NFI plots distributed over the entire country of Switzerland and representing various terrain and forest conditions, we evaluated the use and performance of handheld MLS acquisition, using a GeoSLAM ZebHorizon laser scanner, to deliver analysis-ready (with minimal occlusion) point clouds and to estimate primary tree variables such as tree position and DBH. Data acquisition was successful for all tested Swiss NFI plots. The average time needed for point cloud acquisition of a 50 × 50 m sample plot was 13.13 min. Over all tested NFI plots, we achieved a tree detection rate of 82.6%, with a relative root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.25%, a mean absolute error of 2.0 cm and a systematic prediction error (SPE) of 1.0 cm for DBH estimation. The terrain gradient had an especially strong influence on the accuracy of DBH estimation. Occlusion, as a metric for point cloud capacity to hold forest structural information for the entire canopy volume, was minimal when the suggested acquisition pattern was followed, at 9% on average for the entire canopy volume. However, the level of occlusion increased in the upper part of the canopy (> 10 m above ground), to 15% on average.Overall, handheld MLS effectively produced analysis-ready point clouds within the 15-minute acquisition time limitation for a 50 x 50 m area, even under challenging conditions, showing promise for future use in the Swiss NFI. However, the current accuracy of MLS-estimated forest variables like DBH and tree detection is insufficient to replace conventional measurements within an established NFI. Despite this, estimating NFI-relevant variables, even with lower accuracy, and expanding the area of measured tree variables could improve information on forest functions and services (e.g., protection and biodiversity), currently not possible to derive from NFI data due to the limited plot size. In the future, MLS-acquired point clouds could (1) shift from expert-assessed to more quantitative and reproducible variable estimation, and (2) enhance NFI with variables difficult to measure conventionally. This could open new pathways for assessing and monitoring forest structural diversity nationally and provide valuable calibration and validation data for large-scale forest assessments from airborne or space-borne acquisitions."

 Terrestrial sediment transport through large rivers exerts a significant impact on coastal morphology, marine ecosystems, and human livelihoods. Accurately measuring these sediment discharges has long been a challenge. Traditional in-situ methods fall short of providing comprehensive and continuous assessments of sediment dynamics due to spatiotemporal and economic constraints. While remote sensing techniques using satellite imagery have offered valuable insights into sediment transportation and deposition, their scope is primarily restricted to observing suspended sediment loads rather than total loads. Sediment accumulation at river margins will cause gravity increases observable by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On (GFO) missions. Previous efforts to observe sediment signals lacked proper corrections for various GRACE/GFO issues, including leakage of signals from surrounding land, variations in nearby ocean mass, and noise levels that typically exceed sediment signal magnitudes. In this study, we develop a new approach to obtain a satellite gravity estimate of sediment accumulation along the Amazon coast where the largest amount of sediment deposition is expected. We address limitations in previous studies using three steps: Forward modeling to suppress leakage of signal from land to oceans; adjusting ocean mass change via the sea level equation; and filtering using empirical orthogonal functions. The estimated accumulation rate of sediment on the Amazon continental shelf is approximately 1301 Mtons per year for the period June 2002 to May 2023.

 Flood disasters are characterized by frequent and sudden occurrences and obvious chain effects, posing a major threat to agricultural production. Government disaster relief and agricultural insurance are increasingly urgent in assessing losses to flood-damaged farmland. There are many challenges in assessing flood-damaged farmland. On the one hand, the historical data needed for the farmland loss assessment model is missing. On the other hand, the farmland loss assessment conducted within the flood inundation area only focuses on the completely submerged farmland, which is not accurate enough. Semi-supervised deep learning can effectively alleviate the above problems. This study specifically designed a fine-grained change detection model for flood-damaged farmland using medium-resolution remote sensing (RS) images to achieve multi-scenario change detection of flood-damaged farmland. In order to assist in the automatic sample generation of large-scale unlabeled sample RS images of flood status, a semi-supervised sample generation framework for flood-damaged farmland using medium-resolution RS images is proposed. Based on this framework, FloodedCropland datasets is created. The experimental results show that the proposed change detection model has an F1-score of 0.9047 on flood-damaged farmland. After the semi-supervised sample generation framework optimized the model, the change detection F1-score was improved to 0.9241. Experiments have verified that the automatic generation of labels for flood-damaged farmland in medium-resolution RS images using a semi-supervised sample generation framework performs better than the scarce manual labeling model and can save a lot of manual labeling time. The consistent performance in different geographic regions and under different RS satellites imaging conditions demonstrate the practical application potential of this method for cross-regional and cross-RS satellites intelligent information extraction in natural disaster scenes with a lack of labeled samples."

 The spatiotemporal characteristics of remote sensing data are often time-varying, leading to significant fluctuation and instability in tree species classification results across different years, especially in regions referred to as high-variance areas. To improve the stability and accuracy of the classification results, this study proposes a lightweight spatiotemporal classification framework, with the core algorithm being the Spatiotemporal Entropy-based Change Resistance Filter (STECR-F) algorithm. The STECR-F algorithm integrates the concept of Spatiotemporal Entropy (STE) and, by applying weighted spatiotemporal neighborhood information, suppresses uncertainty in the classification process. It effectively enhances the spatiotemporal consistency of the classification results, particularly in high-variance regions, and reduces classification instability caused by spatiotemporal fluctuations. This study comprehensively evaluates the performance of STECR-F from three dimensions: STE, transfer change, and classification accuracy, and compares it with other methods. The results show that STECR-F significantly reduces the STE value, with an average decrease of 0.3876, effectively mitigating the fluctuation of the classification results. In high-variance regions, the effect of STECR-F is particularly pronounced, with an average decrease in STE value of up to 0.6847. Moreover, STECR-F significantly suppresses random transitions between classes, reducing category transitions by an average of 22.47%, with the maximum reduction reaching 46%. In terms of classification accuracy, STECR-F achieved an overall accuracy of 91.35%, representing an improvement of 8.02% compared to the results without using STECR-F. Additionally, compared to the DMSPN method using only neighborhood information and pattern filtering, STECR-F’s performance improved by 5.86% and 6.42%, respectively. Overall, the STECR-F algorithm effectively addresses the interannual dynamics and uncertainty in tree species classification results. By integrating weighted spatiotemporal neighborhood information, it significantly enhances classification stability and reduces random variability, making it particularly suitable for areas with high spatiotemporal variability and classification uncertainty."

 Equivalent black carbon mass concentrations were measured using a portable Aethalometer (MicroAeth AE51, eBCAE51) and evaluated against refractory BC measurement obtained from a Single-Particle Soot Photometer (SP2, rBCSP2). Correction methods were proposed to improve AE51 measurements by considering the non-linearity of light attenuation (ATN) due to the accumulation of BC particles (i.e., rBC loading effect) and the interference in ATN measurements caused by non-refractory BC particles (i.e., non-BC loading effect). First, a catalytic stripper was used to heat the sampling line to 350 °C, minimizing the impact of non-BC sampling. This allowed for the correction of the non-linearity of ATN due to the rBC loading effect. After applying the correction formula derived from this process to the measured eBCAE51, further correction was applied to account for the filter loading effect of non-BC, estimated from atmospheric measurements through an unheated sampling line. This study introduces an innovative system for accurately quantifying high-resolution vertical profiles of BC mass concentration. By combining data from the AE51 and a miniaturized optical particle counter, the system applies precise corrections to enhance measurement accuracy at various altitudes. This integrated approach provides a robust framework for reliable atmospheric BC profiling, addressing challenges in pollutant characterization and transport analysis."

 Although air quality has improved in Europe, most of its population is still exposed to levels of pollutants that are harmful to health, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) or sulphur dioxide (SO2). Studying the processes that drive atmospheric chemistry is key to understanding their contribution to air quality. However, since many pollutants are secondary, since meteorology influences the chemical evolution of pollutants, disperses them and transport them and their precursors, among other factors, this task is extremely difficult. This makes thus the use of models essential for the study of air quality. In this work, we present the first long-term validation of air quality simulations in Central Europe for the 2010–2019 decade. The simulations were carried out using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) and the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx). Using the AirBase dataset, stations inside the model domain were classified into three categories according to their pollution burden, and the validation of the models was performed independently in each group. Our research shows that, generally, simulations underestimate pollutant concentrations – except ozone (O3) – most likely because of an incorrect monthly and hourly emissions profile and an overestimation of vertical mixing."

 As important light-absorbing impurities, black carbon (BC) and mineral dust (MD) deposited onto glacier and snow surface can substantially alter the response of cryosphere under climate change. As one of the most important cryosphere in the mid-low latitude regions, the Tibetan Plateau and its surroundings (TP, also known as the Third Pole) is considered to be the Asian Water Tower with widespread distributions of snow and glaciers. Based on recent studies, we reviewed the updated research progress of BC and MD from glaciers on the TP and its surroundings, including their concentrations, spatial distributions and potential sources, especially focusing on impacts of BC and MD on glacier melting. The results indicated that there exist large differences of BC and MD spatial distributions due to their different sources or transport pathways. The estimation indicated that BC and MD can enhance the snow and glacier melt by about 20% during ablation season and cause decreasing snow cover duration by 3–4 days. The melting Asian Water Tower are changing the water storage, further influence the water quality and resources to about one billion people in downstream regions. Additionally, we identified research gaps and suggested future research perspectives of BC and MD in snow and ice over the TP and its surroundings."

This study identifies an interplay between the circadian clock within muscle stem cells (SCs) and their capacity to modulate the immune microenvironment during muscle regeneration. We reveal that the SC clock triggers TOD–dependent inflammatory gene transcription after injury, particularly genes related to neutrophil activity and chemotaxis. These responses are driven by cytosolic regeneration of the signaling metabolite nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form) (NAD+), as enhancing cytosolic NAD+regeneration in SCs is sufficient to induce inflammatory responses that influence muscle regeneration. Mononuclear single-cell sequencing of the regenerating muscle niche further implicates the cytokine CCL2 in mediating SC-neutrophil cross-talk in a TOD-dependent manner. Our findings highlight the intersection between SC metabolic shifts and immune responses within the muscle microenvironment, dictated by circadian rhythms, and underscore the potential for targeting circadian and metabolic pathways to enhance tissue regeneration."

We show that indentation forces above 7 nanonewtons trigger local, repeated and targeted H1-T6SS assemblies within seconds of impact by the AFM tip. Analysis of the corresponding AFM force curves shows that a breach of a single layer of the cell envelope is necessary and sufficient for triggering H1-T6SS assembly. Accordingly, polymyxin B nonapeptide, which damages the outer membrane, also triggers H1-T6SS assembly.

The E140R mutation in the S2 segment prevents activated voltage sensor conformations, but concatemeric constructs containing up to three E140R subunits retain KCNQ2-like currents. The underlying single-channel currents show subconductance levels resulting from limitations in inner gate dimensions, determined by the number of activated subunits and their spatial arrangement.

We identified a small molecule (WEHI-3773) that inhibits interaction between VDAC2 and BAK or BAX revealing contrasting effects on their apoptotic activity. WEHI-3773 inhibits apoptosis mediated by BAX by blocking VDAC2-mediated BAX recruitment to mitochondria. Conversely, WEHI-3773 promotes BAK-mediated apoptosis by limiting inhibitory sequestration by VDAC2. In cells expressing both pro-apoptotic proteins, apoptosis promotion by WEHI-3773 dominates, because activated BAK activates BAX through a feed-forward mechanism. Loss of BAX drives resistance to the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax in some leukemias. WEHI-3773 overcomes this resistance by promoting BAK-mediated killing.

Second, skills decline at older ages only for those with below-average skill usage. White-collar and higher-educated workers with above-average usage show increasing skills even beyond their forties. Women have larger skill losses at older age, particularly in numeracy."

We introduce AMP-Designer, an LLM-based approach, for swiftly designing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with desired properties. Within 11 days, AMP-Designer achieved the de novo design of 18 AMPs with broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative bacteria. In vitro validation revealed a 94.4% success rate, with two candidates demonstrating exceptional antibacterial efficacy, minimal hemotoxicity, stability in human plasma, and low potential to induce resistance, as evidenced by significant bacterial load reduction in murine lung infection experiments. The entire process, from design to validation, concluded in 48 days. AMP-Designer excels in creating AMPs targeting specific strains despite limited data availability, with a top candidate displaying a minimum inhibitory concentration of 2.0 micrograms per milliliter againstPropionibacterium acnes. Integrating advanced machine learning techniques, AMP-Designer demonstrates remarkable efficiency, paving the way for innovative solutions to antibiotic resistance."

Earlier estrogen depletion—via earlier menopause—has been associated with increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Synaptic dysfunction also incites and exacerbates AD progression. We investigated whether age at menopause and synaptic health together influence AD neuropathology and cognitive trajectories using clinical and autopsy data from 268 female decedents in the Rush Memory and Aging Project. We observed significant interactions between age at menopause and synaptic integrity on cognitive decline and tau tangles, such that earlier menopause strengthened the associations of reduced synaptic integrity with faster cognitive decline and elevated tau. Exploratory analyses showed that these relationships were attenuated in women who took menopausal hormone therapy. These findings suggest that midlife endocrine processes or their sequalae may influence synaptic vulnerability to AD. Interventions addressing both hormonal factors and synaptic health could enhance resilience to dementia in women."

However, the controlled synthesis of 2D OLHs with in-plane tunable emission remains a great challenge owing to the difficulty in the sequential integration of multiple components. Here, a cascaded strategy is demonstrated for the hierarchical assembly of OLHs with in-plane multicolor emission, from red-blue and red-green to lateral red-green-blue (RGB), with a lateral size of ~15 micrometers. The tunable regions of 2D OLHs are realized by synergistic effects of the molecular doping method and the photo-induced oxidation route during the epitaxial growth process. The obtained OLHs can actively achieve full-spectrum light transport from 420 to 720 nanometers depending on different excitation positions and thus function as multimode RGB signal converters. These findings provide insights into the epitaxial growth of OLHs for the development of next-generation organic optoelectronics."

Facultative diapause occurs under conditions of maternal metabolic stress such as nursing. While molecular mechanisms of diapause have been studied, a natural inducing factor has yet to be identified. Here, we show that oxytocin induces embryonic diapause in mice. We show that gestational delays were triggered during nursing or optogenetic stimulation of oxytocin neurons simulating nursing patterns. Mouse blastocysts express oxytocin receptors, and oxytocin induced delayed implantation-like dispersion in cultured embryos. Last, oxytocin receptor–knockout embryos transferred into wild-type surrogates had low survival rates during diapause. Our results indicate that oxytocin coordinates timing of embryonic development with uterine progression through pregnancy, providing an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for ensuring successful reproduction."

Currently, the macrolide azithromycin (AZM) is the standard first-line antibiotic for treatment of the disease. However, the rise of drug-resistant MAC necessitates the development of alternative therapeutics. Here, we present a late-stage boron-mediated aglycon delivery strategy for selective modification of AZM, generating a library of potential anti-MAC drugs designatedKU01toKU13. Screening ofKU01toKU13revealed thatKU13exhibited enhanced antimicrobial activity against wild-type and macrolide-resistant MAC compared to AZM. Cryo–electron microscopy analysis indicated that the inserted tercyclic moiety ofKU13formed a robust anchor on the bacterial ribosome, creating a binding pocket with base flipping of U2847, potentially bypassing the standard mechanism of macrolide resistance.

Here, we investigated the impact of HLA diversity on the control of posttransplant BKPyV replication. High HLA evolutionary divergence (HED) at the DQ locus in the donor was an independent predictor of BKPyV-free outcome. More generally, we highlighted the protective effect of highly divergent pairs of HLA-DQ heterodimers corresponding to heterozygous HLA-DQα01/non-DQα01 combinations. We then defined a functional divergence metrics assessed by the similarity of peptide-binding motifs between pairs of HLA-DQ molecules. Greater functional divergence correlated with the size of the BKPyV-derived DQ-bound immunopeptidome and a lower risk of BKPyV reactivation, thus providing a molecular basis for the observed genetic differences. Together, these data provide evidence for a direct link between donor HLA-DQ genetic and functional divergence, diversity of the DQ-bound immunopeptidome, and control of viral infection, likely reflecting stronger antiviral T cell responses."

This promoter-proximal pausing involves negative elongation factor (NELF), 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribobenzimidazole sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF), and transcription elongation factor IIS (TFIIS) and is critical for subsequent productive transcription elongation. However, the detailed pausing mechanism and the involvement of the +1 nucleosome remain enigmatic. Here, we report cryo–electron microscopy structures of ECs stalled on nucleosomal DNA. In the absence of TFIIS, the EC is backtracked/arrested due to conflicts between NELF and the nucleosome. We identified two alternative binding modes of NELF, one of which reveals a critical contact with the downstream DNA through the conserved NELF-E basic helix. Upon binding with TFIIS, the EC progressed to the nucleosome to establish a paused EC with a partially unwrapped nucleosome. This paused EC strongly restricts EC progression further downstream.

HuPBMC EAE mice generated from EBV-seronegative healthy donors were less susceptible to developing severe neurological symptoms than healthy EBV-seropositive and RRMS donor groups. Donor EBV seropositivity and RRMS diagnosis were associated with a significant increase in the number of central nervous system (CNS) infiltrating effector T cells due to enhanced proliferation of proinflammatory T cells and limited expansion of regulatory T cells.

The X chromosome contributes to sex differences, as females harbor an inactive X (Xi) and active X (Xa), in contrast to males with only an Xa. Thus, reactivation of silent Xi genes may contribute to sex differences. We use allele-specific, single-nucleus RNA sequencing to show that aging remodels transcription of the Xi and Xa across hippocampal cell types. Aging preferentially changed gene expression on the X’s relative to autosomes. Select genes on the Xi underwent activation, with new escape across cells including in the dentate gyrus, critical to learning and memory. Expression of the Xi escapeePlp1, a myelin component, was increased in the aging hippocampus of female mice and parahippocampus of women. AAV-mediatedPlp1elevation in the dentate gyrus of aging male and female mice improved cognition. Understanding how the Xi may confer female advantage could lead to novel targets that counter brain aging and disease in both sexes."

While the transition to motherhood has recently been recognized as one of the most neuroplastic periods in adulthood, no study has yet explored whether the hippocampus and amygdala change during the peripartum in relation to childbirth experience and perinatal depression symptoms. In this longitudinal neuroimaging study, we assessed 88 first-time gestational mothers in late pregnancy and early postpartum and 30 nulliparous control women. We used optimized high-resolution MRI scans to quantify volumetric changes in the hippocampus and amygdala, along with their substructures. We found that increases in depression symptoms during the peripartum were positively correlated with changes in the right amygdala. A more challenging birth experience was associated with bilateral increases in hippocampal volume. These findings show that studying the neuroanatomical changes during the transition to motherhood can inform not only about adaptive processes but also about potential vulnerabilities, highlighting the importance of tracking perinatal experiences to enhance women’s health."

In older women (aged >70 years), HT users exhibited faster regional tau accumulation relative to non-users, localized to the entorhinal cortex and the inferior temporal and fusiform gyri, with an indirect effect of HT on cognitive decline through regional tau accumulation. In younger women (aged <70 years), HT associations with tau accumulation were negligible. Findings are relevant for optimizing menopausal treatment guidelines."

Second, despite substantial advances in women’s social and economic status over the past 50 years, their well-being relative to men has declined.

Using global data from 2006 to 2023 and long-term data from Europe and the US since the 1970s, we provide empirical illustrations. These findings reveal a diverse and seemingly inconsistent pattern of gender well-being gaps between countries, suggesting that the first paradox is not universally applicable.
