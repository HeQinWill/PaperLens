We developed a new computer model showing how plane structures create air swirls that make contrails wider and denser than thought. These thicker contrails likely trap more heat. Our findings help improve climate predictions and guide aircraft designs to reduce aviation's warming effects. 
 Contrails – ice clouds forming in aircraft wakes – may have a radiative impact up to twice that of CO2 emissions from aviation, though significant uncertainties remain. Understanding the entire contrail life cycle, from initial ice crystal formation to potential evolution into persistent cirrus clouds, requires addressing the wide range of spatial and temporal scales involved.This work presents a novel numerical methodology for simulating contrails from ice crystal formation onset to wingtip vortex dissipation. Unlike conventional methods relying on analytical initialization using Lamb-Oseen vortex pairs, our approach couples Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) with Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and synthetic turbulence techniques. This enables more accurate capture of near-field effects and detailed consideration of how aircraft geometry influences aerodynamic wake and contrail evolution.Applied to realistic aircraft geometry under standard atmospheric conditions, our methodology revealed that horizontal tailplane vortices trigger short-wavelength instabilities in the main wingtip vortices, significantly modifying secondary wake structure. Compared to conventional methods, contrails generated through our methodology are wider with larger cross-sectional areas in the first few minutes following ice crystals formation. Previous studies showed contrail spatial dimensions significantly affect contrail-cirrus properties; for instance, under identical initial ice crystal number and mass, an A380 contrail-cirrus exhibits 20 % greater total extinction than a CRJ200 due to different contrail sizes.We propose a modified conventional method incorporating a quadripolar wake – two main wingtip vortices plus two secondary horizontal tailplane vortices – that more closely matches our methodology's simulations, which more precisely account for near-field aerodynamic effects."

 The global reduction in shipping fuel sulphur that culminated in 2020 with an ∼ 80 % reduction has created a large-scale natural experiment on the role of aerosol-cloud interaction (ACI) in the climate system. We compare observations from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program's Eastern North Atlantic site (ARM-ENA; 39.1° N, 28.0° W) during two June to September periods: 2016–2018 (pre-2020) and 2021–2023 (post-2020). We find a significant (∼ 15 %) decrease in cloud condensation nuclei concentrations post-2020, which resulted in a decrease in cloud droplet number (Nd) and an increase in effective radius (re) of marine boundary layer clouds. However, cloud liquid water path (LWP) increased post-2020. The increase in LWP offset the increase in re, resulting in insignificant changes to optical depth. MODIS and CERES data in the vicinity of ENA during these periods produce similar results also with negligible change in albedo and optical depth. Regional cloud occurrence declined in line with changes in the large-scale meteorology. Our results highlight the complex interplay of factors that modulate cloud feedbacks in the Eastern North Atlantic."

Absorption signatures differ between Icelandic and low/mid-latitude dust due to differences in mineralogical composition. Spectral differences could be used to characterise the mineralogy and trace the origin of airborne dust based on infrared remote sensing observations. 
 Mineral dust absorbs and scatters solar and infrared radiation, thereby affecting the radiance spectrum at the surface and top-of-atmosphere and the atmospheric heating rate. While half of the outgoing thermal radiation is emitted in the far infrared (FIR, 15–100 µm), knowledge of the optical properties and thermal radiative effects of dust is currently limited to the mid-infrared region (MIR, 3–15 µm). In this study we performed pellet spectroscopy measurements to evaluate the MIR and FIR contribution to dust absorbance and explore the variability and spectral diversity of the dust signature within the 2.5–25 µm range. Thirteen dust samples re-suspended from parent soils with contrasting mineralogy were investigated, including low and mid latitude dust (LMLD) sources in Africa, America, Asia, and Middle East, and high latitude dust (HLD) from Iceland. Results show that the absorbance of dust in the FIR up to 25 µm is comparable in intensity to that in the MIR. Also, spectrally different absorption (position and shape of the peaks) is observed for Icelandic dust compared to LMLD, due to differences in mineralogical composition. Corroborated with the few available literature data on absorption properties of natural dust and single minerals up to 100 µm wavelength, these data suggest the relevance of MIR and FIR interactions to the dust radiative effect for low to high latitude sources. Furthermore, the dust spectral signatures in the MIR and FIR could potentially be used to characterise the mineralogy and differentiate the origin of airborne particles based on infrared remote sensing observations."

We found that the reductions in anthropogenic precursors had limited impacts on SOA formation. The results highlight the increasing role of gas-phase oxidation under low-pollution conditions, emphasizing the need for effective ozone control strategies to mitigate SOA formation. 
 Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is a dominant constituent of fine particulate matter, exerting significant impacts on both climate and human health. Oxalic acid (C2), a key end-product formed from the oxidation of volatile organic compounds, can provide insights into the formation mechanism of SOA. Thus, long-term measurements of C2 and related compounds help understand the changes in SOA formation with decreasing pollutant levels. In this study, C2 and its homologs, along with five primary anthropogenic source markers and three SOA markers, were measured in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) during 2007–2018. The concentrations of C2 did not exhibit significant downward trends, despite substantial reductions in anthropogenic emissions, such as biomass burning (−11 % yr−1), vehicle emissions (−17 % yr−1), and cooking emissions (−7 % yr−1). Correlation analysis revealed that aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) and Ox (O3 + NO2) were the main drivers of C2 variations. Moreover, the relative contribution of biogenic SOA increased under cleaner conditions. A machine learning model was applied to quantify the impacts of changes in anthropogenic precursor emissions, biogenic precursor emissions, aqueous-phase oxidation processes, and gas-phase oxidation processes on C2 variability. As pollution levels declined, the impacts of gas-phase oxidation increased from 37 % to 55 %, whereas that of aqueous-phase oxidation declined from 42 % to 30 %. This shift indicated a transition from aqueous-phase to gas-phase pathways in C2 and SOA formation. Our findings highlight the increasing importance of gas-phase oxidation under low-pollution conditions and underscore the need for effective ozone control strategies to further reduce SOA in the future."

Our study introduces the first Total Carbon Column Observing Network site in this region, in Cyprus, providing high-precision columnar measurement of key greenhouse gases. This new dataset enhances global climate monitoring efforts, supports the validation of satellites, will help assess regional emission trends, filling a critical observational gap in this climate-sensitive region. 
 Long-term greenhouse gas (GHG) measurements are essential for understanding the carbon cycle, detecting trends in atmospheric composition, and assessing the efficiency of climate change mitigation strategies. However, observational gaps over large geographic areas such as the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East (EMME), a well-known regional GHG hotspot, are likely to increase uncertainties in estimations of their sources and sinks. Here, we describe a new Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) observatory for solar absorption spectroscopy measurements that has been operating in Nicosia, Cyprus, since September 2019. The site helps bridge a regional observational gap in the EMME, a strategic location at the crossroads of air masses from Europe, Asia, and Africa. Using near-infrared (NIR, InGaAs detector) solar absorption spectra, TCCON-Nicosia measures total column average dry-air mole fractions (Xgas) of key trace gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen fluoride (HF), water vapor (H2O), and semi-heavy water (HDO). These continuous observations, spanning more than 4 years, are presented along with a description of the quality control procedures, compliant with the TCCON standards, to ensure total column atmospheric data with minimal errors.In 2023, observations were extended into the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral region with the addition of a liquid-nitrogen-cooled InSb (LN2-InSb) detector enabling the retrieval of additional trace gases such as formaldehyde (HCHO), carbonyl sulfide (OCS), nitrogen monoxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ethane (C2H6), herewith further contributing to the global Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC).To tie the TCCON Nicosia with the WMO reference scale, an AirCore (AC) campaign conducted in June 2020 over Cyprus provided vertical in situ profiles, which were converted into total column quantities (AC.Xgas) and compared to TCCON observations (Xgas). The TCCON/in situ comparison showed agreement well within their respective uncertainty budget."

Simulated reflectivities show strong sensitivity to particle size distributions and frozen hydrometeor habits. Results highlight the role of microphysical assumptions in radar forward modeling and their importance for assimilating spaceborne radar data in weather prediction models. 
 Accurate forward models, particularly radiative transfer models, are essential for the assimilation of both passive and active satellite  observations in modern data assimilation frameworks. The Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM), widely used in the assimilation of satellite observations within numerical weather prediction systems, especially in the United States, has recently been expanded to include a radar module. This study assesses the new module across multiple radar frequencies using observations from the Earth Clouds, Aerosols and Radiation Explorer Cloud Profiling Radar (EarthCARE CPR), the CloudSat CPR, and the Global Precipitation Measurement Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar (GPM DPR). Simulated radar reflectivities were compared with the spaceborne measurements to evaluate the impacts of hydrometeor profiles, particle size  distributions (PSDs), and frozen hydrometeor habits. The results indicate that both PSD selection and particle shape largely influence the simulated  reflectivities, with snow particle habits introducing differences of up to 4 dBZ in W-band comparisons. For the GPM DPR, reflectivities simulated using the Thompson PSD showed closer agreement with the observations than those using the Abel PSD; this agreement should be interpreted in the context of the limited independence between the observations and the retrievals used as input to the CRTM, which themselves rely on PSD-related assumptions. The sensitivity of forward radar simulations to microphysical assumptions, underscores their importance in the assimilation of radar observations in numerical weather forecast models."

The model contains 146 units and is provided as a point dataset with a resolution of 1x1 km².  This enables the creation of, e.g.,  3D finite element models in a very short amount of time. A comprehensive supplement and 157 figures documents the results and assumptions. 
 3D geological models are an essential source of information for research as well as for the safe and efficient use of the underground. They provide not only a visualization of the subsurface structures but also serve as geometry input for geophysical and numerical models, e.g., gravimetric, mechanical or thermal models. The set-up of a geological model for a numerical simulation is often a time-consuming task. During the last two decades, several 3D geological models have been created for specific regions in Germany. Up to now only one attempt has been made to combine several of them to a Germany-wide model. However, there are many new models that have not been integrated into this model. Therefore, we present a new Germany-wide 3D geological model combining information of 27 individual models. The model has a resolution of 1×1 km2 and is vertically and horizontally subdivided into 146 units. Where possible, the model is extended to neighboring countries, e.g., the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Switzerland and Austria. In order to combine all models with their different sizes, resolutions and stratigraphic subdivisions, we used a point set approach, which has a number of advantages with regards to its flexibility and usability. To demonstrate the usability, the set-up of a finite-element model is shown as a possible application. The model is published as Ahlers (2026) and is available under https://doi.org/10.48328/tudatalib-1791."

Kimball;Xiao Cheng;J. Patrick Donnelly;Jennifer D. Watts;Annett Bartsch,A satellite-based ice fraction record for small water bodies of the Arctic Coastal Plain (2017 to 2023),"Ice cover on small water bodies is highly sensitive to climate change and influences ecosystems, water, and the carbon cycle. We produced a satellite-based ice fraction dataset for small water bodies on the Arctic Coastal Plain from 2017 to 2023. The dataset captures freeze-up and break-up timing and reveals spatial variability. It will support studies of climate–ice interactions and improve models of water and carbon processes. 
 Ice cover of water bodies in the northern high latitudes (NHL) is highly sensitive to the changing climate, and its dynamics exert substantial impacts on the NHL ecosystems, hydrological processes, and the carbon cycle. Yet, operational quantification of ice cover dynamics for smaller water bodies (e.g., ≤25 km2) over vast, remote NHL regions remains limited. Here, we developed an ice fraction dataset for small water bodies (ponds, lakes, and rivers; 900 m2 to 25 km2) across the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska (ACP) from 2017 through 2023, using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, texture features, and Daymet air temperature data. The dataset has a spatial resolution of 1 km and a temporal resolution of approximately 6 d. Compared with the Google Dynamic World (DW) product derived from Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing, our dataset shows high consistency with DW (R=0.91, RMSE=0.19) while having enhanced temporal coverage due to less SAR constraints from solar illumination, cloud cover, and atmospheric conditions. Validation against in-situ observations suggests that our dataset is more capable of capturing small water body ice phenology (e.g., freeze-up and break-up dates) relative to DW, with an 11 d reduction in mean absolute error. Our ice fraction dataset reveals high spatial heterogeneity in ice conditions mainly occurring in June for small water bodies across the ACP. The ice phenology analysis over three selected subregions further shows that a warmer transition period generally leads to earlier ice break-up and later freeze-up, while the responses of ice fraction to warming climate vary among and within individual water bodies. The resulting dataset is anticipated to fill a gap in ice phenology studies for small water bodies, improve our understanding on the interactions between ice dynamics and climate change, and enhance the coupled modelling of ice and carbon processes. The S1 ice fraction dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17033546 (Lin et al., 2025)."

The system is user-interactive in real time. It has been implemented for South Romania and is applicable and extendable for Europe. 
 Climate change significantly threatens crop yields levels and stability. The complex interplay of factors at the local scale makes assessing these impacts difficult, requiring coupled climate-phenology models, which integrate climate data and crop information. Identifying suitable local management practices and crop varieties under future conditions becomes essential for developing effective adaptation strategies.This study presents the implementation and application of an integrated climate-phenology adaptation support modelling system. This is based on regional CORDEX climate models and the CERES Maize model from the DSSAT platform. Novel modules for optimal management and genotype identification under climate change have been developed in the system, employing a hybrid approach that combines deterministic modelling with machine learning (ML) techniques and genetic algorithms. This system was run as a regional pilot over Southern Romania, operating in real-time in interaction with users, performing agro-climate projections (combination of fertilization, sowing date, genotype) and providing best crop management simulated under climate change projections. Multi-model ensemble simulations were conducted for two radiative forcing scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 and twelve management scenarios, yielding novel results for the region. Results indicate a projected decrease in maize yields for the current genotype across all tested scenarios, primarily attributed to a shortened grain-filling period and reduced fertilization efficiency under warmer conditions. The analysis warns about a projected narrowing of the agro-management options for maintaining a high yield level. However, we find an added value from the impact of genotype selection in mitigating climate change impacts, even in extreme years. Genotype optimisation across six crossed cultivar dependent parameters revealed that while maximum yields decline, specific genotype windows exhibit increased intermediate yields under future climates compared to current conditions. Sensitivity analysis identified the thermal time requirements during juvenile and maturity stages as the most critical factors influencing genotype performance under warmer climates.This research demonstrates the added value of combining deterministic and data-driven modelling approaches within a coupled climate-crop system for developing effective adaptation strategies, including optimised fertilization pathways that contribute to climate change mitigation."

 A major shift in Arctic sea ice occurred in 2007, transitioning from thicker, deformed ice to thinner, more uniform ice with reduced surface roughness. This abrupt change likely altered the dynamic and thermodynamic interactions between sea ice and ocean, with potential implications for nutrient and biogeochemical cycles in both sea ice and the upper ocean. In this study, we present a suite of regional coupled ocean-sea ice simulations designed to assess the potential impact of the regime shift on sea ice–ocean interactions, with a regional focus on the Atlantic sector of the Arctic Ocean. The different sea ice regimes are represented by changes in ice thickness distribution described by ice thickness classes in the sea ice model, and the effects of the different regimes are simulated through variations in the drag coefficient diagnosed from the ice thickness distribution. We emulate the two sea ice regimes by prescribing sea ice properties at the model's lateral boundaries. The results suggest a weaker dynamical coupling between sea ice and ocean in the new sea-ice regimes, leading to enhanced surface stratification, suppression of vertical mixing and momentum transfer to deeper layers. The simulation framework and the physical analyses presented here serve as a basis for ocean biogeochemical modelling studies that aim at understanding ocean ecosystem responses to changing Arctic sea ice."

However, this feedback is highly uncertain because most Earth system models (ESM) do not represent permafrost carbon. We have improved the Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace ESM by including permafrost physical, carbon and nitrogen processes to better represent Arctic ecosystems. The model more accurately represents past and present permafrost physics and biogeochemistry, paving the way for future projections. 
 Permafrost soils have the potential to release large amounts of soil carbon to the atmosphere under climate change. However, in the Sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), only two Earth System Models (ESM) represented permafrost carbon, both sharing the same land surface model. This makes future permafrost carbon dynamics  highly uncertain and underscores the urgent need to include permafrost carbon in ESMs to enable more reliable future projections of climate change and remaining carbon budget estimates. Here, we present IPSL-Perm-LandN, an improved version of the Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL) ESM (used for CMIP6) aiming at better representing high-latitude land ecosystems. The main developments are the inclusion of an explicit nitrogen cycle and of key permafrost physical and biogeochemical processes. The latent heat associated with soil water freeze/thaw is taken into account in the energy budget, as well as soil thermal insulation by soil organic matter and a surface organic layer (e.g. litter or moss). Soil organic carbon and nitrogen are vertically resolved with depth-dependent decomposition dynamics, a key feature for representing the effect of gradual permafrost thaw on soil biogeochemistry. Cryoturbation is represented as a diffusion process that buries organic matter in the deeper soil layers. Compared to the previous version of the model used for CMIP6, we show that the extent of the permafrost region has improved significantly and that the simulated active layer thickness in the Arctic is in better agreement with observations. Permafrost soil carbon stocks have increased 20-fold to reach 1006 PgC in the top 3 m of soil, which is consistent with observation-based estimates. We simulate that the permafrost region has been a net carbon sink over the past 150 years (+0.32 ± 0.04 PgC yr−1 on average between 2005 and 2014), primarily due to carbon uptake from boreal forests. This is comparable with recent pan-Arctic carbon balance estimates, when accounting for unrepresented processes in our model (fire and riverine carbon losses). Overall, the inclusion of permafrost processes has improved the response of the model to anthropogenic perturbations in high latitudes over the past century, marking a step forward in the representation of Arctic ecosystems."

In urban areas, participants with lower educational attainment, lower household income, or those who were unemployed exhibit a higher exposure to airborne pollutants. Household income also influences the vicinity to green spaces and natural environments, with lower incomes experiencing less green and natural environments in both the rural and urban contexts. Retired individuals experienced lower exposure to airborne pollutants and lived in areas with more green spaces or natural environments compared with employed individuals. These patterns were consistent across England, Scotland, and Wales, although some geographical and national differences were observed.

In this study, a label-free chemical analytical method for rapid visualization of microplastics incorporated in coral tissue and skeletons is proposed by using a coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscope combined with two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) detection. Acropora polystoma was maintained in an environment with a high concentration of polyethylene (PE) beads ranging from 0.7 to 5 μm in size. PE beads were successfully visualized, and the number of incorporated beads per skeleton area was quantitatively analyzed using the proposed technique. Notably, plastic beads were only found in the skeleton of coral colonies showing signs of localized tissue loss. Further CARS analysis of tissue found that a number of microplastics were trapped in the areas where tissue loss was observed due to bleaching or physical tissue removal, whereas minimal amounts were observed within healthy tissue. These results suggest that unhealthy conditions which lead to tissue loss and bleaching may accelerate microplastic incorporation into coral tissue and further into skeletons. Our study shows the ability of our CARS-based method to help understand how microplastics are incorporated into corals and will lead to improved tracking of their accumulation in coral reefs."

The mechanisms supporting long-term functional stability remain unclear. As a key OHRB, Dehalococcoides faces similar constraints, including declining abundance and loss or divergence of functional genes in bioaugmentation. Here we demonstrate that strain-level microdiversity within Dehalococcoides supports the resilience of community-scale dehalogenation. In AEDhc, a reconstructed consortium derived from eight Dehalococcoides-containing enrichment cultures, sequencing of a Dehalococcoides-specific marker gene revealed 30 distinct Dehalococcoides phylotypes coexisting within the community. Despite fluctuations in phylotype abundance over successive transfers, AEDhc consistently debrominated tetra- and pentabrominated diphenyl ethers (0.39 ± 0.06 - 0.45 ± 0.05 μM Br–/d), producing no detectable accumulation of intermediates. Proteomics analyses revealed that among 71 putative reductive dehalogenase (RDase) genes identified in metagenomic analysis, expression was consistently dominated by PcbA1-like and TceA-like RDases across transfers. These findings demonstrated that Dehalococcoides phylotypes can coexist and fluctuate dynamically even under constant cultivation conditions, with genetic variation serving as a reservoir of metabolic potential. Such microdiversity enhances functional stability and ecological resilience, highlighting the need to consider strain-level heterogeneity in bioremediation strategies."

Early generation gas-phase products of isoprene oxidation remain to be fully characterized. •OH addition at terminal C1/C4 followed by the addition of O2, yields β- and δ-peroxy (ISOPO2•) isomers. Under low-nitric oxide conditions, δ-ISOPO2• isomers branch between bimolecular reaction with HO2• and intramolecular H-shifts. Initial C5H8O3 products of H-shifts reported in chamber experiments were assigned δ-hydroperoxyalkenal (HPALD) structures and predicted to photolyze rapidly. We observe by ion mobility spectrometry that a putative δ-HPALD isomer from •OH addition at C4 is the cyclic peroxyhemiacetal, 5-methyl dioxinol, and may be the relevant product in atmospheric chemistry. 5-Methyl dioxinol is robust to photolysis at tropospheric UV–vis wavelengths and is thus potentially a significant previously unrecognized source of SOA. In chamber experiments, we found that 5-methyl dioxinol forms SOA and determined that the steady-state ratio of the proximal major unimolecular/bimolecular products downstream of ISOPO2• is ∼0.26. Using the total steady-state dioxinol level formed in the isoprene oxidation experiment, dioxinols may contribute ∼3.2 × 109 g yr–1, or 4% to isoprene-derived atmospheric carbon."

The aquaculture industry uses medicinal (e.g., emamectin benzoate (EMB)) and non-medicinal (e.g., thermolicers) methods to control sea lice. Non-medicinal methods can harm fish, while medicinal treatments can accumulate on the seafloor and impact the environment. Nevertheless, research on EMB’s effects on non-target fauna in Norway remains limited. This study is the first to integrate field and modeling analysis of EMB and benthic ecology in Norway, aiming to (i) map EMB distribution around farms, (ii) assess impacts on benthic communities, and (iii) compare EMB’s effects on crustaceans to other stressors. Results show EMB had the strongest effect on benthic abundance and species richness, compared to other stressors (e.g., organic matter). EMB concentrations at 0.2 ng/g, near the SEPA EQS of 0.272 ng/g, reduced species diversity and disrupted community structure, with crustaceans being most sensitive. EMB was found to be widespread, persistent, and to accumulate in sediments long after use. Dispersion modeling suggest harmful concentrations could extend 1 km from farms. These findings highlight the need for improved monitoring, regulation, and sustainable lice management to protect biodiversity in aquaculture intensive areas."

However, its accuracy has hardly been studied. To assess effectiveness of PUF–PAS for measuring CUPs, 18 PUF–PAS devices were deployed for 1–6 weeks at a school near banana plantations in Costa Rica. Simultaneously, every week air was sampled with high and low volume active air samplers (AAS) for 24 h and 7 days, respectively. Extracts were analyzed using microwave-assisted extraction and LC-MS/MS. Nine CUPs (ethoprophos, difenoconazole, cadusafos, chlorpyrifos, fenpropidin, fenpropimorph, pyrimethanil, spiroxamine, and terbufos) were detected by both PAS and AAS. Concentrations were highest for pyrimethanil (34.3 ng/m3) followed by fenpropidin (9.0 ng/m3) and terbufos (8.4 ng/m3). An average sampling rate of 3.4 m3/day was estimated for PUF–PAS using Lo-AAS data, like previously reported in literature. After 3 weeks of deployment, PUF–PAS detected eight out of nine pesticides, similar to the AAS methods. However, after 4 weeks of deployment, substantial losses (≥50%) were observed for all CUPs except pyrimethanil, likely due to oxidative degradation. We therefore recommend a maximum deployment time of 3 weeks under tropical conditions. These findings support PUF–PAS as a cost-effective alternative for AAS in tropical regions."

While nutrient enrichment generally is a primary driver, insufficient insight into biotic-hydrological stressor interactions may result in an overreliance on nutrient reduction as the sole intervention. Focusing on China’s subtropical eutrophic Lake Dianchi, we applied an innovative coupled hydrodynamic-ecological model to identify key drivers of ecosystem degradation. This approach uniquely involved simulating multiple restoration strategies across eight degradation scenarios, 28 climate change scenarios, and over 100 regulatory scenarios, offering a comprehensive analysis of potential solutions. Our results identify the synergistic effects of grass carp introduction and elevated water levels as key drivers of the observed clear-to-turbid regime shift in the 1970s. Subsequently, fluctuations in nutrient loading became dominant drivers of eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms. We further show that restoring a clear-water state with submerged macrophytes would optimally require a multidimensional strategy: 63% nutrient loading reduction (76% under simulated climate change conditions), 1.5 m water level lowering, and ∼80% benthivorous fish removal over three consecutive summers. Our study demonstrates that combining biotic, hydrological, and nutrient management outperforms single-factor manipulations, underscoring the importance of resilience-building through integrated, multidimensional interventions."

In this study, we evaluated the influence of inactive chemicals on mixture modeling outcomes and explored strategies for predicting the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-mediated toxicity of PAC mixtures. Using an in vitro AhR reporter gene assay, we tested seven defined mixtures composed of six active and seven inactive PACs. Observed concentration–response curves were compared to predictions from three established mixture models, concentration addition (CA), independent action (IA), and generalized concentration addition (GCA), using both effective concentration eliciting 10% response (EC10) and benchmark concentration (BMC10) approaches. Including inactive chemicals without scaling led to consistent overestimation of potency, especially in models assuming equal efficacy. Predictive accuracy improved across all models when mixtures were limited to active chemicals and contributions were scaled to 100%, excluding inactives. Among approaches, GCA consistently produced the best agreement with measured responses, particularly when paired with BMC modeling. BMC10 values better accommodate partial agonists. Our findings support a pragmatic, mechanism-based framework for modeling environmental mixtures, one that prioritizes active components, scales their contributions, and adopts BMC-based methods to estimate potency."

However, pLCA lacks consistent prospective characterization factors (pCFs) to assess the climate impacts of future emissions and align the inventory and impact assessment phases. This work produces pCFs by integrating gas-specific climate parameters with future emission scenarios from the Integrated Assessment Models (IAM). Prospective Global Warming Potential (pGWP20, pGWP100) and Global Temperature change Potential (pGTP50, pGTP100) are computed for emission years until 2050. Relative to present-day CFs, methane pGWP100 varies from −8% to +23%, and nitrous oxide varies from −17% to +7%. CH4 pGTP100 shifts from −24% to +22%, while N2O pGTP100 shifts from −27% to +8%. For non-CO2-dominated activities such as rice production, climate impacts increase by 8% in terms of pGWP100. With pGTP100, impacts of ammonium nitrate decrease by 9%. When pCFs are combined with prospective background inventories, impacts are substantially lower in sectors such as steel (−44%), road transport (−58%), and cement (−31%) under pGTP100. Overall, the availability of pCFs for multiple climate metrics and IAM scenarios enables a consistent coupling of impact assessment with future-oriented inventory data, improving the robustness and coherence of pLCA."

Wilson,Dramatic Slowdown of Bimolecular Reactions of Criegee Intermediates in Organic Aerosols,"Although Criegee intermediates (CIs) play a central role in driving the transformation of organic molecules, their condensed-phase reaction kinetics remains poorly understood. While CIs undergo unimolecular decomposition to produce OH radicals, stabilized CIs participate in a host of other bimolecular reactions forming larger molecular weight products, including secondary ozonides (kSOZ), alkoxyalkyl hydroperoxides (kAlAHP), and acyloxyalkyl hydroperoxides (kAcAHP). Here, we demonstrate, using prior literature and new measurements of heterogeneous organic aerosol reactions using O3 or OH radicals, that these condensed-phase bimolecular reaction rate coefficients kSOZ (10–20 cm3·molecule–1·s–1), kAlAHP, and kAcAHP (10–19 cm3·molecule–1·s–1) are 7–10 orders of magnitude slower than analogous gas-phase reactions (∼ 10–10–10–13 cm3·molecule–1·s–1). This contrasts with current evidence that the rate coefficients for unimolecular steps in the condensed phase are similar in magnitude to those in the gas phase. Kinetic models using gas-phase-like bimolecular coefficients consistently overestimate the importance of bimolecular relative to unimolecular pathways while underpredicting the aerosol reactivity by up to 30-fold. The slowing of bimolecular reactivity in aerosols is likely due to solvation effects and the increased steric hindrance of larger molecular weight CIs and their scavengers in the condensed phase. These results challenge the conventional view that the high reactant density of an organic aerosol should favor bimolecular over unimolecular reactions, underscoring the need for more accurate CI condensed-phase rate constants for reliable modeling of oxidative processes across a diverse set of atmospheric and environmental systems."

Mezyk,Going out with a Bang: Absolute Kinetics of Removing Organic Energetic Compounds from Waters Using Hydroxyl Radicals,"Organic energetic compounds (OECs) such as nitroaromatics, nitrate esters, and nitramines are widely used explosives that persist as toxic contaminants in water systems. Among them, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) is of particular concern due to its carcinogenicity and genotoxicity as well as its resistance to current remediation methods. Conventional treatment approaches, such as microbial degradation, phytoremediation, and phase-transfer methods are either inefficient or fail entirely to eliminate this contaminant. Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs), which generate highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (•OH), represent a promising large-scale alternative for degrading persistent organic contaminants like OECs. However, the practical implementation of AOPs depends on the measurement of accurate kinetic data for •OH-OEC reactions. This study quantifies the absolute second-order rate constants for •OH radical reactions with six common OECs (TNT, picric acid (PA), tetryl, nitroglycerin (NG), ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN), and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN)) in aqueous solution using pulse radiolysis and competition kinetics. Reaction kinetics were evaluated at environmentally relevant concentrations (3–6 μM), and TNT and PETN were further studied over 10–40 °C to determine Arrhenius activation parameters. Measured •OH reaction rate constants ranged from 0.73 × 109 M–1 s–1 (EGDN) to 8.41 × 109 M–1 s–1 (PETN), with TNT having a value of (1.14 ± 0.05) × 109 M–1 s–1 at room temperature, in excellent agreement with corrected literature values. Activation energies were determined as 42.4 ± 4.3 kJ mol–1 for TNT and 21.6 ± 1.5 kJ mol–1 for PETN. Mechanistic kinetic comparison to model compounds suggests the hydroxyl radical reaction proceeds via hydrogen abstraction for both aliphatic and nitroaromatic species. These findings support the feasibility of hydroxyl radical-driven AOPs as an effective, scalable strategy for treating explosive-contaminated waters."

In water and soils, iron minerals are often associated with natural organic matter (NOM), which can substantially influence surface redox reactions. Yet inconsistencies remain in understanding the impacts of NOM association on ROS production from iron mineral surfaces due to limited insight into surface interfacial electron transfer processes. Here, we show that NOM association significantly modulates both the kinetics and the path of electron transfer on pyrite surfaces. Steric hindrance at O2 adsorption sites decreased the electron transfer rate by 22.7–38.6%, from 4.4 × 10–4 to 2.7–3.4 × 10–4 s–1. Concomitantly, O2 reduction shifted from a four-electron path producing H2O to a two-electron path favoring H2O2 formation, increasing H2O2 selectivity from 29.6% on pristine pyrite to 49.2–67.1% on NOM-associated pyrite. These changes collectively enhanced ROS production, with H2O2 and •OH yields increasing by 1.5–1.9-fold and 1.8–2.3-fold, respectively. Elevated ROS levels increased organic pollutant degradation rates by 1.6–2.7-fold.

We applied the method to the entire tadpole head postexperimental exposure to the legacy contaminant, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS; 0.1–100 μg/L, 48 h). At 10 μg/L, PFOS unexpectedly localized mainly to the olfactory epithelium. At 100 μg/L, PFOS was distributed throughout all tissues except for the brain, where only the pineal gland showed significant accumulation. The pineal gland, a neuroendocrine organ regulating the circadian rhythm, is not protected by the blood–brain barrier. Together, these findings indicate that PFOS did not readily cross the blood–brain barrier.

Among SAF production pathways, alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) stands out for its scalability, supported by abundant feedstock availability and a well-established bioethanol industry. However, significant reductions in SAF carbon intensity (CI) require the use of future feedstocks (e.g., cellulosic) whose adoption is hindered by high capital costs for feedstock processing and ethanol upgrading. Here, we evaluate the financial viability and environmental implications of integrating an ATJ SAF biorefinery within a petroleum refinery, utilizing miscanthus and switchgrass as example feedstocks. Three scenarios are evaluated: standalone (benchmark), colocated, and repurposing (coprocessing SAF within the petroleum refinery). Results show repurposing reduces baseline capital costs by 36% and SAF minimum selling price (MSP) by 12% to 8.14 USD·gal–1; the superior performance of repurposing is consistent across both feedstocks. Integration has a limited effect on SAF CI, which remains stable across scenarios, whereas using cellulosic feedstocks reduces CI by over 70% relative to corn, with baseline values of 17.01 g CO2e·MJ–1 for miscanthus and 12.23 g CO2e·MJ–1 for switchgrass.

To overcome the proton transfer limitations inherent in conventional thermal regeneration, which relies on elevated temperatures, this study proposes a novel homogeneous catalytic system utilizing proton shuttles. By replacement of heterogeneous solid acid catalysts with small organic molecules (e.g., ethanol), this system enables efficient proton transfer while circumventing solid–liquid interfacial diffusion resistance. The dynamic proton exchange capability of these shuttles, operating BH/B– cycling, accelerates the deprotonation of RNHCOO– species and significantly reduces the reaction energy barrier. Experimental results demonstrate that ethanol, because its pKa value balances proton donation and acceptance capabilities, reduces regeneration energy consumption by 35%, with isotope-labeled mass spectrometry confirming the proton transfer pathway. This homogeneous catalytic mechanism, through molecular-level optimization of proton transfer dynamics, provides a new pathway for developing efficient and stable CO2 desorption processes, potentially accelerating the economic advancement of carbon capture technologies toward achieving carbon neutrality goals."

Here, a modified passive air sampler was developed and used to characterize vertical profiles of typical hazardous polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) in near-ground microenvironments. Field measurements demonstrated significant vertical  changes for most target air pollutants within the 2–150 cm height range, with the relative difference  ranging from 1.1 to 40.0. The concentration of total PACs generally showed an increasing trend with height; however, the intensity of this vertical variation was closely linked to season, pollution levels, and photochemical activity, and it also varies among individual compounds. Children’s exposure to total BaPeq would be significantly overestimated, particularly during summer, with the overestimation ranging from 13% to 79%. This vertical heterogeneity implies that exposure assessment should not overlook the height-dependent variability of near-ground air pollution levels, and the sampling strategy employed in this study can be used to evaluate the vertical  variation of air pollutants across different microenvironments."

We aimed to determine the amount of NDMA contained in various types of rubber gloves and its behavior. It was found that rubber gloves contained NDMA exceeding 2 mg/kg, which volatilizes into the air during storage, causing air contamination and easily dissolving in water when used. Thus, the exposure risks of NDMA contained in rubber products may be underestimated. A temperature-dependent leaching experiment demonstrated that NDMA leaches more rapidly from gloves at higher temperatures. Furthermore, exposure to ambient air decreased NDMA content over time, indicating loss by volatilization. These findings suggest that NDMA levels in gloves may be highest at the time of manufacture and can fluctuate depending on storage conditions, thus highlighting the potential for underestimated health risks. Our results provide important new insights into the safety assessment of disposable rubber gloves and underscore the need for further evaluation and regulation of NDMA in these products."

In particular, there exist limited to no direct measurements of the distances traveled by MP particles during atmospheric transport. This study builds on a previous study that measured the settling velocity of various shapes and sizes of MPs. The settling velocity was found to have a distinct linear relationship for each type and shape of MP rather than one predictable relationship based on MP size and shape. In the current study, MP particles were released into the airflow from a common point within a boundary layer wind tunnel at three different wind speeds to measure the distance to which the particles were dispersed downwind. Similar to the previous study, a common relationship was not found between distance traveled and MP size and shape. However, a strong power relationship was determined between distance traveled and settling velocity when normalized by the friction velocity, which reflects the shear within the turbulent flow. This outcome stresses the importance of developing a database of MP settling velocity values that is accurate and comprehensive. The relation is suitable for use for all shapes and sizes of MP and windspeeds, providing a convenient simplification for MP dispersion modeling."

However, their combined effect on the metabolome has not been evaluated. We investigated the effect of short-term coexposure to temperature and PM2.5 on metabolomic signatures and the potential roles of serum lipids and biomarkers using a repeated-measures study among Chinese women of childbearing age. We performed untargeted metabolomic profiling to quantify plasma metabolites. Data on temperature and PM2.5 exposures were estimated using a fused estimator. Serum lipids and biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation were detected. The independent and combined effects of temperature and PM2.5 were estimated using a linear mixed-effect model and quantile-based g-computation, respectively. Pathway analysis was conducted to identify perturbed metabolic pathways. Ten women provided 46 blood samples, from which 139 metabolites were quantified. Temperature and PM2.5 had independent effects on several metabolites and pathways. The largest positive and negative combined effects were observed for benzyl sulfate [β = 1.460, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.438, 2.481] and chenodeoxycholic acid glycine conjugate (β = −1.933, 95% CI: −3.473, −0.392), respectively. Co-exposure to temperature and PM2.5 perturbed four pathways, including biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids; phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis; linoleic acid metabolism; and phenylalanine metabolism. The metabolomic perturbations were mainly related to oxidative stress and the inflammatory response. We observed a positive combined effect of temperature and PM2.5 on interleukin-8. Our findings demonstrate that the metabolic mechanisms induced by temperature and PM2.5 involve oxidative stress and the inflammatory response and suggest that these metabolomic perturbations might promote an inflammatory response via release of interleukin-8."

However, its expanding application in diverse fields has raised concerns about inadvertent environmental release, which might lead to potential ecological and health risks. Herein, mice were continuously exposed at doses of 0.1 mg/kg/day (possible acceptable daily intake dose, ADI) and 1 mg/kg/day (possible occupational exposure dose) to BPNSs for 28 days. Using hyperspectral imaging and Evans blue fluorescence chromogenic assay, we confirmed that partial BPNSs penetrated the blood–testis barrier (BTB) and distributed throughout the spermatogenic microenvironment of testes. Mice exposed to BPNSs exhibited significant reproductive toxicity, evidenced by abnormal sperm parameters, disordered spermatogenic cell layers, sloughed germ cells, and disrupted sex hormone levels. Further, BPNSs promoted the steroid synthesis pathway and inhibited testosterone aromatization, leading to testicular endocrine homeostasis disorders. BPNSs also damaged germ cells in the testes via the apoptosis pathway. In conclusion, our study not only highlights the male reproductive toxicity of BPNSs but also demonstrates that BPNSs can penetrate the BTB and have bioaccumulation potential in the male reproductive system, which provides new insights into the toxicological implications of 2D nanomaterials for mammalian fertility."

Accurate submesoscale representation in ocean models is a current challenge due to rapidly evolving flow and lack of observations at suitable scales.

We use advanced data‐assimilation to demonstrate the impact of SWOT observations on circulation estimates in a high‐resolution hydrodynamic model of the East Australian Current. We show that assimilating SWOT data improves representation and prediction of the mesoscale motions, and improves representation (but not prediction) of the fine‐scale dynamics. Increased relative vorticity variance with SWOT assimilation is widespread in space and time (away from SWOT observations) and projected to depth. Using data observed by SWOT in a realistic ocean model, we show enhanced representation of ocean processes across scales, essential for improved ocean forecasts and projections."

The time series from the half‐cubic hectometer mooring‐array allows for the creation of unique movies of deep‐sea water motions. Although temperature differences are typically 0.001°C, variable convection‐turbulence is observed as expected from geothermal heating through the flat seafloor. During about 40% of the time, an additional turbulence, 3 times stronger in magnitude, is observed from slantwise advected warmer waters to pass in turbulent clouds.

However, the details of BrC photochemical aging are not fully understood. When exposed to UV radiation, the chemical composition and optical properties of BrC can change, influencing atmospheric radiative forcing. Previous studies suggested that water‐soluble BrC in clouds and fog initially experiences enhanced light absorption due to phenolic monomers forming dimers. However, the identities of dimers responsible for the enhancement have neither been identified nor quantified. This study investigates the direct photolysis of a few key phenolic compounds present in BrC under UVA and UVB radiation. In particular, vanillin was used as a model compound with an aim to identify and quantify divanillin, the dimer of vanillin, and evaluate its role in photo‐enhancement. Using liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry and UV‐visible spectroscopy, we confirmed the formation of phenolic dimers during photolysis. Quantitative analysis of vanillin revealed that while phenolic homodimers formed under both UVA and UVB conditions, with yields peaking at approximately 10% after 5 min, their contribution to enhanced visible‐range absorption was minor (about 10%). Our observations indicate that not all dimers contribute equally to photo‐enhancement. While divanillin showed negligible absorbance, the demethylated dimer (dimer‐CH2 ${\text{CH}}_{2}$) correlated better with the observed optical changes. This suggests that differences in molecular structure and conjugation, rather than the dimer backbone alone, are critical for absorbance, highlighting the need to distinguish between different dimers and oligomers in atmospheric models."

The simulation of wet deposition of solutes, alongside precipitation rates, in the Community Atmosphere Model version 6 with Chemistry (CAM‐chem) has had limited previous evaluation leaving an opportunity to determine its accuracy in simulating precipitation chemistry. Here, we assessed the accuracy of 1° resolution CAM‐chem outputs of wet deposition over the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) from 2002 to 2022, comparing model outputs for observed equivalents of sulfate (SO42−), ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3−), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) wet deposition with long‐term records collected at hundreds of stations across CONUS. After evaluating the temporal, spatial, and quantile differences between modeled and observed wet deposition fluxes, we find the model captures long‐term and seasonal patterns but consistently overestimates NO3−, while underestimating SO42−, NH4+, and DOC wet deposition fluxes. Model‐measurement agreement improved at higher deposition flux quantiles and site‐specific alignment was strongest for NO3−, and moderate for SO42− and NH4+. Low model‐measurement agreement for DOC comparisons is likely due to focusing on aerosol contributions. Higher resolution model simulations (∼14 km) resulted in equivalent comparisons as the 1° model, suggesting that wet deposition processes are represented consistently across different model simulations and spatial resolution is not the main driver of inaccuracies of model deposition. Benchmarking modeled deposition outputs is crucial for evaluating CAM‐chem's performance and its utility in understanding landscape drivers of deposition chemistry within Earth system models."

However, the influence of a pre‐existing TC (PTC) has not been fully clarified in realistic simulations. This study conducted 42 numerical experiments (NPTC) for 1981–2022, in which a PTC was removed by horizontal smoothing from the initial conditions 120 hr before the genesis of a subsequent TC (STC). Compared to control simulations with the PTC (WPTC), the number of STC formations was slightly larger (WPTC: 31, NPTC: 33). The intensities of common STCs are very similar. STCs were typically located to the south or southwest of a subtropical high. The experiments showed wave‐like anomaly patterns in the vorticity field southeast of PTCs and in the geopotential height field northeast of the PTCs. Vertical wind shear (VWS), enhanced by PTC outflows, created an unfavorable environment for STC formation and intensification. Reanalysis data supported strong VWS and a similar wave‐like pattern. A positive sea surface temperature anomaly over the central equatorial Pacific induced westerly wind anomalies in the southeastern WNP. The spatial collocation of PTCs and STCs was frequently observed when the active eastern convection is expected by the indices of Madden–Julian Oscillation, Boreal Summer Intraseasonal Oscillation, and El Niño–Southern Oscillation. These conditions promote TC genesis farther east, suggesting that such collocation does not imply PTC‐induced formation. Thus, impact of PTCs appears less significant than previously assumed."

Using all TC events from the North Atlantic and Western Pacific basins between 2020 and 2025, we assess the ability of two AI models (Pangu‐Weather and Aurora) to reproduce observed TC track density, climatology of storm characteristics, and physical consistency with TC theory. By comparing AI‐simulated TCs with ERA5 reanalysis, we benchmark the distributions of intensity, size, forward speed, and evaluate the model's ability to credibly simulate extratropical transition. Results show that both Pangu and Aurora perform well in reproducing storm track density, forward speed distribution, and outer size distribution. Aurora shows an improved performance in simulating storm intensity compared to Pangu, with less bias in the distribution of minimum central pressure and maximum wind speed. However, both models overestimate the distribution of storm inner size (radius of maximum winds), especially for extreme events. AI models capture the relative frequency and temporal evolution of extratropical transition patterns with reasonable accuracy. The AI‐simulated TCs are also less likely to conform to gradient wind balance compared to ERA5, indicating that the AI TCs may not be physically realistic in many cases. This benchmarking identifies systematic biases that can guide future corrections and support extended applications of AI models for TC hazard and risk assessment. Our work establishes a foundation for future studies using AI weather models in the context of TC climatological and hazard research."

During the cold season (October–March), the regional weather is dominated by extratropical cyclone activity. While these Great Lakes extratropical cyclones (GL ETCs) are getting warmer and holding more moisture with time, there is considerable interannual variability in storm characteristics. To better understand cold‐season variability, this study investigates the correlations between GL ETC thermodynamic characteristics and different global teleconnection patterns. Using a database of 886 cyclones identified in ERA5 data, we find that while there is no correlation between teleconnection indices and the number of GL ETCs each year, the Pacific North American and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) indices are significantly correlated with the moisture content in GL ETCs, and the North American Oscillation is correlated with ETC temperature. The Arctic Oscillation is correlated with all thermodynamic characteristics in GL ETCs. Additionally, the relationships between GL ETCs and teleconnection indices are shifting with time, and some teleconnections, like the NPGO, may become more influential to Great Lakes weather in the future."

Here, we show that the interannual variability of the summer sea fog over the mid‐latitude North Pacific region is correlated with the Asian‐Pacific Oscillation (APO) driven by the seasonal heating of the Tibetan Plateau. During the positive phase of APO, the sea fog frequency is observed to be higher along with a stronger North Pacific Subtropical High, North Pacific Trough and South Asian High, while the Bering Sea Low and Okhotsk High are weaker. The stronger northward heat and water vapor fluxes in the positive phase of APO associated with the North Pacific Subtropical High lead to a higher air temperature and relative humidity over the mid‐latitude North Pacific region. Additionally, this northward warm advection is stronger in the upper boundary layer than the cooling by the sea surface temperature in the lower layer, creating a temperature inversion within the marine boundary layer and hence a higher sea fog frequency over the mid‐latitude North Pacific region.

Here, we constructed a high‐resolution model for the Pacific Arctic Region (PAR) using the polar‐optimized Weather Research and Forecasting model (PWRF), applied it to simulate the low‐level atmosphere during the 2018 Chinese National Arctic Research Expedition (CHINARE‐2018), and were able to accurately reproduce the observed conditions. Simulations, combined with observational data, were used to evaluate and investigate extreme variations in inversions over the MIZ. Analysis of 84 observed inversions revealed that inversion variability increased significantly during cyclone passing, with a specific inversion of extreme variations occurring in the MIZ. Simulation results showed that abrupt sea ice transitions in the MIZ triggered boundary‐layer destabilization, setting it apart from other ice zones and leading to these extreme inversion variations. Before the abrupt sea ice transitions occurred, inversions were mainly controlled by warm advection induced by the cyclone, which facilitated the formation of low‐level clouds. Following the transitions, increased surface turbulent fluxes destabilized the boundary‐layer, triggering strong upward motion. Meanwhile, accumulated moisture and energy promoted convection, lifting the clouds and inversions. Adiabatic cooling and radiative cooling at the cloud‐top over the MIZ led to the formation of inversions reaching the highest altitudes and lowest temperatures during CHINARE‐2018, fully capping the cloud‐top."

Here, authors construct a homotypic membrane-powered biomimetic interface for subtype-specific analysis of breast cancer extracellular vesicles. 
 The cancer cell membrane, rich in tumor-associated antigens, effectively replicates the characteristics of cancer cells by presenting specific protein profiles. Leveraging the inherent binding capability of the cancer cell membrane, here we show a homotypic membrane-powered biomimetic interface for subtype-specific analysis of breast cancer extracellular vesicles (EVs). Specifically, the breast cancer cell membrane is employed to coat a gold substrate, thereby forming the biomimetic interface capable of selectively binding breast cancer EVs with similar subtype features. Subsequently, silver nanoparticles-tethered antibodies are adopted as electroactive immunoprobes to label these EVs, generating distinct electrochemical signals for quantitative analysis. Research findings demonstrate high selectivity and sensitivity of the interface for analyzing target EVs. Based on this, an electrochemical microfluidic device is developed and validated for its effectiveness in identifying subtype features of breast cancer patients. Therefore, our work provides a simple yet efficient platform for precise cancer diagnosis and personalized treatment.

 The skin exhibits extraordinary plasticity, enabling it to adapt to mechanical changes in the environment. While transient deformations are accommodated without lasting structural effects, sustained mechanical stress induces durable tissue changes. To investigate if these responses are mediated by shifts in epidermal stem cell fate, we employed two-photon intravital imaging to visualize epidermal cells in live skin subjected to acute mechanical forces. Mechanical force triggered the formation of intracellular “stress” vesicles within epidermal stem cells that filled with extracellular fluid and progressively enlarged, deforming the nucleus. Lineage tracing analyses revealed that the extent of nuclear deformation can predict cell fate outcomes. Moreover, mechanical stress caused sustained elevation of intracellular calcium in basal epidermal stem cells, and conditional deletion of the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 disrupted calcium dynamics and increased stress vesicle formation. Using human skin xenografts, we demonstrated that stress vesicles are conserved in mammalian skin. Together, these findings identify stress vesicles as key mediators linking mechanical stress, calcium signaling, and epidermal stem cell fate. Using two-photon intravital imaging, the authors show that mechanical stress in skin triggers fluid-filled “stress vesicles” in epidermal cells, altering Piezo1-dependent calcium signals to drive stem cell differentiation and protect tissue integrity."

 The trihexagonal tiling system exhibits strong electron-electron interactions, positioning it as a key condensed matter platform for studying geometrically frustrated lattices made up of corner-sharing triangles. Its phase-transition-driven lattice modulations enable Fermi surface reconstruction, while emergent van Hove singularities near the Fermi level and correlated band anomalies present critical challenges in understanding electronic interaction mechanisms. By combining temperature-dependent spectroscopy, angle-resolved photoemission, and density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate a 61-fold enhancement in terahertz direct detection mode, ultra-low noise (1.38 × 10⁻²⁵ A²/Hz) below phase transition temperature, and broadband operation up to 100 GHz in beat-note heterodyne mode. These results are directly correlated with the Fermi surface reconstruction induced by phase transitions. This work positions geometrically frustrated lattices as a powerful platform for studying correlated quantum phenomena, offering new pathways for the design of advanced quantum devices.

Here the authors identify a Ly6G+Nur77+ macrophage population involved in initiation of HDM-driven Th2 responses that detect Derp1 allergen through PAR2 and modulate migration of conventional DC to draining lymph nodes via cysteinyl leukotriene production. 
 The mechanisms of airway allergen sensing and type 2 immune response initiation remain poorly understood. Using a mouse house dust mite (HDM)-induced allergic airway model, we identify a population of lung macrophages located close to alveolar capillaries that express Ly6G and the nuclear receptor Nr4a1/Nur77. These atypical Ly6G+Nur77+ macrophages preferentially capture airway-delivered allergens and play an important role in initiating HDM-driven T helper type 2 (Th2) responses. They sense the major HDM allergen, the cysteine protease Der p 1, via protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2), and their activation and accumulation require both PAR2 and Nr4a1/Nur77. These Ly6G+Nur77+ macrophages regulate the migration of conventional migratory dendritic cells (mDCs) to draining mediastinal lymph nodes (mLNs) through cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) production, which enhances mDC migration toward CCL21 for T cell priming. Inhibiting CysLT biosynthesis reduces mDC migration and dampens Th2 allergic responses, highlighting possible therapeutic avenues in type 2 immunity.

 α-Oxy carbonyl compounds, characterized by their distinct electronic and topological properties, represent highly versatile building blocks and modifiers for functional molecules. Despite their potential, the synthetic challenges associated with these compounds have limited their exploration in chemical biology and drug discovery. In this study, we address this limitation by introducing a general Cu-catalyzed three-component carbonyl 1,2-transposition reaction, which proceeds via a PV-oxirene intermediate. Our method employs IIII/PV-hybrid ylides as carbene precursors to generate α-PV-Cu-carbenes, which subsequently facilitate the formation of PV-oxirene species. This intermediate undergoes regioselective ring-opening by carboxylate anions, followed by acylation of a third nucleophile, enabling the modular assembly of α-oxy carbonyl compounds. This strategy provides efficient access to α-oxy esters, amides, and thioesters, exhibiting broad tolerance to various functional groups. Furthermore, these compounds exhibit remarkable chemical versatility, as demonstrated in the synthesis of depsipeptides and late-stage drug modification, underscoring their applicability across diverse research areas. Our findings not only significantly expand the structural diversity of accessible α-oxy carbonyls but also introduce a versatile and biocompatible synthetic linkage for chemical synthesis. α-Oxy carbonyl compounds represent versatile building blocks and modifiers for functional molecules, but the synthetic challenges have limited their exploration in chemical biology and drug discovery.

 Causal inference is fundamental across scientific disciplines, yet existing methods struggle to capture instantaneous, time-evolving causal relationships in complex, high-dimensional systems. In this paper, assimilative causal inference (ACI) is developed, which is a methodological framework that leverages Bayesian data assimilation to trace causes backward from observed effects. ACI solves the inverse problem rather than quantifying forward influence. It uniquely identifies dynamic causal interactions without requiring observations of candidate causes, accommodates short datasets, and, in principle, can be implemented in high-dimensional settings by employing efficient data assimilation algorithms. Crucially, it provides online tracking of causal roles that may reverse intermittently and facilitates a mathematically rigorous criterion for the causal influence range, revealing how far effects propagate. The effectiveness of ACI is demonstrated by complex dynamical systems showcasing intermittency and extreme events. ACI opens valuable pathways for studying complex systems, where transient causal structures are critical. The authors develop a framework that uses data assimilation to trace causes backwards from observed effects, even with partial observations.

 Macrophage (Mφ) phenotypic transformation is crucial in determining spinal cord injury (SCI) outcomes. However, the suborganelle crosstalk mechanisms—particularly between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria—that mediate Mφ subgroup conversion during SCI remain underexplored. We aim to integrate niche intervention strategies and omics sequencing to investigate the effects of the metabolic crosstalk between ER stress (ERS) and mitochondria. Subsequently, we develop a dual-targeted camouflaged nanorobot (BP@D/N) that can reach the SCI site via systemic circulation and selectively interact with Mφ. We observe that Ero1α-mediated Ca2+ shuttling is an important mechanism for locking the inflammatory phenotype of Mφ. Blocking the Ero1α/MAMs/mtCa2+ axis suppresses mtDNA release and downregulates the cGAS-STING-NFκB signaling cascade, thus promoting M2 polarization and neural repair. Our study clarifies the regulatory mechanism of Mφ transformation-associated suborganelle crosstalk and offers a paradigm for reconstructing the dynamic balance of immune–neural interactions in the SCI microenvironment for effective repair.

 Ocean fronts are critical features that influence marine ecosystems and can affect climate at both regional and global scales. In many regions, fronts enhance vertical mixing and advection, increasing nutrient supply, which can stimulate primary production and modulate air–sea CO2 fluxes. However, a global perspective on the impacts of changing ocean fronts on primary production and air–sea CO2 exchange is still lacking. Here using satellite observations (2003–2024) and supplementary reanalysis data at higher latitudes (2003–2024), we identify areas with the richest frontal activity and the fastest-changing frontal properties. We find that 72% of global ocean CO2 uptake occurs in key frontal areas. Trends in sea surface chlorophyll concentration and ocean CO2 uptake closely track changes in local frontal activity. Our results indicate that ocean fronts play a central role in regulating the global carbon cycle by influencing the biological component of air–sea CO2 fluxes.

 Anomalously unradiogenic neodymium in authigenic phases of the North Atlantic during glacial terminations has been attributed to weathering of glacial sediments derived from shield rocks. However, mechanisms producing unradiogenic neodymium and their link to terrestrial processes remain poorly constrained. Here we analyze neodymium isotopes from co-located stream water and sediment across a deglaciating landscape in southwest Greenland. Dissolved neodymium is ~8 ɛNd units less radiogenic than bedload in recently exposed watersheds. In watersheds with longer exposure time, dissolved neodymium is ~10 ɛNd units and particulate neodymium ~3 ɛNd units higher, decreasing the offset to ~1 unit. This shift results from preferential weathering of minerals with low samarium/neodymium ratios and winnowing of the fine fraction of recently exposed sediments. Variations in the influx and weathering extent of shield-derived sediment alter neodymium isotopic compositions of North Atlantic seafloor sediment and seawater, constraining interpretations of past ice sheet loss and deep ocean circulation.

 The Cd concentrations and isotope compositions of open ocean surface waters are generally thought to be governed by internal cycling, and particularly by the balance between upwelling of more Cd-rich deeper water masses and Cd uptake by phytoplankton. Here we present a new dataset of coupled Cd isotope compositions and concentrations for seawater depth profiles sampled in the western tropical Atlantic Ocean during Leg 2 of the GEOTRACES GA02 section. A box model for the Cd source and sink fluxes of the oligotrophic surface waters of the study area shows that the observed light Cd isotope compositions and low Cd concentrations are a consequence of biological Cd uptake and atmospheric deposition of isotopically light anthropogenic Cd. Aerosols enriched in anthropogenic Cd thereby contributed at least 19%, and possibly more than 45%, to the dissolved surface water Cd inventory during the sampling period. This reveals that anthropogenic emissions of volatile Cd can have a key impact on the distribution of Cd in open ocean surface waters.

 Countries worldwide are pursuing efficient and clean energy extraction. In China, coal bases have implemented green mining policies for over a decade, but their environmental impact remains poorly understood. Here we compile raw coal production data and green mining policy records from 14 coal bases between 2004 and 2021 to estimate carbon emissions and quantify policy intensity. We assess the effect of these policies on emissions and find that, following national green mining initiatives, policy intensity increased more than tenfold, coinciding with a substantial reduction or slowdown in carbon emissions from raw coal production. Implementation of these policies is estimated to have reduced total emissions by 43.59 million tons annually. Differences in policy design, enforcement capacity, and technological foundations contribute to variability in emission reductions. These results demonstrate the critical role of policy interventions in guiding coal-dependent regions toward effective climate governance and provide insights for designing more scientifically grounded strategies to achieve cleaner and more efficient energy production.

 Palaeoceanographic records spanning the Oligocene provide insights into Antarctic ice-sheet dynamics in a world warmer-than-today, allowing us to improve future climate projections linked to global warming. Here, we present a high-resolution multi-proxy record from ODP Site 689 (Maud Rise, Southern Ocean), to investigate the short-term Antarctic ice-sheet variability during the late Oligocene. Our oxygen isotope composition of sea water record reflects large, obliquity-paced ice volume fluctuations from 26.2 to 25.2 Ma. These fluctuations would have resulted in changes in the types of rocks eroded as the Antarctic ice-sheet advanced/retreated. Indeed, the radiogenic isotopic compositions of neodymium and lead co-vary with the oxygen isotopes for most of the record and identify changes in sediment provenance and weathering rates linked to advances and retreats of the Antarctic ice-sheet. At the same time, the stable incongruent lead isotope signal observed confirms the presence of a major East Antarctic ice-sheet during the late Oligocene.

 There is no satisfactory model explaining the incompatible element-enriched chemical characteristics observed in few ~3000 Ma-old, low-titanium lunar basalts. Using in situ Pb-Pb systematics by Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry, we determined crystallisation ages and initial Pb isotope ratios of the meteorites North West Africa (NWA) 4734, LaPaz Icefield (LAP) 02224, LAP 02205, Northeast Africa 003 and newly found meteorite NWA 14178. We show that these samples form a unique chemical and age group, distinct from any other chemical group known from the Moon. Pb isotope ratios suggest these basalts originated from an enriched source distinct from the KREEP mantle component identified in rocks from the Procellarum Terrane. Three-stage model-based Monte Carlo simulations suggest a mantle source formed from a depleted mantle at 4260 Ma – that is, after the solidification of the Lunar Magma Ocean. This mantle source may have acquired its chemical characteristics as a result of deep crust-breaking impact.

 The formation of cloud condensation nuclei is a critical but uncertain factor in Arctic climate dynamics. A major nuclei contributor is new particle formation, yet the geographical variations in activity and the factors driving it remain poorly understood. Here, we present a nine-year (2010–2018) analysis of atmospheric particle number size distributions from Tiksi, Russia, integrated with air mass trajectory modelling and ocean remote sensing. We show that aerosol formation rates are significantly enhanced—particle formation rates increase by 300% and growth rates by 60%—when air masses travel over regions of the Arctic Ocean with high concentrations of terrigenous dissolved organic matter from river runoff. Using multiple analytical approaches, we identify terrigenous dissolved organic matter rich waters as key source regions for aerosol formation, likely driven by the oxidation of biotic and abiotic volatile organic compounds emitted from the air–ocean interface. We note that most atmospheric measurements are conducted far from Arctic River deltas, despite 11% of the ice-free Arctic Ocean being influenced by high terrigenous dissolved organic matter concentrations.

 Global shipping fuel sulphur content regulations introduced in 2020 reduced the radiative cooling effects of sulfate aerosol over the ocean.

Persistent incoming shortwave radiation enhancements on the order of 5-11 Wm−2 likely lead to sea-surface temperature increases of 0.05-0.15 °C, implying that during bleaching-conducive conditions, 5-10% additional thermal stress is felt by GBR corals now than before the regulation of ship sulfate emissions. Reduced sulfate aerosols due to ship fuel regulation may increase shortwave radiation on the Great Barrier Reef, exacerbating the impact of marine heatwaves on coral bleaching, according to model analysis of ship emission impacts on aerosols, clouds and solar radiation."

 Accurate stem-level volume estimation at large scale is highly desired in temperate natural forests due to their economic and ecological significance. Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) systems (e.g., handheld or backpack) offer the ability to efficiently capture high-density point clouds over large areas, creating opportunities for automated, large-scale individual stem volume estimation. However, effective algorithms that can automatically and accurately analyze the dense and complex MLS point clouds of temperate natural forests are lacking. To address this issue, we propose a novel three-stage method to automatically detect, segment, and reconstruct individual stems, enabling direct volume estimations from MLS point clouds of temperate natural forests. First, a deep learning model is employed to separate understory vegetation from overstory trees, reducing point cloud complexity. Next, we introduce a Bidirectional Section Growing (BSG) method for individual stem detection and segmentation, specifically for the segmentation of merchantable logs and multi-stem scenarios, using a novel Least Squares with Similarity Optimization (LeSSO) algorithm. Finally, the Sector Median Points (SMP) method is developed to reconstruct stem shapes for precise volume estimation. Our method is evaluated on four datasets collected in temperate natural forests across the U.S. and Europe. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving 89.2% Intersection over Union (IoU) for understory removal, 99.4% F-score for stem detection, 91.5% IoU for stem segmentation, and reconstruction accuracy with a Point-to-Mesh distance of 0.0004 m2 and a Chamfer distance of 0.05 m. Moreover, we record 42 stem locations in the field for one of the U.S. datasets and conduct destructive measurements of section-wise diameters for each of them to serve as independent reference data to evaluate stem detection and volume estimation. Our method is able to detect all 42 trees from the point cloud, and reconstructed stem models yield the most accurate section-wise diameter estimates with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 2.27 cm and R2 of 0.96, and best volume estimation with RMSE of 0.18 m3 and R2 of 0.97. Our method paves the way for automated and accurate estimation of merchantable stem volume from MLS point clouds collected in complex temperate natural forests."

 This study harnesses quality-assured global Pandora observations (2019–2023) from the Pandonia Global Network (PGN) to investigate diurnal and seasonal variations of NO2 and HCHO—key proxies for tropospheric O3—and to evaluate TROPOMI satellite observations. NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) at Polluted Urban stations peak in winter and gradually increase throughout the day, but show a decrease in afternoons in summer due to photochemical loss. Conversely, Rural/Background stations exhibit summer maxima with monotonic daytime increases across seasons, driven by stratospheric NO2 variability. HCHO VCDs are higher in summer at most sites, with a morning increase followed by elevated concentrations throughout the afternoon. The spatial representativeness mismatch between satellite and Pandora observations results in negative biases in TROPOMI NO2 VCDs at Polluted Urban stations and a valley station, while overestimations are found at high-altitude stations. Considerable random uncertainties in TROPOMI HCHO VCDs lead to low correlations (r2 = 0.08–0.11) and high random errors (0.27–0.33 DU) across environments. Averaging collocated data points prior to intercomparison effectively reduces random biases, whereas increasing the spatial collocation range introduces biases due to spatial averaging effects. Tropospheric HCHO-to-NO2 ratios (FNRtrop) retrieved from Pandora observations indicate that Polluted Urban (0.82 ± 0.08) and Rural/Background (1.64 ± 0.07) stations are generally under VOC-limited and NOx-limited O3 production regimes, respectively, while summertime increases in FNRtrop put Polluted Urban stations in a transitional range, yielding higher O3 production efficiencies. TROPOMI-derived FNRtrop shows good agreement with Pandora in Polluted Urban stations (ΔFNRmedian = 0.18), whereas random error increases in rural areas with lower tropospheric NO2."

 Accurate and timely information on rice cultivation areas and cropping intensity is essential for precision crop management, food security and environmental sustainability. However, the generation of high-quality rice products is often hindered by the lack of ground truth samples, particularly in the regions with complex cropping patterns. While most rice mapping methods rely on the use of remotely sensed flooding signal from the transplanting period to distinguish rice from other crops, they face significant challenges from the increasingly prevalent direct-seeded rice for which the flooding signal at the beginning of season is weak due to the unique management measures. To address these issues and achieve the comprehensive extraction of rice under diverse cropping patterns and establishment methods, this study proposed the phenological knowledge-guided automatic rice mapping approach using optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data (PHAROS). This method first determined the cropping intensity of rice and its concurrent crops using harmonized multi-resource Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series and phenological knowledge. Subsequently, the Double Phase SAR Index (DPSI) was constructed to extract candidate rice samples by synthesizing the early and peak growth phases retrieved from NDVI time series and the corresponding SAR polarization features. Consequently, training data were generated automatically and fed into a machine learning classifier for rice mapping. The effectiveness of the PHAROS was evaluated over the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River (MLRYR) of China and four other major rice production regions in Asia. Furthermore, the earliest timing of early, middle and late rice in the MLRYR was also quantified via the PHAROS and cross-year model transfer.The results demonstrated that the PHAROS could identify rice of diverse cropping pattern with an overall accuracy (OA) from 0.965 to 0.976 in the MLRYR from 2019 to 2023. The classification maps exhibited well-delineated rice parcels and clear separation between single- and double-cropping rice. The PHAROS also yielded OA values of 0.902–0.979 and similar distribution pattern with the reference rice products in Suihua of China, Sataka of Japan, An Giang of Vietnam and Punjab of Pakistan, which represent diverse climatic conditions and cropping patterns across Asia. Compared to its counterpart methods, PHAROS demonstrated significant improvements by 0.022–0.235 in OA in rice planting area extraction and cropping intensity detection. The early, middle and late rice could be identified as early as at tillering, tillering-jointing and sowing/transplanting stages, respectively. This study reveals the necessity of handling the overlooked weak flooding signal from direct-seeded rice and offers a viable solution for large-scale rice cropping intensity detection and mapping under diverse establishment methods."

 Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are widely used in land cover mapping, environmental monitoring, and disaster management. While optical sensors are often hindered by adverse weather conditions such as clouds and rain, SAR provides all-weather capability but suffers from lower interpretability. To overcome this limitation, historical optical data can be leveraged to improve SAR interpretation and enhance mapping accuracy. This study proposed a degradable multimodal fusion (DEMFuse) framework that leverages historical optical data to enhance the interpretation of single SAR imagery and implemented it via semantic segmentation. The DEMFuse is composed of a SAR-to-optical image generator and a degradable fusion model. The former was built upon an ImageNet-pretrained transformer that employed a non-local generative modeling for translating SAR images into optical images to recover optical visual structural information. The latter was proposed to achieve progressively enhanced fusion performance by continuously assimilating useful information from synthesized optical data based on SAR data, thus reducing the impact of artifacts in the synthesized data, and ensuring the effective fusion of the optical and SAR data. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DEMFuse framework, a globally distributed SAR-to-optical image translation dataset and a land-cover semantic segmentation dataset were constructed by using 18,071 Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical images, together referred to as “IT-SS-18 K” (image translation-segmentation-18 K). Additionally, a SAR-based flood rapid mapping dataset was employed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in disaster scenarios. Experiments on IT-SS-18 K demonstrated that the proposed DEMFuse framework significantly reduced the relative accuracy gap by over 30 % between SAR and optical data for the segmentation of water, built areas, and trees. In the flood disaster scenario, the proposed framework yielded a 1.76 % improvement compared to the single SAR segmentation. This finding suggests that DEMFuse can be employed to enhance SAR interpretation in scenarios where optical data is missing, and improve the efficiency and accuracy of disaster management and environmental monitoring.

 Landslides are among the most frequent natural hazards worldwide, posing severe risks to human lives and assets. Sentinel-2 imagery, a widely available remote sensing resource, has become an essential tool for detecting landslide changes. Nevertheless, its moderate spatial resolution often causes the loss of subtle surface information, which limits the precision of landslide recognition. To overcome this limitation, this study develops a Dynamic Multi-branch Landslide Change Detection Network (DMLCDNet) that integrates three types of multimodal data: multispectral, deformation, and topographic information. The proposed model achieves efficient landslide extraction through four key stages: preliminary change detection, dynamic feature extraction, feature fusion optimization, and spatial-semantic restoration. Experiments were conducted on three representative landslide events—Jiuzhaigou, Luding, and Longyan. The experimental findings indicate that DMLCDNet achieves improvements of 3.61% in F1-score and 6.91% in IoU over all baseline models, while sustaining efficient inference performance. In addition, evaluations on two other landslide cases confirm the model’s robust generalization ability. The study further emphasizes that the optimal selection of input data should follow three guiding principles: rich information, high discriminability, and strong relevance. Overall, the proposed method provides an effective paradigm for multisource feature fusion in Sentinel-2–based landslide change detection, offering substantial theoretical significance and practical value.

 Coastal regions worldwide are increasingly threatened by Relative Sea Level Rise (RSLR), which results from the combined effects of Sea Level Rise (SLR) and Vertical Land Motion (VLM). Satellite Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) can measure millimeter-scale VLM. However, the spatiotemporal variability of VLM remains poorly quantified in RSLR estimation and projection and flood inundation assessment. This study constructed an RSLR dataset for the Bohai Rim by integrating high-resolution InSAR-derived VLM with SLR. We develop a dynamic flood inundation model by incorporating hydrological connectivity and flow path attenuation factors to improve flood risk assessment. The results show significant spatial variability of VLM and concentration on muddy and sandy coastlines. VLM dominates the spatial patterns and magnitude of RSLR. The maximum inundation extent and depth reach 17,756 km2 and 5.4 m, respectively, under the RSLR-SSP5-8.5 scenario by 2100, which threatens 10.4 million residents. The uncertainties in inundation projection can be reduced by considering the drivers and nonlinear evolution of VLM. The flood protection infrastructures can reduce inundation largely. Our findings highlight the crucial importance of incorporating VLM into coastal risk assessments and provide insights for RSLR adaptation strategies."

 BackgroundGlobally, the increasing frequency of extreme heat events and ozone pollution incidents has significantly intensified public health risks. However, empirical evidence regarding their synergistic impacts remains limited in central China.MethodsA two-stage analysis was conducted using data from 121 counties in Henan (2013–2019). Quasi-Poisson generalized additive models were used to assess county-specific associations, adjusting for PM2.5, RH, and temporal trends. The combined effect of air temperature (non-linear) and ozone (linear) was captured through multiplicative interaction terms. Random-effects meta-analyses were applied to pool the results. Subgroup analyses examined differences by age, sex, marital status, and cause of death.ResultsDuring the study period, 1,280,429 deaths were recorded. Both high temperatures and elevated ozone levels were associated with increased mortality. Their joint effects were stronger than individual exposures. At high ozone levels, mortality risk increased by 2 percentage points (from 9.3 % to 11.3 %) between temperature distribution percentiles 75th and 99th. Under high-temperature conditions (31.4 °C, 90th percentile), a 10 μg/m3 elevation in ozone was associated with a 0.94 % (95 % CI: 0.49 %–1.38 %) increase in mortality. Older adults, females, other marital statuses (including unmarried, divorced, or widowed), and those with cardiovascular or respiratory diseases were more susceptible to its effects.ConclusionHigh temperature and ozone synergistically increase mortality risk.

 Coupling effects among different components of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) may influence the oxidative potential (OP) of PM, whereas the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we investigate the OP of binary organics/inorganics mixtures, typically present in PM, using a dithiothreitol assay under dark conditions. The binary mixture of 2-methoxyphenol (2-MET, a typical biomass burning marker) and FeCl3 shows a 23 times increase in OP (380 pmol min−1·μg−1) compared to the individual species. A synergistic mechanism has been revealed through comprehensive characterization of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and relevant intermediates, by ROS probe technology, spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry indicates that diphenyl-p-benzoquinones, like 5,5′-dihydroxy-3,3′-dimethoxy-[1,1′-bi(cyclohexane)]-2,2′,5,5′-tetraene-4,4′-dione‌, can be produced in the presence of Fe3+, subsequently promoting ROS formation (·OH and ·O2−) through free radical chain reaction induced by semiquinone. The OP achieves a maximum when the mass ratio of 2-MET to FeCl3 is 1.0 at 37°C. It persists around 60% of the initial OP over 31 h, which indicates the possible contribution of the mixture of methoxyphenol and Fe(III) to environmental persistent free radicals in the atmosphere. Our findings provide a new insight into the non-linear dependence of PM oxidative toxicity on composition and meaningful guidance for future PM health risk reduction."

Similarities and differences between the two FHRs are analyzed and concluded from the perspective of their key driving mechanisms. During the first FHR with short durations, geostrophic winds progressively intensified, while low-level southeasterlies underwent topographic convergence and uplifted over the northwestern basin. Under the background of weak geostrophic wind variations, the ageostrophic wind vector in the second FHR with extremely persistent durations exhibited pronounced clockwise diurnal rotation. Enhanced nocturnal southerlies poured moisture convergence into the basin, driving nighttime precipitation intensification. Steep basin-edge topography strengthened boundary layer friction (BLF) and intensified easterly ageostrophic winds. This deflection steered the LLJ southeastward, effectively channeling moisture into the storm area. Post-dawn enhancement of boundary layer friction increased ageostrophic moisture flux, slowing the precipitation decay rate. The inertial oscillation of ageostrophic winds critically governed the nocturnal enhancement and daytime suppression of rainfall by modulating moisture transport phases. Additionally, the post-dawn increase in boundary layer friction altered spatiotemporal configurations between ageostrophic winds and the LLJ, forming a key factor in precipitation process asymmetry."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108734,True,Atmospheric Research,这项研究使用卫星观测数据来分析地中海飓风（medicanes）的近地表风场，并开发了一种新的卫星算法来估计最大风速半径。这直接涉及使用卫星技术进行大气环境遥感，特别是风场和气象系统的监测与分析，因此与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['satellite observations', 'near-surface wind field', 'medicanes', 'radius of maximum wind', 'MeRCAD algorithm']",Stefano Sebastianelli;Leo Pio D'Adderio;Paolo Sanò;Daniele Casella;Giulia Panegrossi,Near-surface wind field characterization of medicanes using satellite observations,"•A new satellite-based algorithm is defined to estimate the radius of maximum wind. •The radius of maximum wind gives information on the mature phase of medicane. •Lower values of radius of maximum wind are found in the presence of warm core. •During tropical transition, deep convection occurs within the radius of maximum wind. 
 MEDIterranean hurriCANES (Medicanes) represent a subcategory of Mediterranean cyclones that typically originate as extratropical systems then acquiring characteristics similar to tropical cyclones (TCs). These include the warm core, a nearly symmetric near-surface wind circulation, and eye-like features with spiraling rainbands. This study employs satellite scatterometer data to analyse ocean near-surface wind field in order to detect the rotational center by means the newly developed Medicane Rotational Center Automated Detection (MeRCAD) algorithm. As for TCs, the radius of maximum wind (RMW) is defined as the distance between the rotational center and the area of maximum wind. Results show a significant decrease in RMW, often down to a few tens of kilometres, when the wind field is featured by a nearly symmetric circulation. This allows wind features to be used as an indicator of the possible transition to the mature stage. We also found that the maximum sustained wind associated with the medicanes' mature phase is mostly beyond 95th percentile of values observed for all Mediterranean cyclones, although they appear substantially weaker than TCs. In addition, if the tropical transition occurs, the warm core is fueled by an area of deep convection that may be located near the rotational center at distances shorter than the RMW. However, the presence of an almost symmetrical wind circulation alone is insufficient to indicate the occurrence of the mature phase, due to the possible lack of a warm core. Vice versa, the warm core may occur without the characteristic nearly-symmetric wind circulation."

However, the complexity of these hybrid systems challenges understanding of the mechanisms that determine properties such as mobility. We investigated interlayer exciton diffusion in tungsten diselenide–tungsten disulfide heterobilayers at ultralow exciton density and low temperatures to examine how charges affect exciton mobility. Near the electronic Mott insulator phase, we observed a giant thousand-fold enhancement of exciton diffusion relative to charge neutrality. We attribute this to mobile valence holes, which experienced a suppressed moiré potential due to charge order and recombined nonmonogamously with conduction electrons. Our results show exciton diffusion as a probe of correlated electron states and Bose-Fermi interplay."

We found that ligation of αIIbβ3 by von Willebrand factor or fibrin under flow triggered its accumulation in plasma membrane extensions or “platelet-derived integrin- and tetraspanin-enriched tethers” (PITTs). PITTs remained anchored to leukocytes or endothelial cells, whereas the partially αIIbβ3-deficient platelet body detached. Although still responsive to stimuli, αIIbβ3-deficient platelets did not support thrombus formation. PITTs promoted leukocyte activation and vascular inflammation in mouse models of infection and endotoxemia, and αIIbβ3 blockade reduced immune-mediated tissue damage. In patients with sepsis, COVID-19, or severe infections, PITT formation and platelet αIIbβ3 loss correlated with disease severity and adverse outcomes.

Our results show that OPCs attempt to differentiate throughout the adult central nervous system with spatial and temporal regularity.

We observed that human embryos arresting at the eight-cell ZGA stage exhibited specific down-regulation of endogenous retrovirus MLT2A1. Depleting MLT2A1 resulted in a failure in embryo development and a reduction in ZGA gene expression. Mechanistically, MLT2A1s synthesized chimeric transcripts with downstream coding and noncoding sequences, predominantly with heterologous retro–transposable elements. These diverse fusion sequences expanded the genome-targeting spectrum of MLT2A1 RNAs. Nevertheless, the shared MLT2A1 sequences partnered with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (HNRNPU) to recruit RNA polymerase II, promoting global transcription of ZGA genes and autoamplification of the MLT2A1 subfamily.

One class of cyclic molecules that has been increasingly sought after is semisaturated cyclic scaffolds, whose specific blend of Csp2- and Csp3-hybridized components confers distinct properties to these species. However, existing methods to construct these scaffolds are limited, often relying on arene saturation or annulations that require lengthy de novo syntheses. Herein, we describe a unified and highly modular couple-close strategy for the synthesis of semisaturated scaffolds. This approach installs bifunctional linkers onto aromatic rings through a range of bond-forming reactions, and subsequent cyclization furnishes semisaturated bicyclic adducts. Key to this approach is a mechanistically distinct cobalt-catalyzed dehydrogenative radical cyclization that proceeds efficiently even on electronically unbiased arenes, enabling a broad substrate scope under mild reaction conditions."
