In many aquifers, groundwater extraction exceeds natural recharge, leading to steady aquifer declines with negative consequences for the social, agricultural and ecological systems that depend on these aquifers. In this article we analyze how in the semi-arid the La Mancha Eastern Aquifer, Spain, organized groundwater users, in close collaboration with knowledge institutes and water authorities, have developed a governance system that ensures aquifer sustainability. Our analysis shows that the use of tempo-spatially explicit data generated through remote sensing technologies co-evolved with the development of a user-based groundwater management institution, and a state agency support framework into an effective co-governance approach for regulating groundwater use in the agricultural sector. This research highlights the importance of socio-technical co-creation for the establishment of effective groundwater governance systems that build on, and are embedded in, user-based organizations that are supported by an enabling institutional environment."

While climate change influences the spatial and temporal patterns of transmission, its exact effect varies due to development efforts and malaria control strategies, which have significantly reduced the incidence. Mapping the decline in incidence over two decades shows the persistence of hotspots (Central India, from the borders of Rajasthan and Gujarat to Odisha, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and eastern Madhya Pradesh, and North–East) and areas of significant reduction. Statistical models used in this study delineate the role of temperature and rainfall (annual, seasonal and variability). Exposure to a minimum rainfall (60–120 mm; IRR = 1.001) and warm temperature (IRR = 1.037) are necessary for transmission, but a 1 °C temperature increase during the summer months leads to a 13% reduction in cases. The variability of the long-term average in temperature contributes to the incidence (IRR = 1.3) but precipitation thwarts (IRR = 0.98). Integrating socioeconomic factors emphasises the vulnerability of historically marginalised social groups (scheduled tribe (ST) individuals) to malaria and an enhanced adaptive capacity due to improved water sources and female education. It curtails the odds of high malaria incidence by 5.6% and 4.7%, respectively. The role of last-mile health access is noted in better reporting. The classification and regression tree (CART) model also recognises ST population, proportion of educated females and access to sanitation as dominant and interacting predictors of malaria prevalence. With the success of micro-level strategies like the DAMaN and Malaria Elimination Demonstration Project, the persistence of (‘tribal’) malaria can be addressed with women’s capacity building, education, and integration with national nutrition schemes for equitable malaria elimination."

Previous studies have largely focused on the influence of climate on vegetation, with insufficient consideration given to feedback effects and time lags. Here, we use leaf area index (LAI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), soil moisture (SM), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) data for 1982‒2023 in global drylands to investigate bidirectional time-lagged causal effects between climate and vegetation. We quantify these causal effects and explore the soil-vegetation-atmospheric moisture coupling strength along climate and tree cover gradients. Our results demonstrate an overall positive effect of SM and a negative effect of VPD on vegetation greening (i.e. LAI and EVI) in global drylands, while the causal effect of VPD (23.7%‒31.6%) is more widespread than that of SM (12.6%‒12.7%). We also find dryland greening depletes SM and replenishes atmospheric moisture, albeit the latter to a lesser extent. The causal effect magnitudes of soil and atmospheric moisture on vegetation decreases with increasing tree cover, while the causal effect of SM on greening shows significantly steeper decline with increasing tree cover (p < 0.001). These findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of dryland vegetation dynamics under a changing climate."

The overarching goal of marine CDR methods is to contribute to offsetting remaining CO2 emissions as a means to stabilize global mean surface air temperature (SAT). However, AU also directly affects ocean heat uptake (OHU) through the upwelling of cold ocean interior water to the surface and the simultaneous backflow of warm surface water into the ocean interior. In this study, we challenge the carbon centered perception of AU. We simulate large-scale AU in an Earth system model of intermediate complexity between the years 2025 and 2100 with and without its direct impact on OHU under low, medium and high future CO2 emission scenarios. Thus, we can quantify the individual contributions of AU-induced carbon and heat effects to changes in global mean SAT. We find the direct impact of AU on OHU to be key for a significant reduction in global mean SAT and the atmosphere’s CO2 concentration under all simulated future CO2 emission pathways. If AU directly impacts OHU, we can attribute only 17% under RCP 2.6 to 27% under RCP 8.5 of the reduction in global mean SAT (−0.17 to −0.27 °C) until the end of the century to the reduction in the atmosphere’s CO2 inventory (−5.9 to −31.2 Pg C). Our findings lead us to challenge the classical view of AU as primarily a marine CDR method. Instead, we propose to consider AU as a method to enhance OHU and thereby reduce global mean SAT, with secondary effects on the carbon cycle that result in some CDR."

This study examined the effects of environmental concerns, feelings of cognitive dissonance and moral disengagement, as well as innovativeness and life satisfaction on PEB among 1646 public officials and citizens from small German municipalities. Public officials, namely mayors and treasurers, are key actors for environmental decisions and serve as role models in those small communities. Hierarchical regression and moderation analysis examined the negative and positive influences of these variables on PEB. The results highlight the pivotal role of emotional factors, especially feelings of cognitive dissonance when failing to act pro-environmentally, with notable differences between public officials and the general public in these small towns. While environmental concerns have a positive impact on PEB, moral disengagement has a negative effect. Innovativeness does not have a significant influence, except when analyzing the subsample of public official sample alone, where it has a positive effect on PEB. These findings highlight the complexity of PEB determinants and emphasize the need for targeted interventions to encourage sustainable practices for decision makers in different settings."

We develop an econometric model employing the instrumental variable (IV) approach to understand the causal impact of previous-year trade on current-year water use. Specifically, our analysis focuses on irrigated area and irrigation water use by water source (surface, groundwater, and total) across states in the CONUS for 2012–13, 2017–18, and 2022–23. We find that at the subnational scale, trade openness reduces groundwater withdrawals during droughts; a unit increase in previous-year trade openness results in a 2%–2.5% and 1.4%–2% reduction in groundwater irrigation withdrawals during 2012–13 and 2022–2023, respectively. This effect is identified as being driven by reductions in irrigated area and shifts towards advanced irrigation technologies. These findings enhance our understanding of how trade influences water use at the subnational scale and may provide helpful insights to policymakers."

We go beyond the virtual water literature that calculates the virtual water content of trade to assess how water use relates to international trade. We develop a suite of econometric regressions to account for the impact of trade liberalizations in a framework that includes standard determinants of countries’ water supply and demand. We focus on the agricultural sector and on the contribution of regional trade agreements (RTAs) to capture the impact of trade liberalizations. We find that more openness to trade due to an increasing number of RTAs may actually reduce total groundwater abstractions, which is qualified by countries’ comparative advantage. We do not find a statistically significant impact of trade on groundwater depletion, which also depends on the recharge rate of aquifers. Our analysis calls for assessing water use in a global world and in a framework that accounts for all the drivers of water use on the demand and supply side, including those behind international trade."

Isoprene is a key biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emitted by select plants, which can impact atmospheric chemistry and climate. Increased temperatures, particularly in high latitudes, may enhance isoprene emissions due to extended growing seasons and heightened plant stress. The research was conducted in Finse, Norway, where isoprene and CO2 fluxes were measured with eddy covariance alongside spectral and meteorological data, and surface temperature. A random forest (RF) model was developed to predict isoprene fluxes, considering the variable importance of different environmental factors. The results showed that surface temperature and CO2 flux were consistently important predictors, across three differential temporal data aggregations (hourly, daily, weekly), while the PRI demonstrated low predictive power, possibly due to the heterogeneous vegetation and variable light conditions. The NDVI was more effective than anticipated, likely linked to phenological changes in vegetation. Model performance varied with temporal resolution, with weekly data achieving the highest predictive accuracy (R2 up to 0.76). The RF model accurately reflected seasonal emission patterns but underestimated short-term peaks, suggesting the potential to combine machine learning with process-based modelling. This research highlights the promise of proxy data from remote sensing for scaling BVOC emission models to regional levels, essential for understanding climate impacts in Arctic ecosystems."

A realist synthesis of ex-post evidence,"To get on track for the rapid emissions reductions required to meet the Paris Agreement temperature goal, we need to understand what climate policies work, under what conditions, and why. In this review, we study how carbon pricing policies lead to emissions reductions and which context factors make each of these mechanisms more or less effective. We systematically review the evidence from 80 ex-post carbon pricing evaluations, covering 21 policy schemes across the globe. Using a realist synthesis methodology we collect 177 hypotheses on how and under what conditions this policy works, clustering hypotheses into nine mechanisms that explain why emission reductions were achieved. We extract 293 evidence statements from the primary studies to evaluate the relevance of each of the mechanisms across different sector and country contexts. We find that in the short term there is evidence that emissions reductions are achieved by a mix of fuel switching, efficiency improvements, downscaling of some emission-intensive activities, and leakage. The prevalence of these mechanisms varies by sector and country. For other emission reduction mechanisms identified in this study, such as low-carbon technology scaling, investments, and research and development activities, there is less robust evidence, suggesting that these need to be further evaluated through longer-term policy evaluations. To gain a rigorous understanding of what climate policies work, under what conditions, and why, we need to make best use of the emerging evidence base using evidence synthesis methods that address policy-relevant research questions."

Large-ensemble simulations show that warming drives distinct seasonal changes: in winter, an intensified ridge over the western U.S. enhances moisture transport to Alaska, increasing precipitation while promoting vegetation growth near the Alaska Range. In summer, rising temperatures intensify the fire weather index signaling greater wildfire potential and increase lightning activity. Although the links among these complex seasonal changes remain difficult to validate, temporal overlap—enhanced vegetation growth followed by more fire-conducive weather, and associated increase in lightning could collectively heighten wildfire risk. The robustness of our large-ensemble simulations provides compelling evidence for these cascading effects. Extreme lightning-driven events, such as the Swan Lake Fire, represent the emerging pattern in Alaska’s evolving fire regime. The concurrent rise in winter wetness and summer fire conditions underscore the urgent need for adaptive fire management strategies that address these interconnected climate drivers."

However, the unprecedented case of Super Typhoon Yagi (2024) challenges this conventional understanding. Using satellite observations, reanalysis datasets, and numerical simulations, we show that a summer marine heatwave (MHW) in the northern SCS played a critical role in fueling Yagi’s rapid intensification and sustaining its super typhoon strength. Notably, the MHW was abruptly dissipated by Yagi’s wind-driven mixing. Further statistical analysis reveals that MHWs may serve as a necessary precondition for super typhoon development in the SCS, providing valuable predictive insights for anticipating future extreme events."

Wind power generation also heavily depends on weather conditions, which affect wind speed. Winter weather in northern Europe is influenced by the polar vortex, a strong westerly wind dominating the wintertime polar stratosphere. The polar vortex can temporarily collapse during sudden stratospheric warming (SSW), which is often followed by cold and windless weather in northern Europe, including Finland. In this paper, we examine the influence of SSWs on wintertime EC and wind power generation in Finland. We show that cold temperature and low wind speed anomalies are more often observed in winters when an SSW happens and the so-called quasi-biennial oscillation of equatorial stratospheric winds is in the easterly phase. These changes are associated with higher EC and lower wind power generation. In contrast, winters without an SSW tend to have warm temperature and high wind speed anomalies, and thus, lower EC and higher wind power generation. When the probability of an SSW event is known, the results of this study show that it is possible to predict winter EC and wind power generation several months in advance."

Results indicate a substantial increase in the duration of dangerous heat stress. By the end of the century, up to 122 million people, or around 44 of the population may experience dangerous heat stress for more than 5 of the time annually (i.e. ∼18 days), compared to 1 of the population or around 1 million people for the period 2005–2016. Up to 28 of the population (∼78 million people) would even experience dangerous heat for 15 of the time (i.e. ∼55 days). 66 of this increased population exposure can be attributed to the combined effect of increasing temperatures and total population in the region.

To inform electricity pricing design, techno-economic optimization modeling can help identify which pricing structures most effectively support the economic viability of electrification across different building characteristics and modeled EV plug-in behavior over the long term. In this paper, we explore the interplay between EV plug-in behavior, building energy system investment decisions, and electricity pricing design, testing electricity tariffs with varying energy and grid components. Using a comprehensive techno-economic optimization framework, we analyze how various combinations of energy and grid charges impact HP adoption across six diverse Swiss residential buildings from 2025 to 2050. We incorporate three distinct EV plug-in behavior scenarios modeled from real-world travel data. Our findings reveal that time-of-use energy charges consistently lead to the highest HP adoption rates across all building types, outperforming both flat and hourly energy pricing structures. Among grid charges, increasing block charges generally support heating electrification more effectively than peak or volumetric charges. Building characteristics substantially affect HP adoption, while EV plug-in behavior has more impact on the choice of charging infrastructure. Overall, our results show the importance of coordinated electricity tariff designs that account for the diversity of building characteristics and user behaviors to enable cost-effective electrification."

Our results show that TCs contribute 0.019–0.024 TW annually to global NIWP, with nearly 45% of this in low-latitude oceans. Moreover, a notable NIW-induced enhancement in thermocline mixing during TC events is identified in subtropical regions, particularly in the northwestern Pacific, based on fine-scale parameterization.

This scoping review systematically maps empirical research on the association between SIs and PEB based on 82 studies. Most studies utilized quantitative-descriptive designs and self-report measures, assessing a wide range of specific SIs and various types of PEBs. Eight categories of SIs based on their content were identified, spanning SIs referring to the environment, specific groups, or places, with most showing positive associations with PEB. To gain a clearer understanding of these categories, they can be further grouped based on two criteria: (1) whether the SIs refer to an external environment (e.g. a specific place) or a social group of people (e.g. an activist group), and (2) whether the SIs have an obvious link to the environment and/or environmental issues (e.g. environmental identity) or not (e.g. national identity). This review emphasizes the importance of focusing on single SI categories to delve deeper into the mechanisms and potential variations within and between the categories. It also recommends future research to improve the practical applicability of these findings as most studies relied on self-report measures, and few were conducted in real-world settings.

To increase the accuracy of the emission rate calculations and harmonize the dataset, the methodology was evaluated through six controlled methane release experiments demonstrating an uncertainty lower than 30 %, following several recommendations. 
 The increasing number of biogas plants in Germany and Europe necessitate an appropriate strategy to quantify potential methane (CH4) losses to ensure the sustainability of renewable energy production. In addition to high uncertainties in emission factors, there is little information on the temporal variation in CH4 emissions from biogas plants. In this study, long-term measurements of CH4 emission rates at a biogas plant in Heidelberg, Germany, were performed over a period of 8 years using mobile measurements combined with a Gaussian plume model (GPM). To increase the accuracy of the emission rate calculations and harmonize the dataset, the methodology was evaluated through six controlled methane release experiments. The results of these experiments demonstrated that our method exhibits an uncertainty lower than 30 %, provided that the following recommendations are followed: wind and solar radiation should be measured on site, at least 10 transects should be driven at low speeds, and a minimum distance of 20 m should be maintained from the emission source. By integrating these improvements into long-term monitoring practices at a biogas plant in Heidelberg, we present a comprehensive and consistent dataset of mobile measurements from 26 campaigns. The data revealed only low temporal variations in CH4 emission rates, which is probably due to the continuous operation of the biogas plant with stable procedures. Notably, the average CH4 emission rate was 5.9 ± 0.5 kg CH4 h−1. The successful integration of data acquired over 8 years through multiple measurement setups increases the reliability of the dataset, providing valuable insights into methane emissions from biogas plants."

The evaluation results show that the CDR has long-term consistency and continuity, and is more accurate than other similar products in climate covariability, suggesting that the CDR is suitable for climate change research and for constraining climate model simulations. 
 We developed a climate data record (CDR) of atmospheric column water vapor (CWV) and sea surface temperature (SST) under oceanic rain-free conditions using over two decades of observational records from three satellite instruments: the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), the MicroWave Radiation Imager (MWRI), and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2 (AMSR2). The AMSR-E and AMSR2 satellites operated in near-stable orbits, while the MWRI experienced orbital drifts of nearly 1 h during its operational period. The CWV and SST products were retrieved from well-recalibrated level-1 brightness temperatures observed by common channels with the same frequencies on these instruments, designed for measuring these properties. Adjustments for diurnal drifting errors caused by orbital drift were applied to MWRI data using a semi-physical model developed in previous studies. The combination of prior recalibration and diurnal drift adjustment ensured inter-satellite consistency in the CDRs. Compared to in-situ radiosonde and buoy observations, the biases and root mean square errors of the CDRs are within 0.1 and 4.4 mm for CWV, and 0.2 and 1.6 K for SST, respectively. Long-term trends of the retrieved CWV and SST align with observations from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and the Global Tropical Moored Buoy Array (GTMBA) products. The global oceanic trends of CWV and SST were 0.39 mm per decade and 0.16 K per decade, respectively, over the period 2002–2022. Inter-consistency between CWV and SST, as well as layer-mean temperatures derived from satellite microwave sounder observations, was examined and compared with climate model simulations from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). It was found that the trend ratio of the retrieved CWV to SST was 9.9 % K−1 in the tropics, which closely aligns with CMIP6 models. These validation results indicate that the presented CDR has high accuracy and is suitable for long-term climate change research.

This platform produces CRA-LICOM, a high-frequency atmospheric and oceanic gravity de-aliasing product with a 6-hourly, 50 km resolution covering 2002–2024 globally. This product is reliable for de-aliasing, signal separation in satellite gravity missions, and climate change studies. 
 Modeling sub-daily mass changes, dominated by the atmosphere and the oceans, is a fundamental requirement for nearly all existing terrestrial or space-borne geodetic observations to perform signal separation. Removing these high-frequency mass changes, through the usage of so-called de-aliasing products, is of particular interest for satellite gravity missions such as GRACE and GRACE-FO to prevent the aliasing of short-term mass changes into seasonal and long-term mass variability. Ongoing efforts focus on simulating this high-frequency signal by driving atmospheric/oceanic numerical models with specific climate-forcing fields and assimilating observational data. In this study, we establish China's first de-aliasing computation platform, achieved by using the recently released CRA-40 (China's first generation of atmospheric reanalysis) as forcing fields to drive our in-house 3-D atmospheric integration model and the LASG/IAP (State Key Laboratory of Numerical Modeling for Atmospheric Sciences and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics/Institute of Atmospheric Physics) Climate System Ocean Model 3.0 (LICOM3.0). With this new platform, we reproduce an alternative high-frequency atmospheric and oceanic gravity de-aliasing product, called CRA-LICOM, at 6 hourly and 50 km resolution, covering 2002–2024 at a global scale. The product is freely available at https://doi.org/10.11888/SolidEar.tpdc.302016 (Liu et al., 2025a). Inter-comparisons with the products of GFZ (Helmholtz Centre for Geosciences) and validations against independent observations reveal: (i) the current version of CRA-LICOM satisfies the requirement of the state-of-the-art satellite gravity missions, as well as other geodetic measurements, and (ii) despite agreement across most areas, considerable uncertainty is found at marginal seas near continental shelves, particularly at high-latitude regions. Therefore, scientific applications that aim to understand the sub-daily atmospheric-oceanic water exchange, as well as mission design of future satellite gravity that seeks accurate gravity de-aliasing, can use our product as a reliable source. Nevertheless, the current platform has the potential to be improved in terms of modeling and data assimilation capacity, which will be outlined in this study."

We encourage using the open Library as a foundation for further spectral analysis and modelling and we support future soil health assessments via spectroscopy. 
 The rise in demand for soil data and information calls for quick and cost-effective methodologies to quantify soil properties. This is particularly important in the realm of restoring soil health in Europe. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has demonstrated the ability to predict specific soil properties with high accuracy whilst being less costly and time-consuming than traditional methods. To fill gaps in national spectroscopic soil data, we compiled the first Austrian NIR Soil Spectral Library (680–2500 nm) based on legacy samples (n = 2129), covering all environmental zones of Austria. We then applied partial least square regression modelling to test the usability of the dataset for soil health assessments at its current stage. Our analysis revealed that, at the present time, the Austrian NIR Soil Spectral Library is not suitable to predict most of the 14 soil properties with sufficient accuracy. Nevertheless, total nitrogen, CaCO3organic carbon and clay showed satisfactory results (R2 > 0.7). Most importantly, the dataset containing sample meta-data (e.g., land use type, environmental zone or zip code), laboratory reference values and NIR spectra with 1 nm resolution can be used as a foundation for further spectral analysis and modelling.

M. van Dijk;Ehsan Forootan,PyGLDA: a fine-scale python-based global land data assimilation system for integrating satellite gravity data into hydrological models,"Satellite gravimetry enables direct measurement of total water storage (TWS), a capability that was previously unattainable. In this study, we present an open-source land data assimilation system with global hydrological model, which temporally, vertically, and laterally dis-aggregates satellite-based TWS. This study provides a practical framework establishing operational water management with current and future satellite gravity missions. 
 Data assimilation (DA) of time-variable satellite gravity observations, such as those from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO), and future gravity missions, can be used to constrain simulations of the vertical sum of water storage in Global Hydrological Models (GHMs). However, current DA implementations of these Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) changes are often performed at regional scales or, if applied globally, at low spatial resolutions. This limitation is primarily due to the high computational demands of DA and numerical challenges, such as instabilities in covariance matrix inversion. To fully exploit the potential of satellite gravity observations and the high spatial resolution of GHMs, we developed PyGLDA, an open-source Python-based system that enables fine-scale and computationally efficient global DA. The key innovations of PyGLDA include (1) a global patch-wise DA approach using domain localization and neighboring-weighted global aggregation and (2) seamless compatibility between basin-scale and grid-scale DA implementations. PyGLDA represents a significant functional improvement over previous DA systems, offering wide-ranging and flexible options for user-specific applications. The modular structure of the system allows users to customize water storage compartments, modify observation representations, and potentially select different GHMs. This paper provides a comprehensive description of PyGLDA and its application in a case study of the Danube River Basin, along with a demonstration of global DA, where experiments involve integrating monthly GRACE TWS fields (2002–2010) with the daily W3RA water balance model at 0.1° spatial resolution."

Pusok;Richard F. Katz,Models of buoyancy-driven dykes using continuum  plasticity or fracture mechanics: a comparison,"Magmatic dykes transport magma to the Earth's surface, sometimes causing eruptions. We advanced a model of dyking, treating it as plastic deformation in a porous medium, unlike the classic model that treats dykes as fractures in elastic solids. Comparing the two, we found the plastic model aligns with the fracture model in dyke speed and energy consumption, despite quantitative differences. This new method could be a powerful tool for understanding volcanic processes during tectonic activity. 
 Magmatic dykes play an important role in the thermomechanics of tectonic rifting of the lithosphere. Our understanding of this role is limited by the lack of models that consistently capture the interaction between magmatism, including dyking, and tectonic deformation. While linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) has provided a basis for understanding the mechanics of dykes, it is difficult to consistently incorporate LEFM into geodynamic models. Here we further develop a continuum theory that represents dykes as plastic tensile failure in a two-phase Stokes–Darcy model with a poro-viscoelastic–viscoplastic (poro-VEVP) rheological law (Li et al., 2023). We validate this approach by making quantitative comparison with LEFM, enabled by a novel formulation for buoyancy-driven porous dykes (poro-LEFM). The comparison shows that dykes in our continuum theory propagate slowly – a consequence of Darcian drag on the magma. Moreover, dissipation of mechanical energy in the poro-VEVP model implies a high critical stress intensity in LEFM. We improve the poro-VEVP model by reformulating the compaction stress and incorporating anisotropic permeability in regions of plastic failure."

Aubry;Matthew Toohey;Pablo Ortega;Vladimir Lapin;Etienne Tourigny,The sensitivity of EC-Earth3 decadal predictions to the choice of volcanic forcing dataset: insights for the next major eruption,"Large volcanic eruptions are unpredictable and can have significant climatic impacts. If one occurs, operational decadal forecasts will become invalid and must be rerun including the volcanic forcing. By analyzing the climate response in EC-Earth3 retrospective predictions, we show that idealised forcings produced with two simple models could be used in operational decadal forecasts to account for the radiative impacts of the next major volcanic eruption. 
 Large volcanic eruptions can have significant impacts on climate. Due to their unpredictable nature, when a major volcanic eruption occurs, decadal forecasts issued prior to the eruption will be inaccurate. Consequently, new decadal forecasts including updated estimates of the stratospheric sulfate aerosol evolution must be produced. To rapidly generate such volcanic forcing once the initial eruption characteristics are known, the Easy Volcanic Aerosol (EVA) forcing generator, and its updated version EVA_H, can be used. Comparing the volcanic forcings generated with these tools and the one from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 for the recent eruptions of Mount Agung (1963), El Chichón (1982) and Mount Pinatubo (1991), we identify some differences in the magnitude and latitudinal structure, particularly for the eruptions of Mount Agung and El Chichón. Using these forcings, we conduct a set of retrospective prediction experiments for these eruptions with the Barcelona Supercomputing Center decadal forecast system, following a specifically designed protocol. The predictions driven by the three forcing datasets show similar post-eruption radiative responses, with particularly good agreement for the eruption of Mount Pinatubo. The global mean top-of-atmosphere flux and global mean surface temperature responses in the hindcast experiments are indistinguishable across the three forcing sets and three eruptions. However, we find differences in the zonal mean and regional responses due to the latitudinally-varying structure of the volcanic forcings, particularly for the eruptions of Mount Agung and El Chichón. Significant differences among the datasets are found in the global mean lower stratospheric warming, where the responses are strongest. Comparing the predicted anomalies in these hindcasts with observations we show that overall there is better agreement when volcanic forcing is included, highlighting its importance to accurate predictions. Our study suggests that either EVA and EVA_H forcings can be used for predicting the post-volcanic radiative response, although the generated forcing datasets and simulations should be interpreted with care given the limitations of these reduced-complexity empirical models."

 The copper-catalysed functionalization of aryl halides is one of the most preferred methods for the formation of carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds.1 Yet, the redox behaviour of the copper species in the catalytic cycle remains elusive and a subject of considerable debate.2 We report experimental and theoretical mechanistic investigations into the reaction of a well-defined Cu(I) complex with an electron-poor aryl iodide, which leads to the formation of an isolable Cu(III)−aryl complex, that subsequently reductively eliminates to forge a C(sp2)−CF3 bond. Our integrated experimental and theoretical findings indicate that the process proceeds through a redox sequence of Cu(I)/Cu(III)/Cu(II)/Cu(III)/Cu(I). Additionally, we managed to interrupt this sequence by temperature control and captured the reactivity of the copper species through various spectroscopic methods, facilitating in-depth mechanistic analysis. These findings shed light on the intricate behaviour of copper species and challenge the traditional mechanistic proposal for the reaction of Cu(I) with aryl iodide, thus providing fresh perspectives into the mechanistic aspect of the copper-catalysed coupling reactions."

 Forest soils hold the largest terrestrial carbon pool, derived from dead plant tissues and transformed by soil biota. Current frameworks emphasize the role of soil microbes in highly persistent forms of carbon. However, moderately persistent forms of carbon also contribute substantially to forest soil carbon pools through the iterative effects of plant litter inputs and outputs over multi-decadal timescales. These sources of soil carbon are not well constrained. Here we synthesize published field data of the finest roots (absorptive roots) of mycorrhizal woody plants across major forest ecosystem types in the Northern Hemisphere. We estimate that, owing to fast turnover and slow decomposition, the iterative effects of absorptive roots on soil carbon accrual generate 2.4 ± 0.1 MgC ha−1 over two decades, exceeding that of leaves by 65%. Further, roots associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi contribute 43% more soil carbon than roots associated with ectomycorrhizal fungi, despite ectomycorrhizal forests dominating soil carbon storage in forest soils overall. We also find that specific root length, a readily measured trait, can be used as a proxy for iterative effects associated with root dynamics. Our findings thus provide a long-needed belowground metric for carbon modelling in the Earth system.

Santoro,Minor contribution of ammonia oxidizers to inorganic carbon fixation in the ocean,"Ammonia oxidizers contribute minimally to carbon fixation in the dark ocean despite their abundance at depth, according to enzyme inhibition experiments on water samples from two cruises. 
 Ammonia-oxidizing archaea are the most abundant chemolithoautotrophs in the ocean and are assumed to dominate carbon fixation below the sunlit surface layer. However, the supply of reduced nitrogen delivered from the surface in sinking particulate organic matter is insufficient to support the amount of nitrification required to sustain measured carbon fixation rates in the dark ocean. Here we attempt to reconcile this observed discrepancy by quantifying the contribution of ammonia oxidizers to dark carbon fixation in the eastern tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean. We used phenylacetylene—a specific inhibitor of the ammonia monooxygenase enzyme—to selectively inhibit ammonia oxidizers in samples collected throughout the water column (60–600 m depth). We show that, despite their high abundances, ammonia oxidizers contribute only a small fraction to dark carbon fixation, accounting for 4–25% of the total depth-integrated rates in the eastern tropical Pacific. The highest contributions were observed within the upper mesopelagic zone (120–175 m depth), where ammonia oxidation could account for ~50% of dark carbon fixation at some stations. Our results challenge the current view that carbon fixation in the dark ocean is primarily sustained by nitrification and suggest that other microbial metabolisms, including heterotrophy, might play a larger role than previously assumed.

 PBK/TOPK is a mitotic kinase implicated in haematological and non-haematological cancers. Here we show that the key haemopoietic regulators Ikaros and Aiolos require PBK-mediated phosphorylation to dissociate from chromosomes in mitosis. Eviction of Ikaros is rapidly reversed by addition of the PBK-inhibitor OTS514, revealing dynamic regulation by kinase and phosphatase activities. To identify more PBK targets, we analysed loss of mitotic phosphorylation events in Pbk–/– preB cells and performed proteomic comparisons on isolated mitotic chromosomes. Among a large pool of C2H2-zinc finger targets, PBK is essential for evicting the CCCTC-binding protein CTCF and zinc finger proteins encoded by Ikzf1, Ikzf3, Znf131 and Zbtb11. PBK-deficient cells were able to divide but showed altered chromatin accessibility and nucleosome positioning consistent with CTCF retention.

Here, Xu et al. identify more than 45 diseases linked to marrow adiposity in over 48,000 people, including causal roles in musculoskeletal disease. 
 Bone marrow adiposity changes in diverse diseases, but the full scope of these, and whether they are directly influenced by marrow adiposity, remains unknown. To address this, we previously measured the bone marrow fat fraction of the femoral head, total hip, femoral diaphysis, and spine of over 48,000 UK Biobank participants. Here, we first use these data for PheWAS to identify diseases associated with marrow adiposity at each site. This reveals associations with 47 incident diseases across 12 disease categories, including osteoporosis, fracture, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and other conditions that burden public health worldwide. Intriguingly, type 2 diabetes associates positively with spine bone marrow adiposity but negatively with marrow adiposity at femoral sites. We then establish PRSs based on bone-marrow-fat-fraction-associated SNPs and use PRS-PheWAS and Mendelian randomization to explore causal associations between marrow adiposity and disease. PRS-PheWAS reveals that genetic predisposition to increased marrow adiposity is positively associated with osteoporosis and fractures. Mendelian randomization further suggests that increased marrow adiposity at the diaphysis and total hip is causally associated with osteoporosis. Our findings substantially advance understanding of how marrow adiposity impacts human health and highlight its potential as a biomarker and/or therapeutic target for diverse human diseases.

Here the authors report a well-preserved, late surviving megaraptoran from Argentina that clarifies our understanding of the morphology of this group and potentially provides insights into its diet and feeding strategies. 
 Recent fossil discoveries have cast considerable light on the palaeobiology of Megaraptora, a group of large-clawed carnivorous theropod dinosaurs known from Cretaceous deposits in Asia, Australia, and especially South America. Nevertheless, many important aspects of megaraptoran morphology and evolution remain poorly understood, due in large part to the fragmentary nature of most fossils of these theropods and the scarcity of anatomically overlapping skeletal elements among the known taxa. Here we report a previously unknown megaraptoran genus and species represented by a partially articulated partial skeleton recovered from an uppermost Cretaceous stratum of the Lago Colhué Huapi Formation of south-central Chubut Province in central Patagonia, Argentina. Pertaining to the derived megaraptoran subclade Megaraptoridae, the taxon is among the most completely represented and latest-surviving megaraptorans. Its stratigraphic occurrence indicates that these dinosaurs likely persisted to the Cretaceous/Palaeogene boundary; moreover, the preservation of a crocodyliform humerus between the dentaries of the new theropod may provide information on megaraptoran dietary preferences and feeding strategies. Megaraptorids appear to have been the apex predators in central and southern Patagonian palaeoecosystems approaching the end of the Cretaceous, in contrast to more northerly areas of South America where these niches were occupied by other non-avian theropod groups.

 Access to water is crucial for all aspects of life. Anthropogenic global warming is projected to disrupt the hydrological cycle, leading to water scarcity. However, the timing and hotspot regions of unprecedented water scarcity are unknown. Here, we estimate the Time of First Emergence (ToFE) of drought-driven water scarcity events, referred to as “Day Zero Drought” (DZD), which arises from hydrological compound extremes, including prolonged rainfall deficits, reduced river flow, and increasing water consumption. Using a probabilistic framework and a large ensemble of climate simulations, we attribute the timing and likelihood of DZD events to human influence. Many regions, including major reservoirs, may face high risk of DZD by the 2020s and 2030s. Despite model and scenario uncertainties, consistent DZD hotspots emerge across the Mediterranean, southern Africa, and parts of North America. Urban populations are particularly vulnerable at the 1.5 °C warming level. The length of time between successive DZD events is shorter than the duration of DZD, limiting recovery periods and exacerbating water scarcity risks. Therefore, more proactive water strategies are urgently needed to avoid severe societal impacts of DZD.

Here, authors identify a population of spinal galanin-expressing neurons that regulate sexual arousal and mating in male mice, revealing a broader role for spinal circuits in copulation than previously acknowledged. 
 During sex, male arousal builds to the ejaculatory threshold, allowing genital sensory input to trigger ejaculation. While copulation and arousal are thought to be brain-regulated, ejaculation is a reflex controlled by a spinal circuit. In this framework, the spinal cord is assumed to be strongly inhibited by descending input until the ejaculatory threshold, playing no role in the regulation of copulatory behavior. However, this remains untested. Here we mapped the spinal circuit controlling the bulbospongiosus muscle, essential for sperm expulsion in mice. Our findings show that bulbospongiosus muscle-motor neurons receive input from galanin-expressing neurons, which integrate genital sensory signals. Stimulating these neurons induces bulbospongiosus activity, but responses vary with spinalization, internal state, and decrease with repeated stimulation. Ablating galanin-positive neurons altered ejaculation latency and copulatory patterns. These results suggest that spinal circuits influence not only ejaculation but also copulation and arousal, challenging the traditional view of spinal control in copulation. The precise role of the spinal cord in copulatory behavior remains not fully understood.

Here the authors show that these fires delay the formation of snow cover in the Arctic, which will be exacerbated under future warming due to increases in burned areas. 
 Wildland fires in seasonally snow-covered areas can have lasting effects on both the snowpack and carbon stocks. Here, using long-term satellite data, we show that from 1982 to 2018, the burned area in the Arctic has significantly increased, while the duration of snow cover has significantly decreased. An XGBoost machine learning model and causal analysis confirmed the role of wildland fires in delaying snow cover formation, with this effect strongly linked to fire-induced reductions in albedo and increases in temperature. In addition, we observed a delay of more than 5 days in snow cover formation following major wildland fires. Looking ahead, our projections under a high-emissions scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway, SSP 5-8.5) indicate that the burned area could increase by a factor of 2.6 and the annual mean snow cover duration could decrease by nearly 18 days between 2015 and 2100 compared with the historical average. Wildland fires are becoming more frequent in high-latitude regions. Here the authors show that these fires delay the formation of snow cover in the Arctic, which will be exacerbated under future warming due to increases in burned areas."

 Over the past four decades, seasonal snow cover has declined rapidly in temperate alpine regions. However, the fine-scale dynamics of snowmelt preceding the ongoing warming period remain largely unknown, limiting our understanding of the long-term influence of past snow cover on alpine ecosystems. Here we rely upon the spatial similarities in melt-out patterns and a temperature-based model of fractional snow cover area, to reconstruct fine-scale snow cover changes over the past 250 years in instrumented catchments of the southwestern Alps. We provide evidence that, until the 1980s, prolonged snow cover in many late-lying snowfields delayed ecosystem development and explain why current vegetation cover, soil organic matter content, and mineral weathering are significantly lower in these areas than in surrounding ecosystems. These findings highlight the long-term legacy of snow cover on alpine landscapes and underscore the need to re-evaluate its effects on ecosystem structure, functioning, and responsiveness to ongoing changes.

 Tropical peatlands storing ∼18–25 % of global peat volume contribute significantly to the global carbon cycle. To balance preservation and protection of tropical peatlands requires assessment of their ecohydrological conditions and continuous monitoring through seasons. This is challenging to achieve using in situ sampling, but there is a great promise to use C-band Sentinel-1 data for this due to its weather-independence, and particularly its increased acquisition capacity and spatial/temporal resolution compared to L- and P-band current sensors. Acknowledging that Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) Interferometry using C-Band Sentinel-1 data has been shown previously to be useful for retrieving peatland surface displacement, but also that the amplitude and phase of the SAR signal are dependent on surface hydrology; there remains a critical question about the extent to which the efficacy of SBAS approaches is themselves sensitive to surface hydrological conditions. This is a particular methodological concern in tropical peatlands due to the dynamically changing hydrological conditions arising from significant rainfall events, which can cause groundwater level (GWL) to vary from 1 m to −2 m. The research area was situated in lowland Central Kalimantan (Indonesia) using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations from the 2017–2022 period. We used SBAS-derived ground displacements and compared to groundwater level (GWL) and peat surface elevation acquired from local networks of monitoring sites. Our work shows that the prevailing hydrological condition affects the area efficacy of the SBAS approach using C-band SAR data. When surface water significantly floods above the ground surface during the wet season, the coherence is not sustained for a long time. This is the opposite of the dry season, when coherence is preserved in longer intervals between acquisitions. Additionally, the range of correlation values between SBAS-derived displacements and in-situ peat surface and ground water table measurements is higher for the dry season than for the wet and whole hydrological year. We show that the SBAS approach can retrieve surface displacement for 34.4 % to 59.8 % on the peat soils of the tested area (391 to 826 km2), excluding areas of dense forests and open water, due to C-band SAR limitations, i.e. volume scattering mechanism and/or loss of signal coherence on water bodies. We show that appropriate hydrological conditions must be met to determine the change in water level above the ground surface. Too large fluctuations in water level may not be detected because of wavelength limitations, and outliers from the assumed linear model may be filtered out or removed due to the specific properties of this approach. These findings underpin the application of Sentinel-1C-band SAR for monitoring tropical peatlands' ecohydrological conditions."

 Long-term time series of global leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (FAPAR) are required for characterizing vegetation dynamics in global change studies. The recently developed Copernicus Land Monitoring Service GEOV2-CLMS products were demonstrated to outperform other existing LAI and FAPAR products in terms of completeness, temporal smoothness, consistency across variables and accuracy. However, these GEOV2-CLMS products are derived from the SPOT/VGT and PROBA-V constellation with temporal coverage from 1999 to 2020 which limits its applicability for global change studies. We present here an adaptation of the GEOV2-CLMS algorithm to AVHRR to extend these time series and generate long-term global vegetation products from July 1981 to December 2022. The GEOV2-AVHRR algorithm was specifically designed to maximize the temporal consistency over the successive AVHRR sensors on board NOAA and MetOp-B satellites while keeping high agreement with GEOV2-CLMS products. Neural networks first transform AVHRR surface reflectance into LAI and FAPAR values at the daily time step. The daily estimates are then filtered, smoothed, gap filled and composited every 10-day.GEOV2-AVHRR showed accuracy error between −0.2 and 0.3 LAI and ∼ −0.03 FAPAR and uncertainty <1 LAI and ∼ 0.10–0.15 for woody and non-woody sites of both DIRECT2.1 and GBOV V3 datasets. GEOV2-AVHRR agreed well with GEOV2-CLMS (MODIS): 92 % (76 %) of land pixels are within ±max(20 %, 0.5) LAI and 71 % (34 %) within ±max(10 %, 0.05) FAPAR uncertainty requirements. The gap filling and temporal filters applied in GEOV2-AVHRR proved effective in improving the completeness (only 1 % of missing data) and temporal precision (smoothness) of LAI and FAPAR time series as compared to MODIS. The intra-annual consistency of GEOV2-AVHRR highly agree with GEOV2-CLMS, indicating it is mostly driven by the algorithm. On the contrary, the inter-annual consistency of LAI and FAPAR datasets appears to be very sensitive to the consistency of the input surface reflectance. GEOV2-AVHRR showed high stability as evaluated with MODIS LAI/FAPAR and improves the stability of GEOV2-CLMS. Some residual inter-annual inconsistencies from the transition to sensors are observed for GEOV2-AVHRR as well as for other long term AVHRR datasets (i.e. GIMMS, GLASS and C3S). GEOV2-AVHRR shows overall greening trends in ∼70 % (∼50 % significant at p < 0.05) of land pixels, and the magnitude and spatial pattern of trends highly agree with those of GIMMS."

 With the rapid advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT), sensor technologies, and remote sensing, spatiotemporal data has emerged as a crucial data source across diverse industries, extensively utilized in environmental monitoring, intelligent transportation, socio-economic analysis, and other domains. Spatiotemporal data encompasses the locations, states, and interrelationships of objects within specific temporal and spatial contexts. It is characterized by dynamic properties, high dimensionality, and large data volumes, which pose significant challenges for storage, querying, and analysis. To address the challenges associated with managing large-scale spatiotemporal data, geospatial grid subdivision, grid encoding, grid indexing, and grid storage technologies offer essential support and have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness. In the past, existing reviews have typically focused on a single aspect, such as the fundamental methods of grid subdivision, the implementation details of encoding and indexing techniques, or solely on spatiotemporal databases. Although these reviews provide in-depth discussions of specific technologies, they lack a systematic analysis of the interrelationships among multiple technical modules, resulting in an inability to fully reveal the collaborative potential between modules. Additionally, current research provides limited comprehensive discussions on grid indexing technologies. This paper aims to address this gap by providing a systematic review of the development status of grid indexing technologies. Furthermore, it reviews and summarizes the key technologies, interrelationships, research advancements, and future directions of grid subdivision, grid encoding, grid indexing, and grid storage, thereby providing references for enhancing the storage and querying efficiency of spatiotemporal data."

 Opuntia stricta is a globally widespread invasive species that degrades dryland ecosystems and threatens pastoral livelihoods. Accurate, high-resolution distribution maps are essential for effective management, but its spectral similarity to native vegetation complicates remote sensing-based classification. We developed an interpretable Random Forest model, incorporating SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to map Opuntia stricta and co-occurring land cover types at 10  m resolution across heterogeneous arid and semi-arid lands in Laikipia County, Kenya. The model integrated monthly Sentinel-2 imagery, climate, topographic, landscape structural, and anthropogenic factors. Field surveys were combined with manual labeling using Google Maps and Street View to address annotation gaps in remote areas. Grid-based spatial blocking at multiple scales was used to reduce spatial autocorrelation and assess generalizability. The multi-temporal model achieved 0.91 overall accuracy and an F1-score of 0.92 for Opuntia stricta on the spatial validation set (100 m grid), and 0.86 accuracy with an F1-score of 0.85 on the independent test set, substantially outperforming single-month models (accuracy: 0.62–0.79; F1: 0.67–0.82), with February identified as the most informative single-time window. SHAP analysis identified July precipitation, population density and nighttime land surface temperatures as top predictors, linking invasion patterns to dry-season aridity, wet-season rainfall, and warm night conditions, underscoring the role of climate seasonality and human activity in shaping detectability and distribution. Invasion hotspots were concentrated near Dol-Dol and in degraded group ranches, with lower levels on private ranches and conservancies. Our findings highlight the potential of multi-temporal, context-integrated remote sensing for targeted invasive species management in dryland ecosystems."

 Semantic segmentation of satellite imagery plays a vital role in applications such as sustainable development, agriculture, forestry, urban planning, and climate change monitoring.

The objective is to identify the most effective model for classifying satellite images into eight land cover categories: built-up areas, roads, water bodies, agricultural land, shrubland, forest, grassland, and others. A high-resolution dataset with corresponding segmentation masks was developed to support this analysis and serve as a resource for future research. Preprocessing steps included normalization and data augmentation techniques such as vertical and horizontal flipping and random brightness adjustments. Experimental results indicate that UNet with the Xception backbone, LinkNet with ResNet152, DeepLabV3+ with the Xception backbone, and AE-DeepLabV3+ with the Xception backbone achieved Dice coefficients of 85.7%, 86.7%, 90.4%, and 91.3%, respectively.

 The rapid urbanization of urban riverbank soft ground poses significant geotechnical challenges, particularly in densely populated coastal areas like the Yangtze River Delta. This study employs an enhanced multi-temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) approach to reveal decadal deformation patterns (2015–2024) in soft ground along the Yangtze River in Nanjing, China. Leveraging 275 Sentinel-1 SAR images and improved data processing strategies, we reconstruct the subsidence dynamics and validate them against leveling measurements with an accuracy of 6.5 mm/a. Results reveal that while the overall Nanjing’s urban riverbank remains stable, localized deformations are concentrated in urban riverbank development zones: Jiangbei New Area (JBA) and Hexi New Town (HXT). The highest intensity of development in JBA shows a cumulative settlement of more than 600 mm over ten years. The soft ground deformation is driven by engineering activities, specifically (i) groundwater drawdown during foundation pit dewatering and (ii) consolidation under surcharge loads from riverbank urban infrastructure. The earlier-developed HXT provides a valuable reference for predicting surface deformation trends in JBA. Furthermore, decadal InSAR deformation analyses of critical urban riverbank infrastructure (river-crossing bridges) confirm the effectiveness of bedrock anchoring in mitigating soft ground settlement. Wavelet analyses reveal that temperature fluctuations primarily drive cyclic displacement in the metal truss main spans of the Beijing-Shanghai High-Speed Railway Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge. This work demonstrates the decisive influence of anthropogenic activities in accelerating subsidence and reveals the efficacy of InSAR in supporting adaptive risk mitigation strategies.

 Earth science data exhibit inherent complexity characterized by heterogeneous spatiotemporal attributes, high collinearity among variables, and diverse input formats. Despite rapid advancements in deep learning, geographic modeling lacks unified frameworks for integrating heterogeneous spatiotemporal data and diverse factor types. While Mamba architecture has demonstrated efficiency in large language models, computer vision and remote sensing, its applicability to geographic modeling remains unexplored. This study introduces Geo-Mamba, a novel framework addressing these challenges through three key innovations. First, we propose a systematic geographical factor classification method that categorizes elements into dynamic, static, and categorical factors, enabling standardized integration of heterogeneous data within a unified paradigm. Second, we design a selective encoder module based on Mamba architecture that leverages its linear complexity and scanning mechanism to establish selective state spaces for geographical inputs, revealing intricate associations between diverse feature types. Third, we incorporate Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layers as intermediate components replacing multilayer perceptron linear layers, enhancing numerical regression accuracy in geographical applications. Experimental validation across three tasks demonstrates Geo-Mamba’s effectiveness: in net ecosystem exchange modeling (R2 = 0.92, RMSE = 0.37 μmol·m–2·s–1), groundwater storage anomaly downscaling (R2 = 0.95, RMSE = 1.916 cm), and land cover classification (accuracy = 88.12 %, F1-Score = 84.27 %).

 Emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from on-road vehicle fleets were investigated through tunnel tests conducted in 2014 and 2019 in Guangzhou, China, to assess the impacts of upgraded vehicle emission standards and changing fleet composition. The emission factors of PM2.5-bound PAHs (four-ring and above) significantly decreased by 76.4 %, from 45.22 to 10.66 μg km−1 veh−1 during this period. Although the diesel fleet share fell by ∼75 % from 13.0 % to 3.3 %, diesel vehicles remained the dominant source of PAHs, exhibiting emission factors 9–50 times higher than gasoline vehicles. Notably, emissions of some 5- and 6-ring PAHs declined much less and even increased, suggesting that non-exhaust emissions, particularly tire wear, have become increasingly significant sources of PAHs. The overall toxicity, expressed in terms of toxic equivalency quotients (TEQBaP), declined by 66.7 %, yet benzo[a]pyrene consistently dominated total toxicity (69–74 %). Persistent nocturnal emission risks associated with diesel-dominated freight traffic highlight the need for targeted emission control policies. These results reveal the effectiveness of stringent regulatory measures in reducing vehicle exhaust emissions and stress the emerging importance of mitigating non-exhaust emission sources in urban pollution control strategies."

 On 21 July 2021, extreme rainfall hit central and northern Henan, China, with Xinxiang recording an hourly rainfall of 149.9 mm and 10-h accumulations exceeding 400 mm (the 7.21 Xinxiang rainstorm). This rainstorm, a critical episode in the “21·7” Henan rainstorm event occurring one day after the high-impact 7.20 Zhengzhou rainstorm, was triggered by the development and merger of two meso-β-scale convective systems (NMCS and SMCS). Using convection-permitting ensemble simulations and targeted data assimilation, this study first examines the roles of key mid-to-lower tropospheric synoptic systems (which influenced the 7.20 Zhengzhou rainstorm) in the subsequent 7.21 Xinxiang rainstorm, then identifies and verifies critical mesoscale factors governing the two MCSs' development and merger. Results indicate that a mid-level low-pressure system (corresponding to a lower-level trough) and a high-pressure ridge extending from the southwestern periphery of the western Pacific subtropical high were critically important synoptic-scale systems influencing both consecutive rainstorm events. For the 7.21 Xinxiang rainstorm, the low primarily governed the total precipitation amount, while the ridge mainly influenced the rainfall spatial pattern in central Henan by modulating the SMCS organization. Furthermore, two mesoscale shear lines are found to drive convection evolution. One, formed by the near-surface southeasterly flow ahead of the trough turning into a northeasterly barrier flow parallel to the terrain, influenced the southern tip of the NMCS. The other, from converging ridge-edge southwesterlies and southeasterlies, drove SMCS development. Radar radial velocity assimilation confirms that refining these pivotal shear lines can enhance convective and quantitative precipitation forecasts."
