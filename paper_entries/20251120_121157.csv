10.5194/acp-25-16215-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注斯瓦尔巴群岛雪盖的化学成分的季节性和年际变化。虽然研究涉及大气条件（如大气环流和海盐气溶胶），但它侧重于这些因素如何影响雪的化学成分，而不是直接利用大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测或卫星观测。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强，更偏向于气候变化背景下雪化学的研究。,"['snow chemistry', 'ionic impurities', 'elemental impurities', 'sea spray aerosol', 'sea ice extent', 'atmospheric circulation']",Azzurra Spagnesi;Elena Barbaro;Matteo Feltracco;Federico Scoto;Marco Vecchiato;Massimiliano Vardè;Mauro Mazzola;François Burgay;Federica Bruschi;Clara Jule Marie Hoppe;Allison Bailey;Andrea Gambaro;Carlo Barbante;Andrea Spolaor,Seasonal and interannual variability on the chemical composition of the Svalbard surface snowpack,"Svalbard is ideal for studying how warming affects snow’s seasonal chemistry. By comparing the snow chemical composition of the 2019–2020 season with 2018–2019 and 2020–2021, we provide an overview of the seasonal and interannual variability of several chemical species on the Svalbard snowpack, furnishing insights into the interplay between short-term meteorological variability and the long-term climatic impacts of climate changes. 
 The Svalbard Archipelago, highly sensitive to rapid environmental changes, offers an ideal physical laboratory to investigate how environmental drivers can shape the seasonal chemical composition of snow in a warming climate. From 2018 to 2021, sampling campaigns at the Gruvebadet Snow Research Site in Ny-Ålesund, in the North-West of the Svalbard Archipelago, captured the interannual variability in ionic and elemental impurities within surface snow, reflecting seasonal differences in atmospheric and oceanic conditions. Notably, warmer conditions prevailed in 2018–2019 and 2020–2021, contrasting with the relatively colder season of 2019–2020. Our findings suggest that impurity concentrations in the 2019–2020 colder season are impacted by enhanced sea spray aerosol production, likely driven by a larger extent of sea ice, and drier, windy conditions. This phenomenon was particularly evident in March 2020, when extensive sea ice was present in Kongsfjorden and around Spitsbergen due to an exceptionally strong, cold stratospheric polar vortex and unusual Arctic Oscillation (AO) index positive phase. This study provides a detailed characterization of how snow chemistry in this area responds to major environmental conditions, with particular attention to sea-ice extent, atmospheric circulation, synoptic conditions, and Arctic climate variability."

Using the latest radon exhalation maps and standardized radon measurements, we found the greenhouse gas fluxes to be in agreement with the literature. Compared to inventories, there is a general agreement except for carbon dioxide where we show that the biogenic fluxes are not well represented in the model. 
 Here, we use carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrous oxide (N2O) and radon (222Rn) data from the Saclay ICOS tall tower in France to estimate CO2, CH4 and CO fluxes within the station footprint from January 2017 to October 2024 and N2O fluxes from February 2019 to October 2024 using the Radon Tracer Method (RTM).We first performed a sensitivity study of this method applied to CH4 and combined with different radon exhalation maps including the improved European process-based radon flux maps developed within 19ENV01 traceRadon and back-trajectories in order to optimize it. Then, radon exhalation maps from the 19ENV01 traceRadon project, STILT trajectories from the ICOS Carbon Portal, best estimate of radon activity concentration and greenhouse data have been used to estimate the surface emissions.  To our knowledge, this is the first study in Europe using the latest radon exhalation maps and standardized radon measurements to estimate CO2, CH4, CO and N2O surface emissions. We found that the average RTM estimates are 867 ± 565, 1.10 ± 0.89, 1.01 ± 1.05 and 0.094 ± 0.118 mgm-2h-1 for CO2, CH4, CO and N2O, respectively. These fluxes are in good agreement with the literature for the same site or for similar suburban sites in Europe. No significant trends are observed over time, except for CO, which shows a small decreasing trend especially over the last three years.CH4, N2O and CO are also in fair agreement with the inventories, though with higher values. CO2 fluxes are about 5 times higher than modeled anthropogenic and biogenic fluxes combined. The differences mainly occur during summer, and the CO/CO2 ratio points toward a misrepresentation of the biogenic fluxes by the WRF-VPRM version used here."

We found enhanced concentrations of dissolved metals in fog samples, which we attributed to metal–ligand complex formation in the early stages of particle activation into droplets that can then remain in a kinetically stable form in fog or lead to the formation of colloidal nanoparticles. 
 The western coast of southern Africa is a region of particular climate interest and crossroads for aerosols of different origins as well as fog occurrences. In this study, we present a comparison between the concentration of dissolved trace metals in pairs of total suspended particulate (TSP) and fog water samples collected in Henties Bay, Namibia, during the AErosols, Radiation and CLOuds in southern Africa (AEROCLO-sA) field campaign in September 2017. From inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry measurements, we found that the concentration of dissolved Al, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Cr is enhanced in fog samples compared to the TSP samples. We found that thermodynamic modelling predicts the formation of soluble complexes with inorganic and organic ligands in fog for Cu, Cr, and Ni, but it would predict Al and Fe to precipitate as hydroxides given the neutral pH of fog. In contrast, X-ray absorption near edge structure measurements showed the presence of oxalate of Fe complexes that could explain its enhanced dissolved concentration in fog samples, despite a neutral pH. In addition, transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering measurements revealed the presence of nano-sized colloidal particles containing Fe and Al in filtered fog samples that may appear soluble in inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) measurements. We hypothesise that these complexes are formed in the early stages of particle activation into droplets when water content and, therefore, pH are expected to be lower and then remain in fog in a kinetically stable form or lead to the formation of colloidal nanoparticles."
10.5194/acp-25-16127-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文分析了纳米比亚沿海地区气溶胶的元素组成和溶解度，特别是铁的溶解度。研究发现，天然和人为尘埃的溶解度不同，这主要取决于矿物学以及海洋排放的氟离子的影响。人为尘埃含有较高的重金属，而天然尘埃的金属溶解度更高。氟离子浓度与金属溶解度相关，突出了海洋-大气交换对本格拉地区大气成分和海洋生物地球化学的重要性。虽然论文没有直接涉及遥感技术，但它研究的气溶胶成分分析和空气质量监测密切相关，可以通过卫星观测等遥感手段进行补充研究。,"['aerosol composition', 'mineral dust', 'elemental composition', 'metal solubility', 'iron solubility', 'atmospheric composition', 'air quality monitoring (indirectly)', 'ocean-atmosphere exchange']",Paola Formenti;Chiara Giorio;Karine Desboeufs;Alexander Zherebker;Marco Gaetani;Clarissa Baldo;Gautier Landrot;Simona Montebello;Servanne Chevaillier;Sylvain Triquet;Guillaume Siour;Claudia Di Biagio;Francesco Battaglia;Jean-François Doussin;Anais Feron;Andreas Namwoonde;Stuart John Piketh,"Elemental composition, iron mineralogy, and solubility of anthropogenic and natural mineral dust aerosols in Namibia: a case study analysis from the AEROCLO-sA campaign – Part 2","The elemental composition and solubility of several metals, including iron, at a coastal site in Namibia in August–September 2017, indicate that natural and anthropogenic dust had different solubility depending on mineralogy but mostly on the processing by fluoride ions from marine emissions, pointing to the complexity of atmospheric--oceanic interactions in this region of the world influenced by the Benguela current and significant aerosol load. 
 This paper presents the results of 3 weeks of aerosol sampling at the Henties Bay coastal site in Namibia during the Aerosols, Radiation and Clouds in southern Africa (AEROCLO-sA) field campaign in August–September 2017. The campaign coincided with a transition period between two synoptic regimes and corresponded to a significant change in the aerosol composition measured at the site and in particular of that of mineral dust. During August, the dust was natural windblown from the southerly gravel plains, with a composition consistent with that previously observed in Namibia. In September, the dust was fugitive from anthropogenic mining, possibly with a minor contribution of smelting emissions in northern Namibia or as far as the Copper Belt in Zambia, one of the regional hotspots of pollution.Chemical analysis of filter samples highlights the difference in elemental composition, in particular heavy metals, such as As, Cu, Cd, Pb, and Zn, but also silicon, in the anthropogenic dust. The metal solubility of the natural dust was higher, including that of iron (up to 5 % compared to less than 1 % for anthropogenic dust). Anthropogenic dust was associated with slight higher content of iron oxides and a larger proportion of coarse particles. Additionally, we found that the iron solubility, and, more in general, the metals' solubility, correlated to the high concentrations of fluoride ions which are attributed to marine emissions from the Namibian shelf. In a renewed manner, these results highlight the importance of ocean–atmosphere exchanges affecting both the atmospheric composition and the marine biogeochemistry in the Benguela region."

McCoy;Hunter Brown;Andrew Gettelman;Trude Eidhammer;Donifan Barahona,Aircraft in-situ measurements from SOCRATES constrain the anthropogenic perturbations of cloud droplet number,"This study examines how aerosols from human activities alter cloud microphysical properties. Airborne observations from a field campaign are used to constrain an ensemble of global model configurations and their associated cloud property changes. Results show that airborne in-situ measurements of aerosol and cloud properties do provide insight into global changes in cloud microphysics but are sensitive to uncertainties in both airborne measurements and Earth system model emulators. 
 Aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI) in warm clouds alter reflected shortwave radiation by influencing cloud microphysical and macrophysical properties. The variable of state controlling ACI is the cloud droplet number concentration (Nd). Here, we examine the perturbations in Nd due to anthropogenic aerosols (ΔNd, PD-PI) using a perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) hosted in the sixth Community Atmosphere Model (CAM6). Surrogate models are created for the CAM6 PPE outputs and are used to generate 1 million model variants of CAM6 by sampling 45 sources of parameter uncertainty. The range of uncertain physical parameters related to ACI are constrained with observations of aerosol and cloud properties from SOCRATES. The likely range of uncertain parameters and the associated range of ΔNd, PD-PI are more strongly constrained with observations of Nd relative to observations of cloud condensation nuclei. We conduct sensitivity tests of how constraints on  ΔNd, PD-PI are affected by systematic uncertainties in observations and our limitations in our surrogate models created for CAM6 PPE outputs. Based on this, we provide guidance on the impact of reducing systematic uncertainty in airborne microphysical observations and in surrogate models."
10.5194/acp-25-16053-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注利用卫星观测数据（特别是GNSS无线电掩星数据）来研究全球对流层顶的高度和温度变化。对流层顶是大气中下层和上层之间的边界，被认为是气候变化的敏感指标。研究发现热带地区的对流层顶温度升高，许多地区（尤其是在亚洲和中东地区）的对流层顶高度也在上升。这些变化反映了大气各层对气候变化的响应，并强调了持续卫星监测的必要性。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它使用了卫星观测来监测大气参数的变化，从而服务于气候变化研究。,"['satellite observations', 'GNSS radio occultation', 'tropopause height', 'tropopause temperature', 'climate change monitoring', 'atmospheric layers']",Florian Ladstädter;Matthias Stocker;Sebastian Scher;Andrea K. Steiner,Observed changes in the temperature and height  of the globally resolved lapserate tropopause,"The tropopause, the boundary between the lower and upper atmosphere, is a sensitive marker of climate change. We studied changes in tropopause height and temperature over the past two decades using precise satellite observations. We found warming in the tropics and rising tropopause heights in many regions, especially over Asia and the Middle East. These changes reflect how both atmospheric layers are responding to climate change and highlight the need for continued satellite monitoring. 
 The tropopause is a key indicator of atmospheric climate change, influenced by both the troposphere and stratosphere. Here we present a global view of tropopause changes, using high-resolution GNSS radio occultation data from 2002 to 2024. We identify significant trends in lapse rate tropopause (LRT) temperature and height with seasonal and regional detail. The tropical LRT has warmed, with particularly strong warming (>1 K per decade) over the South Pacific during austral spring and summer, while height changes remain largely insignificant. Outside the tropics, LRT temperature changes are confined to southern high latitudes in winter, showing cooling of up to 1 K per decade. Notably, LRT height has increased significantly across most extratropical regions, with localized trends exceeding 200 m per decade over Asia and the Middle East during Northern Hemisphere winter. An exception is the LRT height decreases over the South Pacific, coinciding with a LRT warming in that region. These results highlight the interrelated effects of tropospheric and stratospheric changes and demonstrate the value of precise tropopause monitoring for detecting ongoing changes in the global climate system."
10.5194/acp-25-16167-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注利用CloudSat和POLDER等多角度被动成像仪的卫星观测数据，对全球液态云的垂直结构进行表征。通过分析云有效半径（CER）廓线的结构特征，提出了一种新的方法来估计三角形廓线的结构特征，并利用物理参数化模型重建云廓线。该研究对于理解云的生命周期、微物理过程以及气候变化的影响具有重要意义，并能提高天气预报和气候变化研究的能力。虽然该研究没有直接涉及空气质量监测或大气成分分析，但它利用了大气环境遥感技术，特别是卫星观测，来研究云的特性，这与大气环境遥感技术领域密切相关。,"['CloudSat', 'POLDER', 'cloud effective radius (CER)', 'cloud optical thickness', 'remote sensing', 'satellite observations', 'cloud vertical structure', 'weather forecast', 'climate change']",Yutong Wang;Huazhe Shang;Chenqian Tang;Jian Xu;Tianyang Ji;Wenwu Wang;Lesi Wei;Yonghui Lei;Jiancheng Shi;Husi Letu,Characterization of liquid cloud profiles using global collocated active radar and passive polarimetric cloud measurements,"By analyzing global CloudSat data, we identified that most liquid cloud profiles have triangle-shaped or steadily decreasing structures, and we developed a new method using pattern recognition, fitting techniques, and machine learning to accurately estimate these profiles. This research advances our understanding of cloud life cycle and improves the ability to characterize cloud profiles, which is crucial for enhancing weather forecast and climate change research. 
 Stratiform liquid cloud profiles are key to deciphering cloud life cycles, microphysical processes, and climate change impacts. Nevertheless, remote sensing of cloud vertical structure remains largely unresolved. CloudSat active measurements provide cloud microphysical profile products but are restricted to narrow orbital tracks. Multiangle passive imagers, such as Polarization and Directionality of Earth's Reflectance (POLDER), are capable of generating a variety of cloud properties with broad area coverage; however, they lack key prior knowledge and effective methods for obtaining cloud vertical information. Focusing on single-layer cloud profile retrieval, we first reveal the structural characteristics of stratiform cloud effective radius (CER) profiles based on global CloudSat data and find that the dominant structures include triangle-shaped and monotonically decreasing profiles, which account for approximately 88.5 % of global liquid CER profiles. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach to estimate the structural characteristics of triangle-shaped profiles from POLDER observations like the properties of the profile turning point (TP). This approach integrates vertical structure morphology recognition with a combination of fitting methods and machine learning models. The cloud profiles are then accurately reconstructed using physical parameterization models. Our retrieval results exhibit good consistency with active observations, with an RMSE of 1.1 µm for TP_CER and 0.1 for the normalized cloud optical thickness at the TP. This research advances the parameterization of liquid cloud profiles and enables profile structural characteristic retrieval based on a multiangle passive imager. Our findings provide valuable insights into improving the understanding and modelling of cloud processes in weather and climate systems."

Lange;Anna Novelli;Benjamin Winter;Changmin Cho;Iulia Gensch;Sergej Wedel;Andreas Wahner;Astrid Kiendler-Scharr,Measurement report: Comprehensive seasonal study of the composition and sources of submicron aerosol during the JULIAC campaign in Germany,"We measured air particles at a rural site in Germany over a year to understand how their sources and properties change with the seasons. Particles from natural sources peaked in summer, especially during heatwaves, while those from burning activities like residential heating and wildfires dominated in colder months. Winds carrying air from other regions also influenced particle levels. These findings link air quality to climate change and energy transitions. 
 The seasonal variations of aerosol sources and their atmospheric evolution are investigated using observations from the year-long JULIAC (Jülich Atmospheric Chemistry Project) campaign (January–November 2019) in Jülich, Germany. Non-refractory submicron aerosol components were continuously measured alongside oxidants (OH, O3, NO3), trace gases, and meteorological conditions. Organic aerosols (OA) dominated the aerosol composition throughout the year (39 %–58 %), with secondary formation being the major source. OA, including organic nitrate and organosulfate, peaked during a summer heatwave event due to enhanced daytime and nighttime secondary OA formation driven by elevated concentrations of atmospheric oxidants. Changes in the OA composition during the heatwave suggest a shift in the formation pathways, where isoprene may play an important role. Biomass-burning, mainly wildfires and anthropogenic activities (e.g., heating, industry), is the dominant primary OA source (45 %–83 %), which may grow in influence due to climate change and the expected energy transition. Air masses containing OA from regional transport from marine and wildfire sources are identified through source apportionment. Analysis and modeling prove this method to be more reliable than traditional tracer-based methods. Regional transport to this study site typically shows a cleansing effect on the aerosol concentration, except in winter. Furthermore, seasonal variations in the effects of regional transport are seen, where identical transport pathways led to different influences on aerosol properties, driven by seasonal differences in biogenic and anthropogenic emissions. This study enhances understanding of seasonal variation in submicron aerosol properties in response to their sources, atmospheric evolution, and transport."

During dust events, oxalic acid and precursors shift from fine to coarse particles, with concurrent heterogeneous reactions on coarse particle surfaces. The characteristic isotopic fractionation signatures accompanying these transformations yield novel theoretical frameworks for elucidating aerosol aging mechanisms in mountainous environments. 
 Dust transport significantly affects downwind aerosol formation and regional climate, yet the evolutionary mechanisms of SOA during this process remain poorly understood. Here, we conducted vertical observations of PM2.5 and size-segregated aerosols at the foot and top of Mount Hua, focusing on C2 formation and its δ13C signatures influenced by dust transport. Under non-dust conditions, PM2.5 and diacid concentrations at the foot were 4.5 and 2.1 times higher than those at the top, indicating stronger anthropogenic influence at lower elevations. Aerosols at the top revealed enhanced photochemical aging, with higher C2 / C4 (5.84 vs. 4.74), C3 / C4 ratios (1.04 vs. 0.56), and more positive δ13C values (−21.5 ‰ vs. −27.6 ‰). The positive correlation of C2 with ALWC and its consistent size distribution with precursors confirm aqueous-phase oxidation as the dominant formation pathway. During dust events, although PM2.5 concentrations increased, C2 concentrations in PM2.5 decreased by 59 % at the foot and 25 % at the top. Concurrently, the δ13C values of C2 showed a positive shift, particularly at the top (from −21.5 ‰ to −13.2 ‰), suggesting that alkaline dust catalyzes the formation of 13C-enriched oxalate. Size-segregated data revealed a shift of C2 from the fine to the coarse mode, with the coarse-to-fine ratio increasing from 0.3–0.4 to 0.6–1.1. These findings demonstrate that under dust influence, the primary formation pathway of C2 shifts from aqueous-phase oxidation in fine particles to heterogeneous reactions on coarse-particle surfaces. Moreover, this shift is accompanied by a positive shift in the δ13C signature of C2 and is more pronounced at higher altitudes."

EarthCARE's radar provides the first space-based vertical wind data, capturing updrafts and downdrafts. Combined with satellite imagery from other sensors, it offers a broader view of convective storms. While resolution limits detail, cloud-top cooling helps track storm development. This combined approach improves understanding and modeling of convection. 
 Convective updrafts and downdrafts play a vital role in Earth’s energy and water cycles by modulating vertical energy and moisture transport and shaping precipitation patterns. Despite their importance, the characteristics of convective motions and their relationship to the near-storm environment remain poorly constrained by observations.Doppler radars, in principle, are able to measure the vertical air motion within clouds, thus providing critical insight into convective dynamics and enabling estimates of convective mass flux. The payload of the recently launched EarthCARE satellite mission includes a 94 GHz Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) with Doppler capability. In this study, we present first-light CPR Doppler velocity observations in deep convective clouds. These early examples offer a first glimpse into the dynamic nature of cloud systems. The narrow footprint of the CPR helps reduce the impact of multiple scattering and non-uniform beam filling (NUBF) on the Doppler velocity measurements. However, the instrument’s low Nyquist velocity presents a significant challenge for recovering the true Doppler velocity profiles in deep convective systems.The CPR Doppler velocity observations are expected to challenge traditional methodologies for identifying deep convective cores, which typically rely on reflectivity-based thresholds. We showcase examples that demonstrate the synergy between CPR Doppler velocity measurements and geostationary satellite observations, illustrating how their combined use can help capture the evolution of the convective lifecycle.These results align with EarthCARE’s broader mission objectives and highlight the potential of spaceborne Doppler radars to significantly advance our understanding of cloud dynamics and convection in the climate system."

By equipping the high-altitude Grob G 520 Egrett with a suite of custom and modified commercial instruments, we demonstrate precise, high-resolution measurements of aerosol particles, trace gases, and contrail ice in the engine exhaust plume at cruise altitudes. 
 This paper reports on the successful first deployment of a new, autonomously operating measurement system on a Grob G 520 Egrett aircraft, which was used as a chase aircraft to perform in-flight aerosol and trace gas measurements of engine exhaust from other aircraft. A suite of custom-built and commercially available instruments was selected, modified, and adapted to operate in the unpressurized compartment of the Egrett over a wide range of ambient temperatures and pressures. We performed these first in-flight emission measurements at cruise altitudes between 7.6 and 10.4 km (FL250 and FL340) behind a Piper Cheyenne, a twin-turboprop aircraft powered by Garrett/Honeywell TPE 331-14 engines over Texas in April 2022. The instrumentation and inlets on the Egrett were designed to measure non-volatile particulate matter (nvPMDp>10), total particulate matter (tPMDp>10), nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2), water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and contrail ice particles. All instruments were operated in relevant plume conditions at cruise altitudes and distances ranging from 100 to 1200 m between the two aircraft. The instruments proved to have high reliability, a large dynamic range, and sufficient accuracy for measuring the emissions of the turboprop engine.We derived the emission indices (EI) for tPM, nvPM, and NOx at cruise. The particulate emission indices range from 9.6 to 16.2 × 1014 kg−1 (particles per kg fuel burned) for EItPM and from 8.1 to 12.4 × 1014 kg−1 for EInvPM (medians). For NOx we find rather low EINOx between 7.3 and 7.7 g kg−1 for EINOx (medians). Furthermore, the tPM aerosol size distributions have been measured in the exhaust plume, taking into account the size-resolved sampling efficiency of the instrument. The analysis of the size-resolved emission index indicates a log-normal distribution with geometric mean and standard deviation at Dg=27.5±2.0 nm. This geometric diameter value is in the range of jet engine soot emissions previously measured in flight.

However, the inherent model has some subjective aspects which should be reduce to ensure the robustness of the result. To do so, this study developed a systematic method, by performing tests on the input and the result validation. Finally, we proposed recommendations for input selection and result validation. A Python package is developed, providing advanced tools for input preparation, validation and visualization results. 
 Positive matrix factorization (PMF) is the most commonly used approach for particulate matter source apportionment; however, the implementation steps of the model require considerable user experience. Most studies apply PMF according to the recommendations of the Environmental Protection Agency and the European Commission, while relatively few studies focus on further developing the PMF methodology. This study aims to develop a systematic method that reduces some subjective aspects when performing a PMF study, providing recommendations and tools for its application and validation. A total of 13 targeted tests were conducted to address key sources of subjectivity in PMF, categorized into three critical aspects: preparation of the input matrix, selecting the number of sources, and validation of the PMF solution. The results of the first step highlighted that using a single source tracer reduces the tracer's dispersion into other sources, leading to more accurate results. The second stage tests suggested that the selection of a source tracer should be based on low uncertainty and specific temporal evolution, in order to facilitate the determination of a new source without compromising the PMF solution. Finally, the validation step was set up as an advanced comparison of the PMF-derived source profiles with those in the literature, including SPECIEUROPE database, using the ratio of chemicals and distance metrics. All outcomes of this study are compiled into a Python package providing essential tools to support the work from PMF implementation to solution validation, leading to less subjective solutions and more rigorous and reliable source apportionment."

Winker,Mapping 532 nm lidar ratios for CALIPSO-classified marine aerosols using MODIS AOD constrained retrievals and GOCART model simulations,"NASA's CALIPSO satellite mission observed aerosols (airborne particles) globally from 2006 to 2023. Its final data products update improves its aerosol optical parameters over oceans by adjusting for regional and seasonal differences in a new measurement-model synergistic approach. This results in a more realistic aerosol characterization, specifically near coastlines (where sea salt mixes with pollution), with potential impacts to future studies of science applications (e.g., climate effects). 
 The NASA-CNES Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) mission provided a spaceborne global record of atmospheric aerosol and cloud profiles from June 2006 to June 2023. As an elastic backscatter lidar, the CALIPSO Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) typically required an assumption of the aerosol lidar ratio (extinction-to-backscatter ratio; Sa) to retrieve aerosol extinction and column-integrated aerosol optical depth (AOD). In all previous versions of its data products, the CALIPSO extinction algorithms first determine the aerosol types then assign one Sa value globally for each aerosol type (e.g., 23 sr for marine at 532 nm). One of the major changes for the final CALIPSO data products release (Version 5, or V5) is the implementation of regional and seasonal Sa tables for CALIOP-classified “marine” aerosols. In this study, we describe the process of creating the tables using 12 years (June 2006–August 2018) of Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) total column AODs to constrain collocated CALIOP backscatter profiles in a Fernald inversion scheme and infer Sa (at 532 nm), focusing solely on the CALIOP “marine” aerosol type. The Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) global aerosol model is used to estimate sea salt volume fraction (SSVF) that are collocated with the constrained Sa retrievals. Patterns of smaller SSVF (< 65 %) and larger constrained Sa (> 40 sr) are found near land masses, while larger SSVF (> 95 %) and smaller constrained Sa (< 30 sr) are generally observed in the remote oceans. The inverse empirical relationship found between modeled SSVF and constrained Sa over global oceans yields values of ∼ 21 sr for SSVF of 100 % (i.e., “pure” marine) and ∼ 58 sr for SSVF of 0 % (i.e., the absence of marine aerosol). This relationship is applied to develop regional and seasonal hybrid (retrieval and model-assisted) climatological Sa maps for CALIOP-classified marine aerosols; i.e., when MODIS-constrained results are not available, the model-assisted values are used. These hybrid Sa maps are subsequently used to retrieve new CALIPSO Level 2 (L2) aerosol extinction profiles and column AODs in the V5 release. For a 4-month (January, April, July, and October 2015) analysis, the V5 L2 CALIPSO AODs compared better to CALIPSO Ocean Derived Column Optical Depth (ODCOD) than the CALIPSO Version 4.51 (V4.51) standard AODs in several regions, most notably the Bay of Bengal/Arabian Sea, where smoke/pollution typically mixes with marine aerosols. Also, the V5 CALIPSO AODs likely provide a lower AOD bias and root-mean-square-error than V4.51 AODs relative to coastal and island Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AODs, as found in a validation study using data from June 2006 through October 2022. The technique described in this study contributes to CALIPSO's final V5 data products release and provides critical Sa information for future spaceborne elastic backscatter lidars."

 The Mount Brown South ice core (MBS 69.111° S 86.312° E) is a new, high resolution ice core drilled in coastal East Antarctica. With mean annual accumulation estimated to be ∼ 30 cm ice equivalent throughout the length of the core (∼ 290 m), MBS represents a high resolution archive of ice core data spanning 1137 years (873–2008 CE), from an area previously underrepresented by high resolution ice core data.Here, we present a high-resolution dataset of chemistry and impurities obtained via continuous flow analysis (CFA). The dataset consists of meltwater electrolytic conductivity, sodium (Na+), ammonium (NH4+), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and insoluble microparticle measurements. The data are presented in three datasets: as a 1 mm depth resolution record, 3 cm averaged record, and decadal average record. The 1 mm record represents an oversampling of the true resolution, as due to smoothing effects the actual resolution is closer to 3 cm for some species. Therefore, the 3 cm resolution dataset is considered to be the minimum true resolution given the system setup. We also describe the current Copenhagen CFA system, and provide a detailed assessment of data quality, precision, and functional resolution.The 1 mm averaged, 3 cm averaged, and MBS2023 decadal averaged datasets are available at the Australian Antarctic Data Center: https://doi.org/10.26179/9tke-0s16 (Harlan et al., 2024)."

For the first time, FWI calculations use surface weather readings taken at the local solar noon. This new method enables a more physically realistic spatial distribution of FWI components values across all boreal forest ecosystems, in particular along the time zones. 
 This article summarizes the work carried out at the ESCER (Étude et Simulation du Climat à l’Échelle Régionale, UQAM) Centre to develop the ERA5-FWI-SN dataset — a new automated, gridded dataset of the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System components for Canada, at a spatial resolution of approximately 31 km. The ERA5-FWI-SN dataset is derived from the hourly ERA5 reanalysis using a new method, called the solar noon method, which is based on the sun's elevation above the local horizon at noon. This method aims to improve the conventional method for calculating the FWI System components, the UTC method, based on the maximum insolation defined via time zones (or specific areas covered by one Coordinated Universal Time zone, i.e. UTC zone), which can cover a wide longitudinal region where the same time prevails. The classical method relies on the principle that the average solar time over the territory covered by the same time zone is not too far from legal time (i.e., solar noon is not too far from legal noon), which can be problematic in regions that are very extensive in longitude, such as in Canada where only six time zones have been defined over more than 95° of longitudes. The solar noon method also allows for the correction of systematic biases associated with the UTC method, particularly those arising in gridded datasets near time zone boundaries or across the east–west extent of a single time zone. The dataset spans from 1950 to the present and is updated daily through an automation process that allows the calculation of the FWI components with a six-day lag, corresponding to the latest ERA5 available reanalysis data for download, resulting in a rapid (i.e., 6-days lag) monitoring of recent wildfire danger throughout Canada. Data were compared between solar noon and UTC methods and were tested against the Canadian Wildland Fire Information System (CWFIS) FWI calculated from observation station data. The dataset is available for download at https://doi.org/10.5683/SP3/4B18XZ, and derived visualization products can be accessed across the web platform http://feux.escer.uqam.ca/. "

Our results show these models struggle to accurately capture trends in variables related to carbon cycle, because the models can’t respond to human and environmental influences. This evaluation is crucial because improving these models will lead to more reliable forecasts of how ecosystems and the climate will change in the future. 
 Systematic evaluation of the carbon cycle physical and biological variables simulated in Earth System Model (ESM) participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP 6) is fundamental to the understanding of terrestrial ecosystems, as well as to future projections. Leaf Area Index (LAI), Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), Net Primary Productivity (NPP), Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) as key indicators of carbon cycle performance in ESM outputs, play a critical role in evaluating ecosystem functions. Assessing these metrics can provide valuable insights into the biases in model-simulated ecosystems and offer guidance for model improvement. In this study, we assessed the interannual trends performance of LAI, GPP, NPP, NEP and LST simulated by 12 CMIP6 ESMs during the historical period by using satellite LAI, NPP, NEP, LST and CSIF data as observations. The findings indicate that: (1) There are significant uncertainties in the overall trends and interannual variability in LAI, NPP, and LST captured by the CMIP6 ESM. Meanwhile, simulated GPP and NEP trends were lower than observations with discrepancies reaching 0.03 yr−1 for GPP and 2.46 gCm-2yr-1 for NEP. (2) Spatially, CMIP6 ESMs exhibited widespread underestimation of trends in LAI, GPP, NPP, and NEP across China. The MME underestimated these variables in 46.29 % (LAI), 43.47 % (GPP), 49.81 % (NPP), and 61.34 % (NEP) of the study area. Meanwhile, the simulated LST trend is underestimated in northern China, while its overestimations in western and southern China.

Our findings reveal that the SPV showed a weakening trend from 1980 until the early 2000s, but a strengthening trend after the 2000s. This change is attributed to the weakening of the planetary wave (PW) activities, particularly the wavenumber‐1, which can be driven by long‐term Arctic surface changes. A strong link has been found between the observed PWs activity and the increasing sea surface temperature (SST) over/nearby the Barents‐Kara Sea before early 2000s and over the Central North Pacific region after the 2000s. Furthermore, we observe that the SPV trend influences the zonal mean zonal winds and migrating solar semidiurnal tide (SW2) in the MLT.

Arnold,Radiative Response to Large Decline in Anthropogenic Emissions From China Between 2008 and 2016 Is Modified by Simultaneous Biomass Burning Emission Changes,"The recent large reduction in anthropogenic aerosol emissions across China has improved China's air quality but has potential consequences for climate forcing. This sharp reduction in anthropogenic emissions has occurred against a background influenced by changing regional biomass burning emissions over a similar period of time. Here, we use the UK Earth System Model (UKESM) to estimate aerosol instantaneous radiative forcing (IRF) due to changes in emissions of aerosols and precursors from biomass burning and anthropogenic sources (separately and in combination) over 2008–2016, with a focus on China and regions downwind. We also separately quantify the IRF due to changes in anthropogenic aerosol emissions inside China (CHN) and the Rest Of the World (ROW). Reductions in Chinese anthropogenic emissions of BC, SO2 and OC contributed −0.30 ± 0.01, +1.00 ± 0.04, and +0.05 ± 0.01 W m−2, respectively to IRF over China, accounting for ∼97% of the total local anthropogenic aerosol IRF. These emission changes contributed a remote regional IRF of 0.22 ± 0.04 W m−2 over the North Pacific Ocean. The reduction in SO2 emissions from China contributed a global IRF of equal magnitude to that from SO2 emissions from ROW (∼0.08 W m−2). Changes in global biomass burning emissions contributed 0.03 W m−2 (equivalent to over 20% of the magnitude of anthropogenic aerosol IRF), enhancing the global anthropogenic aerosol IRF, whereas they partly offset the anthropogenic IRF over China. Meanwhile, biomass burning emissions dominated the total IRF (around 98%) over the Arctic."

Researchers have developed various morphological models of BC and computed their scattering matrices in attempts to replicate experimental measurements. However, prior simulation endeavors frequently encountered issues such as significant discrepancies with observational data, implausible particle shapes, or unsuitable computational parameters. In this study, we developed a fractal‐based overlapping and necking model to represent the morphology of bare BC particles. We computed the scattering matrices for both individual particles and particle population using these models and compared the results with the previously reported measurements. Our findings revealed that the overlapping model reproduces the measured scattering matrix elements more accurately, whereas the necking model fails to achieve similar consistency. At a wavelength of 532 nm, the overlapping model yields F22(π)/F11(π) ranging from 0.80 to 0.99 for single particles and from 0.86 to 0.99 for particle population, both of which are much closer to the experimental observations than those of the necking model. In contrast, only a small subset of results from the necking model falls within the measured range. The overlapping model outperforms the necking model in reproducing the scattering matrix and should be preferred for representing bare BC particles. The established understanding provides useful guidance for retrieving microphysical parameters of BC from polarization features and for diminishing the uncertainties associated with its radiative forcing estimates."

The model reproduced Lekima's track, intensity changes, and persistent concentric eyewall structure well. Consistent with previous findings, before SEF, the deep‐layer asymmetric inflow and updrafts in the upwind region and descending inflow in the downwind region of the outer rainbands contribute to the expanding tangential wind first in the downshear region through the advection of momentum. The convection in the upshear‐left region is triggered by the convergence induced by the descending inflow in stratiform precipitation of outer rainbands, and enhanced by the phase locking occurring between the radial‐propagating wavenumber‐1 vortex Rossby waves (VRWs) from the primary eyewall and inner rainbands and the azimuthal‐propagating wavenumber‐1 (wavenumber‐2) VRWs at the inner (outer) edge of the developing outer eyewall. The filamentation effect causes the rainband‐associated convection to have a more concentric structure, ultimately leading to SEF.

However, the attribution of GPP trends predominantly focus on interannual timescales, potentially obscuring the differences in dynamic seasonal responses of GPP to meteorological variations. Here, a machine learning model to invert GPP in China's drylands using meteorological data including temperature, solar radiation, and precipitation from 2001 to 2020 was developed. The model was subsequently used to quantify the contributions of these meteorological factors to GPP trends and their regional variations. Results showed that declining solar radiation caused an average GPP decrease of 0.13 gC m−2 yr−1, whereas increased precipitation contributed to an average GPP increase of 0.11 gC m−2 yr−1, partially offsetting the radiation‐induced loss. Temperature effects were relatively minor due to seasonal compensations, with spring and autumn warming enhancing photosynthesis but summer warming suppressing vegetation growth. The combined effects of these three meteorological factors led to a slight decline of approximately 0.03 gC m−2 yr−1 in annual mean GPP across China's drylands. Spatially, GPP variations reflected the dominance of temperature in the Tibetan Plateau, precipitation in North China, and solar radiation in Northeast China. The Tibetan Plateau's low baseline temperature allowed warming to enhance GPP throughout the year. In Northeast China, the significant decline in solar radiation and the radiation sensitivity of forest canopies explained the observed GPP reduction. In North China, pronounced wetting trends established precipitation as the dominant controlling factor. These findings enhance our understanding of climate‐GPP relationships in dryland ecosystems."

In this work, the main absorbing components of BrC were separated into three fractions and each fraction was analyzed individually and systematically. The compositional and structural characteristics of BrC across different wavelengths were studied, and the potential BrC compounds were revealed. Overall, nearly 100 light‐absorbing compounds were identified. The result showed that aromatic and heterocyclic compounds were main contributors to BrC absorption in the wavelength from 220 to 450 nm, which play an important role in radiative forcing. Interestingly, carbonyl groups dominated the BrC absorption in the wavelength from 200 to 220 nm. Although BrC compounds have minimal direct radiative impact due to limited solar radiation at such a wavelength, it can still play important roles in atmospheric photochemistry by participating in light‐induced oxidation process and lead to severe photochemical pollution. Additionally, carboxyl‐rich alicyclic molecules and lignin‐like substances all promoted the absorptivity of BrC, and nitrogenous substituents further enhanced such a process. These results were further extrapolated to various environmental conditions, which indicated that urban BrC probably contained more carbonyl groups. Conversely, more heterocyclic substances were observed in the forest and ocean areas, which illustrated high burden of radiative forcing in these areas. Overall, our work reveals that the BrC absorption is largely dependent on their molecule properties in different wavelengths, and such a correlation can guide and facilitate the BrC absorption analysis."

The first leading mode reveals an in‐phase variation during spring‐summer, where a positive (negative) phase of the corresponding time series indicates consistent wetness (dryness) across both seasons. Further analysis demonstrates that soil moisture in spring over the Eastern Iranian Plateau (EIP) plays a crucial role in shaping this consistent mode. During spring, enhanced soil moisture over the EIP boosts local convective precipitation through positive soil moisture‐precipitation feedback. The anomalous diabatic heating, driven by increased precipitation, intensifies with altitude, triggering a mid‐upper tropospheric cyclone anomaly over the EIP. Therefore, the East Asian subtropical westerly jet strengthens and shifts southward during spring. Concurrently, an anomalous anticyclone dominates the lower troposphere over the Bay of Bengal, weakening the Southern Branch Trough and suppressing water vapor transport and precipitation over Yunnan and the Indochina Peninsula (ICP). These circulation anomalies contribute to spring dry conditions and reduced soil moisture over these regions. Persistently low soil moisture from spring to summer over Yunnan and the ICP favors an equivalent barotropic high‐pressure anomaly over the region, reinforcing westward extension of the western Pacific subtropical high and eastward displacement of the South Asian high. This atmospheric configuration maintains dry conditions during summer in Yunnan. Analysis using the Linear Baroclinic Model further supports this physical mechanism."

This approach aims to bridge gaps between aerosol‐based and thermodynamic‐based PBLH estimates. The RF model outperformed traditional methods during daytime and better captured transition periods, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness. At ARM SGP, it showed a substantial reduction in both bias and RMSE, with a bias near zero (−4.9 m) compared with traditional Haar Wavelet (HW) (70.9 m) and Vaisala BL‐View software (124.1 m), and an RMSE of 303.2 m, lower than both BL‐View (566.9 m) and HW (404.6 m).

At a second evaluation site, RF achieved the lowest overall RMSE (323.7 m), similar to HW (326.4 m) and significantly better than BL‐View (738.3 m).

We describe here the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of stable, acyclic N-stereogenic amines by the addition of enol silanes to nitronium ions that ion pair to a confined chiral anion. In the produced so-called anomeric amines, the commonly observed isomerization is slowed down by two N-oxy-substituents, which hamper nitrogen inversion. The critical stereogenicity creating step challenges previously established stereochemical descriptors of enantiodifferentiation. Computational studies provide additional insight into the origin of the observed stereocontrol.

 Neural representations of information are shaped by long-range input and local network interactions. Previous studies linking neural coding and cortical connectivity have focused on input-driven activity in the sensory cortex1–3. Here we studied neural activity in the motor cortex while mice gathered rewards with multidirectional tongue reaching. This behaviour does not require training, allowing us to probe neural coding and connectivity before activity is shaped by extended learning. Motor cortex neurons were tuned to target location and reward outcome, and typically responded during and after movements. We studied the underlying network interactions in vivo by estimating causal neural connections using an all-optical method3–6. Mapping connectivity between more than 20,000,000 excitatory neuron pairs showed a multi-scale columnar architecture in layer 2/3 of the motor cortex. Neurons displayed local (less than 100 µm) like-to-like excitatory connectivity according to target-location tuning, and inhibition over longer spatial scales. Connectivity patterns comprised a continuum, with abundant sparsely connected neurons and rare densely connected neurons that function as network hubs. Hub neurons were weakly tuned to target location and reward outcome but influenced more neighbouring neurons. This network of neurons, encoding location and outcome of movements to different motor goals, may be a general substrate for rapid learning of complex, goal-directed behaviours.

 Precise genome-editing technologies such as base editing1,2 and prime editing3 can correct most pathogenic gene variants, but their widespread clinical application is impeded by the need to develop new therapeutic agents for each mutation. For diseases that are caused by premature stop codons, suppressor tRNAs (sup-tRNAs) offer a more general strategy. Existing approaches to use sup-tRNAs therapeutically, however, require lifelong administration4,5 or show modest potency, necessitating potentially toxic overexpression. Here we present prime editing-mediated readthrough of premature termination codons (PERT), a strategy to rescue nonsense mutations in a disease-agnostic manner by using prime editing to permanently convert a dispensable endogenous tRNA into an optimized sup-tRNA. Iterative screening of thousands of variants of all 418 human tRNAs identified tRNAs with the strongest sup-tRNA potential. We optimized prime editing agents to install an engineered sup-tRNA at a single genomic locus without overexpression and observed efficient readthrough of premature termination codons and protein rescue in human cell models of Batten disease, Tay–Sachs disease and cystic fibrosis. In vivo delivery of a single prime editor that converts an endogenous mouse tRNA into a sup-tRNA extensively rescued disease pathology in a model of Hurler syndrome. PERT did not induce detected readthrough of natural stop codons or cause significant transcriptomic or proteomic changes. Our findings suggest the potential of disease-agnostic therapeutic genome-editing approaches that require only a single composition of matter to treat diverse genetic diseases.

 Ribosome collisions activate the ribotoxic stress response mediated by the MAP3K ZAK, which in turn regulates cell-fate consequences through downstream phosphorylation of the MAPKs p38 and JNK1. Despite the critical role of ZAK during cellular stress, a mechanistic and structural understanding of ZAK–ribosome interactions and how these lead to activation remain elusive. Here we combine biochemistry and cryo-electron microscopy to discover distinct ZAK–ribosome interactions required for constitutive recruitment and for activation. We find that upon induction of ribosome collisions, interactions between ZAK and the ribosomal protein RACK1 enable its activation by dimerization of its SAM domains at the collision interface. Furthermore, we discover how this process is negatively regulated by the ribosome-binding protein SERBP1 to prevent constitutive ZAK activation. Characterization of novel SAM variants as well as a known pathogenic variant of the SAM domain of ZAK supports a key role of the SAM domain in regulating kinase activity on and off the ribosome, with some mutants bypassing the ribosome requirement for ZAK activation. Collectively, our data provide a mechanistic blueprint of the kinase activity of ZAK at the collided ribosome interface.

 Generative genomic models can design increasingly complex biological systems1. However, controlling these models to generate novel sequences with desired functions remains challenging. Here, we show that Evo, a genomic language model, can leverage genomic context to perform function-guided design that accesses novel regions of sequence space. By learning semantic relationships across prokaryotic genes2, Evo enables a genomic ‘autocomplete’ in which a DNA prompt encoding genomic context for a function of interest guides the generation of novel sequences enriched for related functions, which we refer to as ‘semantic design’. We validate this approach by experimentally testing the activity of generated anti-CRISPR proteins and type II and III toxin–antitoxin systems, including de novo genes with no significant sequence similarity to natural proteins. In-context design of proteins and non-coding RNAs with Evo achieves robust activity and high experimental success rates even in the absence of structural priors, known evolutionary conservation or task-specific fine-tuning. We then use Evo to complete millions of prompts to produce SynGenome, a database containing over 120 billion base pairs of artificial intelligence-generated genomic sequences that enables semantic design across many functions. More broadly, these results demonstrate that generative genomics with biological language models can extend beyond natural sequences.

 Neurons exhibit extraordinary precision in selecting synaptic partners. Although cell-surface proteins (CSPs) that mediate attractive interactions between developing axons and dendrites have been shown to instruct synaptic partner matching1,2, the degree to which repulsive interactions have a role is less clear. Here, using a genetic screen guided by single-cell transcriptomes3,4, we identified three CSP pairs, Toll2–Ptp10D, Fili–Kek1 and Hbs/Sns–Kirre, that mediate repulsive interactions between non-partner olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) axons and projection neuron (PN) dendrites in the developing Drosophila olfactory circuit. Each CSP pair exhibits inverse expression patterns in the select ORN–PN partners. Loss of each CSP in ORNs led to similar synaptic partner matching deficits as the loss of its partner CSP in PNs, and mistargeting phenotypes caused by overexpressing one CSP could be suppressed by loss of its partner CSP. All CSP pairs are also differentially expressed in other brain regions. Together, our data reveal that multiple repulsive CSP pairs work together to ensure precise synaptic partner matching during development by preventing neurons from forming connections with non-cognate partners.

 Most human secretory pathway proteins are N-glycosylated by oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complexes as they enter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1–3. Recent work revealed a substrate-assisted mechanism by which N-glycosylation of the chaperone glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94) is regulated to control cell surface receptor signalling4. Here we report the structure of a natively isolated GRP94 folding intermediate tethered to a specialized CCDC134-bound translocon. Together with functional analysis, the data reveal how a conserved N-terminal extension in GRP94 inhibits OST-A and how structural rearrangements within the translocon shield the tethered nascent chain from inappropriate OST-B glycosylation. These interactions depend on a hydrophobic CCDC134 groove, which recognizes a non-native conformation of nascent GRP94. Our results define a mechanism of regulated N-glycosylation and illustrate how the nascent chain remodels the translocon to facilitate its own biogenesis.

 Emerging evidence suggests a correlation between CD8+ T cell–tumour cell proximity and anti-tumour immune response1,2. However, it remains unclear whether these cells exist as functional clusters that can be isolated from clinical samples. Here, using conventional and imaging flow cytometry, we show that from 21 out of 21 human melanoma metastases, we could isolate heterotypic clusters, comprising CD8+ T cells interacting with one or more tumour cells and/or antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that T cells from clusters were enriched for gene signatures associated with tumour reactivity and exhaustion. Clustered T cells exhibited increased TCR clonality indicative of expansion, whereas TCR-matched T cells showed more exhaustion and co-modulation when conjugated to APCs than when conjugated to tumour cells. T cells that were expanded from clusters ex vivo exerted on average ninefold increased killing activity towards autologous melanomas, which was accompanied by enhanced cytokine production. After adoptive cell transfer into mice, T cells from clusters showed improved patient-derived melanoma control, which was associated with increased T cell infiltration and activation. Together, these results demonstrate that tumour-reactive CD8+ T cells are enriched in functional clusters with tumour cells and/or APCs and that they can be isolated and expanded from clinical samples. Typically excluded by single-cell gating in flow cytometry, these distinct heterotypic T cell clusters are a valuable source to decipher functional tumour–immune cell interactions and may also be therapeutically explored.

Inagaki,Integrator dynamics in the cortico-basal ganglia loop for flexible motor timing,"How the mouse frontal cortex and striatum interact to implement integrator dynamics controlling movement timing is explored. 
 Flexible control of motor timing is crucial for behaviour1–4. Before volitional movement begins, the frontal cortex and striatum exhibit ramping spiking activity, with variable ramp slopes anticipating movement onsets5–12. This activity in the cortico-basal ganglia loop may function as an adjustable ‘timer,’ triggering actions at the desired timing. However, because the frontal cortex and striatum share similar ramping dynamics and are both necessary for timing behaviours, distinguishing their individual roles in this timer function remains challenging. Here, to address this, we conducted perturbation experiments combined with multi-regional electrophysiology in mice performing a flexible lick-timing task. Following transient silencing of the frontal cortex, cortical and striatal activity swiftly returned to pre-silencing levels and resumed ramping, leading to a shift in lick timing close to the silencing duration. Conversely, briefly inhibiting the striatum caused a gradual decrease in ramping activity in both regions, with ramping resuming from post-inhibition levels, shifting lick timing beyond the inhibition duration. Thus, inhibiting the frontal cortex and striatum effectively paused and rewound the timer, respectively. These findings are consistent with a model in which the striatum is part of a network that temporally integrates input from the frontal cortex and generates ramping activity that regulates motor timing. How the mouse frontal cortex and striatum interact to implement integrator dynamics controlling movement timing is explored."

 Oncogenic mutations in phenotypically normal tissue are common across adult organs1,2. This suggests that multiple events need to converge to drive tumorigenesis and that many processes such as tissue differentiation may protect against carcinogenesis. WNT–β-catenin signalling maintains zonal differentiation during liver homeostasis3,4. However, the CTNNB1 oncogene—encoding β-catenin—is also frequently mutated in hepatocellular carcinoma, resulting in aberrant WNT signalling that promotes cell growth5,6. Here we investigated the antagonistic interplay between WNT-driven growth and differentiation in zonal hepatocyte populations during liver tumorigenesis. We found that β-catenin mutations co-operate with exogenous MYC expression to drive a proliferative translatome. Differentiation of hepatocytes to an extreme zone 3 fate suppressed this proliferative translatome. Furthermore, a GLUL and Lgr5-positive perivenous subpopulation of zone 3 hepatocytes were refractory to WNT-induced and MYC-induced tumorigenesis. However, when mutant CTNNB1 and MYC alleles were activated sporadically across the liver lobule, a subset of mutant hepatocytes became proliferative and tumorigenic. These early lesions were characterized by reduced WNT pathway activation and elevated MAPK signalling, which suppresses zone 3 differentiation. The proliferative lesions were also dependent on IGFBP2–mTOR–cyclin D1 pathway signalling, in which inhibition of either IGFBP2 or mTOR suppressed proliferation and tumorigenesis. Therefore, we propose that zonal identity dictates hepatocyte susceptibility to WNT-driven tumorigenesis and that escaping WNT-induced differentiation is essential for liver cancer. Zonal positioning in the liver determines whether the CTNNB1 oncogene can induce liver cancer."

 Lanthanide nanocrystals offer unique advantages for electroluminescence (EL) applications, including narrow-band emission, high colour purity and compositionally tunable output1–4. However, their insulating nature poses a challenge for carrier transport and injection, impeding their application in electrically driven optoelectronic devices5. Here we demonstrate efficient EL from insulating lanthanide fluoride nanocrystals (4 nm; NaGdF4:X; X = Tb3+, Eu3+ or Nd3+) coated with a series of functionalized 2-(diphenylphosphoryl)benzoic acids (ArPPOA). These ligands, featuring donor–phosphine oxide acceptor hybrids with carboxyl and P=O coordination sites, effectively sensitize the luminescence of lanthanide nanocrystals by modulating the intraligand charge transfer characteristics. Ultrafast spectroscopic investigations reveal that strong coupling between ArPPOA and lanthanide nanocrystals facilitates intersystem crossing (ISC; <1 ns) and highly efficient triplet energy transfer to nanocrystals (up to 96.7%). Through careful control of dopant composition and concentration in nanocrystals, we also achieve wide-ranging multicolour EL without altering the device architecture, reaching an external quantum efficiency exceeding 5.9% for Tb3+.

 Proper brain function requires the precise assembly of neural circuits during development. Despite the identification of many cell-surface proteins (CSPs) that help guide axons to their targets1,2, it remains mostly unknown how multiple CSPs work together to assemble a functional circuit. Here we used synaptic partner matching in the Drosophila olfactory circuit3,4 to address this question. By systematically altering the combination of differentially expressed CSPs in a single type of olfactory receptor neuron (ORN), which senses a male pheromone that inhibits male–male courtship, we switched its connection nearly completely from its endogenous postsynaptic projection neuron (PN) type to a new PN type that promotes courtship. From this switch, we deduced a combinatorial code including CSPs that mediate both attraction between synaptic partners and repulsion between non-partners5,6. The anatomical switch changed the odour response of the new PN partner and markedly increased male–male courtship. We generalized three manipulation strategies from this rewiring—increasing repulsion with the old partner, decreasing repulsion with the new partner and matching attraction with the new partner—to successfully rewire a second ORN type to multiple distinct PN types. This work shows that manipulating a small set of CSPs is sufficient to respecify synaptic connections, paving the way to investigations of how neural systems evolve through changes of circuit connectivity. In Drosophila, changing the expression of a small set of cell-surface proteins in just one type of olfactory neuron rewires its connections almost entirely to a new postsynaptic partner neuron type, altering the fly’s odour response and courtship behaviour."

 Insulating nanomaterials have large energy gaps and are only electrically accessible under extreme conditions, such as high-intensity radiation and high temperature, pressure or voltage1,2. Lanthanide-doped insulating nanoparticles (LnNPs) are widely studied owing to their exceptional luminescence properties, including bright, narrow-linewidth, non-blinking and non-bleaching emission in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) range3,4. However, it has not been possible to electrically generate excited states in these insulating nanomaterials under low biases and, therefore, not possible to fabricate optoelectronic devices from these systems. Here we report an electrical excitation pathway to obtain emission from LnNPs. By forming LnNP@organic molecule nanohybrids, in which the recombination of electrically injected charges on the organic molecule is followed by efficient triplet energy transfer (TET) to the LnNP, it is possible to turn on LnNPs under a low operating bias. We demonstrate this excitation pathway in light-emitting diodes (LEDs), with low turn-on voltages of about 5 V, very narrow electroluminescence (EL) spectra and a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) greater than 0.6% in the NIR-II window5. Our LnNP-based LEDs (LnLEDs) also allow for widely tunable EL properties, by changing the type and concentration of lanthanide dopants. These results open up a new field of hybrid optoelectronic devices and provide new opportunities for the electrically driven excitation sources based on lanthanide nanomaterials for biomedical and optoelectronic applications.

 Non-invasive skin permeation is widely used for convenient transdermal delivery of small-molecule therapeutics (less than 500 Da) with appropriate hydrophobicities1. However, it has long been deemed infeasible for large molecules—particularly polymers, proteins and peptides2,3—due to the formidable barrier posed by the skin structure. Here we show that the fast skin-permeable polyzwitterion poly[2-(N-oxide-N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (OP) can efficiently penetrate the stratum corneum, viable epidermis and dermis into circulation. OP is protonated to be cationic and is therefore enriched in the acidic sebum and paracellular stratum corneum lipids containing fatty acids, and subsequently diffuses through the intercorneocyte lipid lamella. Beneath the stratum corneum, at the normal physiological pH, OP becomes a neutral polyzwitterion, ‘hopping’ on cell membranes, enabling its efficient migration through the epidermis and dermis and ultimately entering dermal lymphatic vessels and systemic circulation. As a result, OP-conjugated insulin efficiently permeates through the skin into the blood circulation; transdermal administration of OP-conjugated insulin at a dose of 116 U kg−1 into mice with type 1 diabetes quickly lowers their blood glucose levels to the normal range, and a transdermal dose of 29 U kg−1 normalizes the blood glucose levels of diabetic minipigs. Thus, the skin-permeable polymer may enable non-invasive transdermal delivery of insulin, relieving patients with diabetes from subcutaneous injections and potentially facilitating patient-friendly use of other protein- and peptide-based therapeutics through transdermal delivery.

 Most superconducting materials are well understood and conventional—that is, the pairs of electrons that cause the superconductivity by their condensation have the highest possible symmetry. Famous exceptions are the enigmatic high-temperature (high-Tc) cuprate superconductors1. Nodes in their superconducting gap are the fingerprint of their unconventional character and imply superconducting pairing of d-wave symmetry. Here, by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe that the Weyl semimetal PtBi2 harbours nodes in its superconducting gap, implying unconventional i-wave pairing symmetry. At temperatures below 10 K, the superconductivity in PtBi2 gaps out its topological surface states, the Fermi arcs, whereas its bulk states remain normal2. The nodes in the superconducting gap that we observe are located exactly at the centre of the Fermi arcs and imply the presence of topologically protected Majorana cones around this locus in momentum space. From this, we infer theoretically that robust zero-energy Majorana flat bands emerge at surface step edges. This establishes PtBi2 surfaces not only as unconventional, topological i-wave superconductors but also as a promising material platform in the ongoing effort to generate and manipulate Majorana bound states.

Newly recognized eukaryotic supergroups have been established1–3, and most enigmatic orphan lineages have had their relationships resolved4–6. Studies on unicellular protist eukaryotes have also been key to understanding the evolution of mitochondria, the fundamental organelles of the eukaryotic cell, which originated from an alphaproteobacterial ancestor. The retention of ancestral alphaproteobacterial pathways in some protist lineages reveals that the mitochondrion of the last eukaryotic common ancestor was more metabolically versatile than are the highly derived mitochondria that are found in most modern eukaryotes7,8.

 Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a prevalent and devastating form of oncogene amplification in cancer1,2. Circular megabase-sized ecDNAs lack centromeres, stochastically segregate during cell division3–6 and persist over many generations. It has been more than 40 years since ecDNAs were first observed to hitchhike on mitotic chromosomes into daughter cell nuclei, but the mechanism underlying this process remains unclear3,7. Here we identify a family of human genomic elements, termed retention elements, that tether episomes to mitotic chromosomes to increase ecDNA transmission to daughter cells. Using Retain-seq, a genome-scale assay that we developed, we reveal thousands of human retention elements that confer generational persistence to heterologous episomes. Retention elements comprise a select set of CpG-rich gene promoters and act additively. Live-cell imaging and chromosome conformation capture show that retention elements physically interact with mitotic chromosomes at regions that are mitotically bookmarked by transcription factors and chromatin proteins. This activity intermolecularly recapitulates promoter–enhancer interactions. Multiple retention elements are co-amplified with oncogenes on individual ecDNAs in human cancers and shape their sizes and structures. CpG-rich retention elements are focally hypomethylated. Targeted cytosine methylation abrogates retention activity and leads to ecDNA loss, which suggests that methylation-sensitive interactions modulate episomal DNA retention. These results highlight the DNA elements and regulatory logic of mitotic ecDNA retention. Amplifications of retention elements promote the maintenance of oncogenic ecDNA across generations of cancer cells, and reveal the principles of episome immortality intrinsic to the human genome.

 All spoken languages are produced by the human vocal tract, which defines the limited set of possible speech sounds. Despite this constraint, however, there exists incredible diversity in the world’s 7,000 spoken languages, each of which is learned through extensive experience hearing speech in language-specific contexts1. It remains unknown which elements of speech processing in the brain depend on daily language experience and which do not. In this study, we recorded high-density cortical activity from adult participants with diverse language backgrounds as they listened to speech in their native language and an unfamiliar foreign language. We found that, regardless of language experience, both native and foreign languages elicited similar cortical responses in the superior temporal gyrus (STG), associated with shared acoustic–phonetic processing of foundational speech sound features2,3, such as vowels and consonants. However, only during native language listening did we observe enhanced neural encoding in the STG for word boundaries, word frequency and language-specific sound sequence statistics. In a separate cohort of bilingual participants, this encoding of word- and sequence-level information appeared for both familiar languages in the same individual and in the same STG neural populations. These results indicate that experience-dependent language processing involves dynamic integration of both shared acoustic–phonetic and language-specific sequence- and word-level information in the STG.

Here, the authors present a coupled strategy that combines PDH with the reverse water–gas shift reaction through a tandem catalytic system. 
 The integration of CO2 into the dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) holds significant promise for both propylene production and greenhouse gas utilization. However, a pivotal challenge lies in mitigating the undesirable dry reforming of propane (DRP), which diminishes propylene selectivity compared to direct PDH processes. Herein, we describe a coupled process that integrates PDH with reverse water gas shift (RWGS) using a tandem catalytic system. The PtSn/Al2O3 analogue performs the dehydrogenation reaction, while an adjacent defective CeOx/Al2O3 at nanoscale acts as the hydrogenation sites for CO2. Catalysis and kinetic studies demonstrate the in-situ removal of hydrogen from PtSn/Al2O3 to adjacent CeOx/Al2O3, facilitated by CO2, shifts the quasi-equilibrium of PDH towards propylene production, while suppressing the competitive DRP side reaction. This hydrogen spillover-mediated coupling mechanism enables superior propylene selectivity of ~98.8%, along with high CO2 (~43.9%) and propane conversion (~44.2%) at 550 °C, outperforming direct PDH (~40.6%). Analysis of CO2 footprint indicates the PDH-RWGS tandem process has the potential for carbon utilization to mitigate detrimental CO2 emissions.

 Engineering the topological properties of the system has been a longstanding subject in physics. Here, we propose a scheme to simulate topological materials with a non-Abelian gauge field in synthetic space-frequency dimensions where the symmetry between spin-flipped hoppings can be levitated by using coupled photonic molecules under dynamic modulations. The frequency-split supermodes in these photonic molecules can serve the pseudospin degree of freedom, which can further be connected along the frequency axis in an independent way, offering the unique opportunity to explore topological physics with imbalanced spin-flipped hoppings leading to a complex generalization of the conventional SU(2) non-Abelian gauge field, i.e., an SL

This cryptic conformation is shaped by increased mannosidic glycosylation and furin cleavage shielding conformational epitopes enable virus to persist in the presence of neutralizing antibodies. 
 SARS-CoV-2 Spike - the sole neutralization target, is highly resilient to the immune pressure driving genetic evolution. While potency and breadth of neutralization are widely studied, the incomplete neutralization - the mechanism of resistance without needing genetic change - remains unexplored. Several monoclonal antibodies, although potent, showed incomplete neutralization of genetically homogeneous pseudovirus suggesting the existence of distinct spike conformations. The residual infectivity at high antibody concentration indicates a viral fraction with intrinsic resistance to the antibody. Although the published studies on spike glycosylation, structure, and conformations provide evidence of spike heterogeneity the precise mechanism for the incomplete neutralization has not been established. In this study, we devise a method to separate the un-neutralized virion population, called as persistent fraction of infectivity (PF), and characterize the viral spike protein. The neutralization resistance of PF is stable and unrelated to the conformational equilibrium that exists in the pseudovirus stock. The spike on the PF is highly cleaved between S1 and S2, adopts the closed conformation, and express more mannosidic glycans on RBD than the total virus population. Our study provides possible explanations for the incomplete neutralization by antibodies and delineates the association between furin cleavage of spike, its conformation and glycosylation. The tightly closed conformation of the Spike helps SARS-CoV-2 evade the immune system. This cryptic conformation is shaped by increased mannosidic glycosylation and furin cleavage shielding conformational epitopes enable virus to persist in the presence of neutralizing antibodies."

 Different types of violence are commonly linked with large urban areas, often presumed to scale superlinearly with population size (i.e., to be disproportionately higher in larger cities). This study explores the hypothesis that smaller, isolated cities in Africa may experience a heightened intensity of violence against civilians. It aims to investigate the correlation between the risk of experiencing violence, a city’s size and its geographical isolation. Between 2000 and 2023, incidents of civilian casualties were analysed to assess lethality in relation to varying levels of isolation and city size. African cities are categorised by isolation (measured by the number of highway connections) and centrality (the estimated frequency of journeys). We show that violence against civilians exhibits a sublinear pattern, with larger cities witnessing fewer events and casualties per 100,000 inhabitants. Individuals in isolated cities face a fourfold higher risk of becoming casualties compared with those in more connected cities.

 The mammalian brain comprises a vast number of neurons, exhibiting remarkable diversity in both molecular composition and spatial distribution. However, a comprehensive understanding of how these neurons are organized within the brain remains elusive, largely due to the lack of systematic studies providing three-dimensional coverage of molecularly defined neurons across the entire brain. In this study, we utilized transgenic mice and fMOST imaging to map the spatial distribution of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and modulatory neurons at the single-cell level throughout the whole brain. Our approach enabled precise registration of individual cells to the standardized brain coordinate framework, facilitating the construction of whole-brain cell atlases for commonly used Cre recombinase driver lines. Analysis revealed diverse cellular composition patterns across the brain, aligning with the boundaries of known brain regions in some areas while uncovering previously uncharacterized subdivisions in others. Notably, cortical and subcortical nuclei as small as approximately one millimeter in size exhibited intricate three-dimensional organization, suggesting the presence of finer functional zones.

 Endometrial regeneration is essential for reproductive cycles and pregnancies, allowing the endometrium to undergo estrogen-driven repair, growth, and renewal after menstruation and parturition. Epithelial cells lining the uterine cavity undergo apoptosis during estrous cycles, and remnant cells can quickly restore this lining through a process known as re-epithelialization. It is presumed that adult stem/progenitor cells in the uterine stroma also contribute to re-epithelialization. However, the specific cell type(s) and the underlying mechanisms have not been determined. Herein, we use genetic lineage tracing assays in mice to identify Nestin+ perivascular cells as active contributors to re-epithelialization. Notch signaling maintains Nestin+ perivascular cells in a quiescent state, but these cells re-enter the cell cycle and differentiate into epithelial cells via estrogen-stimulated suppression of Notch signaling dependent on estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1). These findings demonstrate that perivascular cells support re-epithelialization and reveal a mechanism regulating the quiescence and activation of uterine perivascular cells.

 A growing number of compounds are reported to extend lifespan, but it remains unclear whether they reduce mortality across the entire life course or only at specific ages. This uncertainty persists because the commonly used log-rank test cannot detect age-specific effects. Here, we introduce a new analytical method that addresses this limitation by revealing when, how long, and to what extent interventions alter mortality risk. Applied to survival data from 42 compounds tested in mice by the National Institute on Aging Interventions Testing Program, it identified 22 that reduced mortality at certain ages, more than detected by the log-rank test, while 15 increased mortality at certain ages. Most compounds were effective only within restricted age ranges; just 8 reduced mortality late in life, when burdens of aging are greatest. Compared to conventional methods, this approach uncovers more beneficial and harmful effects, offers deeper insight into timing and mechanism, and can guide development of future anti-aging therapies.

 In vivo characterization of protein structures and structural changes after perturbation is still a major challenge and has impacted our understanding of the molecular events involved in protein misfolding diseases. To identify the true conformational space occupied by proteins in their native state in vivo, we recently developed a structural proteomics method named Covalent Protein Painting (CPP). Here, we show how CPP can be used to identify and quantify the conformational defects of proteins in the misfolding disease Cystic Fibrosis. We first report the discovery of a previously unreported opening mechanism for the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) as well as its conformational changes during biogenesis. Then we further reveal how misfolding of different CFTR variants in Cystic Fibrosis disturbs these conformational changes even upon treatment with current approved drugs and suggest possibilities to stabilize misfolded CFTR variants not or less responsive to these drugs such as N1303K CFTR.

 Previous studies have primarily examined the impacts of tropical North Atlantic or uniform extratropical North Atlantic sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) on El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). However, how the dominant tripole SSTAs mode in the North Atlantic and its three individual components influence interannual ENSO evolution remains poorly understood. In this study, observational analyses reveal a significant connection between the winter–spring North Atlantic tripole SSTAs mode and ENSO development in the following autumn–winter. Model simulations demonstrate that a positive winter–spring North Atlantic tripole SSTAs mode (negative-positive-negative) results in spring westerly wind anomalies over the equatorial western Pacific through both tropical and mid-latitude pathways, ultimately contributing to an autumn–winter El Niño event. The tropical pathway triggers a westward Gill-type Rossby wave to induce the westerly wind anomalies. The mid-latitude pathway generates an eastward Rossby wave train that induces the westerly wind anomalies by modulating both tropical Indo-Pacific zonal-vertical circulations and North Pacific air-sea interactions. Further model analysis reveals that the relative contributions of tropical, mid-latitude, and high-latitude SSTAs of the North Atlantic tripole SSTAs mode to El Niño formation are approximately 43%, 34%, and 23%, respectively. The tropical SSTAs contribute to an El Niño event through both tropical and mid-latitude pathways, while mid-latitude and high-latitude SSTAs exert their influence exclusively via the mid-latitude pathway. This study can advance current theories on the North Atlantic tripole SSTAs mode in driving ENSO variability."

 Soil moisture critically modulates moist heat via surface energy fluxes, impacting human health and ecosystems under climate change. Using CMIP6 models with or without interactive soil moisture, we dissect its global role. Moist heat is most severe in tropical and extra-tropical regions, with mid-latitudes showing >2.4 °C increases significantly amplified by soil moisture. Soil moisture dynamics intensify moist heat across most land regions, exhibiting strong negative correlations, especially in eastern South America and Central America. Conversely, diverse moist heat responses to soil moisture variations are found in the Arabian Peninsula and northern Africa. High moist heat generally coincides with high Bowen ratio and low soil moisture while low moist heat is generally found with low Bowen ratio and high moisture. Our findings also highlight exceptions exist where moist heat is not directly influenced by these factors.

 The Lower Mekong River Basin faces growing challenges in deploying variable renewable energy under intensifying hydroclimatic extremes. To evaluate these impacts, we develop an integrated modeling framework that links an energy expansion model with a synthetic streamflow generator. The results indicate that severe extended periods of low flows (10,000-year events) reduce hydropower output by 24.3 ± 8.7 terawatt-hour (−13.7% ± 4.9%), increasing wind capacity requirements by 10.6 ± 12.5 gigawatts (1.15% ± 1.36%) and raising system-wide costs by 8.7 ± 3.2 billion U.S. dollars. Conversely, extended periods of high flows of similar severity boost hydropower generation by 23.3 ± 9.2 terawatt-hours (+ 13.1% ± 5.2%), decreasing wind capacity needs by 9.3 ± 11.7 gigawatts (1.02% ± 1.27%) and lowering system costs by 7.8 ± 3.0 billion U.S. dollars. Prolonged drought conditions accelerate wind development to sustain decarbonization, while surplus flows from floods may delay investment—introducing long-term uncertainty for energy system resilience. These findings underscore the need for proactive, region-specific strategies to ensure resilient and sustainable energy transitions under intensifying hydroclimatic extremes.

 Well-preserved layered structures have been reported for Jurassic ammonites’ aptychi, but the role, function, and origin of the lamination has been unclear. Here, we applied electron backscatter diffraction imaging to detect crystal fabric patterns in the laminated layer of Laevaptychi (calcitic coverings of the lower jaw of Aspidoceratoidea ammonites) and their diagenetic alteration, which was used to interpret variations in stable oxygen isotope compositions. We combined electron backscatter diffraction imaging with discrete and combinatorial geometry to model the calcite crystal deposition patterns. A new probabilistic approach was developed to gain a fundamental 3D description of the tiling based on information from 2D sections. The analyses revealed that the lamination results from variable deposition of elongated calcite crystals arranged in rotating bundles, which may be interpreted as a Bouligand-like structure.

 High Mountain Asia is a global warming hotspot, yet its influence on Northern Hemisphere extreme weather-related synoptic temperature variability remains unclear. Combining observations and numerical model simulations, we show that amplified High Mountain Asia warming has substantially enhanced summer synoptic temperature variability (>21%) in Canada and Russia while reducing winter variability (>19%) in Eastern Europe and the Nordic Seas during 1940–2022. These changes are primarily driven by altered high-frequency temperature advection. High Mountain Asia warming modifies horizontal temperature gradients, strengthening them in Canada and Russia in summer but weakening them in the Nordic Seas and Eastern Europe in winter. These patterns arise from hemispheric teleconnections that redistribute temperature and modulate atmospheric circulation stability via changes in jet streams, Rossby waves, and air-sea interactions. Our findings highlight High Mountain Asia warming’s far-reaching impacts on Northern Hemisphere weather variability, extending beyond its well-known local climate effects.

 Seismic velocity variations before and after major earthquakes, measured with ambient noise interferometry, reveal time-dependent changes in subsurface properties, but the physical mechanism that causes them remains difficult to identify. Using noise interferometry, we observed a 0.5–1.3% velocity reduction within the upper-crust where the Mw 6.2 Northern Nagano earthquake rupture reached the surface. We combined the inverted 2D image with depth sensitivity to reconstruct the distribution of velocity changes in the shallow crust and show its correlation with the surface rupture and high-slip zones. Our results suggest that the main cause of velocity drop in the first kilometers of depth is damage induced by the mainshock rupture. Both fault-zone damage and near-surface damage from strong ground-shaking are involved, supported by the spatial correlation of velocity perturbations with peak ground acceleration and coseismic slip. These findings highlight fault zone weakening and shaking-induced damage as key drivers of post-earthquake velocity variations.

 Biological nitrogen fixation by diazotrophs is vital for nitrogen supply and marine productivity. Despite extensive documentation of diverse diazotrophs, their functional diversity and adaptive strategies across ecosystems remain largely underexplored. Here, we analyzed 561 metagenomes from 16 distinct marine environments to characterize the distribution, functional diversity, and ecological adaptations of marine diazotrophs on a global scale. Our results reveal a high relative abundance of diazotrophs in extreme environments, such as hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, underscoring their roles in biogeochemical processes of these ecosystems. Analysis of 167 metagenome-assembled genomes representing 22 phyla revealed considerable metabolic versatility among diazotrophs, along with habitat-specific functional adaptations that facilitate their survival in diverse marine environments. For example, diazotrophs in the coastal area have adapted to utilize readily available energy sources such as starch and sucrose, while those in the open ocean have developed mechanisms to degrade refractory organic matter. In the chemosynthetic ecosystem, diazotrophs closely associate with methane and sulfur metabolism, demonstrating their capacity to thrive in extreme environments. Diazotrophs affiliated with Alphaproteobacteria and Desulfobulbia were found to be ubiquitous in aerobic and anaerobic environments, respectively.

 Ancient trees are vital evolutionary resources for ecosystems in a changing world. Although being fundamental anchors of many natural processes, the causes leading to their extreme longevity are still partly unknown. Here, we aim to unveil how specific habitat features and selective pressures influence functional traits of long-living trees that support extreme tree age. During the period 2022-2024, we monitored 13 forests covering the entire age range of mountain pine and silver fir in the Pyrenees. Results reveal that extreme tree longevity requires the prevalence of complex habitat structures settled over millennia. Lifespan is limited in forests with common and homogeneous habitat attributes, preventing the maximum attainable lifespan of trees to occur. In longevity hotspots, however, some functional traits deployed in response to specific habitat features and evolutionary pressures lengthen longevity for several centuries. Our findings revitalise the idea of extreme tree longevity as a fundamental spatiotemporal process that depends on habitat structure. Moreover, we show that current maximum attainable lifespan has been reduced in most forests due to habitat alteration.

 Surface ozone pollution, a major threat to ecosystems and human health, can be exacerbated by interactions between anthropogenic and biogenic emissions. Here we combine field observations with numerical models to reveal a previously unrecognized pathway that intensifies ozone pollution: urban expansion fragments forests, forming Urban-Forest-Urban plumes that trigger cascading ozone production. In South China, five-year observations show ozone levels in Urban-Forest-Urban plumes are 35%–105% higher than in other plume types during hot seasons. Urban pollutants infiltrating forests elevate atmospheric oxidation capacity, accelerating biogenic volatile organic compounds oxidation and boosting their ozone contribution by up to twelvefold. The resulting long-lived oxygenated volatile organic compounds are transported downwind and further react with urban nitrogen oxides, enhancing ozone production. This mechanism shows strong temperature dependence, with up to 10% more ozone per 1 °C warming, underscoring its growing significance under climate change.

 Legumes play a crucial role in nitrogen cycling; however, it is unclear how this effect is related to soil organic carbon dynamics in grassland across climatic gradients. Here, we investigate how legumes affect soil nitrogen levels and thus microbial necromass accumulation across a 2500 km climatic gradient, using nitrogen-fixing Caragana shrubs as indictors for legumes. We show that microbial necromass and its contribution to organic carbon were markedly lower in warm-arid than in cold-humid grasslands, associated with lower soil nitrogen availability in arid environments. The impacts of legumes on increasing soil nitrogen availability in warm-arid grasslands were greater than in cold-humid regions. This led to a 64–112% increase in microbial necromass under legumes relative to non-legumes in warm-arid regions, whereas a 6–29% increases in cold-humid regions, contributing to more pronounced soil carbon gains under legumes in arid areas. Our findings indicated microbial necromass as a key mediator linking legume-driven nitrogen enrichment to soil carbon storage.

 Sea ice type information is important for climate change research and human activities in polar regions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, particularly from the Sentinel-1 (S1) mission, has become a key source for high-resolution sea ice mapping. With the growing volume of S1 SAR data, deep learning (DL) methods have been explored for sea ice classification. However, the limited availability of fine labels and overlapping backscatter intensity among ice types remain major obstacles to achieving automated fine-scale sea ice classification across the pan-Arctic region. This paper proposes a model, named IceDeepLab, for the automatic mapping of sea ice type across the pan-Arctic region in winter using S1 dual-polarized SAR images, based on the Deep Learning framework DeepLabv3+. The IceDeepLab can identify open water, young ice, first-year ice and old ice, generating pixel-wise classification maps at 400 m resolution. A sea ice type dataset, comprising 174 finely labelled S1 images from November 2019 to March 2020 and covering the pan-Arctic region with diverse sea ice conditions, is established for model training and validation. In particular, radar incidence angle is included as an input to mitigate its effects on HH-polarized SAR data. The model integrates the spatially optimised ConvNeXt backbone, the newly proposed Enhanced Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling module, and tailored training and inference schemes. These designs make it more suitable for processing whole SAR images, effectively reducing ambiguity between different sea ice types and eliminating stitching lines, thereby improving overall performance. Experiments on the test dataset show that IceDeepLab achieves an overall accuracy of 91.9%, a mean intersection over union of 82.3%, and a mean F1-score of 90.2%, significantly outperforming the traditional DeepLabv3+ by 16.0%, 10.0%, and 11.1%, respectively. When applied to 4153 S1 images collected from November 2020 to March 2021, IceDeepLab maintains over 90% agreement with operational ice charts in the pan-Arctic region, demonstrating the model's robustness across different years. Ablation experiments, feature visualizations, and statistical analyses further validate the model's effectiveness and offer insights for future improvements in sea ice classification algorithms. Furthermore, evaluations using both the radiometer-derived sea ice concentration product and a year-round ice type dataset are conducted to explore its potential for broader applications in operational sea ice monitoring."

 Irrigation is the major consumer of freshwater resources on Earth and represents the largest human intervention in the water cycle. Most irrigation modeling frameworks rely on simplified assumptions regarding the timing of irrigation that result in significant error in the irrigation water use estimation. In this study, we developed a generalized data-driven approach for estimating these irrigation timing attributes using a change point detection algorithm applied to thermal remote sensing data. Land surface temperature at cropland pixels was compared with hydrologically similar natural land cover pixels nearby to extract irrigation attributes. The approach was evaluated over two areas: Nebraska (NEB) and Mahabad, Iran (MAH), for which we had the in situ irrigation data. The method detected the start and end of the irrigation season with reasonable accuracy, exhibiting errors of 18 % and 15 % in estimating the duration of season, in NEB and MAH respectively. The cloud cover either at the start or the end of season was the primary source of error in both cases. Irrigation event detection accuracy across 10 NEB sites yielded F1-scores (Precision & recall combined score) of 0.59–0.74, varying with change point detection algorithm parameters. To optimize these parameters, extensive hyperparameter tuning was performed, leading to specific suggestions tailored for different irrigation practices.

 Methane (CH4) emissions from super-emitters on Turkmenistan make it a major global methane hotspot, yet regional emissions and temporal dynamics of these super-emitter sources remain poorly characterized. This study presents a joint analysis of CH4 point source emissions along Turkmenistan’s west coast using multi-satellite hyperspectral observations from PRISMA and Advanced Hyperspectral Imagers (AHSIs) onboard Chinese satellites GF-5B, ZY-1E, and ZY-1F during 2020–2024. We identified 38 point sources with 256 plumes across 1078 satellite overpasses, revealing total regional intermittent emissions of 0.60 (+0.39/-0.29) Tg·a–1. Individual plumes emission rates ranged from 0.37 ± 0.10 to 34.13 ± 11.98 t·h–1, with 25 of 38 sources associated with inefficient flaring operations. A significant ∼ 7 % annual increase in emissions from 2020 to 2023 corresponds with growth in natural gas production. This estimate of annual increase is consistent with that from multispectral satellites of Sentinel-2 and Landsat. Integration of multi-satellite hyperspectral data enhances detection capabilities, enabling finer plume delineation and improving emission quantification. Our findings show emissions consistent with EDGAR v8.0 inventories but nearly three times that of EDGAR v2024, revealing substantial inventory inconsistencies. These findings underscore the importance of high-resolution satellite monitoring for accurate emission inventories and methane mitigation."

 This study investigates the temporal variability of tropospheric NO2 vertical column density over Milan in Italy and its surrounding area using daily satellite observations from Aura/OMI over the period of 2004–2023. The analysis reveals a significant long-term decrease of 55 % in NO2 pollution which is consistent with previous studies. Using spectral analysis techniques such as wavelet and harmonic analysis, we identified distinct oscillation patterns such as an annual cycle linked to seasonal heating and NO2 lifetime variations, and shorter-term variabilities of 6.5–7.5 days (I7) as well as two to five days (I3). The I7 pattern, attributed to weekly traffic variations, shows consistent presence throughout the study period, while I3 exhibits notable temporal variations. The I3/I7 ratio demonstrates significant shifts corresponding to major economic events, including the 2008 global economic crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, the increased adoption of remote work during the pandemic (2.5 %–12 % between 2019 and 2021) disrupted traditional weekly commuting patterns, reflected in enhanced I3 dominance. This study establishes a clear connection between economic activities, commuting behavior, and NO2 variability patterns, demonstrating how the shift to remote work, leaves distinct signatures in atmospheric NO2 variability."

 Introduced in April 2019, the London Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) targets reductions in NOx and PM emissions to improve ambient air quality, with COVID-19 related restrictions superimposed throughout much of 2020 and 2021. However, little existing research assesses the impact of these interventions on O3 and UFP (Ultrafine particles) concentrations, or accounts for variations in meteorological or anthropogenic influences. To assess these effects, NO2, O3, PM10, PM2.5 and 51 size-channel UFP data collected between January 2015 and December 2022 were normalised using Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) models comprised of twelve predictor variables, including overall trend, time of day/year, wind speed/direction, temperature and traffic volume. The introduction of the ULEZ expedited reductions in NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 abundance, aligning with existing research, alongside reductions in nucleation mode UFP abundance and concomitant increases in O3, Aitken and accumulation mode UFP abundance. The implementation of COVID-19 restrictions expedited an increase/decrease in O3/NO2 respectively through the typical OX couple chemistry. The use of BRT models accounts for changes in the predictor variables, thereby showing that changes in atmospheric composition are not wholly a reflection of seasonality, meteorology or anthropogenic activity. The findings indicate the introduction of both ULEZ and COVID-19 restrictions precipitated a reduction in ambient concentrations of larger particulate matter (i.e. PM10, and PM2.5) and larger modes of UFPs (i.e Accumulation and Aitken), alongside increasing concentrations of nucleation mode particles. The findings reinforce the necessity of examining the impact of interventions on atmospheric composition, including changes in the abundance of secondary pollutants."
10.1016/j.atmosenv.2025.121688,True,Atmospheric Environment,该研究论文探讨了在韩国实现碳中和的背景下，移动源排放减少对臭氧的影响。论文使用GEOS-Chem全球三维化学传输模型，模拟了不同情景下移动源氮氧化物（NOx）和挥发性有机物（VOCs）减排对臭氧浓度的影响。研究发现，即使在移动源氮氧化物排放减少的情况下，韩国主要城市的臭氧生成机制仍然处于氮氧化物饱和或过渡状态。此外，仅减少韩国的氮氧化物排放会导致臭氧浓度升高，而同时减少韩国和中国的氮氧化物和挥发性有机物排放，可以更有效地减少臭氧超标天数。虽然论文没有直接提及卫星观测或特定的遥感技术，但其研究内容与大气成分分析和空气质量监测密切相关，特别是通过模型模拟来评估排放变化对大气成分的影响，这与大气环境遥感技术在应用层面上是相关的。,"['Tropospheric ozone', 'Nitrogen oxides (NOx)', 'Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Emission reduction', 'Chemical transport model']",Yohan Yang;Hyeong-Ahn Kwon;Xiaomeng Jin,Effects of mobile emission reduction on ozone under future carbon neutrality scenarios in Korea,"•O3increased under 40 % NOx/VOC mobile emission reduction scenarios for the carbon neutrality. •NOx-saturated or transitional O3production regime in urban areas maintained despite 40 % reduction in mobile NOxemissions. •Mobile NOxand VOC reductions increased O3and exceedance days in the SMA. •Both NOx-VOC reductions in South Korea and China reduced O3exceedances more than Korea-only reduction. 
 Tropospheric ozone (O3), formed through photochemical reactions between volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx ≡ NO + NO2), poses detrimental risks to health and ecosystems. In South Korea, the fourth-highest maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O3 concentrations have increased from 53 to 89 ppbv over the past three decades, and the implementation of the carbon neutrality strategy in South Korea is expected to alter emissions of O3 precursors (NOx, VOCs). In particular, emission changes in the transportation sector can affect ozone concentrations in densely populated urban areas, thereby impacting public health outcomes. Therefore, we investigate O3 responses to transportation decarbonization using a global 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) under mobile NOx and VOCs emission reduction scenarios. Across all scenarios involving 40 % reductions in mobile NOx emissions in South Korea, with additional VOC reductions and expanded coverage to China in some cases, MDA8 O3 concentrations increased. Furthermore, O3 production regimes in South Korea remain NOx-saturated or transitional in major cities despite NOx reductions, while suburban and remote forested regions are becoming more limited by NOx availability. NOx-only mobile emission reductions led to substantial MDA8 O3 increases (up to 4.7 ppbv) and additional six exceedance days compared to results from the control run, whereas concurrent VOCs reductions mitigated both the magnitude (2.7 ppbv) and the number of ozone exceedance days. Also, emission reductions for both NOx and VOC in South Korea and China resulted in reducing O3 exceedance days in May–July compared to results implemented only in South Korea, highlighting the importance of transboundary VOC mitigation."

 Pre-monsoon season (March–April–May, MAM) constitutes the primary heat season across the Indian Peninsula (0°–40°N, 60°–100°E), marked by frequent occurrences of extreme surface air temperature (SAT) events. These extreme heat conditions not only impact regional climate but may also propagate remotely to East Asia via atmospheric teleconnections. Despite their significance, the monthly evolution of SAT over the Indian Peninsula and its governing mechanisms remain inadequately quantified. This study investigates the monthly variability of pre-monsoon SAT over the Indian Peninsula during the period 1970–2024, emphasizing synergistic roles of internal atmospheric dynamics and sea surface temperature (SST) forcing. Results show that SAT anomalies in March and April exhibit a spatially coherent pattern across the the peninsula, associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and North Pacific Oscillation (NPO), respectively. Notably, April SAT anomalies are further modulated by SST anomalies south of Greenland through wave-mean flow interactions. In contrast, May SAT anomalies display a distinct east–west dipole pattern, characterized by opposing SAT anomalies between northwestern (22°–40°N, 60°–82°E) and eastern (10°–30°N, 82°–100°E) peninsula sectors. The May dipole arises from a “Z-shaped” SST anomaly pattern in the eastern Pacific, which initiates a Rossby wave train. During its propagation across Greenland, this wave train undergoes amplification via air–sea coupling with local SST anomalies, ultimately intensifying downstream impacts on the Indian Peninsula."

 The aerosol extinction coefficient (AEC) is a significant contributor to uncertainties in visibility predictions. The visibility diagnostic algorithm (S1) utilized in the China Meteorological Administration Mesoscale Model (CMA-MESO) does not incorporate the AEC, leading to an inadequate representation of aerosol impacts on visibility, particularly during haze events, which diminishes the effectiveness of visibility forecasts. In this study, the AEC has been integrated into the model's calculations to enhance the accuracy of visibility predictions. Two optimization schemes for the visibility diagnostic algorithm have been proposed: one based on historical observational data from monitoring station (S2), and another that calculates the AEC using haze model forecast data (S3). A comparative evaluation of the visibility forecasting capabilities of the three schemes (S1, S2, and S3) was conducted, focusing on their spatial-temporal characteristics. The findings indicate that for the visibility range of 1-3 km, the original S1 scheme already performs well in terms of the Threat Score(TS), owing to the CMA-MESO model's good forecasting ability for precipitation and fog; however, the S3 scheme demonstrates a more advantageous TS score. For visibility range of 3-5 km and 5-10 km, the S3 scheme demonstrated strong forecasting capability, performing well in errors reduction and TS scores improvement, compared to the S1 scheme, the annual mean error (ME), normalized mean bias (NMB), and root mean square error (RMSE) decreased by 56.88 %, 67.73 %, and 65.97 %, respectively. The performance of the S2 and S3 schemes varies across different regions and seasons in China. The S2 scheme performs well in improving the TS scores across six regions, with the performance in spring and slightly weaker results in summer and autumn. The S3 scheme demonstrates a stronger ability to reduce visibility forecast errors in northern regions than in southern regions."
