This editorial synthesizes findings from 35 interdisciplinary studies featured in this focus issue, which collectively advance our understanding of permafrost degradation dynamics and their cascading impacts. The contributions span a wide range of spatial scales from site-level process studies to regional syntheses. The studies encompass critical research scopes, including thaw processes, hydrology-ecosystem interactions, biogeochemical feedback, and emerging techniques in monitoring and modeling (e.g. AI and machine learning). Collectively, these studies highlight the critical importance of integrative, cross-disciplinary approaches for characterizing and understanding permafrost vulnerability. These studies also underscore the need for sustained investment in observational networks, methodological innovation, and coordinated synthesis efforts to improve predictive capabilities and understand long-term consequences of permafrost thaw and the associated adaptive responses in a rapidly evolving cryosphere."
10.1088/1748-9326/adfcec,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注布基纳法索被忽视和未充分利用的植物物种（NUS）生产系统的特征和社会经济表现。它旨在通过调查和统计分析，识别不同的NUS生产系统，并评估其对当地生计和粮食安全的影响。论文侧重于农业多样性、气候适应性和市场导向的NUS生产，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,[],Quanli Wang;Eric Brako Dompreh;Blandine Marie Ivette Nacoulma;Miyuki Iiyama;Kangbéni Dimobe;Mohammad Naushad Emmambux;Mame Samba Mbaye;Adjima Thiombiano;Alexandros Gasparatos,Characteristics and socioeconomic performance of neglected and underutilized plant species (NUS) production systems in Burkina Faso,"Agricultural systems in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are often characterized by low agrodiversity and high vulnerability to climate change, both of which can compromise food security and livelihoods. Many neglected and underutilized plant species (NUS) are known for their nutritional value and climate resilience, presenting a potential solution to conserve agrodiversity and contribute to local livelihoods and food security. However, NUS is commonly used as an umbrella term, obscuring potential differentiation between NUS systems in terms of their characteristics and socioeconomic performance. Here we characterize NUS production systems in three regions of Burkina Faso, a country experiencing food insecurity, poverty and arid and semi-arid climatic conditions, where many local communities rely on NUS for their food and livelihoods. We conducted 432 in-person surveys with households cultivating NUS on farms and/or collecting from the wild. Using principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis we identify three distinct NUS production systems: NUS cultivation on farms predominantly for market sales (Cluster 1), NUS collection from the wild predominantly for market sales (Cluster 2), and NUS collection from the wild predominantly for self-consumption (Cluster 3). Through propensity score matching we identify that households in Cluster 1 had better socioeconomic performance compared to the other two clusters across all five income and food security variables considered here. However, there are no significant differences in the socioeconomic performance of Clusters 2 and 3. Our results indicate that: (a) NUS systems are not homogenous but can have a high degree of differentiation; (b) NUS are not solely emergency resources during severe food insecurity periods, (c) many NUS producers exhibit strong market orientation. Such findings can provide nuance in the current debates on whether and how can NUS provide promising alternatives to the other more widely produced crops in SSA."

Post-event analyses often assess the rarity of events from historical observations, and a growing number of studies attempt to attribute the event’s severity to anthropogenic warming. Recent studies also advocate for the creation of ‘what if’ event storylines to explore the consequences if an observed event turned out to be worse. However, few studies have harmonized these different approaches when conducting retrospective analyses of hydrological extremes. Climate change attribution including river flows also remains rare. Here, a framework for post-event analyses of hydrological extremes is demonstrated using the winter half-year 2023/24 UK river flooding as a case study. Persistent high river flows were observed across the UK and western Europe, following on from notable winter floods in 2013/14, 2015/16 and 2019/20. The ‘ClimaMeter’ analogue-based attribution suggests that a 6 month period with similar atmospheric circulation patterns to the observed winter half-year 2023/24 has become warmer and wetter (by an average 8.8%) in 1945–2021 compared with 1850–1925. Monthly river flow reconstructions extended back to 1850 show that river flows during the analogue periods in the recent past have also become 13.5% higher. Applying the UNSEEN approach by pooling seasonal hindcasts show the potential for river flows to be 46% higher than the baseline in a worst-case storyline. Finally, hydrological simulations driven by a single-model initial-condition large ensemble suggest that when accounting for internal variability, a robust climate signal in winter half-year river flows has emerged for some areas but may remain concealed until the mid-21st century and beyond. Our results contribute to the use of storyline approaches in post-event analysis and highlight the changing risk of winter flooding in the UK. This framework can be applied to future hydrological extremes both in the UK and elsewhere to inform long-term planning for climate adaptation."

Topographic controls on hydrological and ecological conditions impact methane (CH4) fluxes, contributing to uncertainty in local and regional CH4 budgets and underlying drivers. The objective of this study was to explore CH4 fluxes and their drivers in a transitioning boreal forest-fen ecosystem (Goldstream Valley, Alaska, USA). This landscape is characterized by thawing discontinuous permafrost and heterogeneous mosaics of fens, collapse-scar channels, and small mounds of permafrost soils. From a survey in July 2021, observed chamber CH4 fluxes included fen areas with intermediate to very high emissions (29.8–635.3 mg CH4 m−2 d−1), clustered locations with CH4 uptake (−2.11 to −0.7 mg CH4 m−2 d−1), and three anomalous emission hotspots (342.4–772.4 mg CH4 m−2 d−1) that were located near samples with lower emissions. Some surface and near-surface variables partially explained the spatial variation in CH4 flux. Log-transformed CH4 flux had a positive linear relationship with soil moisture at 20 cm depth (R2 = 0.31, p-value < 1e-5) and negative linear relationships with microtopography (R2 = 0.13, p-value < 0.006) and slope (R2 = 0.28, p-value < 2e-5). Methane emissions generally occurred in flat, wet, graminoid-dominated fens, whereas CH4 uptake occurred on permafrost mounds dominated by feather mosses and woody vegetation. However, the CH4 hotspots occurred on drier, slightly sloped locations with low or undetectable near-surface methanogen abundance, suggesting that CH4 was produced in deeper soils. When the hotspot samples were omitted, log-transformed CH4 flux had a positive linear relationship with near-surface methanogen abundance (R2 = 0.29, p-value = 0.0023), and stronger linear relationships with soil moisture, slope, and soil macronutrient concentrations. Our findings suggest that some CH4 emission hotspots could arise from CH4 in deep taliks. The inference that methanogenesis occurs in deep taliks was strengthened by the identification of intrapermafrost taliks across the study area using low-frequency geophysical induction. This study assesses surface spatial heterogeneity in the context of subsurface permafrost conditions and highlights the complexity of CH4 flux patterns in transitioning forest-wetland ecosystems. To better inform regional CH4 budgets, further research is needed to understand the spatial distribution of terrestrial CH4 hotspots and to resolve their surface, near-surface, and subsurface drivers."

We apply the Global Change Analysis Model to explore the continent’s energy–land–water systems under four scenarios: a business-as-usual (BAU) and three net-zero scenarios targeting 2050 (NZ50), 2070 (NZ70), and 2100 (NZ100). Our analysis quantifies how the pace of decarbonization influences Africa’s interconnected energy, land, and water systems. Without new climate policy (BAU), Africa’s net CO2 emissions could increase by nearly six-fold; from 1.8 GtCO2 yr−1 in 2020 to 10.4 GtCO2 yr−1 by 2100. All net-zero scenarios constrain this growth, with NZ50, NZ70, and NZ100 achieving net-zero emissions by their respective target years through deployment of multiple carbon dioxide removal approaches (e.g. BECCS). Across all scenarios, primary energy supply expands, but its composition shifts under net-zero conditions. Over 2020–2100, renewables account for an average of 49%–53% of primary energy in the net-zero cases, displacing fossil fuels. Net-zero pathways also drive land-use shifts, reducing cropland area by 29%–31% and lowering water demand for food crops by 14%–15%, while increasing water use for BECCS (∼0.9 km3 yr−1 in NZ50). These land constraints raise staple food prices, averaging $1.16 kg−1 in NZ50—about 96% above BAU—with the steepest increase in Western Africa. In terms of mitigation cost, NZ50 is the most expensive pathway ($78 tCO2−1), compared to $68 tCO2−1 in NZ100. While earlier action enables deeper emissions cuts and faster clean energy transitions, it also imposes higher economic and resource trade-offs. Delayed net-zero deadlines reduce near-term disruption but result in higher cumulative emissions. Given Africa’s development context, we argue that net-zero timelines must balance technical feasibility with economic realities and social justice."

DRP, the most bioavailable form of phosphorus, stimulates algal proliferation directly, serving as a major driver of eutrophication, thereby threatening water quality degradation and freshwater sustainability. However, quantifying DRP loads and tracing their sources remains challenging due to landscape heterogeneity and the dynamic nature of precipitation events. In this study, a daily time-step DRP transport model was constructed for the entire Yamato River catchment (1077 km2), utilizing the Soil and Water Assessment Tool. A total of 106 weekly water quality samples, collected from January 2023 to December 2024, were analyzed for DRP concentrations and used for model calibration and validation. Results reveal that DRP fluxes are predominantly event-driven, with peak discharges closely associated with intense rainfall events. Non-point source (NPS) DRP loading, particularly from agricultural fields, was observed during rainfall, regardless of soil type or phosphorus adsorption capacity. These NPS contributions affect ecosystem vulnerability and closely correlate with environmental stability. Scenario analysis demonstrates that implementing deep fertilization practices can reduce annual NPS DRP loading by approximately 32% and lower peak loads during rainfall events by 28%. This study enhances the understanding of NPS DRP dynamics by identifying specific landscape characteristics linked to eutrophication risk, providing essential scientific guidance for targeted mitigation strategies. These findings are particularly important for enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of environmental management strategies in the context of future climate change."

Despite reports of increasing heat-related death rates, robust epidemiological evidence on the health impacts of high temperatures, as well as the effects of low temperatures, remains scarce, particularly outside of urban settlements in Caribbean SIDS. In this study, we conducted a case time-series study on municipality-level mortality and temperature in Puerto Rico from 2015–2023. We modeled the relationship between daily mortality count and mean temperature using a conditional quasi-Poisson regression, combined with a distributed lag non-linear model (dlnm) with a 21 d lag, adjusting for relative humidity, seasonality, and day of the week. We estimated the minimum mortality temperature (MMT)—the optimal temperature associated with the lowest mortality risk—and calculated the relative risk associated with extreme low and high temperature, defined as the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of daily temperature. Additionally, we estimated the municipality- and island-level excess mortality fractions attributable to both low and high temperatures, relative to MMT. Our findings indicate that exposure to non-optimum temperatures (both low and high temperatures) is significantly associated with increased mortality risk. Specifically, extreme low temperature was associated with a 1.23 (95% CI: 1.07–1.40) times risk of all-cause mortality, while extreme high temperature was associated with a 1.16 (95% CI: 1.05–1.27) times risk. We estimated that temperature-related mortality accounted for 3.88% of the total 280 568 deaths (95% eCI: 3.39%–4.29%), with low temperatures contributing 2.02% (95% eCI: 1.69%–2.32%) and high temperatures contributing 1.86% (95% eCI: 1.35%–2.35%). Furthermore, we found substantial spatial variability in temperature-related mortality burdens across municipalities. Our study identifies the vulnerable municipalities to temperature-related deaths in Puerto Rico, providing evidence to inform municipality-specific climate adaptation and mitigation strategies."

In this study, we employ observational analysis from 1950–2023 to show that the sea surface temperature interhemispheric dipole in winter (SSTIDw) has a strong influence on SSR. A positive SSTIDw anomaly-marked by relatively warmer Northern Hemisphere sea surface temperatures-persists through spring to summer and leads to persistent negative surface pressure anomalies and anomalous cyclonic circulation. This intensifies the Saharan heat low and reinforces anomalous westerly and southwesterly flows across the Atlantic and the Guinea Coast, enhancing moisture flux convergence and rainfall in the Sahel. Based on this relationship, we develop an SSTIDw-based linear regression model that skillfully captures SSR characteristics. These findings highlight the multi-month lead time predictability of SSR, which is critical for climate-informed decision making in the Sahel."

Tomkins;Sandra E. Yuter;Matthew A. Miller;Mariko Oue;Charles N. Helms,Synthesis of surface snowfall rates and  radar-observed storm structures in  10+ years of northeastern US winter storms,"This study investigates how radar-detected snow bands relate to snowfall rates during winter storms in the northeastern United States. Using over a decade of data, we found that snow bands are not consistently linked to heavy snowfall at the surface, as snow particles are often dispersed by wind before reaching the ground. These findings highlight limitations of using radar reflectivity for predicting snow rates and suggest focusing on radar echo duration to better understand snowfall patterns. 
 Winter storms can cause disruptions in the densely populated regions of the northeastern United States. Mesoscale snow bands embedded within winter storms are often the main focus of snowfall forecasts and analyses. While primary bands are associated with frontogenesis, multi-bands are found in environments with both frontogenesis and frontolysis. This study investigates the relationship between observed surface snowfall rates and local enhancements in radar reflectivity (i.e., mesoscale snow bands) using data from 264 storm days over 11 winter seasons (2012–2023). We compare hourly surface snowfall rates obtained by National Weather Service (NWS) Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) weather stations with the area × time fractions of locally enhanced reflectivity features and of all echoes passing over the 25 km radius of the surface observation. Our analysis focuses on non-orographic snowstorms with surface winds < 5 m s−1.Our findings show that most of the time snow rates are low (75 % of hours had liquid-equivalent snow rates less than 1 mm h−1). Heavy snow rates (>2.5 mm h−1 liquid equivalent) are rare (<4 % of observations). When enhanced reflectivity features pass over a location, only 1 out of 4 h have heavy surface snow rates. High-spatial-resolution vertical cross-sections from airborne radar obtained during the NASA Microphysics and Precipitation for Atlantic Coast-Threatening Snowstorms (IMPACTS) field campaign and rapid-update range-height indicators (RHIs) from ground-based radar demonstrate that enhanced reflectivity features in snow aloft are tilted and smeared on their way to the surface as their constituent snow particles are dispersed laterally by the horizontal winds within the storm. The duration of all snow echo over a location is useful in determining where higher snowfall accumulations may occur."

The ion-induced fraction was much higher in the clean boreal forest. However, earlier activation of charged particles and high ion-induced fraction during quiet NPF in the megacity site imply a non-negligible role for ion-induced NPF in polluted urban areas. 
 Air ions play a crucial role in new particle formation (NPF), which in turn has the potential to influence global climate and air quality. We conducted a comparative analysis of air ions in three size ranges (0.8–2 nm cluster ions, 2–7 nm intermediate ions, and 7–20 nm large ions) at two flagship sites: the Station for Measuring Ecosystem-Atmosphere Relations II (SMEAR II) site in a boreal forest of Finland and the Station for Observing Regional Processes of the Earth System (SORPES) site in a megacity of eastern China. Air ion number size distributions (0.8–42 nm) were measured using a Neutral cluster and Air Ion Spectrometer (NAIS) at these two sites from June 2019–August 2020. At both sites, rising temperatures reduced the difference between positive and negative cluster ion concentrations, likely due to the enhanced convection and turbulent mixing that diminish the Earth's electrode effect. The median cluster ion concentration at SMEAR II (1270 cm−3) was approximately six times higher than at SORPES (220 cm−3), which was caused by the high coagulation sink in the urban area. The median large-ion concentration at SORPES was nearly three times higher (197 cm−3) than that at SMEAR II (67 cm−3), which is due to the high number density of neutral aerosol particles facilitating ion attachment in the polluted megacity environment. The cluster ion concentration was negatively associated with the condensation sink (CS) at both sites, with a significantly stronger negative correlation at SORPES, suggesting that the CS was a decisive factor for reducing the cluster ion concentrations in this urban area. The median formation rates of 2 nm ions at SMEAR II (J2-: 0.033 cm-3s-1, J2+: 0.041 cm-3s-1) were similar to those at SORPES (J2-: 0.028 cm-3s-1, J2+: 0.025 cm-3s-1). The median ion-induced fractions were 19.9 % and 1.3 % at SMEAR II and SORPES, respectively, indicating a minor contribution of ions to NPF in polluted environments. Nevertheless, the charged particles were activated earlier than neutral particles at SORPES, indicating that the ion-induced nucleation could precede neutral nucleation in this polluted environment. In addition, the contribution of ion-induced nucleation at SORPES was higher at low NPF intensity, implying the non-negligible roles of air ions in urban aerosol production. This study underscores the need for long-term observations of air ions in both pristine boreal forests and polluted urban environments."

 Nitrate plays an important role in the Earth system and air quality. A key challenge in simulating the life cycle of nitrate aerosol in global models is to accurately represent mass size distribution of nitrate aerosol. In this study, we evaluate the performance of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 2 (E3SMv2) and the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2), along with Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) phase III models, in simulating spatial distribution of fine-mode nitrate, the mass size distribution of fine- and coarse-mode nitrate, and the gas–aerosol partitioning between nitric acid gas and nitrate, using long-term ground-based observations and measurements from multiple aircraft campaigns. We find that most models underestimate the annual mean PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 µm) nitrate surface concentration averaged over all sites. The observed nitrate PM2.5 / PM10 and PM1 / PM4 ratios are influenced by the relative contribution of fine sulfate or organic particles and coarse dust or sea salt particles. Overall, the ground-based observations give an annual mean surface nitrate PM2.5 / PM10 ratio of 0.7. Most models underestimate the annual mean PM2.5 / PM10 ratio in all regions. There are large spreads in the modeled nitrate PM1 / PM4 ratios, which span the full range from 0 to 1. Most models underestimate the surface molar ratio of nitrate to total inorganic nitrate averaged across all sites. Our study indicates the importance of gas–aerosol partition parameterization and the simulation of dust and sea salt in correctly simulating the mass size distribution of nitrate."

Using idealized baroclinic life cycle experiments with the ICON model, this study demonstrates that moisture and cloud processes amplify GW activity, driving strong shear and turbulence in the LMS. These findings highlight the critical role of GWs in shaping the dynamics in the LMS, particularly for clear air turbulence. 
 Mixing significantly influences the redistribution of trace species in the lower stratosphere, potentially being the dominant factor in forming the extratropical transition layer (ExTL). However, the role of small-scale processes contributing to mixing is poorly characterized. In the extratropics, mixing processes are often linked to stratosphere–troposphere exchange (STE), which occurs frequently during baroclinic life cycles, e.g., near tropopause folds, cut-off lows, or stratospheric streamers. Gravity waves (GWs), a dynamical feature of these life cycles, can potentially contribute to STE and mixing in the lower stratosphere. We present a series of baroclinic life cycle experiments with the ICOsahedral Non-hydrostatic (ICON) model to study the impact of GWs on the occurrence of vertical wind shear and consequent potential turbulence, an indicator for mixing in the lowermost stratosphere (LMS). Dry adiabatic simulations with varying spatial resolution reveal that the spatiotemporal occurrence of GWs depends on the model grid spacing and is closely linked to shear and turbulence generation. Further process understanding is gained from experiments incorporating physical processes like latent heating, (vertical) turbulence, and cloud microphysics. Introducing moist processes amplifies GW activity and turbulence potential, mainly driven by latent heat release and stronger baroclinic wave evolution with vigorous vertical motions. Turbulence parameterization has a lesser effect on the overall evolution without moisture, whereas it dampens the effect of latent heat release in moist simulations. Altogether, GWs substantially enhance vertical shear and potential turbulence occurrence in the LMS and thus can play a significant role in tracer mixing and, consequently, in the ExTL formation."

Tai,Effects of enhancing nitrogen use efficiency in cropland and livestock systems on agricultural ammonia emissions and particulate matter air quality in China,"Through a combination of emission models and air quality models, this study aims to address the pressing issue of poor nitrogen management while promoting sustainable food systems and public health in China. We discovered that improving nitrogen management of crops and livestock can substantially reduce air pollutant emissions, particularly in the North China Plain. Our findings further provide the benefits of such interventions for PM2.5 reductions, offering valuable insights for policymakers. 
 Chinese agriculture has long been characterized by low nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) associated with substantial ammonia (NH3) loss, which contributes significantly to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution. However, the knowledge gaps in the spatiotemporal patterns of NH3 emissions and the states of nitrogen management of agricultural systems render it challenging to evaluate the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies and policies. Here, we explore the NH3 mitigation potential of various agricultural NUE-improving scenarios and their subsequent effects on PM2.5 pollution in China. We developed and used a combination of bottom-up emission models and a nitrogen mass flow model to evaluate the NUE of different crop and livestock types at the provincial scale in China. We generated gridded NH3 emission input to drive a chemical transport model to provide an integrated assessment of the air quality impacts of four improved nitrogen management scenarios. The total agricultural NH3 emission of China was estimated to be 11.2 Tg NH3 in 2017, of which 46.2 % and 53.8 % are attributable to fertilizer use and livestock animal waste, respectively. Our results show that grain crops have higher NUE than fruits and vegetables, while high livestock NUE can be found in pork and poultry. We also found that by implementing different mitigation scenarios, agricultural NH3 emissions can be effectively reduced by 11.6 %–39.3 %. Consequently, annual population-weighted PM2.5 reductions were estimated to be 1.3–4.1 µg m−3. Our results provide decision support for policymaking concerning agricultural NH3 emissions and their public health impacts."

Zhang;Nuanliang Zhu,Covariability of dynamics and composition in the Asian monsoon tropopause layer from satellite observations and reanalysis products,"Swirling above summer storms, the Asian monsoon anticyclone functions as both gateway and gatekeeper to moisture entering the stratosphere. Although well monitored from space since 2005, many details of the anticyclone and the air that flows through it remain mysterious. Reanalyses, which combine model output and observations, may help to address how and why but only if they reliably capture the what and where of water vapor variations. Current reanalyses are beginning to meet these criteria. 
 The upper-level anticyclone above the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) greatly influences variations in stratospheric water vapor, which in turn have significant effects on climate. An impending data gap underscores the need to evaluate the reliability of recent reanalysis products in this region. Here, we describe three leading modes of deseasonalized water vapor variability in the tropopause layer (147–68 hPa) above the ASM. The first mode describes regional-scale moist or dry anomalies that peak in the lower stratosphere on interannual scales. Separating this mode into linear trend and detrended components, we find that the spatial pattern and sign of the trend disagree between observations and reanalyses. These discrepancies arise from different responses in the upper troposphere despite broad agreement in the lower stratosphere. Regional water vapor budgets suggest that the stratospheric trend originates outside the monsoon region, beyond our analysis domain. Interannual variability is more consistent, and arises mainly from the pre-monsoon influence of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. The second mode features anomalies arcing around the northern flank of the anticyclone with weaker opposing anomalies in the southeast, while the third mode features a horizontal dipole oriented east to west. These two modes often vary in quadrature as quasi-biweekly waves propagate across the region but also vary independently when other modes of convective variability manifest in similar areas. Despite lingering questions on the linear trend, mean biases, and data assimilation effects, the consistency between observation- and reanalysis-derived variability demonstrates that reanalyses are increasingly able to capture the processes controlling water vapor near the tropopause."

Ristovski,Measurement report: Aerosol and cloud nuclei properties along the Central and Northern Great Barrier Reef – impact of continental emissions,"Aerosols play a role in global climate by interacting with incoming solar radiation and by taking up water vapour from the atmosphere to form clouds. Enhancing local-scale cloud cover can reduce sea surface temperatures. Coral bleaching events have increased in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) as sea surface temperatures have risen. Our study found that the number of aerosols and the cloud-forming ability over the GBR increased if the aerosols were transported from inland Australia rather than the ocean. 
 The frequency of coral bleaching events increased during the past decade in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) due to climate change, and rising ocean temperatures. Recent work has demonstrated that enhancing local-scale cloud albedo can reduce the sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in this region. However, little research has been done on variations in the aerosol properties, as well as aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions over different regions of the GBR, which is critical for predicting the potential for marine cloud brightening (MCB) climate forcing on a local or regional scale. Here, we examined trends in the aerosol population in terms of their physical and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) properties during a research cruise in the Central and Northern GBR. Overall higher particle number concentrations, CCN number concentrations, and CCN activation ratios were observed during periods where the air masses passed over the continent prior to reaching the research vessel, despite lower hygroscopicity parameters. We suggest that organics contribute considerably to CCN number concentrations in this region of the GBR, which highlight the important role of additional emissions from inland Queensland. As well as the total aerosol number concentration, precipitation history along the back trajectory affected CCN number concentrations. These results represent a first step towards building a climatological understanding of aerosol and CCN properties over the GBR during summertime, a region and season where no observations have been previously reported."

This study isolates fire-specific PM2.5 from observations, showing its increasing proportion in recent years. Our findings indicate that fire-specific PM2.5 disproportionately affects impoverished populations in the Asia Pacific. Furthermore, we suggest that, under future climate change, fire-specific PM2.5 will likely continue rising. This highlights the need for interventions to reduce fire-related air pollution and its health impacts. 
 Forest and vegetation fires are major sources of air pollution and have triggered air quality issues in many regions of Asia. Measures to reduce fires may be a significant yet under-recognized option for efficiently improving air quality and preventing related premature deaths. Here we isolate fire-specific fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from monitoring concentrations using an observation-driven approach in the region. Fire-specific PM2.5 concentrations average 2–15 µg m−3 during the fire season, with higher values in Southeast Asia (SEA), Northeast Asia (NEA), and northern India. The total PM2.5 in the Asia Pacific region exhibits a rapid declining trend from 2014 to 2021, while fire-specific PM2.5 decreases in early years but begins to reverse in SEA and NEA. The proportions of fire-specific PM2.5 increase in NEA from 0.2 to 0.3 during the fire season and increase in SEA from 0.2 in 2018 to 0.4 in 2021. Fire-specific PM2.5 exposure caused 58 000 (95 % confidence interval (CI) of 32 600–82 600), 90 000 (95 % CI of 63 700–106 000), 157 000 (95 % CI of 110 000–186 000), and 29 300 (95 % CI of 18 000–39 700) premature deaths annually in SEA, East Asia (EA), Central Asia (CA), and NEA, respectively, accounting for 40.9 % (95 % CI of 22.8 %–57.7 %), 14.9 % (95 % CI of 10.5 %–17.6 %), 19.4 % (95 % CI of 13.5 %–24.5 %), and 24.1 % (95 % CI of 14.8 %–32.5 %) of the numbers caused by the total PM2.5. Analysis of infant mortality rate data and PM2.5 exposure indicates that the total PM2.5 exposure had a greater impact in richer areas, while fire-specific PM2.5 exposure affected more populations in poorer regions. Based on the positive correlation between vapor pressure deficit and fire-specific PM2.5, this study suggests that, without further regulation and policy intervention, the emerging growth trend of fire-specific PM2.5 in the Asia Pacific region is likely to continue under the influence of future climate change."

Using data from NASA's ACTIVATE campaign, we compared measurements from the Turbulent Air Motion Measurement System (TAMMS) and diode laser hygrometer (DLH) aboard a Falcon aircraft with dropsondes from a King Air, matching data points based on location and time using statistical methods. The study showed strong agreement, confirming the reliability of these methods for advancing climate models. 
 Airborne measurements of wind speed and direction, temperature, and relative humidity are critical due to their importance for atmospheric processes. Field campaigns with multiple coordinated aircraft present challenges when combining data from each platform due to atmospheric heterogeneity. To confront this issue, this work intercompares for the first time in situ measurements from the Turbulent Air Motion Measurement System (TAMMS) of horizontal winds and temperature and a diode laser hygrometer (relative humidity) deployed on an HU-25 Falcon flying mostly within the marine boundary layer to an independent set of measurements from dropsondes launched from a higher-flying King Air. Leveraging data from 162 joint flights over the northwest Atlantic from these two spatially coordinated aircraft during the NASA Aerosol Cloud meTeorology Interactions oVer the western ATlantic Experiment (ACTIVATE) campaign in winter and summer seasons between 2020–2022, a total of 555 pairs of Falcon–dropsonde data points are identified within 30 km horizontal separation, with minimal vertical separation (usually < 1 m), and within 15 min. This analysis is based on the following range of conditions experienced: altitude = ∼ 0.1–5 km, temperature = −19–27 °C, relative humidity = 1 %–100 %, and wind speed = 0.2–42 m s−1. Based on scatterplots, correlation coefficients, and mean (in situ–dropsonde) error (ME), intercomparisons reveal good agreement for wind speed (r = 0.95, ME = 0.21 ± 1.68 m s−1), u/v wind components (r ∼ 0.96–0.97, ME ∼ 0.03–0.16 (± 1.62–1.67) m s−1), wind direction (r = 0.94, ME = 0.00 ± 0.22 based on cosine of direction angles), temperature (r = 0.99, ME = 0.00 ± 0.71 °C), and relative humidity (r = 0.91, ME = −3.86 ± 10.74 %). Sensitivity analysis shows that binning data into categories of horizontal separation distance, clear versus cloud, winter versus summer, altitude range, and terciles of the values for examined variables did not yield major changes except for relative humidity where there was more deviation, especially above 70 %. The effect of statistics was examined by relaxing the vertical separation distance criteria to expand the number of pairs to over 360 000, without much difference in intercomparison metrics. The effect of averaging more points for each instrument in the final 555 pairs was also shown to lead to minimal change in agreement. Overall, these results provide confidence in both the performance of the measurement techniques compared and combining dropsonde data with in situ data from a separate coordinated aircraft for ACTIVATE, which has relevance to other campaigns with multiple coordinated aircraft conducting similar types of measurements."

Active radar is costly, so we focus on a more accessible approach. Using data from the Fengyun-3G satellite, we successfully tracked severe weather like Typhoon Khanun and heavy rainfall in Beijing in 2023. This method enhances global precipitation data and helps better understand extreme weather. 
 The Fengyun-3G satellite (FY-3G), China's first precipitation measurement satellite, was launched on 17 April 2023. FY-3G carries the advanced Multi-Channel Microwave Radiance Imager-Rainfall Measurement (MWRI-RM) system, which, compared to the previous GPM/GMI, includes more sounding channels. Additionally, a Ka/Ku-band dual-frequency Precipitation Measurement Radar (PMR) on board FY-3G provides 3D observations of severe precipitation systems. Due to the high cost and hardware limitations of precipitation radars, most precipitation-affected satellite observations rely on passive data. Deep learning methods have become effective tools to bridge these two types of observations. In this study, we propose a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to reconstruct PMR-Ku reflectivity profiles based on MWRI-RM multi-channel radiances across different precipitation scenarios and analyze the effects of dual oxygen absorption sounding channels and polarization differences (PDs) on reconstruction outcomes. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating dual oxygen absorption channels substantially improves reflectivity reconstruction accuracy, particularly over land (root mean square error reduction: 5.43 % ± 1.56 %) and coastal regions (5.47 % ± 1.17 %). In contrast, polarization differences provided only marginal improvements (0 %–1.6 % RMSE reduction), with statistical significance constrained within the uncertainty bounds of model training variability.  Validation against extreme precipitation events – including Typhoon Khanun (2023) and the “07.2023” (for July 2023)  Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) extreme rainfall event – confirms the operational value of dual oxygen channels in resolving three-dimensional precipitation structures. These enhancements not only improved accuracy but also enabled a more comprehensive three-dimensional representation of precipitation systems."

We compare the refractivity retrievals from three RO processing centers – each with their own retrieval algorithm – in the PBL, finding a strong underestimation of refractivity in regions with the strongest refractivity gradients, especially in Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) processing, as well as areas of weak overestimation of refractivity near the poles. 
 Global Navigation Satellite System radio occultation (GNSS RO) performance in the planetary boundary layer is strongly dependent on retrieval algorithms. In this work, we characterize differences in refractivity retrievals in the planetary boundary layer across three major processing centers of GNSS RO data – NASA JPL, ROM SAF, and UCAR. Using a shared base of occultations from the FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC-1 GNSS RO mission, we identify key differences between the three processing centers that are especially strong in the regions of frequent super-refraction. We find that the minimum penetration height allowed by each processing center is correlated with the amount of super-refraction, resulting in poorer penetration and higher refractivity biases in the tropics. We found JPL to have the most conservative minimum height in this region at 1 km, followed by ROM SAF (640 m) and UCAR (420 m). We identify two key geopotential heights – 0.8 and 2.6 km – to sample the global distribution of inter-center refractivity bias, finding differences of 0.3 %–0.5 % in the tropics. We also find negative refractivity biases of up to −4 % relative to ERA5 reanalysis in regions of persistent high stratocumulus coverage and areas along the descending branch of the Hadley circulation, with negligible bias along the Intertropical Convergence Zone. A comparison to ERA5 also reveals areas of weak (0.2 %–0.5 %) positive refractivity biases in polar regions. We hypothesize potential causes for these biases based on truncation schemes, radio-holographic filtering choices, and quality control and identify findings deserving of further investigation."

We evaluate sensitivity dependence on a relatively few key instrument parameters and show that when these are held constant, consistent performance is achieved. We show that the maximum sensitivity of a given flow tube reactor across various reagent ion chemistries is a constant, which aids in the quantification of compounds lacking analytical standards. 
 Chemical ionization mass spectrometers are widely used for the detection of trace gases, particularly in the field of atmospheric science. Depending on the analytes of interest, chemical ionization instruments are operated under varying reactor conditions, which can make it difficult to compare instrument performance, even for the same reagent ion chemistry. This variability leads to inconsistent sensitivity distributions, particularly for weakly bound or labile analytes. As a result, determining sensitivity – instrument response per unit analyte concentration – is challenging, even when comparing the same compound detected with the same reagent ion across different studies. To address this issue, we employed multiple Vocus AIM reactors (Tofwerk AG) to systematically identify the critical parameters affecting sensitivity in flow tube chemical ionization mass spectrometers. Controlling these parameters for a given reactor geometry can significantly reduce sensitivity variations across instruments and operators. We demonstrate that sensitivity normalized to reagent ion concentration serves as a fundamental metric for interpreting results from different datasets operating under uniform chemical ionization conditions, such as those within regional networks or other monitoring applications. Calibrating the sensitivity of benzene cations to a group of hydrocarbons, and comparing it to the sensitivity of iodide anions to levoglucosan, a molecule known to react near the collision limit, reveals that it is possible to map kinetic constraints on sensitivity from one ion mode polarity to another, as long as the critical parameters are held constant. Additionally, we show that collision-limited sensitivity relative to the reagent ion is nearly constant across different ionization mechanisms for a given reactor geometry and set of conditions. This consistency enables the determination of the upper limit of sensitivity, even for reagent ions where the specific molecules reacting at the collision limit are unknown. As a result, the use of the voltage-scanning approach can be extended to a broader range of reagent ion chemistries. This study highlights how collision-limited sensitivity can enhance our understanding of the relationships between different instruments and simplify calibration requirements across various reagent ion chemistries."

Currently heater emissions are not regulated as part of vehicle emissions, so this research was done to assess harmful gaseous and airborne particle emissions from them. Heaters were found to be major source of particles, especially when particles formed after combustion were accounted for, and large carbon monoxide emissions were also observed. 
 Fuel-operated auxiliary heaters (AHs) are potentially significant additional sources of particle- and gas-phase pollution from vehicles, but information on their emissions is scarce. In particular, an understanding of secondary aerosol formation originating from AH exhaust is lacking. In this study, we measured the gas and particle emissions, including secondary emissions, of diesel- and gasoline-operated AHs used in passenger cars. Investigation revealed the importance of peak emissions during start and shutdown events of the heaters and differences between emissions of gasoline- and diesel-fuelled AHs: gasoline-operated AHs also produced particles under steady-state operating conditions, while their diesel counterparts did not. Furthermore, ambient air temperature was observed to impact the emission profiles, with, for example, higher nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particle mass emissions but lower particle number (PN) emissions observed in outdoor (−19 to −7 °C)  measurements compared to laboratory measurements (+25 °C). However, further quantification is necessary to fully connect the temperature-related effects and AH emissions. Our findings highlight the importance of also characterizing the atmospherically aged aerosols, specifically secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation, which was simulated here both by an environmental chamber and by an oxidation flow reactor (OFR). The particle mass in photochemically aged aerosols surpassed the fresh exhaust particulate mass emissions by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude, with the increase depending mainly on fuel, combustion conditions, and ageing methods. Further research into formation pathways of secondary aerosols from precursors is still needed, along with the quantification of vehicle AH emissions at the fleet level, to enable the estimation of atmospheric and air quality effects of AH usage."

The GHG measurements are carried out in this region for the first time and used for satellite validation. 
 The Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau (QTP) is a key system that impacts the global carbon balance, but greenhouse gas (GHG) mole fraction measurements in this region are limited due to the tough environment. Supported by the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition Program, we carried out an integrated GHG measurement campaign in May 2022 as part of the Earth Summit Mission-2022 at the Qomolangma station for atmospheric and environmental observation and research (QOMS; 28.362° N, 86.949° E; 4276 m a.s.l.). In this study, the first GHG column-averaged mole fraction measurements (Xgas) at QOMS are presented, including XCO2, XCH4, XCO, and XN2O, derived from a ground-based Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR; Bruker EM27/SUN). We then compare them to surface in situ and satellite (the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument, TROPOMI, and the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, OCO-2) measurements. The mean FTIR XCO2 and XCH4 are 7.8 ppm and 97 ppb less than those near the surface, respectively. The difference between OCO-2 land nadir and EM27/SUN XCO2 measurements is 0.21 ± 0.98 ppm, which is consistent with OCO-2 retrieval uncertainty. However, a relatively large bias (1.21 ± 1.29 ppm) is found for OCO-2 glint XCO2 measurements, which is related to the surface albedos and surface altitudes. The EM27/SUN measurements indicate that the uncertainty in OCO-2 satellite XCO2 measurements is relatively large in the QTP mountain region, and its quality needs to be further assessed.

Haase;Nicholas J. Gianoutsos,Evaluating mass flow meter measurements from chambers for greenhouse gas emissions from orphan wells and other point sources,"This work demonstrates a simple approach for using mass flow meters connected to rigid chambers for measuring gas emissions rates in situations the meter cannot be attached directly, such as orphan oil and gas wells. This paper shows the results of performance testing, demonstrates common sources of uncertainty, and provides suggestions for how to use the approach to generate the best quality data. The findings can be used by researchers, the petroleum industry, regulators, and carbon markets. 
 This study evaluates the performance of a rigid gas flux chamber equipped with a mass flow meter (MFM) for measuring gas emissions from leaking orphan wells and similar pressure-driven gas point sources. We conducted a series of laboratory and field experiments to evaluate the sensitivity, stability, and dynamic range of an MFM chamber system and found an optimal method for sealing the chamber to the ground to isolate the emission source. From these results, we estimate the effects of different soil gas permeabilities on measurements and identify the uncertainty of environmental processes that can impact measurements. Simulations of an MFM chamber are compared to those of a dynamic flux chamber to contrast the data derived with both methodologies and illustrate the potential for measuring high variability leaks with the MFM chamber. Using a low flow resistance MFM and a chamber well-sealed to the ground, it is possible to measure leaks down to 1.08×10-3 cubic meters per hour (m3 h−1) (refenced to 25°/1 atm), corresponding to 0.77 grams per hour (g h−1) methane or 2.11 g h−1 carbon dioxide, with a mean uncertainty of 0.89 % relative standard deviation. Environmental processes such as heated gas inside the chamber from solar gain, wind blowing across the chamber vent, and changing humidity in the chamber, can cause variation in MFM measurements. Over 11 d of continuous monitoring under varying weather conditions, the standard deviation of the environmentally sourced signals was found to be 7.40×10-3 m3 h−1 (equivalent to or 5.27 g h−1 methane or 14.45 g h−1 carbon dioxide). Strategies to obtain the highest quality data from MFM chambers include burying the edges of the chamber below the surface sufficiently deep to seal the chamber edges against gas flow and soaking the dirt with water to lower the chances of escaping gases, while monitoring the gas flow and adjusting the chamber seal to achieve a maximum flow rate."

GRAIN is the first openly accessible, worldwide map of irrigation canals, and was built using community driven mapping efforts and machine learning. GRAIN contains data on nearly 4 million kilometers of canals, and this resource can support better water planning and agricultural management efforts by governments, researchers, and communities worldwide. 
 Despite supporting roughly 40 % of the world’s agricultural output, irrigation canal networks remain a critical data gap in global geospatial archives. Currently, there is no consistent geospatial database that documents the extent of surface-water irrigation canals. The GRAIN (Global Registry of Agricultural Irrigation Networks) dataset fills this gap by leveraging the potential of volunteered geographic information (VGI) from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and applying a machine learning based classification pipeline to distinguish canals from rivers and streams. A Random Forest classifier was trained on 20,000 samples of quality-controlled canal and river data using 5 engineered geometric and topographical features. The model achieved over 98 % training accuracy, translating to a ~93.6 % median recall on independent validation datasets for primary canals, with a mean positional offset of ~98 m. The GRAIN dataset includes land cover maps and OSM tags to assign canal use cases, identifying over 3.8 million km of agricultural irrigation canals in 95 countries. There is marked regional concentration of agricultural canals with hotspots identified in Europe, South and Southeast Asia, and North America. Agricultural canal distribution also varied widely by climatic zones with over 65 % in temperate and cold zones and approximately 22 % in arid regions. A canal density analysis normalized by cropland area highlighted smaller countries such as Finland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Egypt having the densest irrigation canals. While the global correlation between canal density and national cereal yields was found to be modest (r = 0.31), the GRAIN dataset suggests that the presence of well-developed surface-water infrastructure may positively influence agricultural productivity as seen in the Netherlands and New Zealand. GRAIN is now publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16786488 (Suresh and Hossain, 2025) under a CC-BY-4.0 licence. Designed as a community-driven resource, GRAIN data bridges a long-standing gap, and opens new possibilities for evaluating irrigation efficiency, supporting climate adaptation, guiding infrastructure investments, and extending the value of new satellite remote sensing missions on surface water such as the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT)."

 Argo profiles of temperature/salinity (T/S) at specific times and locations from January 2003 through December 2023 are mapped into monthly maps of steric sea level (SSL), thermosteric sea level (TSL), and Ocean Heat Content (OHC) anomalies at long wavelengths. The mapping uses a monthly satellite reference computed from the difference between satellite altimetry and gravimetry, so that in periods where there is not sufficient global Argo coverage (generally before 2007), the satellite estimate is used instead of a mean climatology. Longwave mapping is done to reduce large errors introduced by poor sampling of mesoscale eddies by the Argo floats. We demonstrate that on global- and basin-scales, the longwave mapping does not substantially affect calculations of mean SSL, TSL, or OHC changes. Monthly standard error maps from the mapping are also provided. These maps are intended for users interested in understanding global- and basin-scale sea level budgets, as well as understanding changes in ocean heat uptake."

The RW was analyzed (i) before and after the tertiary treatment (sand filtration and chlorination), (ii) during the storage period in secondary ponds before its use in irrigation, and (iii) directly in the droppers installed in four plastic-based greenhouses over 9 months. The results obtained in RW showed a bacterial concentration below the minimum required to reach class A (<10 CFU/100 mL, Regulation EU 2020/741), a reduction of the initial AB concentration (up to 13 ABs, total 4847 ± 1413 ng/L) of 58%, and no significant reduction of ARGs (Log units/100 mL: 16S rRNA (9.99 ± 0.80) > intI1 (8.80 ± 0.95) > blaCTX-M32 (7.53 ± 0.63) > sul1 (7.08 ± 1.05) > blaTEM (6.81 ± 1.05) > qnrS (5.72 ± 0.82)). The storage of RW was a hotspot only for bacteria; an increase in all concentrations was observed in both main and secondary reservoirs, demonstrating that direct RW reuse is the most beneficial option to avoid significant bacterial regrowth. In all greenhouse droppers’ systems, a significantly higher concentration of all bacteria was generally detected than in secondary reservoirs, demonstrating that this is another hotspot independent of whether the RW is used directly or not. Therefore, the RW storage and distribution may negatively affect the microbial water quality, while ABs and ARGs are detected along the entire scheme of urban wastewater reclamation and reuse, reaching the greenhouse environment (including soil and plants)."

However, its regulatory mechanisms in rhizospheric methane oxidation and biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) remain elusive. This study reveals a previously unrecognized function of IP: mediating methanotrophic nitrogen fixation through coupled aerobic methane oxidation and IP reduction (Fe-MOX). Using a hydroponic coculture system integrating methane-oxidizing bacteria and rice seedlings, we demonstrated that IP enhanced microbial methane oxidation by 46.8% and significantly stimulated BNF rate by 33.6%, with methane-derived carbon accounting for 89.1% of the BNF energy source. Notably, dissolved iron removal did not diminish the BNF enhancement, excluding mediation by soluble iron species. Intriguingly, ferrihydrite supplementation at equivalent iron concentrations failed to replicate the BNF stimulation observed with IP, suggesting the indispensability of root-associated iron redox cycling. Mechanistic analyses identified that Methylosinus/Methylocystis species mediated Fe(III) reduction, synergistically collaborating with specific rhizobial strains to execute Fe-MOX-dependent BNF. These findings uncover a previously overlooked yet pronounced contribution of IP to BNF, providing novel insights for developing dual-strategy approaches to mitigate methane emissions and reduce nitrogen fertilizer dependency in paddy ecosystems."

While microbial arsenic detoxification has been extensively studied in bacteria, archaeal mechanisms remain understudied. Here, we investigated arsenic resistance genes in Bathyarchaeia, one of the most abundant archaeal lineages on Earth. Comprehensive genomic analysis of 318 Bathyarchaeia representatives revealed a widespread distribution of arsenic resistance genes, with 60% of genomes harboring genes for arsenate reduction (arsR1 and arsC2), arsenite methylation (arsM), and arsenic transport (acr3, arsP, and arsB). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these genes are widely distributed across 14 archaeal phyla, including Asgardarchaeota, Thermoproteota, and Thermoplasmatota, with close evolutionary relationships among these archaeal lineages. In situ investigation of sediment columns and laboratory microcosm experiments demonstrated a strong positive correlation between Bathyarchaeia abundance and arsenic concentrations, suggesting their adaptation to arsenic-rich environments. Molecular dating analysis placed the emergence of Bathyarchaeia at approximately 3.01 billion years ago, with the evolution of their arsenic resistance mechanisms closely tracking major geological events, including the Great Oxidation Event (2.4–2.1 Gya), Huronian Glaciation (2.29–2.25 Gya), and Cryogenian Glaciation (∼700 Mya).

GridEX is designed for integration with external health and socioeconomic data sets, irrespective of their geographic boundaries. We validated our spatial model using station temperature observations from the NOAA Integrated Surface Database (ISD) and reanalysis surface climate data provided by GridMET.

We measured the concentration of 32 pesticides at the puy de Dôme observatory (France) in the sub μg L–1 to μg L–1 range in cloud water, largely arising from regional to long-range transport that also involves pesticides currently banned for agricultural use in France. Half of the samples showed a total concentration of pesticides of over 0.5 μg L–1, which is the European drinking water limit. If 2,4-dinitrophenol, which can also be produced by photochemical reactions, is excluded,  two samples still present a total concentration of over 0.5 μg L–1.

Here, we investigate how amine-modified polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NH2) regulate silicon transport and biosilica deposition in Synechococcus sp. CC9311, a key contributor to oceanic primary production. At an environmentally relevant concentration (0.1 μg/mL), PS-NH2 primarily modified the cell surface microenvironment, which significantly increased the level of extracellular biosilica deposition. In contrast, higher PS-NH2 concentrations (0.5–2.0 μg/mL) induced oxidative stress and membrane damage, leading to a shift toward enhanced intracellular silicon accumulation. Notably, at 2.0 μg/mL, the oxidative damage was the most severe, resulting in the most significant intracellular silicon accumulation compared to 0.5  and 1.0 μg/mL. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that PS-NH2 exposure downregulated genes involved in energy metabolism and photosynthesis while upregulating stress response pathways, suggesting that silicon accumulation may serve as a protective mechanism against PS-NH2-induced cellular stress.

However, studies of the atmospheric photochemical oxidation of BTHs remain very limited, hindering the assessment of their atmospheric impacts. Herein, we systematically investigated the reaction kinetics and yields of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from benzothiazole (BTH, the parent compound of BTHs) photo-oxidation under various experimental conditions using an oxidation flow reactor. The rate constant for BTH reacting with OH radicals, (3.14 ± 0.20) × 10–12 cm3 molecule–1 s–1, was similar to that of single-ring aromatics like toluene, yet its SOA yield was comparable to that of bicyclic aromatics like naphthalene. Furthermore, we found that while NOx suppressed the BTH-derived SOA production, relative humidity enhanced its production. Further field measurements revealed significant SOA formation potential from BTH photo-oxidation in typical urban areas, comparable to that of well-known benzene or naphthalene. Gaseous BTH in an offshore atmosphere was also  detected, indicating its potential impacts on marine environments. Our results elucidate the atmospheric photochemical processes of BTH, revealing its important but previously overlooked contribution to ambient SOA formation."

This study uses TROPOMI satellite observations and mass balance modeling to estimate multiyear (2019–2023) methane emissions rates for a key CHOPS region spanning Alberta and Saskatchewan. The iterative 3-year mean emissions estimates were found to be ∼4.5 times higher than industry-reported data but show a notable downward trend, with a 71 ± 34% reduction over the study period. The methane emissions intensity decreased by 63 ± 31%, reaching 0.69 ± 0.25 gCH4/MJ, but remains substantially higher than that of other oil production basins globally. Although the TROPOMI-based emission reductions were found higher than the industry-reported reductions, our emission estimates remain notably higher than the industry-reported emissions. Deficient industry reporting makes identifying root causes difficult, underscoring the need for robust measurement systems to benchmark and drive performance improvements. Potential drivers for the observed reductions include regulatory efforts targeting vent gas and fugitive emissions, an increased use of solution gas combustors, and a 19% decline in production during the period.

Despite greater insolation, the grassy equator‐facing slope experienced less and shallower moisture withdrawal during the dry season relative to the pole‐facing slope with oak trees, which experienced greater and deeper moisture withdrawal.

Here, we investigate this specific observation with a combination of machine learning techniques. Before the mainshock, we identify two seismicity volumes with asynchronous activity, disparate fault orientations, and distinct b‐values. Throughout the sequence, both structures maintain their distinct b‐values; only when combined, the b‐value apparently increases before the mainshock (and drops afterward). Our observation suggests that a temporal b‐value variation in a large volume, or the entire extent of this sequence, originates from individual structures with distinct b‐values being active at different times. More generally, temporal b‐value variations may also reflect changes in the spatial distribution of seismicity besides other underlying processes.

Over the East Antarctic Plateau, clear‐sky precipitation (CSP) is a significant portion of the total annual precipitation. CSP consists of very small ice crystals that form when the air becomes supersaturated and settles to the surface. This study presents the first continental‐scale estimates of CSP over the East Antarctic Plateau using atmospheric backscatter profiles from the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite‐2 (ICESat‐2) lidar. A method is developed to identify CSP based on calibrated attenuated backscatter and to estimate the associated precipitation amounts by deriving ice water content from lidar extinction and using an estimated particle fall speed to obtain precipitation rate. Comparisons with in situ measurements at Concordia Station, Dome C show general agreement. Results for the April–October 2021 period reveal a high frequency of CSP (up to 80%) across the high Plateau. The ICESat‐2 estimated CSP amount for this period ranges from about 5 to 8 mm snow water equivalent (SWE) south of about 80S and increases toward the north with maximum values of 18–20 mm SWE near 70S, 90E. The ICEsat‐2 estimated CSP amount for the grid box containing Dome C was 8.5 mm SWE which agrees well with the amount measured there (9.9 mm SWE).

The tornado's fine‐scale dynamic structures in turn can be disturbed by these buildings. This study employs an advanced modeling system of mesoscale‐to‐large eddy simulation (LES) to explicitly resolve both the tornado‐like vortex (TLV) and building‐induced flow disturbances. Our modeling reasonably reproduced a TLV passing over building clusters, while the evolutionary characteristics of TLV are comparable to that of the video‐captured tornado funnels of an actual event in South China. The structures of the TLV are significantly disturbed as it approaches high‐rise building clusters. After arriving at the downstream of the building cluster, the disturbed TLV regains a well‐defined structure. Such a reconstruction of TLV structures is characterized by the vertical alignment of the original aloft TLV structures and low‐level building‐induced lee vortex. As the TLV detaches the building cluster, it leaves open space for a wind corridor, a band area of high wind speeds along the direction of ambient flow in the open area among building clusters. This corridor delivers momentum that, when coupled with the reconstruction of TLV, favors local strong winds. Such a type of local strong winds are highly related to the heights of building clusters but are somewhat less sensitive to the detailed TLV track relative to building clusters, as indicated by numerical sensitivity experiments. These results provide insight into possible wind speed changes when tornadoes encounter buildings, which may have valuable implications for urban wind hazard mitigation."

A persistent problem, however, is that it is notoriously difficult to examine spray effects directly: observations are scarce, and numerical simulations are often idealized or lacking in a full representation of the physical processes involved. In this study, we provide the most complete treatment of spray transport and coupling with the hurricane boundary layer to‐date by conducting high‐resolution large‐eddy simulations coupled with Lagrangian spray droplets across a range of wind speed using a GPU‐accelerated model. In this first of a two‐part work, we describe the turbulence, the impacts of spray on mean profiles, and the dispersion of spray throughout the boundary layer. Spray has minimal impacts on the velocity and turbulence statistics, while at the same time having a much more pronounced influence on profiles of temperature and water vapor. Droplet concentrations roughly follow the conventional power‐law shape above the droplet injection layer, although almost universally over predict the droplet number concentrations. The Lagrangian lifetime statistics are computed as well, and it is shown that estimates based on a droplet falling at its Stokes terminal velocity from the significant wave height is inaccurate and cannot capture the wide range of possible droplet lifetimes."

The potential impacts of this uncertainty on regional terrestrial hydroclimates are largely unknown, which is problematic for climate risk assessments. To address this, we designed novel atmospheric model experiments simulating future global warming with and without enhanced ETP warming, superimposed upon an idealized El Niño‐Southern Oscillation cycle. Our results show that enhanced ETP warming significantly influences future terrestrial hydroclimates in several regions across the tropical and subtropical Americas. In southern Mexico, Central America and the Amazon region, enhanced ETP warming exacerbates long term drought trends and extreme drought events, yet the opposite is true in south‐central South America. Along the west coast of the continental western United States, the effects of enhanced ETP warming manifest as El Niño‐related extreme precipitation anomalies.

 The maternal microbiome during pregnancy and the peripartum period plays a critical role in maternal health outcomes and establishing the neonatal gut microbiome, with long-term implications for offspring health. However, a healthy microbiome during these key periods has not been definitively characterized. This longitudinal study examines maternal and neonatal microbiomes using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing in a Japanese cohort throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period. Forty-two mothers and their forty-five offspring participate in the study. The maternal vaginal microbiome remains relatively stable during pregnancy but significantly changes in the postpartum period. Among Lactobacillus species, the Lactobacillus crispatus group is predominant. A higher abundance of Lactobacillus early in pregnancy is associated with a favorable gestational period. The maternal gut microbiome is associated with the vaginal microbiome throughout pregnancy. The neonatal gut microbiome substantially changes in early life, with bacterial composition influenced by delivery mode. Over time, bacteria shared with the maternal gut microbiome become dominant in the neonatal gut. This study provides insights into microbiome dynamics in Japanese mothers and their offspring during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Identification of common patterns across diverse populations may help define keystone microbes essential for human health and inform the development of microbiome-based interventions.

 Rising atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD)—a measure of atmospheric dryness, defined as the difference between saturated vapor pressure (SVP) and actual vapor pressure (AVP)—has been linked to increasing daily mean near-surface air temperatures since the 1980s. However, it remains unclear whether the faster increases in daily maximum temperature (Tmax) relative to daily minimum temperature (Tmin) have contributed to rising VPD. Here, we show that the faster rise in Tmax compared with Tmin over land has intensified VPD from 1980 to 2023. This sub-diurnal asymmetric warming has driven a larger SVP increase than would occur under uniform temperature rise, while AVP is more strongly influenced by Tmin. Using reanalysis data, we estimate that asymmetric warming has contributed an additional ~18% to the increase in global land VPD. Sub-daily station observations corroborate this pattern, with asymmetric warming accounting for ~30% of VPD intensification across all stations. Our findings indicate that sub-diurnal asymmetric warming has substantially amplified global warming’s effect on atmospheric dryness over the past four decades, with significant implications for terrestrial water availability and carbon cycling.

 ROSAH (retinal dystrophy, optic nerve edema, splenomegaly, anhidrosis, and headache) syndrome is a rare genetic disease caused by variants in alpha-kinase 1 (ALPK1) resulting in downstream pro-inflammatory signaling mediated by the TIFA/TRAF6/NF-κB pathway. Here, we report the design of an ALPK1 inhibitor, DF-003, with pharmacokinetic properties suitable for daily oral dosing. In biochemical assays, DF-003 potently inhibits human ALPK1 (IC50 = 1.5 nM) and the ROSAH disease-causing mutant ALPK1[T237M] (IC50 = 16 nM). When tested against a panel of 394 human kinases, DF-003 exhibits ≥860-fold selectivity over the closest kinase. In cell-based assays, DF-003 suppresses inflammatory cytokine signaling mediated both by wild-type ALPK1 and the disease-causing ALPK1[T237M] mutant. Using mice heterozygous for wild-type human ALPK1 and ALPK1T237M established to model ROSAH syndrome that exhibit retinal microglial infiltration, astrocyte activation, and inflammatory cytokine upregulation in the retina, optic nerve, and cortex, we show that orally administered DF-003 is sufficient to inhibit these inflammatory phenotypes.

These patterns resemble brain changes induced by ketamine, highlighting altered excitation-inhibition balance underlying autism’s neurophysiology. 
 Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition associated with altered resting-state brain function. An increased excitation-inhibition ratio is discussed as a pathomechanism but in-vivo evidence of disturbed neurotransmission underlying functional alterations remains scarce. We compare local resting-state brain activity and neurotransmitter co-localizations between autism (N = 405, N = 395) and neurotypical controls (N = 473, N = 474) in two independent cohorts and correlate them with excitation-inhibition changes induced by glutamatergic (ketamine) and GABAergic (midazolam) medication. Autistic individuals exhibit consistent reductions in local activity, particularly in default mode network regions. The whole-brain differences spatially overlap with glutamatergic and GABAergic, as well as dopaminergic and cholinergic neurotransmission. Functional changes induced by NMDA-antagonist ketamine resemble the spatial pattern observed in autism. Our findings suggest that consistent local activity alterations in autism reflect widespread disruptions in neurotransmission and may be resembled by pharmacological modulation of the excitation-inhibition balance. These findings advance understanding of the neurophysiological basis of autism.

 The unique biodiversity and vast carbon stocks of the Amazon rainforests are essential to the Earth System but are threatened by future water balance changes. Empirical evidence suggests that species and trait diversity may mediate forest drought responses, yet little evidence exists for tropical forest responses. In this simulation study, we identify key axes of trait variation and quantify the extent to which functional trait diversity increases tropical forests’ drought resistance. Using a vegetation model capable of simulating observed tropical forest drought responses and trait diversity, we identify emergent trade-offs between water-related traits (hereafter hydraulic traits) as a key axis of variation. Our simulations reveal that higher functional trait diversity reduces site-scale biomass loss during sudden catastrophic drought, i.e., a 50% precipitation reduction for four and seven years, by 17% and 32%, respectively, and continental-scale biomass loss due to severe chronic climate change-associated precipitation reductions, i.e., RCP8.5, constant CO2 at 380 ppm, and a 50% precipitation reduction over 100 years, by 34%. Additionally, we find that functional trait diversity-mediated biomass resistance is stronger under more severe drought conditions. These findings quantify the essential role of hydraulic-trait diversity in enhancing tropical forest drought resistance and highlight the critical linkages between biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. The hyper-diverse tropical forests of the Amazon store vast carbon stocks, but whether this diversity increases their resistance to future drought remains uncertain.

Here the authors report that cannabis use and THC levels associate with oocyte maturation rate and reduced number of euploid embryos in a retrospective case-control study of patients undergoing IVF treatment, while in vitro data suggests THC impairs chromosome segregation. 
 Cannabis consumption and legalization is increasing globally, raising concerns about its impact on fertility. In humans, we previously demonstrated that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and its metabolites reach the ovarian follicle. An extensive body of literature describes THC’s impact on sperm, however no such studies have determined its effects on the oocyte. Herein, we investigate the impact of THC on human female fertility through both a clinical and in vitro analysis. In a case-control study, we show that follicular fluid THC concentration is positively correlated with oocyte maturation and THC-positive patients exhibit significantly lower embryo euploid rates than their matched controls. In vitro, we observe a similar, but non-significant, increased oocyte maturation rate following THC exposure and altered expression of key genes implicated in extracellular matrix remodeling, inflammation, and chromosome segregation. Furthermore, THC induces oocyte chromosome segregation errors and increases abnormal spindle morphology. Finally, this study highlights potential risks associated with cannabis use for female fertility. Cannabis use has been reported to impair sperm quality but less is known about whether cannabis affects female fertility. Here the authors report that cannabis use and THC levels associate with oocyte maturation rate and reduced number of euploid embryos in a retrospective case-control study of patients undergoing IVF treatment, while in vitro data suggests THC impairs chromosome segregation."

Here, the authors examine the neural basis of this effect, showing that neural response patterns to tools in visual perception regions become more similar to those typically elicited by guns, contributing to racially biased responding. 
 Racial stereotypes have been shown to bias the identification of innocuous objects, making objects like wallets or tools more likely to be identified as weapons when encountered in the presence of Black individuals. One mechanism that may contribute to these biased identifications is a transient perceptual distortion driven by racial stereotypes. Here we provide neuroimaging evidence that a bias in visual representation due to automatically activated racial stereotypes may be a mechanism underlying this phenomenon. During fMRI, tools presented after Black face primes induced neural response patterns that exhibited a biased similarity to independent gun images in object-discriminative regions of the ventral temporal cortex involved in the visual perception of objects. Moreover, these neural representational shifts predicted the magnitude of participants’ racial bias, as reflected by differences in response times during weapon identification due to Black versus White face primes. Together, these findings suggest that stereotypes can shape the visual representation of socially-relevant objects in line with preconceived notions, thereby contributing to racially biased responding. Due to racial stereotypes, innocuous objects (e.g. a tool) can be misperceived as a gun when presented immediately after a Black individual’s face.

Moreover, full processing is not always a requirement for complex formation. 
 In coronavirus (CoV) infection, polyproteins (pp1a/pp1ab) are processed into non-structural proteins (nsps), which largely form the replication/transcription complex (RTC). The polyprotein processing and complex formation is critical and offers potential therapeutic targets. However, the interplay of polyprotein processing and RTC-assembly remains poorly understood. Here, we study two key aspects: The order of polyprotein processing by viral main protease Mpro and its influence on complex formation with the methyltransferase nsp16. Moreover, we establish an approach to determine rate constants k from cleavage sites in structured CoV polyprotein based on native mass spectrometry (MS). The high sensitivity and precision of our method allow quantification of multi-reaction kinetics of nsp7-11 processing from four human pathogenic CoV species. The experimentally determined rate constants are put into perspective with a comprehensive analysis of primary sequences and structural models, revealing distinct cleavage mechanisms for each site based on their local structural environments. Our systematic approach provides a blueprint for kinetic analysis of complex multi-cleavage reactions.

They show considerable scope for faster migration by reducing the fuelling time before departure and subsequently on stopovers 
 Climate change is causing an earlier onset of spring, requiring migratory birds to accelerate their spring migration to avoid arriving late at the breeding grounds. This acceleration hinges on the capacity to shorten the time spent building energy reserves (fuelling) for migratory flight, which is currently thought to be very limited. Combining multiyear global-positioning-system tracking and body mass data from five large-bodied Arctic-breeding waterfowl species, we demonstrate that there is considerable scope for the studied species to migrate faster by shortening the fuelling time, either before departure or at stopovers. With the exception of one species (brent goose), populations were able to largely or fully offset their spring departure date with subsequent fuelling time en route. Still, under the current rates of Arctic warming, this may allow them to mediate only a few more decades of spring advance by migrating faster.

 Mangrove forests store significant amounts of blue carbon, mainly as soil organic matter. Insights into mangrove organic matter are limited, despite its importance for understanding blue carbon accumulation and vulnerability to global change. Here, we quantified soil organic matter preserved through chemical recalcitrance and association with the mineral phase, as key factors influencing blue carbon persistence. We found that the nature of the soil organic matter varied with mangrove geomorphic settings. Delta settings were dominated by presumably the most persistent soil organic matter associated with minerals, while open coast karstic settings contained mostly particulate soil organic matter, likely preserved due to low microbial activity. Across mangrove soil depths, there was little difference in soil organic matter pools. The soil organic matter pool across mangroves’ geomorphic settings exhibited greater variation than that observed across all terrestrial biomes. These findings underscore the need to tailor mangrove conservation and restoration to geomorphic settings.

 Increased warming due to climate change can induce heat stress in humans and adversely affect labour productivity due to heat-related morbidity. Here, we use a simulation model to examine the effects of heat stress, through declined labour capacity under +1.5 °C and 3.5 °C warming scenarios on agriculture and welfare across the three agroecological zones (Sudanian, Sudano-Sahelian, and Sahelian) in Burkina Faso. In the two scenarios, domestic production declines, with outdoor labour-intensive sectors such as cropping and mining being the most affected, reducing gross domestic product by 9% and 20%, respectively. All households lose welfare in all scenarios except non-poor households in the +1.5 °C scenario. Across zones, crop production declines strongest in the crop-producing Sudanian and Sudano-Sahelian zones. In contrast, relative welfare losses are strongest for households in the Sahelian zone.

 The prediction of fire-induced tree mortality is important for evaluating potential timber volume losses, replanting costs, and for assessing how mortality will impact long-term yield and carbon dynamics. However, current methods do not provide spatially explicit predictions, limiting the use of this data for proactive forest management, such as thinning and reducing fuel load to reduce tree mortality. In this study we assess whether the incorporation of individual tree inventory data derived from airborne laser scanning and modeled and observed fire intensity data can provide accurate spatially explicit tree mortality predictions. Specifically, tree-level mortality was predicted for over 1.9 million trees within six wildfires in mixed coniferous forest in northwestern Montana, USA, and validated using high resolution imagery for each segmented tree crown. Random forest classification models utilizing observed fire intensity metrics derived from VIIRS observations were the most accurate (overall accuracy: 77.2 %), followed by random forest classification models utilizing modeled fire intensity (64.5–66.1 %) and those that utilized existing logistic regression relationships (55.7–59.0 %). The random forest tree mortality models also produced lower RMSE (6.3–10.2 %) and bias (1.7–3.7 %) compared to the logistic regression approach (RMSE: 38.4 %, bias: −29.6 %) when mortality accuracy was assessed across tree size class. The predictor variable importance quantification showed that fire intensity metrics were more important than species and structural variables in the mortality classification. Ultimately, this study contributes to the remote sensing of fire effects and fire science fields by developing a remote sensing-based methodology for predicting spatially explicit individual tree mortality across large spatial extents."

 Moisture content is a critical parameter for estimating the strength of partially saturated sand for engineering challenges such as beach trafficability. A framework for estimating the volumetric moisture content of sandy beaches using satellite-based HH-polarized X-band synthetic aperture radar imagery is presented and used to test the applicability of three theoretical scattering models: Oh, Dubois, and the Integral Equation Model (IEM). The developed framework relies on the measured backscatter coefficient, soil surface root-mean square (RMS) height, and the geometric characteristics of the image. Models for estimating the RMS height were developed based on field measurements for two distinct sites composed of predominately quartz sand and approximately uniform beach slopes: Duck, North Carolina and Cannon Beach in Yakutat, Alaska. The models were developed and tested for incidence angles of 23.3°-54.2° using data obtained from the Cosmo-SkyMED and TerraSAR-X satellites. Four sets of RMS height models were tested: Oh with moisture contents greater than 0 %, Oh with moisture contents greater than a very dry threshold, Dubois, and the IEM. Unique RMS height models, specific to a moisture content model, were developed for incidence angles ranging from a single incidence angle to a range of consecutive incidence angles. Applying the RMS height models, the root mean square error (RMSE) of moisture content was 0.7–6.9 %. Images with incidence angles of 30°- 46° and 40°-50° resulted in the best estimates of moisture content when compared to other ranges of incidence angles for the models tested. Deviations generally represented underestimates of the moisture content (0.1 %–1.3 %), with greater underestimates observed for the IEM. Spatial estimates of moisture content resulted in two distinct zones, one with low moisture contents and a second with slightly elevated moisture contents for all models except the IEM. Challenges associated with differences in scattering mechanisms, a lack of data with high moisture content, and sensitivity of models to small changes in RMS height are discussed."

 Phenolics are a rarely quantified plant biochemical trait that plays a vital role in plant physiology and ecosystem functioning, contributing to plant's chemical defence and influencing nutrient cycling and soil microbial compositions. Spatially continuous information on foliar phenolics is essential for assessing plant health and ecosystem functional diversity. However, previous efforts to predict and map phenolics have been confined to aircraft-based hyperspectral data in limited biomes. The potential of next-generation imaging spectroscopy, whether airborne- or spaceborne-based, for mapping phenolics remains underexplored, particularly in structurally complex and heterogeneous ecosystems such as European mixed temperate forests. Furthermore, much is still unknown about the consistency and uncertainties of predicting forest canopy phenolics across different acquisition levels (airborne vs. spaceborne), limiting our ability to generalise and upscale local trait estimates to broader spatial extents. In this study, we sampled sunlit top-of-canopy leaves from three dominant tree species across mixed temperate forests in southeast Germany. Leveraging next-generation airborne (AVIRIS-NG) and spaceborne (PRISMA) imaging spectroscopy (400–2400 nm), we modelled two ecologically important phenolics (total phenol and tannin) expressed in three forms (foliar mass-based, foliar area-based, and canopy-based). The predictive accuracy of two data-driven approaches, partial least squares regression (PLSR) and Gaussian processes regression (GPR), was compared to assess performance across different spatial scales. Our results demonstrate that phenolics in sunlit canopy leaves can be accurately estimated from both airborne and spaceborne data, with foliar area-based phenolics showing the strongest relationship with spectral reflectance (total phenol: R2 = 0.64–0.69, NRMSE = 13.28%–15.65%; tannin: R2 = 0.49–0.65, NRMSE = 15.86%–21.29%). We observed several similar patterns in model coefficients across airborne and satellite levels, with informative wavelengths aligning with known phenolic features. While the model accuracy declined slightly when scaling from canopy to landscape scale, phenolic maps derived from AVIRIS (aggregated to 30 m) and PRISMA showed good spatial agreement and linearity (GPR: r = 0.68, slope = 0.86; PLSR: r = 0.57, slope = 0.49). These maps successfully captured inter- and intra-species phenolic variability across the test site with low prediction uncertainty. Our findings provide valuable insights into mapping canopy traits across different observational scales, demonstrating how next-generation imaging spectroscopy can characterize the spatial and temporal dynamics of plant phenolics. This research paves the way for improved global monitoring of ecosystem functioning, as well as the pattern of phenolics across forested landscapes and trees' potential ‘chemical’ defences against herbivory and other environmental stressors."

 Reliable flood inundation modelling in complex river systems that are poorly instrumented is often limited by inaccuracies in open source DEMs, particularly near river channels and vegetated regions. This study proposes a methodology to correct and enhance resolution of satellite based DEMs in floodplain areas with ICESat-2 land elevation, Sentinel-2 MSI imagery, and a simple artificial neural network (ANN). FabDEM (30-m) is selected as the base DEM, and the ANN is trained to correct elevation errors at 10-m resolution using spectral bands from Sentinel-2 and ICESat-2 ATL03 elevation. The corrected ANN DEM reduces the mean squared error by 7 cm on average and up to 38 cm in the areas closer to the main river channel. MIKE 21 is used to simulate 2D flood extent maps for four different events, that consider in-situ discharge values at high, medium and low flow, comparing modelled flood extent with observed surface water extent (SWE) maps derived from Sentinel-2 at the selected dates. To ensure that improvements are attributed to DEM corrections rather than hydraulic parametrization, simulations are performed with different uniform values of the Gauckler-Strickler coefficient Ks, which are kept consistent across FabDEM and ANN DEM based scenarios. The critical success index (CSI), F1- score and bias are calculated for simulations with FabDEM and ANN DEM. Across all events, the ANN DEM improves flood simulation accuracy, increasing the Critical Success Index (CSI) and F1 score by up to 19 % and 13 %, respectively, and reducing bias by up to 25 %. This workflow demonstrates a scalable and efficient approach to improve hydraulic model inputs in data-scarce floodplain environments, offering valuable insights for flood risk assessment and water resource management in remote regions."

 To investigate the combustion characteristics of diesel/methanol in the engine cylinder, this study developed a chemical kinetics model for the diesel/methanol (DM) dual-fuel mechanism, comprising 288 reactions and 101 species. The simplified DM mechanism was optimized by adjusting the rate parameters of key reactions, combined with a sensitivity evaluation system for ignition delay time (IDT) and laminar flame speed (LFS). The model's predictions for IDT, LFS, and the concentrations of key species were verified experimentally using a zero-dimensional model. The effects of methanol substitution rate, and altitude on the formation of aldehyde pollutants were systematically analyzed. The results show that the DM mechanism can accurately predict the IDT, LFS, and the formation of key species for a single fuel within the temperature range of 318 K–2000 K, equivalence ratio range of 0.5–2.0, and pressure range of 0.1 MPa–2 MPa. Compared with existing mechanisms, the DM mechanism significantly improves prediction accuracy for these parameters, with R2 values greater than 0.96 and RMSE values below 0.05, demonstrating higher accuracy and consistency. Furthermore, increasing the methanol substitution rate significantly reduces CH2O emissions, while altitude lead to a marked increase in CH2O and CH3CHO emissions.

It highlights the issue of ambient PM2.5 levels exceeding India's National Ambient Air Quality Standards, a common challenge in urban areas worldwide. The RES scenario's transition to cleaner fuels, including Liquefied Petroleum Gas, biogas, and renewable sources, forecasts significant emission reductions: a 26.76 % decrease in PM2.5 and a 10.67 % reduction in SO2 emissions. This adjustment leads to a 16.14 % improvement in average PM2.5 exposure, from 90.62 to 75.99 μg/m3, potentially preventing nearly one-third of premature deaths due to air pollution.

 Very few evaluation studies have focused on the western Tibetan Plateau (TP), despite considerable scientific interests from climatologists and glaciologists globally. This region exhibits anomalous glacial stability under climate warming, but the lack of long-term and high-density observational data poses a major research challenge. Evaluating and selecting reanalysis datasets with higher accuracy over the western TP is thereby vital for advancing climate research. Using ground-based 2-m air temperature (T2m) observations from multiple neighboring countries across the western TP, we establish an integrated observational network to evaluate the performance of widely used reanalysis datasets, including NCEP1, NCEP2, ERA-Interim, JRA55, MERRA2, CRA-Land, CRA, and ERA5.The results indicate that three reanalysis datasets (CRA-Land, CRA, and ERA5) generally outperform the others in capturing T2m climatology and year-to-year variability across the western TP as a whole. However, over the Karakoram, the core glacial zone in the western TP, the above three datasets demonstrate the lowest skills in simulating T2m climatology, although they still perform well in capturing year-to-year variability. For CRA-Land and CRA, the error sources are unclear, although their terrain elevation differences respectively explain ∼67.4 % and ∼69.1 % of their climatological T2m errors. For ERA5, the terrain elevation differences (explaining ∼58.4 %) and collective radiative processes are the two primary error sources. Moreover, higher surface albedo in ERA5 is identified as the key contributor causing radiative errors. This study identifies the optimization of surface albedo in the Karakoram and its neighboring regions as a critical pathway to enhance ERA5 data quality in the future."
