We focused on three types of terpenes, common in nature, and their reactions with specific acids. Our findings reveal that these reactions efficiently produce expected compounds. This research enhances our understanding of how these reactions affect air quality and climate by contributing to aerosol formation, crucial for atmospheric chemistry. 
 Criegee intermediates (CIs), formed from the ozonolysis of alkenes, are highly reactive species with diverse reaction pathways, with important roles in atmospheric chemistry. This study focuses on the formation of accretion products through reactions of thermally stabilized CIs (sCIs) from the ozonolysis of three different terpenes (α-pinene, β-pinene, and β-caryophyllene) with malonic and oxalic acids. Our experimental results demonstrate that these reactions efficiently produce the expected accretion products, though with apparent variations in yields depending on the specific terpene and acid involved. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report direct gas-phase observations of expected adducts from several different terpene-derived sCIs and carboxylic acids, paving the way for a better understanding of the importance and atmospheric implications of these reactions, especially in terms of the aerosol-forming capabilities of these large product molecules."

The model's performance was evaluated, demonstrating its potential for high-resolution mapping in other cities with well-characterized urban structures and diverse in situ monitoring stations. 
 High-resolution mapping of pollutants based on mobile observation facilitates deep understanding of air pollutant distributions within a city. This approach fosters science-based decisions to improve air quality, by adding to the existing but not optimally distributed permanent monitoring stations. In this study, we developed high-resolution concentration maps of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM10) and ultrafine particles (UFP) for Bucharest, Romania, to evaluate the spatial variation of pollutants across the city during the warm and cold seasons. Maps were generated using a mixed-effects method applied to a land-use regression (LUR) model. The approach relies on multiple land-use and traffic predictor variables and assimilation of data collected by mobile measurements over 30 d in the periods May–July 2022 and January–February 2023. Cross-validation was done against in situ data extracted from the same collection, while validation was organized by comparison with standard measurements at fixed reference sites. Our study shows that this combined method has a good performance for all pollutants (R2>0.65), the highest performance being observed for the cold season. PM10  concentration maps indicate multiple sources of particles during the warm season, the most important source being traffic. During the cold season, PM10 concentration maps show a more uniform distribution of sources in Bucharest. The city's principal roads, particularly the Bucharest ring road, are also highlighted in the NO2 maps, with a higher gradient during the warm period."

W. van de Wal,ZEMBA v1.0: an energy and moisture balance climate model to investigate Quaternary climate,"This work documents the first results from ZEMBA: an energy balance model of the climate system. The model is a computationally efficient tool designed to study the response of climate to changes in the Earth's orbit. We demonstrate that ZEMBA reproduces many features of the Earth's climate for both the pre-industrial period and the Earth's most recent cold extreme – the Last Glacial Maximum. We intend to develop ZEMBA further and investigate the glacial cycles of the last 2.5 million years. 
 The Zonally Averaged Energy and Moisture BAlance (ZEMBA) climate model is introduced as a simple and computationally efficient tool for studies of the glacial–interglacial cycles of the Quaternary. The model is based on an energy balance model comprising an atmospheric layer, a land component and a two-dimensional ocean transport model with sea ice. In addition, ZEMBA replaces temperature with moist static energy for calculations of diffusive heat transport in the atmospheric layer and includes a hydrological cycle for simulating precipitation and snowfall. Prior to coupling with an ice sheet model, we present and evaluate equilibrium simulations of the model for the pre-industrial period and the Last Glacial Maximum, using prescribed land ice fractions and elevation. In addition, we test the sensitivity of ZEMBA to a doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration and a 2 % increase in solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere. Compared to a global climate model (the Norwegian Earth System Model version 2, NorESM2) and reanalysis data (ERA5), ZEMBA reproduces the zonally averaged climate of the pre-industrial period with reasonable accuracy, capturing features such as surface temperature, precipitation, radiative fluxes, snow cover, sea ice cover and meridional heat transport. The response of ZEMBA to increasing CO2 concentrations is qualitatively similar to the observational record and climate models of higher complexity, including polar amplification over the Northern Hemisphere and during the winter months. The globally averaged rise in surface air temperature for a doubling in CO2 is 3.6 °C. Finally, ZEMBA shows success in emulating changes in surface temperature and precipitation during the Last Glacial Maximum when compared to reconstructions and global climate models."

Specifically, their retention profiles (RPs) are nonexponential. We present experiments demonstrating that nonexponential RPs arise from variations in interception history among attached colloids wherein the fraction of the colloid population that attaches after multiple interceptions is negligible under favorable conditions and is significant to dominant under unfavorable conditions. We show that RPs were exponential only for colloids that attached under favorable conditions, whereas RPs were nonmonotonic for colloids that attached under unfavorable conditions, with RPs for multiple intercepting attachers assuming γ distributions having maxima at transport distances that increased with interception order. We show that in our experiments the value of attachment efficiency (α) was greater for multiple than single interception attachers, and we speculate on the origin of this change in α. We emphasize that such variance from overall exponential RP reflects a fundamental aspect of colloid transport under unfavorable conditions, as they arise without significant variations in colloid size, surface properties, and density, and without straining and detachment."

To align with well‐calibrated CloudSat cloud profiling radar (CPR) (and HCR) reflectivity measurements, a constant 4.5 dB offset was applied to all M‐WACR reflectivitives during the MARCUS. This brings M‐WACR data into better agreement with both HCR and CPR reflectivity measurements and facilitates a more reliable cloud fraction (CF) comparison. The total CFs (CFTs) derived from the three radars show excellent agreement. All three radars detect large drizzle drops, but M‐WACR and HCR excel at detecting smaller cloud droplets that are often missed by CPR. The underestimated CFs by CPR are due to increased attenuation of CPR measurements below 3 km, and the combined effects of attenuation and surface clutter below 1 km. Combining radar and lidar observations enhanced cloud detection by 20%–60%. The results from this study provide new insights for designing future cloud radar systems."

Despite the knowledge that such a bias may be directly behind the general lack of asymmetry in model‐simulated El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO), its causes remain unknown. Here we report that a weaker response in the zonal currents to wind forcing in these models results in a biased response in the vertical motion which in turn causes weaker asymmetric temperature responses through the contribution of the vertical motion to the advective heating (dynamic heating). This finding underscores the critical importance of accurately modeling the zonal currents—a previously less noticed element in the modeling effort—to better capture the asymmetric responses in the tropical western Pacific to external wind forcing and thereby improving simulations of ENSO by coupled climate models."

Ortega,Late Winter Ozone and PM 2.5 NAAQS Exceedance in the Northern Colorado Front Range in Relation to Oil and Natural Gas Emissions,"There has been a notable increase in winter and early spring ozone exceedance occurrences in enclosed air basins that contain abundant oil and natural gas (O&NG) activity. High ozone levels can arise from emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) combined with enhanced photochemical reactions. The wintertime temperature inversions trap these emissions near the ground and cause their concentrations to increase, and the high albedo of snow accelerates the photochemical reactions. Although these events have been noted in rural high elevation O&NG development basins in the western United States, here, we report on and analyze a late winter high ozone and particulate matter (PM) event in the densely populated Northern Colorado Front Range (NCFR) in an unenclosed air basin with abundant O&NG production. On 19–20 March 2021, the 8‐hr average ozone reached 82 ppb, and 24‐hr‐averaged PM 2.5 concentrations reached 77 μg m−3, resulting in the year's highest PM pollution event. Using a combination of in‐situ chemical and meteorological measurements, we show that the buildup of ozone precursors was likely attributable to O&NG emissions in a stable boundary layer in conjunction with Denver Cyclone conditions, a mesoscale feature common in the NCFR that recirculates pollutants. The concurrent PM pollution was likely driven by animal feedlot emissions and diverse sources of NOx, including O&NG. This event raises concern about the potential of wintertime air quality standard exceedances and cumulative adverse health effects considering an expanding O&NG industry within a densely populated urban and suburban area."

Nehrir,Improving Planetary Boundary Layer Height Estimation From Airborne Lidar Instruments,"The height of the planetary boundary layer (PBLH) influences processes such as pollutant distributions, convection, and cloud formation within the troposphere. Aerosol observables play a critical role in deriving the mixed layer height (MLH) using retrieval techniques like the Haar wavelet covariance transform (WCT), which employs gradients in aerosol backscatter to estimate MLH. Currently, backscatter‐only approaches struggle with identifying very shallow stable boundary layers, distinguishing PBL from lofted residual or other aerosol layers, and profiles with very low aerosol loading. Here, we reflect on the WCT method's performance and evaluate different approaches to improve PBLH estimations. We aggregate lidar observables from recent NASA airborne field campaigns and compute MLHs based on the WCT method. Machine learning (ML) approaches are explored to produce PBLH estimates by training lidar information on thermodynamically derived PBLHs over marine and land settings. A linear model is found suitable for producing PBLH estimates in marine settings (improving mean bias by 71 m), while an ensemble tree method proves more suitable for PBLH types over land, as indicated by improved biases (13 m mean bias), errors (179 m mean error and 391 m RMSE), and correlations (+0.3) for the models explored. The algorithms are additionally tested on “unseen” data to gauge differences between MLH and PBLH estimates produced from each of the models. The PBLH estimates, composed of information from lidar and thermodynamic profiles, further support the use of ML for an automated method of PBLH prediction. Overall, these improved predictions will help evaluate models and deepen our understanding of PBL‐aerosol interactions."

Convective boundary layer (CBL) reaches 3,500 m in daytime while the top of stable boundary layer (SBL) reaches 1,500 m at night. The depth of surface layer, mixing layer (ML), residual layer (RL), entrainment zone (EZ), and temperature inversion are closely correlated with diurnal temperature variation.

Dynamic PBL representing dynamic stability from Ri fluctuates around 1,000 m during nighttime and rises to about 1,500 m during daytime. Material PBL, representing the distribution of atmospheric substances driven by solar heating, is classified into residual height of material boundary layer and accumulation height of material boundary layer to describe the capacity of dispersion and accumulation affected by CBL and SBL, respectively. Material PBL demonstrates similar trends to the thermal PBL in the daytime ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 m and shows similar variation with dynamic PBL in the nighttime due to orographic winds.

Existing methods for estimating Tmh fall into four categories: single‐source methods employing spatial downscaling or diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) models and multisource methods employing spatiotemporal fusion or DTC models. Despite this methodological diversity, a comprehensive evaluation of their respective strengths and weaknesses remains lacking, posing a challenge for advancing Tmh estimation. To address this critical gap, we performed a wide‐ranging comparison of eight representative approaches for estimating Tmh, comprising two from each category. Their accuracies were assessed over various timescales and conditions, utilizing in situ LST observations from 77 ground‐based stations worldwide. Our evaluations show that DTC‐based multisource approaches exhibit the highest overall accuracy, outperforming both spatial downscaling‐based single‐source approaches and spatiotemporal fusion‐based multisource approaches. Conversely, the performance of DTC‐based single‐source methods exhibits substantial disparity. This observed pattern of overall accuracy remains valid across months, seasons, land cover types, and climatic zones. Furthermore, our assessments indicate that accuracies are time‐of‐day dependent. Spatial downscaling and spatiotemporal fusion approaches are most effective around 2 hr after sunrise, while DTC‐based approaches show better performance around midday. Our findings suggest that this work holds potential significance for generating fine‐resolution hourly LST data with enhanced accuracy."

Traditional methods rely on rainfall intensity (R) as a proxy, oversimplifying the complex microphysical processes of raindrop formation. In contrast, our study introduces a physically based framework that leverages dual‐polarization radar (DPR) variables—capturing key raindrop properties—to enhance RKE prediction through methods ranging from statistical regression to advanced machine learning. Statistical regression models with DPR variables show superior accuracy over traditional R‐based methods in RKE prediction. Meanwhile, machine learning models, developed through four algorithms to create 12 advanced models, surpass linear DPR models by better handling extreme conditions. Among these, the Local Cascade Ensemble model utilizing DPR variables and simple environmental conditions (LCE‐DPRS) stands out for its balance of effectiveness and ease of use, making it the recommended approach for RKE estimation. Specifically, this model achieves reductions exceeding 70% in both root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error compared to traditional rainfall R‐based methods. Additionally, 1 month of X‐band dual‐polarization radar observations was validated using in situ raindrop size distributions measured by disdrometers. The LCE‐DPRS model demonstrated effective high‐resolution, real‐time spatiotemporal predictions, significantly reducing errors during intense rainfall events.

Employing globally resolutions of below 5 km, the models from the Dynamics of the Atmospheric general circulation Modeled On Non‐hydrostatic Domains (DYAMOND) project do not require a parameterization for deep convection. This can be expected to lead to a better representation of cloudiness, particularly in the tropics where most of the total ice water path (TIWP) results from convection. We study the inter‐model variability of TIWP simulated by the DYAMOND models during boreal summer, compare to the TIWP from a lower‐resolution numerical weather prediction model and evaluate using satellite observations and ERA5 reanalysis data. We disentangle dynamical reasons for the inter‐model variability in monthly and daily mean TIWP from reasons connected with the cloud response to convective forcing. As expected, we find that differences in the models' cloud response are mainly responsible for the inter‐model variability. The ratio of TIWP to TIWP plus total liquid water path (TLWP), which is controlled by convective de‐ and entrainment, and the models' microphysical scheme lead to a large inter‐model variability in TIWP. Differences in convective dynamics also impact cloudiness with some models compensating a low TIWP in areas of low vertical ascent by an increased probability of large TIWP connected with large vertical velocities. Finally, the spatial distribution of convective events varies with models that parameterize convection simulating a larger fraction of the tropical TIWP in areas of high sea surface temperature."

The stratification conditions in the surface layer are represented by the stability parameter (ζ), calculated as the ratio of the reference height z to the Monin‐Obukhov length L (i.e., ζ = z/L). Current surface layer schemes exhibit uncertainties under strong stable conditions (ζ > 1). The Grachev2007 scheme for ζ > 1 and the Li2014 and Li2015 schemes for calculating ζ are implemented into the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF‐Chem). Two successive radiation fog events in the Yangtze River Delta are simulated to compare the improved scheme with the default scheme. Both fog events occur under high‐pressure conditions characterized by clear sky and light wind during the nighttime. The results indicate that strong stable conditions dominate before fog formation, and the improved scheme improves threat scores for fog formation. Regarding surface flux, due to reduced surface thermal resistance in parameterization, increased surface heat exchange in the improved scheme enhances cooling from sensible heat flux for ζ > 1, which is conducive to fog formation. Regarding turbulent thermal mixing, the increased surface dynamic exchange in the improved scheme enhances surface drag and reduces wind speed for ζ > 1. This weakens the contribution of wind shear to turbulent kinetic energy, ultimately promoting fog formation. The findings of this paper are applicable to radiation fog simulations in other regions, such as plain areas covered with grassland, cropland, or other vegetation, providing support for improving fog simulation."

Evaluating the SR of sites at a national scale and its long‐term trends is particularly important for countries like China, where both air quality and monitoring networks have changed dramatically over time. Here, we used 1‐km daily air pollutant concentrations from the China High Air Pollutants dataset to assess the yearly SR of state‐controlled sites in China from 2013 to 2022 for multiple pollutants. With the number of sites increasing from 460 in 2013 to 1,590 in 2022, our results showed that the total SR area of sites increased by 89% for PM2.5, 149% for PM10, and 2,190% for O3. While the number of sites mainly drove these increases, its impact varied at different phases. Interestingly, the rise in sites from 2020 to 2022 actually led to a decrease in the total SR area for PM2.5 (−18,300 km2) and PM10 (−14,200 km2). Additionally, we found that applying SR to pollution exposure assessments did not improve their accuracy at national and city levels when compared to the official method, which involves exposure calculation using arithmetic mean aggregation of monitoring sites. This was related to poor SR performance, with more than half of the population being uncovered by SR areas in more than 85% of Chinese cities. Nevertheless, we demonstrated the benefits of applying SR for city‐level air quality attainment."

This study employs a boundary layer mass balance (MB) method (also known as the hypothetical box model) to calculate the nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) emission fluxes based on the ground surface and tower measurements between September and November 2018 in the urban core of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, China. The MB method estimated the propane, toluene, n‐butane, m,p‐xylene, and i‐butane as the major species, which are in reasonable agreement with the estimates by mixed layer gradient technique. The physical dispersion term explained over 80% of the emission flux variations for most species while the chemical loss term took up nearly 60% for the highly reactive species (e.g., isoprene and styrene). Higher emission fluxes were identified during daytime than nighttime, well reflecting the daily activities. The flux‐based positive matrix factorization (FLU‐PMF) and traditional concentration‐based apportionment both revealed that vehicular emissions and oil and gas evaporation were the dominant sources of NMHC emissions. FLU‐PMF attributed a higher contribution to biogenic emissions and a reduced contribution to fuel combustion by accounting for chemical loss and atmospheric dilution. Higher NMHC emission flux was found by MB estimates than EI grids near the measurement sites. It was suggested that EI underestimated the emission fluxes due to missing information for the residential fugitive emissions, while industrial contributions were overestimated. The findings provide useful information for policy‐makers and government to better constrain volatile organic compound emissions and improving the source apportionment in urban areas."

The climate effect of an eruption may last for about a decade and is nonlinearly tied to the amount of injected SO2 ${\text{SO}}_{2}$ from the eruption. We investigate the climatic effects of volcanic eruptions, ranging from Mt. Pinatubo‐sized events to supereruptions. The study is based on ensemble simulations in the Community Earth System Model Version 2 (CESM2) climate model applying the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model Version 6 (WACCM6) atmosphere model, using a coupled ocean and fixed sea surface temperature setting. Our analysis focuses on the impact of different levels of SO2 ${\text{SO}}_{2}$ injections on stratospheric aerosol optical depth (SAOD), effective radiative forcing (ERF), and global mean surface temperature (GMST) anomalies. We uncover a notable time‐dependent decrease in aerosol forcing efficiency (ERF normalized by SAOD) for all eruption SO2 ${\text{SO}}_{2}$ levels during the first posteruption year. In addition, it is revealed that the largest eruptions investigated in this study, including several previous supereruption simulations, provide peak ERF anomalies bounded at −65Wm−2 ${-}65\,\mathrm{W}\,{\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$. Further, a close linear relationship between peak GMST and ERF effectively bounds the GMST anomaly to, at most, approximately −10K ${-}10\,\mathrm{K}$.

First, we derive a proxy estimate for CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ enhancements from NO2 ${\text{NO}}_{2}$ observations through linear regression near the plume cross‐section. Then, we fit a Gaussian function to the resulting NO2 ${\text{NO}}_{2}$‐based CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ enhancement data. We apply this method to data from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory‐2 (OCO‐2) and the Sentinel‐5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (S5P/TROPOMI) starting from May 2018. The method is tested on the Matimba and Medupi power stations in South Africa, as well as the cities of Madrid (Spain), Las Vegas (USA), and Baghdad (Iraq). The corresponding mean CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ emission estimates are 49 ± $\pm $ 17 Mt/yr, 22 ± $\pm $ 10 Mt/yr, 30 ± $\pm $ 8 Mt/yr, and 41 ± $\pm $ 19 Mt/yr, respectively. The results show that the method is robust and can be applied to challenging cases where NO2 ${\text{NO}}_{2}$ data helps constrain the fit. The proxy approach allows evaluation of 17 additional scenes (out of 53), reducing the average error of individual emission estimates from approximately 30%–40% to 22%–25% compared with the traditional method. Furthermore, we highlight the significant potential of satellite data to uncover discrepancies in reported emission estimates, for example, by identifying under‐reported or missing emission sources. The proposed approach can be extended to other case studies and applied to future satellite missions with joint CO2/NO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}/{\text{NO}}_{2}$ observations, such as CO2M, GOSAT‐GW, TanSat‐2, and TANGO."

While global climate models generate invaluable dynamical temperature forecasts, the crucial role of model output statistics (MOS) in enhancing forecast skill has not been thoroughly investigated. This paper aims to unravel the potential of MOS methods for improving global temperature forecasts. It is achieved by developing a MOS toolkit to iteratively incorporate the attributes of bias, spread, trend, and association into forecast post‐processing, resulting in a series of methodical one‐factor‐at‐a‐time experiments. A case study is devised for monthly forecasts of July 2‐m air temperature (T2m) over land and sea surface temperature (SST) generated by the National Center for Environmental Prediction's Climate Forecast System version 2. The results expose the detrimental impacts of biases and unreliable ensemble spreads within raw temperature forecasts. At the lead time of 0 months, the continuous ranked probability skill score (CRPSS) is −128.51 ± 252.46% for T2m over land and 7.72 ± 76.66% for SST over ocean, indicating considerable underperformance of raw forecasts against reference climatological forecasts across numerous grid cells. The incremental considerations of bias, spread, trend, and association of the MOS methods result in substantial skill enhancements across global land and marine grid cells. Notably, the CRPSS of T2m is improved to 21.00 ± 23.63% and the SST forecast skill is improved to 42.26 ± 22.43%.

Prior studies have used localized observational records to analyze air temperature trends across distinct geographical regions, leaving local and inter‐regional variations to be undetected. Using the high‐resolution temperature product AntAir ICE, air temperature trends and extreme warming events were identified across Antarctica for the period 2003–2021. Unsupervised clustering was applied to austral summer and annual mean air temperature trends to divide Antarctica into 12 regions exhibiting similarity in temperature trends. Our results show a significant annual mean cooling trend of ‒0.12°CYr $0.12\,\sfrac{{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}}{\text{Yr}}$ for the terrestrial Antarctic Peninsula, and an austral summer (annual) warming trend of +0.08°CYr $0.08\,\sfrac{{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}}{\text{Yr}}$ (+0.07°CYr $0.07\,\sfrac{{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}}{\text{Yr}}$) in the Ross Sea region's Victoria Land and Transantarctic Mountains. The spatial extent of each of the 12 clusters' extreme air temperature events was mapped in austral summer revealing that West Antarctica has spatially confined events, while East Antarctica events are widespread. ERA5 data indicate that West Antarctica's extreme air temperature events are associated with consistent meridional atmospheric flows. Local to regional extreme warming events in East Antarctica are associated with inland high‐pressure systems, which enhance katabatic winds. Localized warming events around complex coastal geographies appear to be related to mesoscale wind systems such as foehn but require further investigation using mesoscale numerical weather models.

Glacier runoff is a crucial source of water in mountain basins, and a decrease in its contribution can affect agricultural production. In this study, we modeled the agricultural sector's response to changes in glacier runoff in the Asian basins of Amu Darya, Tarim Interior, and Indus, using the Global Change Analysis Model, which was driven by surface runoff derived from the Xanthos hydrological model and the Open Global Glacier Model. Our findings indicate that under SSP5‐8.5, there is an increase in accessible water during the Peak‐Water Glacier Runoff compared to the Historical Glacier Runoff scenario. However, accessible water under SSP58.5 falls below the Historical Glacier Runoff scenario in the last decades of the 21st century. The initial increase in accessible water drives the GCAM agricultural model to increase the production of oil crops, root tubers, sugar crops, and fruits, but only temporarily until peak glacier runoff occurrence. In Pakistan, we observe the adaptive response of neighboring basins (increased production) to a reduction in crop production in the Amu Darya and Indus and vice versa. Our results support the argument that policymakers should implement a holistic long‐term perspective, in which the apparent positive economic effect of the temporary increase in accessible water is balanced with the threat to intergenerational access to freshwater and ecosystem conservation."

 Enantioenriched α-arylated dialkyl ketones with acidic proton are ubiquitous subunits in valuable target organic molecules and serve as versatile synthetic precursors for other value-added chiral blocks. Herein, a distinct synthetic strategy of enantioenriched α-arylated dialkyl ketones enabled by nickel-catalyzed iterative cross-hydrocarbonylation of two alkenes has been developed, representing a reaction mode for the direct synthesis of asymmetric α-arylated dialkyl ketones. One aliphatic alkene and one styrene are creatively used as surrogates of two different alkyl precursors. Two different alkenes are sewed together by a “carbonyl glue” with exclusive alkene sorting. This straightforward and gas-free protocol transforms a diverse array of styrene and unactivated alkenes into highly valuable α-arylated dialkyl ketones with high levels of enantioselectivity, allowing for the construction of enantioenriched unsymmetric dialkyl ketones from only alkenes. This process is also applicable to late-stage functionalization of complex molecules.

 Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are promising candidates for beyond-silicon electronic devices. However, an excessive contact resistance due to ineffective or non-existent doping techniques hinders their technological readiness. Here, we unveil the doping mechanism of pure nitric oxide and demonstrate its effectiveness on wafer-scale grown monolayer and bilayer tungsten diselenide (1L- and 2L-WSe2) transistors, where doping bands induced by nitric oxide can realign the Schottky barrier and approach p-type unipolar transport. This doping approach, combined with a scaled high-κ dielectric, yields WSe2 transistors with high performance metrics. For monolayer WSe2, we achieved an on-state current of 300 μA/μm (at a drain-to-source voltage of –1 V and overdrive voltage of –0.8 V), contact resistance of 875 Ω·μm, peak transconductance of 400 μS/μm, and a subthreshold swing of 70 mV/dec, while preserving on/off ratios >109, minimal variability, and good stability over 24 days under moderate thermal conditions. For bilayer WSe2, the devices exhibit an on-state current of 448 μA/μm and contact resistance of 390 Ω·μm, further showcasing the scalability and effectiveness of the NO doping method.

 Gestational diabetes mellitus, a heritable metabolic disorder and the most common pregnancy-related condition, remains understudied regarding its genetic architecture and its potential for early prediction using genetic data. Here we conducted genome-wide association studies on 116,144 Chinese pregnancies, leveraging their non-invasive prenatal test sequencing data and detailed prenatal records. We identified 13 novel loci for gestational diabetes mellitus and 111 for five glycemic traits, with minor allele frequencies of 0.01-0.5 and absolute effect sizes of 0.03-0.62. Approximately 50% of these loci were specific to gestational diabetes mellitus and gestational glycemic levels, distinct from type 2 diabetes and general glycemic levels in East Asians. A machine learning model integrating polygenic risk scores and prenatal records predicted gestational diabetes mellitus before 20 weeks of gestation, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.729 and an accuracy of 0.835. Shapley values highlighted polygenic risk scores as key contributors.

This work demonstrates an outdoor radiant cooling structure incorporating infrared-reflective surfaces that delivers enhanced thermal comfort. 
 As climate change accelerates, extreme heat events will intensify, threatening vulnerable populations experiencing dangerous heat outdoors. Active radiant cooling has recently emerged as a promising strategy for outdoor thermal comfort, at it offers cooling at a distance without the inefficiency of conditioning unconfined air. However, for radiant cooling structures to be effective, the overwhelming majority of their internal surfaces must be actively cooled, typically with visibly opaque panels, raising practicality and safety concerns. Here, we demonstrate that thermal comfort can be achieved in an outdoor cooling structure that lightly uses radiant cooling and amplifies this cooling effect using visibly transparent, infrared-reflective surfaces. This approach enables visibly open cooling structures that will be accepted by a wide range of communities. We first derive an analytical model that relates the mean radiant temperature to the proportion of cold and reflective surfaces in a structure. We then experimentally demonstrate such a structure, with human subject testing revealing a substantial enhancement in thermal comfort as experienced by occupants. Our results highlight how next-generation radiant cooling structures can use fewer actively cooled surfaces without compromising on cooling effectiveness. This is a practical approach to enabling thermal comfort outdoors in extreme heat conditions.

 Atmospheric moisture flows play a vital role in the hydrological cycle, connecting evaporation sources to precipitation sinks. While high-resolution tracking models provide valuable insights, discrepancies arise comparing tracked flows to atmospheric reanalysis data. Here we reconcile tracked atmospheric flows with reanalysis data by means of the Iterative Proportional Fitting applied to the UTrack dataset (averaged over 2008–2017) aggregated within countries and ocean boundaries. It corrects country-scale discrepancies of up to 275% in precipitation and 225% in evaporation, adjusting bilateral flows by  ~ 0.07 %, on average. The resulting dataset ensures that the total tracked moisture matches total precipitation at the sink and evaporation at the source annually. Remarkably, this procedure can be applied to any tracking model output and scale of analysis. The reconciled dataset enhances transboundary atmospheric water flows analysis, revealing that 45% of total terrestrial precipitation (~1.5  ⋅ 105 km3yr−1) originates from land evaporation (9.8  ⋅ 104 km3yr−1).

 Increased CH4 emissions from rewetted organic soils can undermine the climate benefits of reduced CO2 release. This is especially problematic in low-lying areas that tend to remain waterlogged and act as potential CH4 hotspots. Here we test whether burning the soil surface before rewetting can reduce CH4 emissions. Using laboratory experiments with soil cores collected from degraded farmland in Denmark, we found that rewetting organic soils following burning reduced CH4 emissions by more than 95% over a 90-day period compared to rewetting alone. The reduction was likely associated with changed soil chemistry such as increased soil carbon stability and the decrease in methanogen abundance and activity. Our results suggest that targeted burning could help suppress short-term CH4 emissions after rewetting. However, long-term field studies are needed to understand whether this effect persists and to assess potential ecological risks such as pollution runoff, before any broader field-scale implementation is considered.

 China has restored extensive forest areas through afforestation and natural regeneration, contributing to climate change mitigation. However, the restoration patterns and the mechanisms driving aboveground carbon accumulation in these forests remain unclear. We mapped the distribution of the aboveground carbon accumulation rates for China’s young planted and natural forests in 2020 and identified key factors influencing their variability using remote sensing and field data. The analysis reveals marked spatial heterogeneity in aboveground carbon accumulation rates of these restored young forests, driven primarily by seasonal temperature. At comparable ages, young planted forests show lower aboveground carbon accumulation rates than young natural forests, mainly due to different tree density. Although young planted forests currently sequester more carbon, projections indicate that by 2060 its total aboveground carbon stock will be lower than that of young natural forests. Consequently, our findings emphasize optimizing forest structure in managing China’s planted forests to enhance carbon storage.

 The growth of the Tibetan Plateau is traditionally attributed to the India-Asia collision and subsequent convergence. However, recent paleo-elevation reconstructions suggest that Gangdese arc in southern Tibetan Plateau reached >4.0 km before or alongside the collision. Here we reconstruct the crustal thickness evolution of the Gangdese arc during the Late Cretaceous-Cenozoic using a machine learning model and investigate the thermal evolution by analyzing the metamorphic temperature-pressure-age properties of crustal rocks. Isostatic calculations are performed to constrain the crustal density evolution. Our results show that crustal thickness decreased from ~60 to ~40 km between 80 and 55 Ma, with an increase in lithosphere geotherm and a drop in average crustal density (from ~2.97 to ~2.70 g/cm3). These results suggest the removal of a 20 km thick dense lower crust during that period. Combined with numerical modeling and geological evidence, we propose that lower crustal foundering drove the uplift of the Gangdese arc during the Paleocene, independent of the India-Asia collision.

 Satellite remote sensing has greatly advanced the study of land surface phenology, providing crucial insights into large-scale vegetation dynamics in the context of climate change. Multi-sensor satellite-derived vegetation proxies, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in optical mode, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) in fluorescence mode, and vegetation optical depth (VOD) in microwave mode, are effective indicators of vegetation dynamics in greenness, biomass, and productivity. However, a comprehensive understanding of phenological patterns derived from these proxies and their climatic responses remains limited. In this study, spanning 1988–2021, we analyzed spatio-temporal patterns and climatic responses of spring green-up dates (GUDs) and autumn dates of foliar senescence (DFSs) across the three vegetation proxies. We found broadly consistent trends of advancing GUDs (−2.4 to −1.1 days decade−1) across proxies, while DFSs exhibited divergent temporal patterns: VOD-derived DFSs showed significant delays (+1.1 days decade−1), whereas NDVI- and SIF-derived DFSs displayed no clear trends. Rising temperatures were the primary driver of earlier GUDs, while precipitation and insolation had limited influence. In autumn, warming delayed VOD-based DFSs but had minimal effects on NDVI- and SIF-based estimates. Spatial attribution analyses indicated that both biotic and abiotic factors contributed to the spatial variability in climatic responses, with species richness and tree density modulating temperature effects. These findings highlight the importance of proxy selection in phenological studies and underscore the need for integrated investigations into the biophysical mechanisms driving non-uniform climatic responses across vegetation proxies."

 Gaseous and particulate organic compounds are key components of atmospheric chemistry and better understanding their composition, sources and processes is essential to limit their impacts. Source apportionment using positive matrix factorization (PMF) is customarily performed for such studies. Combining organic aerosol data with their gaseous precursors was shown to be a promising approach, however very rarely attempted so far, to refine their origins using PMF. In this study, co-located continuous proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) and aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) measurements were performed at the suburban SIRTA station located in the Paris region. A combined dataset using both instruments during summer (June–August 2020) was then used in an exploratory PMF analysis to investigate the sources and processes of organic compounds, particularly the influences of biogenic emissions and important photochemical reactions on the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in this period of the year. Specific parameters and evaluation procedures were needed to ensure an equivalent representation of both instruments in the PMF model. A weighing factor was applied to the PTR-MS uncertainties which was controlled and optimized based on the analysis of the modelled scaled residuals. Seven main factors were obtained, describing anthropogenic sources (hydrocarbon-like organics, cooking-like organics), primary biogenic volatile organics, nighttime VOC, oxidized organics, aged organics and a specific isoprene oxidation factor which contributed 11 % to VOC and 4 % to OA. Compared to single-instrument PMFs, more factors were obtained, notably including the cooking-like factor which is not usually resolved using only ACSM data. This method also showed a better mathematical performance for the PTR-MS variables (mean absolute scaled residuals lower for the combined PMF (11.2) than for the PTR-MS-only PMF (38.2)) and a better separation of the factors for the ACSM variables in the combined PMF."

 Studies related to vertical probing of dust aerosols during an active episode of a dust storm will enable quantification of the dust load and unleash the mechanics of dust transport. Space-borne sensors, especially LiDAR-based sensors, are proven to detect the vertical concentration of dust aerosols; practically, essaying the suspended aerosols in the troposphere has been well recorded by the Cloud-Aerosol LIdar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) mission, which retired in 2023. This research is motivated to utilize NASA ICESat-2's photon data as a substitute for the CALIPSO mission to study the vertical structure of an active dust storm. This research suggests using photons from ICESat-2's weak beam over the strong beam to successfully profile aerosols suspended in the atmosphere. Technical validation by comparing the heights of the dust aerosols retrieved by attenuated photons from ICESat-2 and 532 nm total attenuated backscatter of Cloud-Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) sensor yielded a good agreement of the results from both sensors. Further, analyzing the vertical wind profiles from ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) data for the ten test sites with active dust storms confirms that the lift force of wind speed is greater than 5 m/s, while the drag force of the wind speed above the vertical structure having the dust aerosols is always greater than the lift force."
