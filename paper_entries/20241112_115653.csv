10.5194/acp-24-12409-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了对流层中酚类化合物（PhCs）的快速氧化过程，重点关注气水界面和二氧化钛矿物气溶胶的影响。研究选取苯酚、4-羟基苯甲醛和香兰素三种模型化合物，利用分子动力学模拟和量子化学计算，探究了它们在气相、水相、气水界面和TiO2表面上的反应机理和动力学。结果表明，气水界面和TiO2簇促进了PhCs的氧化，其中苯酚的反应活性最高。不同环境介质对不同PhCs的氧化影响不同，这与取代基团有关。一些氧化产物比母体化合物毒性更大。这项研究虽然没有直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如卫星观测或特定传感器，但其结果对于改进大气化学模型，特别是对流层中酚类化合物氧化过程的模拟至关重要，这将间接地提升空气质量监测和大气成分分析的精度。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术具有间接关联。,"['Atmospheric composition', 'Phenolic compounds', 'Tropospheric chemistry', 'Air quality', 'Mineral dust', 'Air-water interface', 'Ozone', 'Hydroxyl radical', 'Remote sensing (indirectly)']",Yanru Huo;Mingxue Li;Xueyu Wang;Jianfei Sun;Yuxin Zhou;Yuhui Ma;Maoxia He,Rapid oxidation of phenolic compounds by O3 and HO●: effects of the air–water interface and mineral dust in tropospheric chemical processes,"This work found that the air–water (A–W) interface and TiO2 clusters promote the oxidation of phenolic compounds (PhCs) to varying degrees compared with the gas phase and bulk water. Some byproducts are more harmful than their parent compounds. This work provides important evidence for the rapid oxidation observed in O3/HO• + PhC experiments at the A–W interface and in mineral dust. 
 Environmental media affect the atmospheric oxidation processes of phenolic compounds (PhCs) released from biomass burning in the troposphere. To address the gaps in experimental research, phenol (Ph), 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (4-HBA), and vanillin (VL) are chosen as model compounds to investigate their reaction mechanism and kinetics at the air–water (A–W) interface, on TiO2 mineral aerosols, in the gas phase, and in bulk water using a combination of molecular dynamics simulation and quantum chemical calculations. Of the compounds, Ph was the most reactive one. The occurrence percentages of Ph, 4-HBA, and VL staying at the A–W interface are ∼ 72 %, ∼ 68 %, and ∼ 73 %, respectively. As the size of (TiO2)n clusters increases, the adsorption capacity decreases until n > 4, and beyond this, the capacity remains stable. A–W interface and TiO2 clusters facilitate Ph and VL reactions initiated by the O3 and HO•, respectively. However, oxidation reactions of 4-HBA are little affected by environmental media because of its electron-withdrawing group. The O3- and HO•-initiated reaction rate constant (k) values follow the order of A–WPh > TiO2 VL > A–WVL > A–W4-HBA > TiO2 4-HBA > TiO2 Ph and TiO2 VL > A–WPh > A–WVL > TiO2 4-HBA > TiO2 Ph > A–W4-HBA, respectively. Some byproducts are more harmful than their parent compounds, so they should be given special attention. This work provides key evidence for the rapid oxidation observed in the O3/HO• + PhC experiments at the A–W interface. More importantly, differences in the oxidation of PhCs by different environmental media due to the impact of substituent groups were also identified."
10.5194/acp-24-12465-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了2005年至2021年间六氟化硫(SF6)的全球排放量及其在大气中的浓度。研究者使用反向建模的方法，结合地面、飞机和船舶观测到的SF6浓度数据，对全球SF6排放量进行了重新分析。结果表明，美国和欧盟的SF6排放量有所下降，而中国的排放量大幅增长，导致全球SF6排放量总体呈上升趋势。研究还发现，美国、欧盟和中国的国家报告都低估了各自的SF6排放量。这项研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及到大气成分分析（SF6是大气中的重要温室气体）、排放源的监测以及利用大气观测数据进行反演建模等方面。通过分析SF6在大气中的浓度分布，可以反推其排放源的强度和位置，从而为制定相应的减排政策提供科学依据。,"['sulfur hexafluoride (SF6)', 'greenhouse gas', 'atmospheric composition', 'emission', 'inverse modelling', 'atmospheric re-analysis', 'air quality monitoring']",Martin Vojta;Andreas Plach;Saurabh Annadate;Sunyoung Park;Gawon Lee;Pallav Purohit;Florian Lindl;Xin Lan;Jens Mühle;Rona L. Thompson;Andreas Stohl,A global re-analysis of regionally resolved  emissions and atmospheric mole fractions  of SF6 for the period 2005–2021,"We constrain the global emissions of the very potent greenhouse gas sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) between 2005 and 2021. We show that SF6 emissions are decreasing in the USA and in the EU, while they are substantially growing in China, leading overall to an increasing global emission trend. The national reports for the USA, EU, and China all underestimated their SF6 emissions. However, stringent mitigation measures can successfully reduce SF6 emissions, as can be seen in the EU emission trend. 
 We determine the global emission distribution of the potent greenhouse gas sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) for the period 2005–2021 using inverse modelling. The inversion is based on 50 d backward simulations with the Lagrangian particle dispersion model (LPDM) FLEXPART and on a comprehensive observation data set of SF6 mole fractions in which we combine continuous with flask measurements sampled at fixed surface locations and observations from aircraft and ship campaigns. We use a global-distribution-based (GDB) approach to determine baseline mole fractions directly from global SF6 mole fraction fields at the termination points of the backward trajectories. We compute these fields by performing an atmospheric SF6 re-analysis, assimilating global SF6 observations into modelled global three-dimensional mole fraction fields. Our inversion results are in excellent agreement with several regional inversion studies in the USA, Europe, and China. We find that (1) annual US SF6 emissions strongly decreased from 1.25 Gg in 2005 to 0.48 Gg in 2021; however, they were on average twice as high as the reported emissions to the United Nations. (2) SF6 emissions from EU countries show an average decreasing trend of −0.006 Gg yr−1 during the period 2005 to 2021, including a substantial drop in 2018. This drop is likely a direct result of the EU's F-gas regulation 517/2014, which bans the use of SF6 for recycling magnesium die-casting alloys as of 2018 and requires leak detection systems for electrical switch gear. (3) Chinese annual emissions grew from 1.28 Gg in 2005 to 5.16 Gg in 2021, with a trend of 0.21 Gg yr−1, which is even higher than the average global total emission trend of 0.20 Gg yr−1. (4) National reports for the USA, Europe, and China all underestimated their SF6 emissions. (5) Our results indicate increasing emissions in poorly monitored areas (e.g. India, Africa, and South America); however, these results are uncertain due to weak observational constraints, highlighting the need for enhanced monitoring in these areas. (6) Global total SF6 emissions are comparable to estimates in previous studies but are sensitive to a priori estimates due to the low network sensitivity in poorly monitored regions. (7) Monthly inversions indicate that SF6 emissions in the Northern Hemisphere were on average higher in summer than in winter throughout the study period."
10.5194/acp-24-12375-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了法国北部地面太阳辐射的年际变化及其与云、气溶胶和几何因素之间的关系。文章利用2010年至2022年的小时分辨率地面观测数据，分析了不同天空状况（晴空、晴空带云、多云）下全球水平辐照度（GHI）、水平直射辐照度（BHI）和水平散射辐照度（DHI）的变化趋势。研究结果表明，云对SSI的影响最为显著，其次是气溶胶和太阳天顶角等几何因素。即使在晴空带云的情况下，云的存在也可能导致SSI增强，甚至超过无云无气溶胶的理想情况。文章还定量分析了气溶胶光学厚度变化对SSI的影响，并探讨了不同因素对春季和夏季SSI变化的相对贡献。总的来说，这项研究使用了地面观测数据和辐射传输模拟，定量分析了云、气溶胶和几何因素对地表太阳辐射的影响，这与大气环境遥感技术，特别是气溶胶和云特性观测以及辐射传输模拟密切相关。,"['Aerosols', 'Cloud properties', 'Surface solar irradiance', 'Ground-based measurements', 'Radiative transfer']",Gabriel Chesnoiu;Nicolas Ferlay;Isabelle Chiapello;Frédérique Auriol;Diane Catalfamo;Mathieu Compiègne;Thierry Elias;Isabelle Jankowiak,"Influence of cloudy and clear-sky partitions, aerosols, and geometry on the recent variability in surface solar irradiance components in northern France","The measured ground-based surface solar irradiance variability and its sensitivity to scene parameters are analysed with a filtering of sky conditions at a given site. Its multivariate analysis is applied to observed trends over 2010–2022. The recorded values show, in addition to the dominant effects of cloud occurrence, the variable effects of aerosol and geometry. Clear-sun-with-cloud situations are highlighted by SSI levels close to those of aerosol- and cloud-free situations. 
 Surface solar irradiance (SSI) is a fundamental parameter whose components (direct and diffuse) and variabilities are highly influenced by changes in atmospheric content and scene parameters. The respective importance of cloudy-sky conditions and atmospheric aerosols on SSI evolutions is region dependent and only partially quantified. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of SSI variabilities recorded in northern France, a region with extensive variability in sky conditions and aerosol loads. Through the application of automatic filtering methods to 1 min resolution SSI ground-based measurements over Lille, sky conditions are classified as clear-sky, 11 %; clear-sun-with-cloud, 22 %; and cloudy-sun situations, 67 % from 2010 to 2022, for which we analyze the statistics and variabilities in the global horizontal irradiance (GHI), beam horizontal irradiance (BHI), and diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI). Coincident photometric measurements of aerosol properties and radiative-transfer simulations provide the means to conduct a multivariate analysis of the SSI observed trends and year-to-year evolutions and to estimate aerosol and cloud forcings under clear-sun conditions. The analysis of the record value of all-sky GHI in spring 2020 attributes 89 % of the changes to the exceptional sunlight conditions (57 % of clear-sun situations). It highlights also for that season the importance of solar zenith-angle changes, whose positive effects on clear-sun conditions surpass those due to aerosols. Our results show all-sky GHI and BHI positive trends of around +4.0 and +4.4 Wm-2yr-1, respectively, in both spring and summer, which are explained by more than 60 % by an increase in clear-sun occurrences of +1 % yr−1. Additional significant BHI increases under clear-sun conditions are mainly explained in spring by the negative trend in aerosol optical depth (−0.011 yr−1) and partly by angular effects in summer. Moreover, we find that clear-sun-with-cloud situations are frequently marked by irradiance enhancement due to clouds, with 13 % more GHI on a monthly average and 10 % additional diffuse proportion than in clear-sky situations. Under such conditions, clouds add on average 25 W m−2 of diffuse irradiance that sets the GHI at the remarkable level of pristine (aerosol-and-cloud-free) conditions or even higher, by more than +10 W m−2 in summer and for low aerosol loads. Overall, our results highlight the dominant and complex influence of cloudy conditions on SSI, which precedes or combines with that of aerosols and geometrical effects, and leads to a remarkable global level of SSI in clear-sun-with-cloud situations."
10.5194/acp-24-12447-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究的是大气中温室气体反演中的流量相关观测误差。研究者发现，大气传输模型中的不确定性是导致温室气体排放估算误差的主要来源。论文提出了一种使用时间变化的、流量相关的传输不确定性来改进排放估算的方法。通过理想化实验，特别是使用集合卡尔曼平滑器系统，研究者证明了该方法能够提高欧洲CH4和SF6排放估算的精度。研究中使用了地面观测网络数据，并考虑了不同观测时间（例如，只使用下午的观测数据或使用所有小时的数据）对反演结果的影响。结果表明，将流量相关的误差纳入反演技术可以更有效地减少估算排放与真实排放之间的差异，尤其对于SF6反演和较弱的通量信号而言效果更显著。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及到利用大气成分分析（温室气体浓度）和地面观测数据来反演排放源，从而进行大气环境监测。,"['Greenhouse gas', 'Atmospheric inversion', 'CH4', 'SF6', 'Emission estimation', 'Atmospheric transport', 'Ensemble Kalman smoother', 'In situ measurement']",Michael Steiner;Luca Cantarello;Stephan Henne;Dominik Brunner,Flow-dependent observation errors for greenhouse gas inversions in an ensemble Kalman smoother,"Atmospheric greenhouse gas inversions have great potential to independently check reported bottom-up emissions; however they are subject to large uncertainties. It is paramount to address and reduce the largest source of uncertainty, which stems from the representation of atmospheric transport in the models. In this study, we show that the use of a temporally varying flow-dependent atmospheric transport uncertainty can enhance the accuracy of emission estimation in an idealized experiment. 
 Atmospheric inverse modeling is the process of estimating emissions from atmospheric observations by minimizing a cost function, which includes a term describing the difference between simulated and observed concentrations. The minimization of this difference is typically limited by uncertainties in the atmospheric transport model rather than by uncertainties in the observations. In this study, we showcase how a temporally varying, flow-dependent atmospheric transport uncertainty can enhance the accuracy of emission estimation through idealized experiments using an ensemble Kalman smoother system. We use the estimation of European CH4 emissions from the in situ measurement network as an example, but we also demonstrate the additional benefits for trace gases with more localized sources, such as SF6. The uncertainty in flow-dependent transport is determined using meteorological ensemble simulations that are perturbed by physics and driven at the boundaries by an analysis ensemble from a global meteorology and a CH4 simulation. The impact of direct representation of temporally varying transport uncertainties in atmospheric inversions is then investigated in an observation system simulation experiment framework in various setups and for different flux signals. We show that the uncertainty in the transport model varies significantly in space and time and that it is generally highest during nighttime. We apply inversions using only afternoon observations, as is common practice, but also explore the option of assimilating hourly data irrespective of the hour of day using a filter based on transport uncertainty and taking into account the temporal covariances. Our findings indicate that incorporating flow-dependent uncertainties in inversion techniques leads to more accurate estimates of GHG emissions. Differences between estimated and true emissions could be reduced more effectively by 9 % to 82 %, with generally larger improvements for the SF6 inversion problem and for the more challenging setup with small flux signals."

 The age of air is an important transport diagnostic that can be derived from trace gas measurements and compared to global chemistry climate model output. We describe a new technique to calculate the age of air, measuring transport times from the Earth's surface to any location in the atmosphere based on simultaneous in situ measurements of multiple key long-lived trace gases. The primary benefits of this new technique include (1) optimized ages of air consistent with simultaneously measured SF6 and CO2; (2) age of air from the upper troposphere through the stratosphere; (3) estimates of the second moment of age spectra that have not been well constrained from measurements; and (4) flexibility to be used with measurements across multiple instruments, platforms, and decades. We demonstrate the technique on aircraft and balloon measurements from the 1990s, the last period of extensive stratospheric in situ sampling, and several recent missions from the 2020s, and compare the results with previously published and modeled values."
10.5194/amt-17-6459-2024,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这篇论文介绍了一种改进的用于从S5P-TROPOMI卫星数据中反演对流层臭氧的新方法CHORA。该方法的核心是使用局部云作为参考，而不是传统的太平洋云参考区域，从而减少了平流层臭氧区域差异带来的误差。论文比较了该方法（特别是其中的CLCT算法）与传统方法以及ESA的TROPOMI产品，结果表明，CHORA方法，尤其CLCT算法，在热带和亚热带地区对流层臭氧反演的精度更高，与探空仪观测结果更一致。该研究对于提高卫星遥感监测对流层臭氧的精度具有重要意义，并为未来地球静止轨道卫星（如GEMS、Sentinel-4和TEMPO）上的臭氧监测提供了改进算法。,"['Tropospheric ozone', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Air quality monitoring', 'S5P-TROPOMI', 'Atmospheric composition', 'Geostationary satellites', 'Ozone profile retrieval', 'Cloud-related effects']",Swathi Maratt Satheesan;Kai-Uwe Eichmann;John P. Burrows;Mark Weber;Ryan Stauffer;Anne M. Thompson;Debra Kollonige,Improved convective cloud differential (CCD) tropospheric ozone from S5P-TROPOMI satellite data using local cloud fields,"CHORA, an advanced cloud convective differential technique, enhances the accuracy of tropospheric-ozone retrievals. Unlike the traditional Pacific cloud reference sector scheme, CHORA introduces a local-cloud reference sector and an alternative approach (CLCT) for precision. Analysing monthly averaged TROPOMI data from 2018 to 2022 and validating with SHADOZ ozonesonde data, CLCT outperforms other methods and so is the preferred choice, especially in future geostationary satellite missions. 
 We present the CHORA (Cloud Height Ozone Reference Algorithm) for retrieving tropospheric-ozone columns from S5P-TROPOMI (Sentinel-5 Precursor–TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument). The method uses a local-cloud reference sector (CLC – CHORA Local Cloud) to determine the stratospheric (above-cloud) column, which is subtracted from the total column in clear-sky scenes in the same zonal band to retrieve the tropospheric column. The standard CCD (convective cloud differential) approach uses cloud data from the Pacific region (CPC – CHORA Pacific Cloud) instead. An important assumption for the standard method is the zonal invariance of stratospheric ozone. The local-cloud approach is the first step to diminish this constraint in order to extend the CCD method to mid-latitudes, where stratospheric-ozone variability is larger. An iterative approach has been developed for the automatic selection of an optimal local-cloud reference sector around each retrieval grid box varying latitudinally by ± 1° and longitudinally between ± 5 and ± 50°. The optimised CLCT (CHORA Local Cloud Theil–Sen) algorithm, a follow-up from the CLC, employs a homogeneity criterion for total ozone from the cloud reference sector in order to overcome the inhomogeneities in stratospheric ozone. It directly estimates the above-cloud column ozone for a common reference altitude of 270 hPa using the Theil–Sen regression. The latter allows for the combination of the CCD method with the cloud-slicing algorithm that retrieves upper-tropospheric ozone volume mixing ratios. Monthly averaged tropospheric-column ozone (TCO) using the Pacific cloud reference sector (CPC) and the local-cloud reference sector (CLC, CLCT) has been determined over the tropics and subtropics (26° S–22° N) using TROPOMI for the time period from 2018 to 2022. The accuracy of the various methods was investigated by means of comparisons with spatially collocated NASA/GSFC SHADOZ (Southern Hemisphere Additional Ozonesondes) measurements and the ESA TROPOMI level-2 tropospheric-ozone product. At eight out of nine tropical stations, tropospheric-ozone columns using the CLCT yield better agreement with ozonesondes than the CPC. In the tropical region (20° S–20° N), the CLCT shows a significantly lower overall mean bias and dispersion of 1 ± 7 %, outperforming both the CPC (12 ± 10 %) and CCD-ESA (22 ± 10 %). The CLCT surpasses the ESA operational product, providing more accurate tropospheric-ozone retrievals at eight out of nine stations in the tropics. For the Hilo station, with a larger stratospheric-ozone variability due to its proximity to the subtropics, the bias of +30 % (CPC) is effectively reduced to −5 % (CLCT). Similarly, in the subtropics (Reunion, Irene, Hanoi, and King's Park), the CLCT algorithm provides an overall bias and scatter of −11 ± 9 % with respect to sondes. The CLCT effectively reduces the impact of stratospheric-ozone inhomogeneity, typically at higher latitudes. These results demonstrate the advantage of the local-cloud reference sector in the subtropics. The algorithm is therefore an important basis for subsequent systematic applications in current and future missions of geostationary satellites, like GEMS (Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer, Korea), ESA Sentinel-4, and NASA TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of POllution), predominantly covering the middle latitudes."

Sensitivity tests demonstrate the complexity and non-linear interactions of auxiliary parameters in the AMF calculation. An improved agreement is found with measurements from a global ground-based instrument network. The POMINO retrieval provides a useful source of information for studies combining HCHO and NO2. 
 The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), onboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite launched in October 2017, is dedicated to monitoring the atmospheric composition associated with air quality and climate change. This paper presents the global retrieval of TROPOMI tropospheric formaldehyde (HCHO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) vertical columns using an updated version of the Peking University OMI NO2 (POMINO) algorithm, which focuses on improving the calculation of air mass factors (AMFs). The algorithm features explicit corrections for the surface reflectance anisotropy and aerosol optical effects, and uses daily high-resolution (0.25°×0.25°) a priori HCHO and NO2 profiles from the Global Earth Observing System Composition Forecast (GEOS-CF) dataset. For cloud correction, a consistent approach is used for both HCHO and NO2 retrievals, where (1) the cloud fraction is re-calculated at 440 nm using the same ancillary parameters as those used in the NO2 AMF calculation, and (2) the cloud top pressure is taken from the operational FRESCO-S cloud product."

Active radar is costly, so we focus on a more accessible approach. Using data from the FengYun-3G satellite, we successfully tracked severe weather like Typhoon Khanun and heavy rainfall in Beijing in 2023. This method enhances global precipitation data and helps better understand extreme weather. 
 FengYun 3G satellite (FY-3G), China’s first precipitation measurement satellite, was launched on April 17, 2023. FY-3G carries an advanced multi-channel microwave radiance imager-rainfall measurement (MWRI-RM) system, which, compared to the previous GPM/GMI, includes more sounding channels. Additionally, a Ka/Ku-band dual-frequency precipitation measurement radar (PMR) onboard FY-3G provides 3D observations of severe precipitation systems. Due to the high cost and hardware limitations of precipitation radars, most precipitation-affected satellite observations rely on passive data. Deep learning methods have become effective tools to bridge these two types of observations. In this study, we proposed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to reconstruct PMR-Ku reflectivity profiles (VPR) based on MWRI-RM multi-channel radiances across different precipitation scenarios and analyzed the effects of dual oxygen absorption sounding channels and polarization differences (PD) on reconstruction outcomes. Experiments showed that dual oxygen absorption sounding channels improved VPR accuracy, especially over land, reducing RMSE by 17.42 %. Including PD further enhanced accuracy, reducing RMSE by 23.54 %, while also demonstrating excellent capability in precipitation identification, achieving an F1 score of 0.904. Applying the models to Typhoon Khanun and the extreme precipitation event in Beijing further demonstrated the benefits of dual oxygen sounding channels and PD, even for reflectivity contaminated by ground clutter."

The developed portable LP-FRS instrument expands the measurement capabilities for atmospheric total OH reactivity and will be employed in more field observations. 
 Quantitative measurements of atmospheric total OH reactivity (kOH') provide crucial insights into atmospheric photochemistry. However, widespread application of total OH reactivity measurements is challenging due to insufficient equipment and the complexity of existing instrumentation. In this work, we report the development of a portable laser-flash photolysis Faraday rotation spectroscopy (LP-FRS) instrument for real-time and in-situ measurement of kOH'. To achieve efficient overlapping between the pump and probe laser and realize a long effective absorption path length, thus enabling high sensitivity measurement, a specific Herriott-type pump-probe optical multi-pass cell was designed with an overlapping factor of up to 75.4 %. The instrument’s optical box dimensions were 130 cm × 40 cm × 35 cm. The obtained efficient absorption path was ~ 28.5 m in a base length of 77.2 cm. The kOH' detection precisions of the LP-FRS instrument were 2.3 s-1 and 1.0 s-1 with averaging times of 60 s and 300 s, respectively. The kOH' measurement uncertainty was evaluated to be within 2 s-1. Field measurement was performed, and the difference between the measured kOH' and the model simulated from the measured reactive species was analysed.

To ease the computation of the ocean oxygen budget from in situ DO data, mapping of data on a regular 3D grid is useful. Here, we present a new DO gridded product from the Argo database. We compare it with existing DO mapping from a historical dataset. We suggest that the ocean has generally been losing oxygen since the 1980s, but large interannual and regional variabilities should be considered. 
 Recent estimates of the global inventory of dissolved oxygen (DO) have suggested a decrease of 2 % since the 1960s. However, due to the sparse historical oxygen data coverage, the DO inventory exhibits large regional uncertainties over the interannual timescale. Using the In Situ Analysis System for O2 (ISASO2), a new Argo DO-based optimally interpolated climatology at https://doi.org/10.17882/52367 (Kolodziejczyk et al., 2023), we have estimated an updated regional oxygen inventory. Over the long term (∼ 1980–2013), comparing the ISASO2 Argo fields with the first-guess World Ocean Atlas (WOA18) built from the DO bottle sample fields extracted from the World Ocean Database 2018 (WOD18), the broad tendency to global ocean deoxygenation remains robust in the upper 2000 m, with −451 ± 243 Tmol per decade. The oxygen decline is more pronounced in the key ventilation areas of the Southern Ocean and North Atlantic, except in the Nordic Seas, where oxygen has increased. Over the shorter timescale of the Argo period (2005–2019), the deoxygenation tendency seems globally amplified (−1211 ± 218 Tmol per decade). However, DO changes exhibit stronger amplitude and contrasting regional patterns. The recent changes in Apparent Oxygen Utilization mainly explain the interannual variability in the ventilation regions. However, Argo DO coverage is still incomplete as global and calibration method development is still in progress. Continuing the monitoring of the seasonal-to-interannual and regional-to-global DO variability from ISASO2 will improve our ability to reduce uncertainties in global and regional DO inventories."

We developed a continual learning-based multilayer perceptron, integrating prior knowledge from numerical models and Biogeochemical Argo validation to reconstruct the pan-European 3D nitrate field from 2010 to 2023 (0–2000 m depth, monthly, 0.25° horizontal resolution) using sea surface environmental features. This dataset helps bridge observational gaps and enhances understanding of the ocean's interior environment. 
 Nitrate plays a crucial role in marine ecosystems, as it influences primary productivity. Despite its ecological significance, accurately mapping its three-dimensional (3D) concentration on a large scale remains a considerable challenge due to the inherent limitations of existing methodologies. To address this issue, this study proposes a continual learning-based multilayer perceptron (MLP) model to reconstruct the 3D ocean nitrate concentrations above 2000 m depth over the pan-European coast. The continual learning strategy enhances the model generalization by integrating knowledge from CMEMS nitrate data, effectively overcoming the spatial limitations of BGC-Argo observations in comprehensive nitrate characterization. The proposed approach integrates the advantages of extensive spatial remote sensing observations, the precision of Biogeochemical Argo (BGC-Argo) measurements, and the broad knowledge from simulated nitrate datasets, exploiting the capacity of neural networks to model their nonlinear relationships between multi-source sea surface environmental variables and subsurface nitrates. The model achieves excellent performance in profile cross-validation (R2 = 0.98, RMSE=0.522 µmol · kg−1), and maintains robustness across diverse 3D validation scenarios, suggesting its effectiveness in filling observational gaps and reconstructing the 3D nitrate field. Then, the spatiotemporal distribution of the reconstructed 3D nitrate field from 2010 to 2023 reveals a spatial distribution pattern, an interannual upward trend, and the degree of consistency in vertical variation. The contributions of all 22 input features to the model's estimation were respectively quantified by using Shapley additive explanations values. This study reveals the potential of the proposed approach to overcoming observational limitations and enrich further insights into the 3D ocean condition.

Their deposition in the 1950s coincided with the “Great Acceleration”, which is characterized by large-scale shifts in the Earth’s systems, including increased land-use change and soil degradation.

We have updated a land surface model called ORCHIDEE to better examine the effect of bark beetles on forest health. Our findings suggest that sudden events, such as insect outbreaks, can dramatically affect carbon storage, offering crucial insights into tackling climate change. 
 New (a)biotic conditions resulting from climate change are expected to change disturbance dynamics, such as windthrow, forest fires, droughts, and insect outbreaks, and their interactions. These unprecedented natural disturbance dynamics might alter the capability of forest ecosystems to buffer atmospheric CO2 increases, potentially leading forests to transform from sinks into sources of CO2. This study aims to enhance the ORCHIDEE land surface model to study the impacts of climate change on the dynamics of the bark beetle, Ips typographus, and subsequent effects on forest functioning. The Ips typographus outbreak model is inspired by previous work from Temperli et al. (2013) for the LandClim landscape model. The new implementation of this model in ORCHIDEE r8627 accounts for key differences between ORCHIDEE and LandClim: (1) the coarser spatial resolution of ORCHIDEE; (2) the higher temporal resolution of ORCHIDEE; and (3) the pre-existing process representation of windthrow, drought, and forest structure in ORCHIDEE. Simulation experiments demonstrated the capability of ORCHIDEE to simulate a variety of post-disturbance forest dynamics observed in empirical studies. Through an array of simulation experiments across various climatic conditions and windthrow intensities, the model was tested for its sensitivity to climate, initial disturbance, and selected parameter values. The results of these tests indicated that with a single set of parameters, ORCHIDEE outputs spanned the range of observed dynamics. Additional tests highlighted the substantial impact of incorporating Ips typographus outbreaks on carbon dynamics. Notably, the study revealed that modeling abrupt mortality events as opposed to a continuous mortality framework provides new insights into the short-term carbon sequestration potential of forests under disturbance regimes by showing that the continuous mortality framework tends to overestimate the carbon sink capacity of forests in the 20- to 50-year range in ecosystems under high disturbance pressure compared to scenarios with abrupt mortality events. This model enhancement underscores the critical need to include disturbance dynamics in land surface models to refine predictions of forest carbon dynamics in a changing climate."

This API allows the user to increase automation and productivity, including determination of modes, crossvalidation hindcast and validation. It includes a visualisation module for the results as well as a preprocessing tool that can be also used for other climate variability studies. 
 Maximum Covariance Analysis (MCA) is a well known discriminant analysis technique used for finding coupled patterns in climate data. This is a powerful tool that has been applied to the study of teleconnections, by reducing all possible relationships between a predictor and a predictand field to a few modes of covariability patterns. MCA can be used to provide statistical forecasts, which can complement predictions performed with dynamical models. Nevertheless, the power of this tool relies on its application in a productive and easy way, as it can be applied to the huge climate data-sets available. Spy4Cast is an open-source interface (API), implemented in Python, that contains a MCA-based statistical model to be used for seasonal forecast. Its main goal is to increase automation and productivity. Spy4Cast enables large data-set manipulation and also performs basic tasks like region slicing and plotting. The methodology consists on an initial configuration (data-set reading and slicing) and preprocessing that prepares the data to be fed into MCA, crossvalidation and validation. It acts upon any kind of predictor and predicting variables that can come from any source of data. Spy4Cast analyses the model sensitivity to particular years, including a diagnosis of the stability of the obtained modes to particular outliers. Finally, the spatial and temporal skill, in terms of anomaly correlation coefficient is obtained and a hindcast is provided. The software is easily accessible through a python package and well documented for beginners and experienced programmers. Only a reduced number of third-party libraries are needed, and they are those widely used in data-science and physics."

This study examined the impact of the 2020 Chornobyl wildfire on the redistribution of radionuclides, specifically 137Cs and 90Sr, in the Chornobyl River system. We determined the quantities and speciation of 137Cs and 90Sr in charred residues and soil after wildfires and analyzed the riverine concentrations of these radionuclides based on long-term monitoring data. Our findings indicate that the inventories of 137Cs and 90Sr in the charred residues and soil decreased with increasing distance from the nuclear power plant, which is consistent with the initial deposition patterns. However, the transfer of 137Cs and 90Sr from soil to charred residues did not correspond to the distance, type of contamination source, or fire type. Speciation analysis revealed that the water-soluble fractions of 137Cs and 90Sr in the charred residues were significantly higher than those in the soil, implying increased mobility. Following the wildfires, no significant increase in 137Cs concentration was observed in a river catchment in Chornobyl. However, 90Sr concentrations showed a significant increase, exceeding the permissible levels in drinking water (2 Bq/L) in Ukraine. This increase is attributed to hydrologically driven mobilization processes: (1) during snowmelt in spring and (2) the transport of soluble 90Sr from charred residues and surface soil into the river during high suspended solid concentration events. Collectively, our findings highlight the importance of continuous monitoring of radionuclide dynamics in postwildfire environments to better assess potential radionuclide redistribution and radiation exposure risks. These results provide valuable insights into the behavior of 137Cs and 90Sr in river systems affected by wildfires, contributing to a more accurate understanding of their environmental impacts and potential countermeasures."

In this study, we investigate the partitioning of five carbonyl compounds (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, glyoxal, and methylglyoxal) during haze episodes in Beijing, China. On haze days, the values of field-derived effective Henry’s law coefficients (KHf) on aerosols for these carbonyl compounds are 106–108 M atm–1, which are significantly higher (102–104 times) than those in pure water. Sulfate is observed to have a pronounced “salting-in” effect on these carbonyl compounds, resulting in at least 1-order-of-magnitude increase in their particle-phase concentrations. Parameterization schemes for their partitioning in the ambient aerosols were provided and applied to the multiphase chemical box model (RACM2-CAPRAM). When incorporated into the field-derived parametrization, the model significantly increased hydroxymethanesulfonate (HMS) production by 50-fold compared to using the parameters obtained in pure water, increasing from 2.6 × 10–2 to 1.23 μg m–3 h–1. The formed HMS can facilitate sulfate formation in turn through further oxidation by OH radicals and enhance aerosol hygroscopicity.

This study therefore aimed at investigating the presence of 40 PFAS in sediments, assessing their bioaccumulation in a rooting macrophyte (Myriophyllum spicatum) and a benthic invertebrate (Lumbriculus variegatus) and examining the effects of the presence and bioturbation activity of the invertebrate on PFAS bioaccumulation in the plants. The macrophytes were exposed to sediments originating from a reference and a PFAS-contaminated site. The worms were introduced in half of the replicates, and at the end of the experiment, PFAS were quantified in all environmental compartments. Numerous targeted PFAS were detected in both sediments and taken up by both organisms, with summed PFAS concentrations in organisms largely exceeding concentrations in the original sediments. Bioaccumulation differed between organisms and the two sediments. The presence of the worms significantly reduced the PFAS concentrations in the plant tissues, but for some compounds, root bioaccumulation increased in the presence of the worms. This effect was most prominent for the degradable PFAS precursors. It is concluded that organisms affect the environmental fate of PFAS, emphasizing that contaminant–macroinvertebrate interactions are two-sided."

We compare ERA5 temperatures with an observation‐based temperature reconstruction for Antarctica (RECON) that has monthly resolution for 1958–2022, the period of reliable observational availability. Results for individual stations are also examined. ERA5 anomalously warms Antarctica in relation RECON especially for the period prior to 1979 when satellite observations over the Southern Ocean were sparse. Trend hotspots that are shown to be artifacts are found at three locations and are present until today. The results demonstrate that ERA5 temperature trends can be questionable even today, but variability is well captured after 1979."

Distinguishing the independent contributions of tectonic denudation and climate‐driven erosion on the production and supply of clastic materials of Chinese eolian deposits is important in understanding the dynamic links between global climate changes, tectonics, and Asian dust emission. Here, multi‐proxy rock magnetic records of detrital fractions of Chinese eolian deposits since ∼6 Ma, combined with further comparison with dust accumulation rates and geochemical data, suggest that limited production and supply of clastic materials of Chinese eolian deposits were observed between 5.6 and 4.4 Ma in a warmer climate, and thereafter an increasing trend is evident during a cooler world. We propose that intense physical erosion under cooler conditions caused increasing production of fresh detrital components, exerting dominant influences on the sediment supply to Asian eolian deposits.

 Although the metabolism of yolk lipids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is pivotal for embryonic development, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here we find that the zebrafish hydroxysteroid (17-β) dehydrogenase 12a (hsd17b12a), which encodes an intestinal epithelial-specific enzyme, is essential for the biosynthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in primitive intestine of larval fish. The deficiency of hsd17b12a leads to severe developmental defects in the primitive intestine and exocrine pancreas. Mechanistically, hsd17b12a deficiency interrupts DHA synthesis from essential fatty acids derived from yolk-deposited triglycerides, and consequently disrupts the intestinal DHA-phosphatidic acid (PA)-phosphatidylglycerol (PG) axis. This ultimately results in developmental defects of digestive organs, primarily driven by ferroptosis. Our findings indicate that the DHA-PA-PG axis in the primitive intestine facilitates the uptake of yolk lipids and promotes the expansion of digestive organs, thereby uncovering a mechanism through which DHA regulates embryonic development.

Here, the authors use simulations to show that a decline in Arctic sea ice can lead to a new multidecadal mode of surface temperatures in the Arctic Ocean. 
 Global warming is expected to be able to trigger abrupt transitions in various components of the climate system. Most studies focus on abrupt changes in the mean state of the system, while transitions in climate variability are less well understood. Here, we use multimodel simulations to show that sea-ice loss in the Arctic can trigger a critical transition in internal variability that leads to the emergence of a new climate oscillation in the Arctic Ocean. The intensified air–sea interaction due to sea-ice melt causes an oscillatory behaviour of surface temperatures on a multidecadal timescale. Our results suggest that a new mode of internal variability will emerge in the Arctic Ocean when sea ice declines below a critical threshold.

 Carbon Dioxide Removal is essential for achieving net zero emissions, as it is required to neutralize any residual CO2 emissions. The scientifically recognized definition of Carbon Dioxide Removal requires removed atmospheric CO2 to be stored “durably”; however, it remains unclear what is meant by durably, and interpretations have varied from decades to millennia. Using a reduced-complexity climate model, here we examined the effect of Carbon Dioxide Removal with varying CO2 storage durations. We found that storage duration substantially affects whether net zero emissions achieve the desired temperature outcomes. With a typical 100-year storage duration, net zero CO2 emissions with 6 GtCO2 per year residual emissions result in an additional warming of 1.1 °C by 2500 compared to permanent storage, thus putting the internationally agreed temperature limits at risk. Our findings suggest that a CO2 storage period of less than 1000 years is insufficient for neutralizing remaining fossil CO2 emissions under net zero emissions. These results reinforce the principle that credible neutralization claims using Carbon Dioxide Removal in a net zero framework require balancing emissions with removals of similar atmospheric residence time and storage reservoir, e.g., geological or biogenic.

 The most prominent abrupt climate event during the Holocene, the ‘8.2 ka event’, was characterized by severe cooling at high northern latitudes causing diverse hydroclimate shifts globally. A precise understanding of the hydroclimate response of the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP) region to the 8.2 ka cooling, remains elusive. Here we present sub-centennial stable carbon isotope record on benthic foraminifera Asterorotalia pulchella and X-ray fluorescence elemental data of a marine sediment core from the Kallang River Basin, Singapore. We show that the rainfall in the western IPWP weakened for ~200 years at ~8.15 ± 0.03 ka BP, consistent with other regional and Southern Hemispheric records, however there is a lag of ~100 years from the North Atlantic cooling. A north-south signal propagation from the North Atlantic possibly via oceanic along with atmospheric routes operating on centennial scales led to southward location of Intertropical convergence zone causing droughts in Southeast Asia.

 The 2023–2024 El Niño has raised widespread concern in scientific and public communities. Here, using latest observational reanalysis, we show that this event matured with two distinct spatial peaks of sea surface temperature anomaly in the equatorial central and eastern Pacific, respectively. Like other double-peaked El Niños, the central Pacific sea surface temperature peaked in winter due to zonal advective and thermocline feedbacks. However, the eastern counterpart matured asynchronously in autumn and then stopped growing. This peculiar behavior results primarily from a cooling zonal advection by the anomalous westward current in the eastern Pacific during the autumn of 2023, which is associated with the local wind-driven sea surface height meridional concavity. We further propose that the relatively stronger and more eastward-displaced autumn precipitation in the Pacific intertropical convergence zone in 2023, compared to other double-peaked El Niños, is the primary cause of this distinct wind and sea surface height pattern. The 2023–2024 El Niño experienced two distinct spatial peaks of sea surface temperature anomaly in the equatorial central and eastern Pacific, with the central Pacific peak occurring in winter due to zonal advection and thermocline feedback, while the eastern counterpart matured in autumn, according to results from observational reanalysis data."

 Exploring the capabilities of remote sensing technologies for identifying stress responses in trees due to environmental pressures is crucial for comprehension, management, and maintenance of forests that are productive, healthy, and resilient. In recent decades, research on forest health monitoring has been predominantly focused on data obtained remotely, either from satellites or crewed aircraft. During the last few years, Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained prominence as invaluable remote sensing platforms, increasingly being employed for forest surveying. As intermediary between traditional remote sensing methods and ground-level observations, UAVs can capture high-resolution imagery from low altitudes, even below cloud cover, in unprecedented detail. This ability allows for the precise detection of stress responses at the individual tree scale. In our study, we have acquired a highly heterogenous, multispectral time-series dataset from the International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests (ICP Forests) inventory plots across Bavaria, Germany, focusing on the main tree species. The data was recorded over three consecutive years from a UAV with the objective of monitoring tree physiological stress responses. Concurrently, with the drone flights, the ground-based forest condition surveying (Level-1 monitoring) was conducted, serving as ground-truth validation, and providing detailed information on tree health indicators, such as defoliation and discoloration. Our findings revealed that multispectral imagery obtained from a UAV closely aligns with field data, proving effective detection of physiological stress in trees. Remarkably, in conjunction to the red, red edge, and near-infrared band, the inclusion of the blue band emerged as a critical indicator of tree stress when incorporated into the Blue Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (BNDVI), depending on factors such as tree species, class division, and atmospheric conditions. Furthermore, the averaged values per sample tree over three years, alongside the 5th and 25th percentile of the data distribution, have proven to be of key importance. Based on spectral indices, we achieved good classification accuracies by training species-specific gradient boosting models (macro F1-scores ranging from 0.492 to 0.769). These models can assist in quantifying tree stress responses, thereby supporting the objectives of the ICP Forests program, potentially leading to substantial cost savings or increased coverage in the future."
