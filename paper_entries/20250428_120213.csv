In this paper, within a deep learning framework, we introduce video prediction techniques into SSW events forecasting for the first time. We develop a Global Attention Motion Decoupled Recurrent Neural Network (GMRNN) to better capture the detailed changes of the polar vortex. Through experiments on representative SSW events in 2018, 2019, and 2021, our model can stably predict SSW events 20 days in advance and accurately capture the morphological changes of the stratospheric polar vortex. Furthermore, we compared our model with baseline models, including PredRNN, MotionRNN, and the sub‐seasonal to seasonal (S2S) integrated forecast models from ECMWF, CMA, and ECCC. The results indicate that our model outperforms these models across various evaluation metrics, compare with ensemble prediction results GMRNN's Structural Similarity increased by approximately 11.2%, and the Anomaly Correlation Coefficient increased by approximately 9.5%. The GMRNN model exhibits superior stability and possesses prediction potential over a longer period."

Under greenhouse warming, the reduction of Antarctic sea ice concentration (SIC) acts as an extratropical energy perturbation, exerting a substantial influence on the spatial distribution of tropical SST change. This study reveals a strong correlation between the current Antarctic SIC and tropical SST change, especially the interhemispheric asymmetry and El Niño‐like pattern under greenhouse warming among CMIP6 models. Considering the commonly underestimated Antarctic SIC in CMIP6 models, this study applies an emergent constraint on the projected tropical SST response to greenhouse warming using the observed Antarctic SIC. The interhemispheric asymmetry in projected tropical SST warming can be markedly diminished in the multi‐model ensemble mean, with a 30% reduction in the intermodel uncertainty. The spatial constraints on the projected tropical Pacific SST change produce a more pronounced and westward‐extended El Niño‐like warming pattern."

This study finds that the seasonal delay of tropical rainfall is much more pronounced under spatially patterned sea surface temperature (SST) warming compared to uniform SST warming. Through the lens of the atmospheric energetic framework, we show that the enhanced seasonal delay is primarily driven by the interhemispheric contrast in SST warming between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, which intensifies the inter‐seasonal difference in cross‐equatorial atmospheric energy transport between transition seasons. The SST warming features are found to be crucial, characterized by both its seasonal cycle and annual mean. The former is closely related to the seasonal delay of SST, especially in the northern high latitude, while the latter is further demonstrated by an atmospheric model forced with the annual‐mean spatially patterned SST warming."

We quantify silicic acid supply at IODP Site U1340 in the Bering Sea using biogenic opal and δ30Si of Coscinodiscus, a diatom genus. These records, along with diatom environmental indicators, suggest the Bølling‐Allerød had high silicic acid availability related to a shift from stratification to seasonal upwelling dynamics. We thus propose the primary cause of the high productivity event was increased macronutrient supply from vertical exchange that injected old, nutrient‐rich, CO2‐rich waters into the surface. Enhanced CO2 release from the subarctic Pacific may help explain critical intervals of CO2 rise that occur at the onsets of the Bølling‐Allerød and PreBoreal."

Despite large observation random errors, the assimilation of HLOS winds produced substantial effects on Kelvin and n=1 $n=1$ Rossby wave zonal winds, and, through 4D‐Var, on mixed Rossby‐gravity waves. The effects are asymmetric in easterlies and westerlies, consistent with the background shear. The largest analysis differences due to HLOS winds occurred during the 2019/2020 disruption of the quasi‐biennial oscillation.

Utilizing 41 years of high‐resolution wave hindcasts, we decipher the season‐ and locality‐dependent connections between ENSO and wave patterns around the Hawaiian Islands. The north and west‐facing shores, exposed to energetic northwest swells during boreal winters, experience the most pronounced ENSO‐related variability, with increased high‐surf activity during El Niño years. While the year‐round trade wind waves exhibit moderate correlation with ENSO, the basin‐wide climate influence is masked by locally accelerated trade winds in channels and around large headlands.

The partitioning of precipitation, between surface and groundwater via infiltration, controls the Martian aquifer recharge rates and, subsequently, surface erosion processes. We investigate infiltration at two scales, near‐surface and deep crustal. We estimate infiltration timescales, revealing that near‐surface water loss enhances aeolian erosion over short periods (hours to days). Deep crustal recharge, which requires decades to centuries, affects the deep aquifer response and the water budget. Martian crustal heterogeneity influences infiltration dynamics and runoff production making them dependent on the duration of precipitation. This interaction suggests that the responses of the aquifers to recharge events and groundwater upwelling likely lag behind climate optimum conditions. The accommodation space between topography and aquifer influences Mars' water budget by transiently sequestering water, thus limiting the available water for surface evaporation and inclusion in climate dynamics."

Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) is a climate intervention strategy that aims to ameliorate climate change by artificially cooling Earth. Climate model simulations have found a side‐effect of SAI would be a strengthening of the positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). This links to a stronger North Atlantic jet stream and suggests enhanced CAT in the region. Here, we analyze simulations from the UKESM1 climate model to evaluate the impact of a realistic SAI application on winter‐time trans‐Atlantic CAT. We find a 23% decrease in severe CAT frequency under SAI when compared to a baseline high‐end global warming scenario. Our results indicate that the amelioration of global warming under SAI has a more dominant impact on CAT over the North Atlantic than residual impacts to the NAO."

Whether a link exists between extreme rainfall in North China and the fast MP warming is unknown. Here, using global variable‐resolution atmospheric model with convection‐permitting capability over North China, we find the rapid warming trends, particularly over the MP, are highly conducive to extreme rainfall over North China. In the 2023 case, the fast MP warming induced an anomalous terrestrial high, which in the Western North Pacific Subtropical High created a strong high‐pressure system over North China.

We investigate this question for subduction megathrusts, via linear stability analysis and quasi‐dynamic simulations of slip on a dipping fault characterized by rate‐and‐state friction. Frictional heterogeneity is imposed through alternating velocity‐strengthening and velocity‐weakening (VW) patches, over length scales spanning from those representative of basement relief (several km) to the entrainment of contrasting lithologies (100s of m). The resulting fault behavior is controlled by: (a) the average frictional properties of the fault, and (b) the size of VW blocks relative to a critical length scale. Reasonable ranges of these properties yield sliding behaviors spanning from stable sliding, to slow and seismic slip events that are confined within VW blocks or propagate along the entire fault."

The WRF‐CPM model's ability to reproduce MCSs was evaluated against satellite infrared‐retrieved cloud top temperature, IMERG V06 precipitation, and global reanalysis data ERA5. Results show that WRF‐CPM captures the observed MCS frequency and precipitation patterns but overestimates them in most areas, which might be related to the overestimated moisture and CAPE. The model also reproduces the eastward propagation of MCSs, albeit at a slightly faster speed and longer duration. MCSs in WRF‐CPM exhibits realistic life cycles in terms of cloud top temperature, convective core area, and precipitation. WRF‐CPM tends to overestimate rainfall frequency over 20 mm/hr while underestimates rainfall per MCS, possibly due to an overestimated number and area. The model captures the diurnal cycle of MCSs well in most of East China, though it shows a 2‐hr delay in southeast China and produces the peak a few hours earlier to the east of Tibetan Plateau. Total column water vapor (TCWV) and wind shear are well‐established factors controlling MCS behavior and rainfall, yet capturing the effects remains a challenge for CP models.

 The unprecedented urbanization in China has driven rapid urban and rural development in recent decades. While existing studies have extensively focused on horizontal urban expansion, research on vertical urban expansion patterns remains limited. To address this gap, this study proposed a Multi-Temporal Built-up Height estimation Network (MTBH-Net) to estimate 30-m China Multi-Temporal Built-up Height (CMTBH-30) by integrating Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), Landsat, and PALSAR data. Specifically, we introduced sample migration to generate reference built-up height data and applied the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) disturbance feature to reduce inconsistency in unchanged built-up areas. Validation using the GEDI test set demonstrated that CMTBH-30 achieved RMSEs of 5.10 m, 5.53 m, 6.16 m, and 6.21 m for 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020. Further validation with field-collected data yielded an RMSE of 4.54 m. Additionally, CMTBH-30 is consistent with the 3D-GIoBFP dataset, achieving RMSEs ranging from 5.34 m to 8.95 m across ten cities. Our findings reveal an increase in average built-up heights in China from 10.28 m in 2005 to 10.92 m in 2020, reflecting an upward trend in urban development. Additionally, the standard deviation of built-up heights rises from 5.16 m in 2005 to 7.71 m in 2020, indicating increased height variation nationwide. Regional analysis from 2005 to 2020 highlights notable vertical growth in newly expanded built-up areas in Macau (+14.4 m), Hong Kong (+12.3 m), and Guangdong (+12.3 m), while Qinghai (+3.8 m) and Chongqing (+3.0 m) also experienced significant growth in stable built-up areas. Heilongjiang, Jilin, Hebei, and Taiwan exhibited minimal growth. The CMTBH-30 dataset effectively captures fine-grained built-up heights, addressing the gap in multi-temporal built-up height estimation. This study provides a new dimension for urban research and is valuable for a multitude of applications such as urban planning, disaster management, and sustainable development.

 This work presents an experimental and computational study of the ozonolysis of allyl methyl sulfide (H2C=CHCH2SCH3, AMS) and allyl ethyl sulfide (H2C=CHCH2SCH2CH3, AES) in the gas phase at atmospheric conditions. The experiments were carried out using carbon monoxide (CO) as scavengers of nascent OH radicals. The main products of the reaction with O3 from AMS and AES were identified and quantified by in situ FTIR spectroscopy. The yields of the SO2, formaldehyde and formic acid products found were (26 ± 1) %, (62 ± 1) % and (7 ± 1) % for the AMS/CO/O3 reaction, and (19 ± 1) %, (62 ± 1) % and (8 ± 1) % for the AES/CO/O3 reaction, respectively. Besides those products, acrolein was also identified when the OH radical scavenger was absent. In this case, the yields obtained were (37 ± 1) %, (6 ± 1) %, (63 ± 1) % and (4 ± 1) % in the AMS/O3 mixture, and (28 ± 1) %, (5 ± 1) %, (41 ± 1) % and (4 ± 1) % in the AES/O3 mixture, for SO2, acrolein, formaldehyde and formic acid, respectively. A small difference in product yields in the presence of CO could be attributed to secondary reactions with OH radicals.DFT and post-Hartree-Fock composite computational chemistry calculations of reactants, transition states and products in the reaction paths were used to lend support to the experimental findings for the AMS + O3 reaction. The calculated rate coefficients obtained in this work are in close agreement with the experimental data, with the ωB97X-D3(BJ)/aug-cc-pVTZ and ωB97X-V/aug-cc-pVTZ as the most accurate and reliable DFT methods. The inclusion of the SVECV-f12 protocol on top of those DFT calculations markedly improves the accuracy of the results. Atmospheric implications are discussed in terms of significant POCP and AP of sulfides and its products obtained."

 Saint John experiences ambient sulphur dioxide (SO2) pollution due to a high density of industrial activities. Despite recent reduction in SO2 emissions, over 90 % of the provincial exceedances of air pollutants were related to SO2 or total reduced sulphur (TRS), and over 70 % among which occurred in Saint John. Pinpointing intra-urban SO2 hot spots is important for revealing the neighborhoods exposed to high health risk. However, this is challenging due to limited spatial coverage of monitoring. To fill the monitoring gap, we developed two-stage gradient boosting models combining a classifier that discerned between SO2-free and SO2-polluted days and a regressor that estimated daily SO2 levels based on remote sensing data. With a 10-fold cross-validation, the classifier achieved 83 % accuracy and the regressors attained R2 of 0.46 and 0.44 for daily mean and maximum SO2 respectively. Based on model outputs, we conducted spatial hot spot analysis and found high SO2 levels spread to northeast, north, and southeast Saint John, where SO2 monitoring was absent. Several existing monitoring sites in west Saint John do not have SO2 regularly measured. Besides the spatiotemporal lags of nearby monitored SO2, wind-related variables such as wind speed and direction had high importance in predicting surface SO2, which might suggest potential impacts to remote unmonitored communities from the transport of SO2. In summary, our findings suggest that certain unmonitored areas in Saint John may experience high SO2 levels. Expansion of monitoring efforts would help inform where and when mitigation should be taken to minimize SO2-related health impacts."

 Understanding aerosol composition is essential for identifying sources and assessing impacts. We analyzed the chemical profile of 100 24-hour PM2.5 samples and used this data for mass reconstruction and source apportionment. Samples were collected between April 2019 and March 2020 at a site located in Buenos Aires, Argentina. PM2.5 concentrations ranged from 4.2 μg m−3 to 51.4 μg m−3, with a mean of 17.5 μg m−3, and maxima during biomass burning (BB) events. Samples were classified according to the presence or absence of BB events affecting the area, and mass reconstruction was performed. Optimal OM/OC ratios were determined to be 2.5 (BB-samples) and 1.9 (non-BB samples), being OM ∼  65% and ∼  54%, respectively. On average, other components accounted for ∼  14% geological minerals > ∼  10% inorganic ions > ∼  6% elemental carbon > ∼  3% sea salt > ∼  2% non crustal K. Source contributions were further studied using Positive Matrix Factorization. Open biomass burning was the main contributor to PM2.5 (28.4%) and total carbon (25.7%), highlighting the significance of long-range pollutant transport. The temporal variability of this factor aligns with fire events identified using fire location, back-trajectory analysis, and aerosol classification schemes. The remaining factors found were: SOA + soil + road dust (17.7%), mobile sources powered by low sulfur (15.8%) and high sulfur fuels (11.1%), construction + grills (12.1%), agriculture (9.3%) and thermal power plants + industry (5.6%). This study provides relevant information for air quality management, highlighting knowledge gaps on primary and secondary sources affecting the site."

 This study analyzes the PM2.5 and Black Carbon (BC) concentrations, along with changes in spectral absorption and Brown Carbon (BrC) characteristics between residential and urban background sites in Athens, Greece, during intense wintertime pollution events occurring in the festive period (25 December 2023–6 January 2024). It aims to examine the magnitude of differences in PM2.5, BC concentrations and spectral absorption properties between the residential area and an urban background site, due to different aerosol emission rates from various sources and mixing processes in the urban atmosphere, with emphasis on intense pollution events generated by recreational activities. The results show excellent inter-site correlations for PM2.5, BC, BrC and absorption properties during most of the examining period, suggesting mainly common source and well-mixing processes in the Athens area. However, during the evening and night hours of 24, 25, 31 December and 1st January, the BC levels, BrC absorption at 370 nm and PM2.5 concentrations were up to 3 times higher at the residential site, reflecting the enhanced direct emissions from residential wood burning (RWB), increased nighttime traffic for recreational purposes at neighborhoods at Christmas and New Year nights. Alarming BC concentrations reaching up to 25–29 μg m−3 were observed during the night hours at the residential site (PM2.5 and BC means of 28.1 and 6.3 μg m−3, respectively), which highly deteriorate the atmospheric environment, being responsible for urban haze and harmful effects on human health. The high light absorption coefficients at 370 nm by BC (66 Mm−1) and BrC (51.3 Mm−1) may modulate atmospheric chemistry and contributes to regional atmospheric warming, while there is evidence of well-mixing processes regarding the aerosol concentrations and spectral absorption during daytime in the Athens atmosphere."

 Lightning data monitored by a very low frequency/low frequency (VLF/LF) three-dimensional lightning detection and position system were assimilated using a mesoscale numerical model and its three-dimensional variational assimilation system. A case study was conducted on a double rainband weather event in Fujian, China, on 7 May 2018, which included both shear-line precipitation and warm-sector rainfall. The impact of assimilating lightning data at cloud resolving scales was investigated through a series of comparative experiments, involving situations with and without lightning data assimilation, assimilation at different times, and assimilation under various parameter combinations. The results showed that assimilating lightning data significantly improved the simulation of the southeastward-moving shear-line rainband in inland Fujian and the northeastward-moving warm-sector rainband along the Fujian coast. The simulation of the warm-sector rainstorm was improved greatly. This improvement in simulating the coastal warm-sector rainstorm through lightning data assimilation was attributed not only to the increases in the relative humidity and cloud microphysical quantities, but also to the enhancement of wind convergence along the southwest jet in the ultra-low-level layer over the Fujian coastal region. The simulation of heavy rainfall in the double rainband was improved both in the individual assimilation of lightning data at 0200 and 0800 BT (Beijing Time), as well as in the simultaneous assimilation of lightning data at these two times. The modelling with assimilating lightning data at 0200 BT produced a greater improvement than that at 0800 BT. Moreover, the results from the simultaneous assimilation at both times were superior to those from individual assimilation at a single time. The simulation of the double rainband was also improved when assimilating lightning data under various parameter combinations, each yielding distinct improvements. The threat scores (TS) for 12-h rainfall were increased greatly, with the missing and empty report rates heavily reduced. The simulation accuracy for moderate rain, heavy rain, rainstorm and heavy rainstorm all improved obviously. Additionally, the TS for 1-h rainfall also increased, with a positive effect extending to 12–18 h."

 Fine particulate matter (PM2.5), as a principal air pollutant, stands as one of the key indicators in atmospheric quality monitoring. The spatiotemporal patterns of PM2.5 concentration in Madrid and Valencia during 2013–2022 were obtained from satellite-derived PM2.5 products and ground-based measurements. The peak PM2.5 concentrations occurred in July, August and December in Madrid, showing a geographical trend of hotspots in the southeast and coldspots in the northwest. Similarly, the highest PM2.5 concentration in Valencia was observed in December and summer months (June–August), with hotspots appearing along the coastline. At diurnal and monthly scales, PM2.5 concentrations in Madrid positively correlated with air temperature (AT); the results of feature importance using XGBOOST-SHAP model reveal that high temperature-humidity enhances PM2.5 at seasonal scale, while high wind speed (WS) weakens it. Therefore, to mitigate elevated PM2.5 levels during summer and winter in Madrid, strategies should focus on increasing green spaces and pervious pavement. Additionally, since Valencia experiences the peak PM2.5 during spring and winter, requiring measures of reducing emission. Moreover, excessive humidity contributes the most to PM2.5 accumulation in Valencia. For both cities, potential urban ventilation corridors during winter align along southwest-northeast direction, which could serve as an effective strategy to facilitate the dispersion of PM2.5."

 Meteorological droughts have magnitude and migration characteristics due to their spatiotemporal construction. A comprehensive identification of these characteristics and quantification of their dominant factors are crucial for drought risk mitigation and forecasting efforts. However, migration characteristics have often been overlooked in previous studies, and the dominant factors affecting drought remain ambiguous. In this study, migration characteristics was described by a series of indicators, e.g., migration trajectory and drought speed (DV). We also proposed the rate of expansion (RE) for overall drought areas to quantify the evolution of the outmost shape boundary, based on 3-dimensional droughts. Furthermore, Shapley additive explanation (SHAP), a unified method to interpret the predictions of complex machine learning models, was used to quantify the importance of driving factors on characteristics. The results showed that: (1) severe meteorological droughts were predominantly concentrated in east region of the Yangtze River Basin, characterized by prolonged duration, high severity, rapid DV, and extensive affected areas along with high RE; (2) RE was large in March and April, ranging from 2.0 to 7.37, while negative RE frequently occurred in August, indicating contractions of affected area (DA); (3) soil moisture emerged as the primary driving factor influencing drought characteristics, with an average relative importance of 21.3 %, followed by vertically integrated water vapor flux (16.1 %) and temperature (15.6 %); and (4) while human activities exerted weaker impacts compared to climate factors, they demonstrated increasing trends in DA and RE. Overall, this study shed three-dimensional insights into meteorological drought evolution and driving mechanism exploration, which provided strategies for drought prediction and proactive prevention."
