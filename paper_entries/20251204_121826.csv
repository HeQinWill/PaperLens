10.5194/acp-25-17527-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注南极春季臭氧柱的变化，并利用卫星观测数据（MLS/Aura）追踪来自中层的空气团，通过分析空气团在10月底的高度（MPA）来评估极地涡旋的动态条件和臭氧输送量。该研究提出了一种新的指标来预测10月份的极地总臭氧柱，并解释了2004-2024年观测到的63%的方差。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是卫星观测和大气成分分析方面。,"['Antarctic ozone', 'total column ozone', 'MLS/Aura', 'carbon monoxide', 'ozone transport', 'polar vortex dynamics']",Hannah E. Kessenich;Annika Seppälä;Dan Smale;Craig J. Rodger;Mark Weber,Quantifying the contribution of transport to Antarctic springtime ozone column variability,"We use observational data to track a mass of mesospheric air which descends into the Antarctic polar vortex each spring. The altitude of the air mass at the end of October is used to create a new diagnostic metric. The metric captures the dynamical conditions of the vortex and can be used to estimate the amount of poleward ozone transport in October. When used as a proxy for October polar total column ozone, the metric explains the majority (63%) of the observed variance from 2004–2024. 
 Quantifying chemical and dynamical drivers of Antarctic ozone variability remains important as stratospheric chlorine levels gradually reduce and the ozone hole recovers in response. While chemistry dominates the formation of the ozone hole in September, the role of dynamics grows as the spring season progresses. To improve our ability to characterise the dynamical impacts on Antarctic total column ozone (TCO), we use MLS/Aura observations of carbon monoxide to trace the path of an air parcel that originates in the mesosphere and descends into the springtime polar vortex. We define a new metric, the Mesospheric Parcel Altitude (MPA), which measures the altitude of the descending mesospheric air parcel at the end of October. The MPA is highly correlated with October TCO and functions as a diagnostic tool, capturing the dynamical state of the inner-vortex. Based on the MPA, we classify October ozone holes from 2004–2024 into three mesospheric descent types (Strong, Regular, and Weak) and provide a formula to estimate the magnitude of horizontal ozone transport (poleward of 70° S and between 17–27 km) during a given October. A higher MPA (>26.9 km) indicates Weak descent, reduced ozone transport, and a larger, longer-lived ozone hole. A lower MPA (<24.6 km) indicates Strong descent, increased ozone transport, and a smaller, shorter-lived ozone hole. When the MPA is used as a proxy for polar cap TCO, approximately 63 % of the observed variance during October is explained by the metric."

Palmer;Martin J. Wooster;Haofan Wang;Fei Yao;Liang Feng;Kai Wu;Xiao Lu;Shaojia Fan,Using geostationary-satellite-derived sub-daily fire radiative power variability versus prescribed diurnal cycles to assess the impact of African fires on tropospheric ozone,"We examine the impact of diurnally varying African biomass burning (BB) emissions on tropospheric ozone using GEOS-Chem simulations with a high-resolution satellite-derived emission inventory. Compared to coarser temporal resolutions, incorporating diurnal variations leads to significant changes in surface ozone and atmospheric oxidation capacity. Our findings highlight the importance of accurately representing BB emission timing in chemical transport models to improve ozone predictions. 
 Assessing the impact of biomass burning (BB) emissions on tropospheric ozone is critical for understanding air pollution and climate interactions. BB emission inventories like Global Fire Emissions Database and Global Fire Assimilation System, typically based on sun-synchronous satellite observations, report emissions on daily, weekly or longer timescales with empirically derived factors generally used to overlay diurnal variations. To explore the sensitivity of tropospheric ozone to diurnal variability, we incorporated day-specific hourly BB variations inferred from geostationary satellite data into the GEOS-Chem atmospheric chemistry transport model. The simulations were compared with those using established inventories and evaluated against in situ and satellite observations. Simulations with real hourly-resolved emissions produce comparable surface ozone biases (−1.54 to +9.09 ppbv vs. −1.58 to +9.13 ppbv) and marginally higher correlations with TROPOMI nitrogen dioxide (r=0.80–0.89) and OMI ozone (r=0.80–0.94). Although the statistical improvements are limited, the geostationary-driven approach reveals pronounced regional ozone differences and mechanistic insights into the role of diurnal fire variability. Data-driven diurnal BB variations across Africa cause significant surface ozone changes (−8.57 to +21.88 ppbv) and alter tropospheric ozone columns by −0.41 to 1.09 DU, particularly in regions with intense fire activity like Angola and Zambia. These changes propagate globally, shifting regional OH concentrations by −4.4 % to +51.7 %. These findings emphasize the critical role of accurately describing diurnal BB variations in atmospheric models to better quantify its impacts on atmospheric composition, providing insights for Earth system model development and the use of geostationary-derived BB emissions datasets."

Cloud responses to aerosols differed significantly across meteorological regimes. The model captured overall trends but exaggerated cloud responses, performing better for shallower than deeper clouds. The results highlight the need to untangle aerosol effects from meteorology and improve cloud process representation in climate models. 
 This study investigates aerosol-cloud interactions in marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds using an advanced deep-learning-driven synoptic-regime-based framework, combining satellite data (CALIPSO vertically resolved aerosol extinction and MODIS cloud properties) with 1° nudged Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 2 (E3SMv2) simulation over the Eastern North Atlantic (ENA; ∼10°×10°, 2006–2014). The E3SMv2 captures observed seasonal variations in cloud droplet number concentrations (Nd) and liquid water path (LWP), though it systematically underestimates Nd. We then partition ENA meteorology into four synoptic regimes (Pre-Trough, Post-Trough, Ridge, Trough) via a deep-learning clustering of ERA5 reanalysis fields, enabling regime-dependent aerosol-cloud interactions analyses. Both satellite and E3SMv2 exhibit an inverted-V LWP-Nd relationship. In Post-Trough and Ridge regimes, the satellite shows stronger negative LWP-Nd sensitivities than in Pre-Trough regime. The Trough regime displays a muted satellite LWP response. In comparison, the model predicts more exaggerated LWP responses across regimes, with LWP increasing too quickly at low Nd and decreasing more sharply at high Nd, especially in Pre-Trough and Trough regimes. These exaggerated model LWP sensitivities may stem from uncertainties in representing drizzle processes, entrainment, and turbulent mixing. As for Nd susceptibility to aerosols, Nd increases with MBL aerosol extinction in both datasets, but the simulated aerosol-cloud interactions appear oversensitive to meteorological conditions. Overall, E3SMv2 better captures aerosol effects under regimes that favor stratiform clouds (Post-Trough, Ridge), but performance deteriorates for regimes with deeper, dynamically complex clouds (Trough), highlighting the need for improved representations of those cloud processes in climate models."

These findings deepen the mechanistic understanding of aerosol phase transitions at the molecular scale, which could inspire new research directions in atmospheric heterogeneous chemistry. 
 Phase transitions of particles are importance because it could influence reactive gas uptake, multiphase chemical reactions pathways, ice and polar stratospheric cloud formation. Electron microscopy-based techniques detect phase transitions through macroscopic properties but cannot resolve efflorescence kinetics at the molecular level, whereas spectroscopic methods, while enabling molecular-level tracking of aerosol transformations and water uptake quantification, remain limited in characterizing the dynamics of efflorescence phase transition due to insufficient temporal resolution to resolve intermolecular interactions and capture complex intermediate states. In this study, the efflorescence phase transition of AS aerosol is tracked by using the fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic technique. A novel method has been developed that not only accurately determines the phase transition region but also enables the identification of micro-dynamic phase transition processes through analysis of the molecular structural change sequence based on two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy. During efflorescence transition processes, we measured the phase transition point at 39 ± 0.8 % (RH), and its start and end points at 41 ± 0.8 % (RH) and 36 ± 0.8 % (RH), respectively. We further identified four distinct micro-dynamics steps during the efflorescence processes. Initially, there was a gradual loss of liquid water for the solution droplets. Subsequently, it formed the supersaturated ammonium sulfate (AS) aerosols. Furthermore, hydrogen bonds between liquid water and sulfate dissociate, reducing aqueous sulfate concentration. The replacement of H2O by NH4+ in the sulfate hydration shell drives a bond reorganization that strengthens sulfate-ammonium interactions at the expense of original sulfate-water bonds. The efflorescence occurs and forms crystal/solid AS. Eventually, the remaining liquid water molecules eventually detach from the AS system, completing the liquid-to-solid phase transition. This method will help improve comprehending of the transport and deposition of inhaled aerosol.  Moreover, these insights will spur fundamental research into the formation, transformation and nucleation mechanisms of atmospheric aerosols."

The dataset contains information on extreme precipitation events with a precipitation duration of 1  to 72 h that can lead to flooding, high mortality rates and infrastructure damage.

 Extreme precipitation events can lead to devastating floods, loss of life and severe infrastructure damage and are expected to increase in a warming world, highlighting the urgent need to quantify current-day and future extremes. Although intense precipitation extremes are generally better represented by high-resolution climate models, large ensemble datasets are lacking. Yet, these are very essential for estimating uncertainties of future trends. Here, the EURO-SUPREME (EURO-SUb-daily PRecipitation extrEMEs) dataset, with DOI: https://doi.org/10.26050/WDCC/EUCOR_prec_v2 (Van de Vyver et al., 2025), is presented that includes extreme precipitation events from the EURO-CORDEX regional climate model (RCM) ensemble (downscaling CMIP5 GCMs), for accumulated precipitation amounts ranging from 1 to 72 h. Specifically, the data are based on a small ensemble of evaluation runs and a 35-member ensemble of historical and future (RCP8.5) annual-maxima on the EURO-CORDEX EUR-11 (0.11°) domain, covering 4984 simulation years in total. The resource is designed to enable climate-model comparison and support various state-of-the-art scientific research efforts and climate-change risk assessments. We provide a validation of the EURO-SUPREME dataset for various countries in Europe and disentangle the RCM and GCM contributions to the biases. Furthermore, we provide a practical application of using EURO-SUPREME as a benchmark for high-resolution convection-permitting models for Belgium. Finally, we investigate the changes in intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation under different global warming levels."

 Accurate and detailed cropland maps are essential for food security, yet existing products for China exhibit substantial discrepancies. This study presents CropLayer, a 2 m resolution cropland map of China for 2020, developed from Mapbox and Google satellite imagery. The framework comprises three key stages: (1) image quality assessment (IQA) using a ResNet model to compensate for missing acquisition metadata; (2) cropland extraction via an active learning strategy guided by a Mask2Former segmentation model and XGBoost-based semantic correctness evaluation; and (3) integration of Mapbox and Google results through an XGBoost model informed by four feature groups: Geography, IQA, Regional Property, and Consistency. A three-level validation scheme (pixel, block, and region) ensures robust and interpretable accuracy across spatial scales.

In this study, we established a CFC-11 emission inventory from coal combustion in China during 2000–2021. We found that CFC-11 emissions from coal combustion exhibited fluctuations and an overall upward trend, peaking in 2016, and that Hebei and Shandong had higher emissions. The CFC-11 emissions from coal combustion in the coastal regions might influence the monitored CFC-11 concentrations. 
 The trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) emission from its production and use (PAU) has drawn widespread interest, while its combustion sources have been overlooked. This study identified CFC-11 emission factors (EFs) of 3.6, 3.2 and 0.025 mg kg−1 from the combustion of domestic chunk coal, honeycomb briquettes and coal-fired power plants, respectively. A multi-year (2000–2021) emission inventory of CFC-11 from coal combustion in China was established. Results indicated that the CFC-11 annual emission from coal combustion in China was, on average, 233.5 t yr−1. It exhibited fluctuations and maintained an overall upward trend, accounting for 0.8 % of PAU emissions in 2000 and increasing to 9.8 % in 2021, with the peak value appearing in 2016. In the Shandong and Hebei provinces, which have high coal consumption amounts, the CFC-11 emissions from coal combustion increased by approximately 74 % during 2014–2017 compared to 2011–2012. At the Gosan station close to the Chinese mainland, CFC-11 emitted from coal combustion in Hebei and Shandong was 0.5 ppt of its average concentration during January 2016. An additional climate effect of the clean heating and coal-to-electricity policies in China was also observed, with an obvious decrease (2.2 × 106 and 3.4 × 107 t) in CO2-equivalent emission. This study provides substantial evidence of CFC-11 emission from coal combustion and highlights the role of combustion emission against the background of reducing CFC-11 from PAU.

This data may be useful to agronomists, ecologists, hydrologists, soil scientists, and policymakers interested in agricultural production, biodiversity conservation, soil erosion control, flood risk management, and reservoir siltation. 
 The Mediterranean region is characterized by a highly variable climate marked by prolonged dry spell interspersed with intense rainfall events mainly in autumn. These climatic extremes exacerbate droughts, flash floods and soil erosion, resulting in significant environmental and agricultural challenges across Mediterranean catchments. The dynamics of water and sediment fluxes in these environments are the result of complex interactions between climate, land use and management. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for recommending effective management strategies to mitigate erosion and runoff impacts. However, high-frequency datasets for both hydrology and sediment fluxes are often lacking for small Mediterranean catchments in North Africa, thus rendering these processes poorly understood."

It's freely available in two versions: one for climate trend analysis and another for training AI wave models, providing a valuable tool for ocean research and forecasting. 
 Satellite altimeters provide long-term, high-accuracy observations of significant wave height (SWH) over the global ocean. However, their sparse spatial and temporal sampling introduces undersampling errors in wave climate analyses. Direct gridding of multi-mission altimeter data through spatiotemporal interpolation still results in low-accuracy global SWH fields due to this limitation. To overcome this challenge, we use SWH outputs from a WAVEWATCH III hindcast as a background field and apply an offline post-fusion with along-track, jointly calibrated altimeter observations from the Climate Change Initiative Sea State dataset. Unlike data assimilation within numerical wave models, this offline fusion approach allows retrospective correction of past model outputs using future observations. Validation against buoy measurements and independent satellite data demonstrates that the fused gridded product achieves high accuracy. To address different application needs, we provide two versions of the fused dataset: 1) A ""two-sat"" version that incorporates data from only two satellites at any given time, designed for wave climate studies. This configuration ensures temporal consistency by maintaining a stable data volume over the entire time span. 2) A ""multi-sat"" version that integrates data from as many altimeter missions as possible, intended to support applications such as the training of artificial intelligence-based wave models, where higher spatial and temporal accuracy is prioritized.

We extended an adjoint method to optimize spatiotemporally varying parameters together with the atmosphere forcing and the initial conditions using satellite and in-situ observations. Seasonally, this scheme demonstrates a more prominent advantage in mid-autumn and show great potential for accurately reproducing the Arctic changes. 
 Parameters in sea ice-ocean coupled models greatly affect the simulated evolution of the ocean and sea ice, and are typically tuned to bring the model state close to observations. Using an adjoint method, spatiotemporally varying parameters of an Arctic sea ice-ocean coupled model are optimized simultaneously with the initial conditions and atmospheric forcing by assimilating satellite and in-situ observations. The assimilation results show that the joint state and parameter estimation (SPE) substantially improves the sea ice concentration simulations. Particularly in October, when the ocean surface starts to refreeze, SPE reduces the lead closing parameter Ho (which determines the minimum ice thickness formed in the open water), thereby increasing the sea ice growth and facilitating the seasonal rapid sea ice recovery in the Arctic's Pacific sector. Comparisons with sea ice thickness observations from the moored upward-looking sonars and Ice Mass Balance buoys demonstrate that incorporating optimized model parameters into the coupled model also leads to better sea ice thickness estimation. Given that the optimal set of sea ice parameters may evolve alongside the thinning of Arctic sea ice, the adjoint-based SPE scheme has the potential to more accurately reconstruct the histical Arctic ocean and sea ice changes covering the satellite era, supporting research on Arctic sea ice and ocean variability."

The former is used to generate the analysis, the latter to verify the simulations. A preprocessor classifying the observations by the data characteristics is developed based on clustering algorithms. The assimilation and validation data sets are compiled by equally allocating data of each cluster. The resulting improvement of the analysis is evaluated with an air quality model. 
 In the field of air quality analysis, data assimilation is commonly used to integrate information on the atmospheric state provided by observations into the model. However, the analysis is largely dependent on the data available to the assimilation system. In order to obtain an accurate analysis of the true state of the atmosphere, the representativity of the utilized data becomes a fundamental requirement. Here, a method is presented that derives a representative split of the ground-based monitoring network data that depends only on the characteristics of the observation data. The core of the methods is a clustering algorithm to subdivide the data into subsets. Two clustering algorithms, k-means, and k-mean soft constraint, are tested and applied to air pollutant observations in Europe. The clusters are solely derived from observation intrinsic properties (such as geographic location and averaged concentrations). The resulting clusters reliably distinguish common features of the observational data, e.g. mean and variance of averaged air pollutant concentrations. Representativity of the observational data in the assimilation and validation subset is ensured by sampling each cluster individually. The method is tested using the assimilation system of the chemistry transport model EURAD-IM (EURopean Air pollution Dispersion – Inverse Model) and evaluated for data from four months in 2016. A significant improvement of the analysis' representativity, quantified by the difference between the analysis' root mean square error with respect to the assimilation and validation dataset, is found in the results. Compared to an operational configuration, the largest improvement in the relative representativity measure is evaluated for CO with 16 %, for NO2 with 4 %, and for O3 with 1 %. A reduction in the relative representativity measure is observed for SO2 with −5 %, for PM10 with −2 % and for PM2.5 with −5 %, although these differences do not lead to significant deviations in absolute values given the overall error and the improvement for CO outweighing the changes in the other species."

Zelinka;Malte Meinshausen,Standardising the “Gregory method” for calculating  equilibrium climate sensitivity,"The Gregory method is a common approach for calculating the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS). However, studies which apply this method lack transparency in how model data is processed prior to calculating the ECS, inhibiting replicability. Different choices of global weighting, net radiative flux variable, anomaly calculation, and linear regression fit can affect the ECS estimates. We investigate the impact of these choices and propose a standardised method for future ECS calculations. 
 The equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) – the equilibrium global mean temperature response to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 – is a high-profile metric for quantifying the Earth system's response to human-induced climate change. A widely applied approach to estimating the ECS is the “Gregory method” (Gregory et al., 2004), which uses an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression between the net radiative flux, N, and surface air temperature anomalies, ΔT, from a 150 year experiment in which atmospheric CO2 concentrations are quadrupled. The ECS is determined by extrapolating the linear fit to N=0, i.e. the ΔT-intercept, indicating the point at which the system is back in equilibrium. This method has been used to compare ECS estimates across the CMIP5 and CMIP6 ensembles and will likely be a key diagnostic for CMIP7. Despite its widespread application, there is little consistency or transparency between studies in how the climate model data is processed prior to the regression, leading to potential discrepancies in ECS estimates. We identify 32 alternative data processing pathways, varying by differences in global mean weighting, net radiative flux variable, anomaly calculation method, and linear regression fit. Using 44 CMIP6 models, we systematically assess the impact of these choices on ECS estimates and calculate uncertainty ranges using two bootstrap approaches. While the inter-model ECS range is insensitive to the data processing pathway, individual outlier models exhibit notable differences. Approximating a model's native grid cell area (if irregular) with cosine of the latitude can decrease the ECS by 11 %, the choice of N-variable can change the ECS by 6 %, and some anomaly calculation methods can introduce spurious temporal correlations in the processed data. Beyond data processing choices, we also evaluate an alternative linear regression method – total least squares (TLS) – which has a more statistically robust basis than OLS. However, for consistency with previous literature, and given TLS may reduce the ECS compared to OLS (by up to 24 %), thereby making a known bias in the Gregory method worse, we do not feel there is sufficient clarity to recommend a transition to TLS in all cases. To improve reproducibility and comparability in future studies, we recommend a standardised Gregory method: weighting the global mean by cell area, using the top of the atmosphere (as opposed to the top of model) N-variable, and calculating anomalies by first applying a rolling average to the preindustrial control timeseries then subtracting from the raw CO2 quadrupling experiment. This approach accounts for model drift while reducing noise in the data to best meet the pre-conditions of the linear regression. While CMIP6 results of the multi-model mean ECS appear insensitive to these processing choices, similar assumptions may not hold for CMIP7, underscoring the need for standardised data preparation in future climate sensitivity assessments."

 We develop a new Earth System model configuration framed into the ICON architecture, which provides the baseline for the next generation of climate predictions and projections (hereafter ICON XPP – where XPP stands for eXtended Predictions and Projections). ICON XPP comprises the atmospheric component of the numerical weather prediction (ICON NWP), the ICON ocean and land surface components, and an ensemble-variational data assimilation system, all adjusted to an Earth System model for pursuing climate research and operational climate forecasting. Two baseline configurations are presented: (1) a 160 km atmosphere and a 40 km ocean resolution, and (2) 80 km atmosphere and 20 km ocean resolution. A CMIP DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) experimentation framework is used for a first evaluation.ICON XPP depicts the basic properties of the coupled climate. The pre-industrial climate shows a top-of-atmosphere balanced radiation budget and a mean global near-surface temperature of 13.8–14.0 °C. The ocean shows circulation strengths in the range of the observed values, such as the AMOC at 16–18 Sv and the flows through the common passages. The current climate is characterized by a trend in the global mean temperature of ∼ 1.2 °C since the 1850s, similar to reference datasets. Regionally, the hydroclimate differs greatly from observed conditions. For example, the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) has a double peak and a wet southern subtropical branch across the oceans. Further, the Southern Ocean sea surface temperature has a strong positive mean bias with temperatures up to 5 °C higher than observations.Dynamical processes, such as El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) performs similarly to CMIP6-like coupled models. Tropical waves and the Madden-Julian Oscillation are well captured, and the 40 km atmospheric configuration has a spontaneous weak quasi-biennial oscillation. The atmospheric dynamics in the northern extra-tropics of both configurations represent well the position of the jet stream as well as the influences of the transient momentum transports and their feedbacks on the jet stream. Overall, ICON XPP performs similarly to climate models performed in CMIP6 making it a good basis for climate forecasts and projections, and climate research."

 De novo enzyme design seeks to build proteins containing ideal active sites with catalytic residues surrounding and stabilizing the transition state(s) of the target chemical reaction1–7. The generative artificial intelligence method RFdiffusion8,9 solves this problem, but requires specifying both the sequence position and backbone coordinates for each catalytic residue, limiting sampling. Here we introduce RFdiffusion2, which eliminates these requirements, and use it to design zinc metallohydrolases starting from quantum chemistry-derived active site geometries. From an initial set of 96 designs tested experimentally, the most active has a catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of 16,000 M−1 s−1, orders of magnitude higher than previously designed metallohydrolases6,7,10,11. A second round of 96 designs yielded 3 additional highly active enzymes, with kcat/KM values of up to 53,000 M−1 s−1 and a catalytic rate constant (kcat) of up to 1.5 s−1. The design models of the four most active designs differ from known structures and from each other, and the crystal structure of the most active design is very close to the design model, demonstrating the accuracy of the design method. The most active enzymes are predicted by PLACER12 and Chai-1 (ref. 13) to have preorganized active sites that effectively position the substrate for nucleophilic attack by a water molecule activated by the bound metal. The ability to generate highly active enzymes directly from the computer, without experimental optimization, should enable a new generation of potent designer catalysts14,15.

 Maintaining biodiversity is central to the sustainable development agenda1. However, a lack of context-specific biodiversity information at policy-relevant scales has posed major limitations to decision-makers2,3. To address this challenge, we undertook a comprehensive assessment of the biodiversity intactness of sub-Saharan Africa4 using place-based knowledge of 200 African biodiversity experts5. We estimate that the region has on average lost 24% of its pre-colonial and pre-industrial faunal and floral population abundances, ranging from losses of <20% for disturbance-adapted herbaceous plants to 80% for some large mammals. Rwanda and Nigeria are the least intact (<55%), whereas Namibia and Botswana are the most intact (>85%). Notably, most remaining organisms occur in unprotected, relatively untransformed rangelands and natural forests. Losses in biodiversity intactness in the worst-affected biomes are driven by land transformation into cropland in grasslands and fynbos (Mediterranean-type ecosystems), by non-agricultural degradation in forests and by a combination of the two drivers in savannas. This assessment provides decision-makers with multifaceted, contextually appropriate and policy-relevant information on the state of biodiversity in an understudied region of the world. Our approach could be used in other regions, including better-studied localities, to integrate contextual, place-based knowledge into multiscale assessments of biodiversity status and impacts.

 Neutrinos are the most abundant fundamental matter particles in the Universe and play a crucial part in particle physics and cosmology. Neutrino oscillation, discovered about 25 years ago, shows that the three known species mix with each other. Anomalous results from reactor and radioactive-source experiments1 suggest a possible fourth neutrino state, the sterile neutrino, which does not interact through the weak force. The Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino (KATRIN) experiment2, primarily designed to measure the neutrino mass using tritium β-decay, also searches for sterile neutrinos suggested by these anomalies. A sterile-neutrino signal would appear as a distortion in the β-decay energy spectrum, characterized by a discontinuity in curvature (kink) related to the sterile-neutrino mass. This signature, which depends only on the shape of the spectrum rather than its absolute normalization, offers a robust, complementary approach to reactor experiments. Here we report the analysis of the energy spectrum of 36 million tritium β-decay electrons recorded in 259 measurement days within the last 40 eV below the endpoint. The results exclude a substantial part of the parameter space suggested by the gallium anomaly and challenge the Neutrino-4 claim. Together with other neutrino-disappearance experiments, KATRIN probes sterile-to-active mass splittings from a fraction of an eV2 to several hundred eV2, excluding light sterile neutrinos with mixing angles above a few per cent.

 Breast cancer remains a major global health challenge1. Here, to comprehensively characterize its genomic landscape and the clinical significance of genomic characteristics, we analysed whole-genome sequences from 1,364 clinically annotated breast cancers, with transcriptome data available for most cases. Our study expands the repertoire of oncogenic alterations and identifies novel driver genes, recurrent gene fusions, structural variants and copy number alterations. Timing analyses on copy number alterations suggest that genomic instability emerges decades before tumour diagnosis, and offer insights into early initiation of tumorigenesis. Pattern-driven genomic features, including mutational signatures2, homologous recombination deficiency3, tumour mutational burden and tumour heterogeneity scores4, were associated with clinical outcomes, highlighting their potential utility as predictive biomarkers for clinical evaluation of treatments such as CDK4/6 and HER2 inhibitors, as well as adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy. These findings highlight the power of large-scale, clinically annotated whole-genome sequencing in advancing our understanding of how genomic alterations shape patient outcomes.

 Stem cell-derived embryo models could greatly facilitate our understanding of embryonic development. Although human and monkey embryo models have reached early gastrulation stage1–7, the development of robust models beyond this time remains to be accomplished8. Here, using an optimized 3D suspension culture system, we have successfully advanced the in vitro culture of a stem cell-derived monkey blastoid to day 25. Morphological and histological analyses showed that these monkey embryoids underwent gastrulation and largely recapitulated key developmental events of the late gastrulation stage observed in vivo, with the appearance of a neural plate, haematopoietic system, allantois, primitive gut, primordial germ cells, yolk sac structures and progenitors of other organs, excluding trophoblast derivatives. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses revealed that the lineage composition and differentiation trajectories of cells in these monkey embryoids were similar to those found in natural embryos during gastrulation. Thus, this primate stem cell-derived embryo model provides a valuable platform for dissecting the mechanisms of primate embryonic development from blastocyst to late gastrulation stage.

 The origin of eukaryotes was a formative but poorly understood event in the history of life. Current hypotheses of eukaryogenesis differ principally in the timing of mitochondrial endosymbiosis relative to the acquisition of other eukaryote novelties1. Discriminating among these hypotheses has been challenging, because there are no living lineages representative of intermediate steps within eukaryogenesis. However, many eukaryotic cell functions are contingent on genes that emerged from duplication events during eukaryogenesis2,3. Consequently, the timescale of these duplications can provide insights into the sequence of steps in the evolutionary assembly of the eukaryotic cell. Here we show, using a relaxed molecular clock4, that the process of eukaryogenesis spanned the Mesoarchaean to late Palaeoproterozoic eras. Within these constraints, we dated the timing of these gene duplications, revealing that the eukaryotic host cell already had complex cellular features before mitochondrial endosymbiosis, including an elaborated cytoskeleton, membrane trafficking, endomembrane, phagocytotic machinery and a nucleus, all between 3.0 and 2.25 billion years ago, after which mitochondrial endosymbiosis occurred. Our results enable us to reject mitochondrion-early scenarios of eukaryogenesis5, instead supporting a complexified-archaean, late-mitochondrion sequence for the assembly of eukaryote characteristics. Our inference of a complex archaeal host cell is compatible with hypotheses on the adaptive benefits of syntrophy6,7 in oceans that would have remained largely anoxic for more than a billion years8,9.

 The appropriate generation of upper-layer neurons is necessary to create the circuits that underlie complex brain functions. Radial progenitors divide asymmetrically to generate neurogenic intermediate progenitors (IPs; also known as intermediate precursors), and the symmetric proliferation of IPs rapidly expands the cortical neuronal population. The dynamic maintenance of balanced diversity of cortical progenitors and the resultant generation, placement and connectivity of appropriate numbers of different classes of neurons serve to guide the formation of a properly wired cerebral cortex1–12. However, the molecular logic that instructs progenitor balance remains unclear. Here we show that members of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)—proteins that are major regulators of cellular metabolism—function to sculpt radial progenitor–intermediate progenitor balance, radial unit organization and the resultant generation of upper-layer neurons. Developmental deletion of TSC proteins alters the radial progenitor and IP balance and changes radial unit composition, leading to increased upper-layer neuron generation and aberrant cortical connectivity. Human-specific modulation of TSC protein expression through human-gained enhancers affects progenitor balance and generation of upper-layer neurons. Evolutionary downregulation of TSC protein expression may therefore provide an effective route to radial unit sculpting and the expanded generation of upper-layer neurons necessary for higher-order brain functions in humans.

 Over the past 20 years, there have been considerable advances in revealing the microbiomes that underpin processes in natural and human-associated environments. Recent large-scale metagenome surveys have recorded the variety of microbial life in the oceans1, in the human gut2 and on Earth3, with compilations encompassing thousands of public datasets4,5. However, despite their broad scope, these studies often lack functional information, and their sample locations are frequently sparsely distributed, limited in resolution or lacking metadata. Here we present Microflora Danica—an atlas of Danish environmental microbiomes encompassing 10,683 shotgun metagenomes and 450 nearly full-length 16S and 18S rRNA datasets, linked to a five-level habitat classification scheme. We show that although human-disturbed habitats have high alpha diversity, species reoccur, revealing hidden homogeneity. This underlines the role of natural systems in maintaining total species (gamma) diversity and emphasizes the need for national baselines for tracking microbial responses to land-use and climate change. Consequently, we focused our dataset exploration on nitrifiers, a functional group closely linked to climate change and of major importance for Denmark’s primary land use: agriculture. We identify several lineages encoding nitrifier key genes and reveal the effects of land disturbance on the abundance of well-studied, as well as uncharacterized, nitrifier groups, with potential implications for N2O emissions. Microflora Danica offers an unparalleled resource for addressing fundamental questions in microbial ecology about what drives microbial diversity, distribution and function.

 The traditional quark model1,2 accounts for the existence of baryons, such as protons and neutrons, which consist of three quarks, as well as mesons, composed of a quark–antiquark pair. Only recently has substantial evidence started to accumulate for exotic states composed of four or five quarks and antiquarks3. The exact nature of their internal structure remains uncertain4–29. Here we report the first measurement of quantum numbers of the recently discovered family of three all-charm tetraquarks30–32, using data collected by the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider from 2016 to 2018 (refs. 33,34). The angular analysis techniques developed for the discovery and characterization of the Higgs boson35–37 have been applied to the new exotic states. Here we show that the quantum numbers for parity P and charge conjugation C symmetries are found to be +1. The spin J of these exotic states is determined to be consistent with 2ħ, while 0ħ and 1ħ are excluded at 95% and 99% confidence levels, respectively. The JPC = 2++ assignment implies particular configurations of constituent spins and orbital angular momenta, which constrain the possible internal structure of these tetraquarks.

 Rapidly growing satellite constellations have raised strong concerns among the scientific community1–4. Reflections from satellites can be visible to the unaided eye and extremely bright for professional telescopes. These trails already affect astronomical images across the complete electromagnetic spectrum, with a noticeable cost for operations and mitigation efforts. Contrary to popular perception, satellite trails affect not only ground-based observatories but also space observatories such as the Hubble Space Telescope5. However, the current number of satellites is only a fraction (less than 3%) of those to be launched in the next decade. Here we show a forecast of the satellite trail contamination levels for a series of international low-Earth-orbit telescopes on the basis of the proposed telecommunication industry constellations. Our results show that if these constellations are completed, one-third of the images of the Hubble Space Telescope will be contaminated, while the SPHEREx (Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer), ARRAKIHS (Analysis of Resolved Remnants of Accreted galaxies as a Key Instrument for Halo Surveys) and Xuntian space telescopes will have more than 96% of their exposures affected, with

 Enzymes find broad use as biocatalysts in industry and medicine owing to their exquisite selectivity, efficiency and mild reaction conditions. Custom-designed enzymes can produce tailor-made biocatalysts with potential applications that extend beyond natural reactions. However, current design methods require testing a large number of designs and mostly produce de novo enzymes with low catalytic activities1–3. As a result, they require costly experimental optimization and high-throughput screening to be industrially viable4,5. Here we present rotamer inverted fragment finder–diffusion (Riff-Diff), a hybrid machine learning and atomistic modelling strategy for scaffolding catalytic arrays in de novo proteins. We highlight the general applicability of Riff-Diff by designing enzymes for two mechanistically distinct chemical transformations, the retro-aldol reaction and the Morita–Baylis–Hillman reaction. We show that in both cases, it is possible to generate catalysts that exhibit activities rivalling those optimized by in vitro evolution, along with exquisite stereoselectivity. High-resolution structures of six of the designs revealed near-atomic active site design precision. The design strategy can, in principle, be applied to any catalytically competent amino acid array. These findings lay the basis for practical applicability of de novo protein catalysts in synthesis and describe fundamental principles of protein design and enzyme catalysis.

 Extreme weather events such as hurricanes and floods cause increasing damage to communities, leading to substantial economic losses and displacement of populations1–6. Previous research suggests that there are disparities in the resilience capacity of neighbourhoods, predicting a recovery mechanism of either segmented withdrawal or reinforcement across different neighbourhood groups7–12. Assessing these hypotheses and investigating if—and to what extent—neighbourhood built environments recover at scale has been difficult because previous measures have relied on aggregated survey data1,7,9–14. Here we construct a building-level disaster recovery dataset covering 2,195 census tracts spanning 16 states and across 12 extreme weather events in the USA from 2007 to 2023 using historical street view imagery and multimodal machine learning. Our analysis shows that in the aftermath of extreme weather events, lower-income neighbourhoods are less likely to rebuild and do not return to their pre-disaster state, whereas higher-income areas rebuild and tend to improve compared with their pre-disaster state, highlighting increasing disparities in their built environments. We further investigate those disparities by examining the deployment of disaster recovery assistance and insurance policies, and identify a resource gap for lower-income neighbourhoods that may explain unequal community responses to extreme weather events. Our findings demonstrate the value of analysing neighbourhood recovery trajectories at a higher resolution and larger scale to inform responsive policy designs, and suggest the importance of restructuring the recovery financial assistance framework to promote more climate resilient communities.

Johnson,Video-call glitches trigger uncanniness and harm consequential life outcomes,"Glitches in video calls can have a negative effect on the judgement of the people involved and correspond to worse outcomes in major areas of life such as job interviews and parole hearings. 
 People are increasingly using video calls for high-stakes interactions that once required face-to-face contact: from medical consultations1,2, to job interviews3, to court proceedings4. But video calling introduces a new communication issue: minor glitches, or intermittent errors in the transmission of audiovisual information during a virtual interaction5. Here, through five experiments and three supplementary studies using both live and recorded interactions, we show that minor audiovisual glitches during video calls harm interpersonal judgements in consequential life domains (for example, hiring decisions after a virtual interview, or trust in a medical provider after a telehealth visit). In addition, two archival datasets from real-world video calls reveal that glitches are associated with both reduced social connection and a lower likelihood of being granted criminal parole. We find that audiovisual glitches damage interpersonal judgements because they break the illusion of face-to-face contact (for example, by distorting faces, misaligning audio and visual cues or making movements appear ‘choppy’), evoking ‘uncanniness’—a strange, creepy or eerie feeling6,7. As the uncanniness of a glitch increases, so does its negative effect on interpersonal judgements. Furthermore, audiovisual glitches undermine interpersonal judgements only in video calls that simulate face-to-face interaction, showing that the negative effect produced by glitches goes beyond mere disruptiveness, comprehension difficulties and negative attributions. These findings have important implications for digital equity. Despite being considered a boon to access, virtual communication might unintentionally perpetuate inequality. Because disadvantaged groups often have poorer internet connections8–12, they are likely to encounter more glitches, and, in turn, to experience worse outcomes in consequential contexts such as health, careers, justice and social connection. Glitches in video calls can have a negative effect on the judgement of the people involved and correspond to worse outcomes in major areas of life such as job interviews and parole hearings."

Zhang,Search for light sterile neutrinos with two neutrino beams at MicroBooNE,"Data obtained from the MicroBooNE liquid-argon time projection chamber are used to exclude the single light sterile neutrino interpretation of the LSND and MiniBooNE anomalies at the 95% confidence level. 
 The existence of three distinct neutrino flavours, νe, νμ and ντ, is a central tenet of the Standard Model of particle physics1,2. Quantum-mechanical interference can allow a neutrino of one initial flavour to be detected sometime later as a different flavour, a process called neutrino oscillation. Several anomalous observations inconsistent with this three-flavour picture have motivated the hypothesis that an additional neutrino state exists, which does not interact directly with matter, termed as ‘sterile’ neutrino, νs (refs. 3–9). This includes anomalous observations from the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND)3 experiment and Mini-Booster Neutrino Experiment (MiniBooNE)4,5, consistent with νμ → νe transitions at a distance inconsistent with the three-neutrino picture. Here we use data obtained from the MicroBooNE liquid-argon time projection chamber10 in two accelerator neutrino beams to exclude the single light sterile neutrino interpretation of the LSND and MiniBooNE anomalies at the 95% confidence level (CL). Moreover, we rule out a notable portion of the parameter space that could explain the gallium anomaly6–8. This is one of the first measurements to use two accelerator neutrino beams to break a degeneracy between νe appearance and disappearance, which would otherwise weaken the sensitivity to the sterile neutrino hypothesis. We find no evidence for either νμ → νe flavour transitions or νe disappearance that would indicate non-standard flavour oscillations. Our results indicate that previous anomalous observations consistent with νμ → νe transitions cannot be explained by introducing a single sterile neutrino state. Data obtained from the MicroBooNE liquid-argon time projection chamber are used to exclude the single light sterile neutrino interpretation of the LSND and MiniBooNE anomalies at the 95% confidence level."

 Codon usage bias—the preferential use of certain synonymous codons—is a fundamental feature of all genomes. Codon usage has a key role in determining gene-expression levels in all organisms that have so far been studied1–3. Nearly all human-infecting viruses show patterns of codon usage that are distinct from those of human genes—yet they express their proteins efficiently in host cells to cause diseases and pandemics. The mechanism behind this evasion of codon usage control by viral RNA translation is unknown. Here we show that viral proteins are subject to strong codon usage control when they are translated like human genes, but that they can evade this control when translated from viral replicons. This evasion is mediated by viral 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs) in diverse human viruses, which support codon-usage-insensitive translation. Canonical mRNA translation depends on codon usage, requiring the 5′ cap, 3′ polyA tail and their associated proteins, which suggests that mRNA looping has a role in the effect of codon usage on translation. Notably, RNA circularization for mRNAs with viral 5′ UTRs restores codon-usage-dependent translation, owing mainly to non-optimal codon-usage-mediated repression. These results suggest that mRNA circularization is crucial for initiating codon-usage-dependent translation, and that viral RNAs bypass this mechanism by blocking circularization, allowing efficient translation despite their poor codon usage profiles. Rather than adapting to the codon usage of their host, viruses use viral 5′ untranslated regions to initiate translation, which allows them to produce viral proteins in host cells efficiently despite poor codon usage profiles."

 Homo sapiens evolved hundreds of thousands of years ago in Africa, later spreading across the globe1, but the early evolutionary process is debated2–6. Here we present whole-genome sequencing data for 28 ancient southern African individuals, including six individuals with 25× to 7.2× genome coverage, dated to between 10,200 and 150 calibrated years before present (cal. bp). All ancient southern Africans dated to more than 1,400 cal. bp show a genetic make-up that is outside the range of genetic variation in modern-day humans (including southern African Khoe-San people, although some retain up to 80% ancient southern African ancestry), manifesting in a large fraction of Homo sapiens-specific variants that are unique to ancient southern Africans. Homo sapiens-specific variants at amino acid-altering sites fixed for all humans—which are likely to have evolved rapidly on the Homo sapiens branch—were enriched for genes associated with kidney function. Some Homo sapiens-specific variants fixed in ancient southern Africans—which are likely to have adapted rapidly on the southern African branch—were enriched for genes associated with protection against ultraviolet light. The ancient southern Africans show little spatiotemporal stratification for 9,000 years, consistent with a large, stable Holocene population transcending archaeological phases. While southern Africa served as a long-standing geographical refugium, there is outward gene flow over 8,000 years ago; however, inward gene flow manifests only after around 1,400 years ago. The ancient genomes reported here are therefore key to the evolution of Homo sapiens, and are important for advancing our understanding of human genomic variation.

 Neutrophils exhibit remarkable phenotypic and functional diversity across tissues and diseases1,2, yet the lack of understanding of how this immune compartment is globally organized challenges translation to the clinic. Here we performed single-cell transcriptional profiling of neutrophils spanning 47 anatomical, physiological and pathological scenarios to generate an integrated map of the global neutrophil compartment in mice, which we refer to as NeuMap. NeuMap integrates and expands existing models3,4 to generate fundamental new insights; it reveals that neutrophils organize in a finite number of functional hubs that distribute sequentially during maturation to then branch out into interferon-responsive and immunosuppressive states, as well as a functionally silent state that dominates in the healthy circulation. Computational modelling and timestamp analyses identify prototypical trajectories that connect these hubs, and reveal that the dynamics and preferred paths vary during health, inflammation and cancer. We show that TGFβ, IFNβ and GM-CSF push neutrophils along the different trajectories, and projection of chromatin accessibility sites onto NeuMap reveals that the transcription factor JUNB controls angiogenic and immunosuppressive states and promotes tissue revascularization. The architecture of NeuMap appears to be conserved across sex, environmental and genetic backgrounds, as well as in humans. Finally, we show that NeuMap enables inference of the pathophysiological state of the host by profiling blood neutrophils. Our study delineates the global architecture of the neutrophil compartment and establishes a framework for exploration and exploitation of neutrophil biology.

However, recent publications show that many premalignant lesions comprise multiple clones expressing different mutant APC proteins1–4. Here, by mediating transformation on different mouse backgrounds containing mutations in Kras or other common CRC driver genes, we establish that the presence of diverse priming events in the normal mouse intestinal epithelium can change the transformation and clonal-selection landscape, permitting the fixation of strong driver mutations in Apc and Ctnnb1 that are otherwise lost due to negative selection. These findings, combined with our demonstration of mutational patterns consistent with similar priming events in human CRC, suggest that the order in which driver mutations occur in intestinal epithelium can determine whether clones are positively or negatively selected and can shape subsequent tumour development. The order in which driver mutations of colorectal cancer occur in intestinal epithelium can determine whether clones are positively or negatively selected and can shape subsequent tumour development."

 Recently, the Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has emerged as a superconductor with a transition temperature (Tc) of ~80 K above 14 GPa1-3. Achieving higher Tc in nickelate superconductors, along with the synthesis of reproducible high-quality single crystals without relying on high oxygen-pressure growth conditions, remains a significant challenge4-7. Here we report superconductivity up to 96 K under high pressure in bilayer nickelate single crystals synthesized at ambient pressure. Energy dispersive spectroscopy, single-crystal X-ray diffraction, nuclear quadrupole resonance, and scanning transmission electron microscopy evidenced high homogeneity and crystal quality of the flux-grown La2SmNi2O7-δ single crystals. La2SmNi2O7 exhibits clear bulk superconductivity, including zero resistivity (Tc,maxonset = 92 K and Tc,maxzero = 73 K at 21 GPa) and Meissner effect (Tc = 60 K at 20.6 GPa). Low-temperature high-pressure structural study indicates that both monoclinic and tetragonal structures can support superconductivity in this bilayer nickelate. Furthermore, we established a correlation between higher Tc under high pressures and larger in-plane lattice distortion at ambient conditions, corroborated by observing even higher Tconset of 96 K in La1.57Sm1.43Ni2O7-δ. This study overcomes key limitations in nickelate superconductor crystal growth, resolves the crystal structure in the superconducting state, and demonstrates an effective pathway towards achieving higher Tc."

 The Southern Ocean absorbs most of the excess heat resulting from climate change. However, climate projections show a persistent warm summer bias in its sea surface temperatures, indicating a limited understanding of the air–sea heat exchange mechanisms governing this region. Here we examine the impact of storms on the interannual variability of Southern Ocean surface temperatures during summer using in situ observations from underwater and surface robotic vehicles, climate reanalyses and satellite data. We show that synoptic-scale storms regulate summer sea surface temperatures through alteration of the effective heat capacity of the mixed layer and the entrainment of colder water from below. Storms reduce the summer ocean heat gain by limiting solar radiation reaching the surface. This effect is partially offset by a reduction in heat loss due to turbulent air–sea exchange. We also find that interannual variations in sea surface temperature during summer in the Southern Ocean are driven by changes in storm-mean wind speeds, which are linked to the Southern Annular Mode. Our results demonstrate a causal link between storm forcing and sea surface temperature variability, which is critical for reducing warming biases in climate models and improving future climate projections.

Lauretta,Bio-essential sugars in samples from asteroid Bennu,"Samples returned from asteroid Bennu contain bio-essential sugars such as ribose and glucose that may have formed in the parent asteroid from brines containing formaldehyde, according to a geochemical study. 
 Deliveries of organic molecules from space, such as those found in carbonaceous meteorites, have long been hypothesized as a source of the inventory of the first life on Earth. This hypothesis is strengthened by detections of two of life’s fundamental building blocks—nucleobases and protein-building amino acids—in pristine samples returned by spacecraft from the carbonaceous asteroids Bennu and Ryugu. However, life also requires sugars, which cannot be searched for in Ryugu samples due to limited available mass, and their presence in some meteorites is equivocal owing to terrestrial exposure. Here we analyse an extract from a sample of asteroid (101955) Bennu collected by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft and identify several bio-essential sugars, including ribose (RNA sugar) and glucose (metabolism substrate). These sugars complete the inventory of ingredients crucial to life. Their distribution is consistent with that in the condensation products of formaldehyde solution. Given that Bennu contains formaldehyde and originates from an ancient parent asteroid that underwent long-term alteration by aqueous fluids, we postulate that the detected sugars formed in the parent asteroid from brines containing formaldehyde. This indicates that material with all three components necessary to life could have been dispersed to prebiotic Earth and other inner planets.

Here, the authors describe a two tiers mechanism required to sustain Pol Epsilon processivity: CHTF18-dependent loading of PCNA at leading strand and dsDNA binding by its POLE3-POLE4 subunits. 
 The maintenance of genome stability requires efficient leading strand synthesis by DNA Polymerase Epsilon (Polε). By performing CRISPR genetic screens in cells lacking the POLE4 subunit of Polε we define a genetic map of the factors required to support Polε function in the absence of its accessory subunits. A set of genes involved in iron metabolism emerge as required to sustain Iron Sulphur Cluster (ISC)-dependent Polε activity. We then dissect a synthetic lethal interaction between POLE3-POLE4 and the CHTF18-RFC2/5 complex. By combining cell biology, structural modelling and biochemistry, we define the existence of two tiers of regulation of Polε processivity: leading strand-specific loading of PCNA by CHTF18-RFC2/5 and “gripping” of newly synthesised dsDNA by POLE3-POLE4. The combined loss of these functions is incompatible with leading strand synthesis and viability. In summary, we describe the biochemical basis of human leading strand synthesis and the consequence of its dysfunction in genome stability. How DNA Polymerase Epsilon accomplishes continuous leading strand synthesis during DNA replication is not understood.

Here, the authors identify pericytes as an active paracrine signaling hub within the tumor parenchyma that orchestrates a tumor-suppressive microenvironment, suggesting pericyte preservation as a key feature of future therapeutic regimens for glioblastoma. 
 Glioblastoma (GBM) is characterized by fast progression, infiltrative growth pattern, and a high relapse rate. A defining feature of GBM is the existence of spatially and functionally distinct cellular niches, where malignant cells engage in paracrine crosstalk with cell types comprising the tumor microenvironment. Here, we identify pericytes as the most active paracrine signaling hub within the tumor parenchyma. Their depletion through genetic engineering results in accelerated tumor progression and shortened survival. Mechanistic studies reveal that pericyte deficiency remodels the endothelium and impacts the immune cell landscape, exacerbating tumor cell invasion and immune suppression. Specifically, the pericyte-deprived endothelium recruits perivascular, tumor-associated macrophages polarized towards an immune-suppressive phenotype. The recruited macrophages express Hepatocyte Growth Factor, which reinforces activation of its receptor tyrosine kinase MET on GBM cells harboring a pronounced mesenchymal subtype driven by the key phenotypic regulator Fosl1. Indeed, orthotopic implantation of MET-expressing GBM cells corroborates their superior tumor-initiating and invasive capabilities. Thus, pericytes represent critical modulators of GBM development by orchestrating a tumor-suppressive microenvironment, highlighting the importance of their preservation in therapy. Improved understanding of the tumor ecosystem in glioblastoma is critical for developing new treatment strategies for the disease.

 Pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) agonists are valuable agents across multiple medical applications, from vaccinology to immune-oncology.

From this screen, we selected a thiazole benzamide derivative, PVP-057, for its robust immunomodulatory properties, low toxicity profile, and concentration-dependent activity. In vitro investigation of pathway and receptor activation reveals that PVP-057 is a Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist. As a single-component adjuvant, administered intramuscularly or intradermally to female mice, PVP-057 enhances long-term humoral immunogenicity of varicella-zoster virus glycoprotein E to levels comparable to those induced by the clinical grade standard benchmark adjuvant, AS01B, while concurrently inducing cell-mediated immunity. To demonstrate the large-scale and precise synthesis necessary for the efficient mass production of a small molecule agonist, a green chemistry approach was completed, devising a three-step, 24-hour synthesis scheme for PVP-057, with a reliable purity of ~98%. Featuring highly efficient and scalable synthesis, a distinct TLR3-dependent mechanism of action, and robust adjuvanticity, the PVP-057 pharmacophore has prophylactic and therapeutic potential. Adjuvants are an important component of modern vaccines. Here, the authors employ a phenotypic screen of ~200k compounds and identify PVP-057, a TLR3 agonist with a simple scalable 3-step synthesis, as an adjuvant that induces durable humoral and cellular immunity to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) gE in mice."

Here, the authors reported hydrogen-bond nanoconfined self-destructive polymers that have reversible solid-fluid switching capability at 25 °C and maintain good mechanical properties. 
 Conventional materials typically maintain a stable solid state under specific application conditions. However, materials that combine high mechanical strength with reversible switching states are highly desirable for advanced technologies. Here, we present hydrogen-bond nanoconfined self-destructive polymers (HNSPs) that have robust mechanics and reversible solid-fluid switching capability at 25 °C. Upon exposure to moisture, HNSPs spontaneously transition from solid to fluid, with humidity-tunable switching rates. HNSPs with weight ratios (Rm) of 1.7 is 1.69 times higher self-destructive rate than those with Rm of 2.1, and at 90% relative humidity (RH), Rm=2.0 samples exhibit an 804.27% higher self-destructive efficiency than at 60% RH. Heating can reverse the fluid back to a solid, enabling reversible, humidity-programmable behavior. Mechanistically, large ordered hydrogen-bond clusters, reduced chain entanglement, and abundant hydrophilic groups collectively facilitate switching. This work provides a simple yet versatile strategy for designing robust, switchable self-destructive polymers, broadening their potential in next-generation devices. Materials that combine high mechanical strength with stable and reversible switching states are highly desirable for advanced technology applications.

Here the authors show that, in septic mice, platelets activate perivascular mast cells to cause systemic hypotension and vascular pathology, while inhibiting platelets or mast cell activation suppresses septic shock induction, thereby implicating potential therapy targets. 
 The critical events that trigger sepsis progression into life-threatening septic shock remain unclear. In agreement with reports that link a drop in platelet count to a complicated clinical course in sepsis patients, here we report that, during sepsis, mouse platelets become activated, deposit systemically on vascular walls, and stimulate perivascular mast cells (MC) by releasing platelet activating factor (PAF). In mouse models and patient samples, MC activation correlates with the development of shock in sepsis and is mechanistically linked to shock by inducing systemic hypotension, vascular leakage and microvascular perfusion abnormalities. Preventing platelet or MC activation, or inhibiting the activity of the major MC granule constituent chymase, averts progression from sepsis to shock and reduces mortality of septic mice. Thus, our work establishes that, during sepsis progression, platelet microvascular adhesion leads to MC-mediated vascular changes to culminate in septic shock and septic shock-associated mortality. Sepsis may progress into lethal septic shock, but the cellular mechanisms are still unclear. Here the authors show that, in septic mice, platelets activate perivascular mast cells to cause systemic hypotension and vascular pathology, while inhibiting platelets or mast cell activation suppresses septic shock induction, thereby implicating potential therapy targets."

Here, using RNA-sequencing data from a large clinical trial in NSCLC patients, the authors define four molecular subsets with distinct tumour-intrinsic and -extrinsic features with differing outcomes to immunotherapy combinations. 
 The phase 3 IMpower150 trial in treatment-naïve patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) demonstrates significantly longer progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with first-line atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1)-bevacizumab (anti-VEGF)-carboplatin-paclitaxel (ABCP) than with bevacizumab-carboplatin-paclitaxel (BCP). We characterise four molecular NSCLC subtypes identified by unsupervised clustering of transcriptomes of 564 pre-treatment primary tumour samples from IMpower150 using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF1-4). Each subtype has distinct tumour PD-L1 expression levels, epithelial characteristics, immune composition, and treatment outcomes. Both NMF2 (enriched in tumour proliferation signal, macrophages, and monocytes) and NMF4 (enriched in B cells and T cells) have elevated tumour PD-L1 expression. Of these two, only NMF4 demonstrates PFS and OS benefits with ABCP versus either BCP or atezolizumab-carboplatin-paclitaxel (ACP). Patients with NMF1 (enriched in basal and squamous-like cells) have improved outcomes on ABCP compared with ACP or BCP; those with NMF3 (enriched in adenocarcinoma signatures) show similar outcomes among treatments. These insights could help inform individualised first-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC. Standard first line therapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer is immunotherapy but responses vary and consistent predictive biomarkers are lacking.

 Mutation sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in liquid biopsy is crucial for tumor precision medicine, resistance profiling, and clinical decision-making. However, cfDNA mutation profiling in blood samples remains challenging due to its low abundance and high background noise. Here, we develop an Enzymatic Cleavage-directed Single Nucleotide Variant Sequencing (EC-SNV-Seq) assay technology for multiple cfDNA mutation detections. The EC-SNV-Seq assay integrates Argonaute-mediated cleavage and stem-loop DNA-initiated cascade-PCR amplification, achieving a sensitivity of 0.01% variant allele frequency. As a proof of concept, we apply the EC-SNV-Seq assay to detect multiple cfDNA mutations in KRAS, EGFR, and PIK3CA genes with single-nucleotide resolution. We further validate that EC-SNV-Seq detects early-stage multi-cancer and identifies single-nucleotide variants in a single patient plasma sample. Lastly, we evaluate its feasibility for multi-cancer early detection in population-scale screening using pooled plasma samples.

 Owing to their significant advantages in terms of bandwidth, power efficiency, and latency, optical neuromorphic systems have arisen as interesting alternatives to digital electronic devices. Recently, photonic crystal nanolasers with excitable behavior were first demonstrated. Depending on the pumping strength, they emit short optical pulses – spikes – at various intervals on a nanosecond timescale. In this theoretical work, we show how networks of such photonic spiking neurons can be used for Bayesian inference through sampling from learned probability distributions. We provide a detailed derivation of translation rules from conventional sampling networks, such as Boltzmann machines, to photonic spiking networks and demonstrate their functionality across a range of generative tasks. Finally, we provide estimates of processing speed and power consumption, for which we expect improvements of several orders of magnitude over current state-of-the-art neuromorphic systems.

This study maps ghost forests at the individual tree level along the US Atlantic coastal region. 
 Rising sea levels have driven widespread coastal tree die-off, forming large swaths of standing dead trees known as ‘ghost forests’. While reports of coastal forest loss are accumulating, its true severity and factors determining the underlying mortality risks remain poorly understood. Here we mapped over 10 million individual dead trees across the US Atlantic region, a sea level rise hotspot, using deep learning and sub-metre aerial imagery. Our analysis reveals disproportionate and pervasive tree mortality in many previously unrecognized ghost forest hotspots, with over 6 million dead trees concentrated in low-lying (<5 m) forests, primarily driven by salinization rather than flooding alone. Notably, man-made flood obstructions (roads and levees), when present, have reduced forest loss by 40% and 79% respectively, but they can only provide temporary protection against rising seas. These findings highlight the alarming decline in coastal forests and the need for strategic long-term planning to preserve the critical services that coastal ecosystems provide.

 Invasive plants, alongside other global changes, are transforming ecosystems globally. Strategic responses depend on monitoring invasions and arising socioecological risks particularly in the biodiverse and socioeconomically vulnerable regions. Using 16 years (2006–2022) of systematic monitoring over 277,000 km2 in India, we analyse the nexus between plant invasions and global changes, including propagule pressure, forest warming and drying, altered fire and herbivory dynamics and rapid land-use transformation. Annually, ~15,500 km2 of natural areas are invaded by at least one new species, exposing ~11,200 km2 of herbivore occupancy to forage loss. These invasions potentially limit resources for tiger food chains across ~5,950 km2 annually. Invasions have exposed 144 million people, 2.79 million livestock and 0.2 million km2 of smallholder agriculture to cascading impacts. By identifying socioecological risk hotspots for prioritizing investments, our findings offer critical insights to guide targeted restoration and safeguard biodiversity and vulnerable livelihoods.

 As a group of concerned organic pollutants, polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are able to accumulate in crops, thereby posing potential ecological risks. Phytohormone herbicides, such as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), are widely used in agriculture to control weeds. Here, we found that IAA at environmentally relevant concentrations promoted the absorption and translocation of 6:2 chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate (6:2 Cl-PFESA) in wheat via activated multiple channel proteins. Furthermore, IAA facilitated unloading of 6:2 Cl-PFESA from cortex to xylem, thereby significantly promoting its translocation. The conformation transformation of channel proteins regulated by IAA greatly promotes dissociation of 6:2 Cl-PFESA from the bound proteins. The electrostatic interaction between 6:2 Cl-PFESA and gate residues enlarges the channel radius and promotes its absorption. These findings provide the evidence regarding the potential ecological risks associated with 6:2 Cl-PFESA accumulation in wheat caused by the application of IAA in agriculture.

 Rock mass volume estimation is crucial for assessing landslide hazard, but it is often challenging.

The aim of this work is to propose a procedure to build an eigenfrequency-volume abacus to estimate the order of magnitude of blocks’ volumes from the extracted resonance frequencies independently estimating the blocks’ area. The resonance frequency is extracted from seismic noise measurements analysed using the Horizontal-to-Vertical Spectral Ratio technique. The abacus is developed here by means of numerical simulations and field data, acquired over lateral spreads and block slides on Malta Island, where independent direct estimates of the blocks’ volume are available.

 Irrigation modifies land-atmosphere interactions, cooling land surface and mitigating heat extremes. However, the global shift toward water-saving irrigation technologies raises new questions about the climate regulation capacity of irrigation under constrained water use. Using two decades of high-resolution satellite observations across China, we show that widespread water-saving adoption has substantially weakened irrigation’s biophysical cooling effects, particularly in late summer and early spring. Daytime land surface cooling declined by 0.05 K/decade (15%) nationally and up to 0.20 K/decade (9%) in arid regions, primarily due to reduced soil evaporation and increased sensible heat flux. This trend was absent in semi-arid and semi-humid regions because of enhanced crop transpiration. Conversely, nighttime cooling intensified by 0.04 K per decade, likely driven by lower soil thermal capacity and radiative feedbacks. These findings reveal an emerging trade-off between water-use efficiency and climate mitigation, calling for considering evolving irrigation practices in Earth system models and climate change projections. Water-saving irrigation weakens daytime cooling and enhances nighttime cooling across China; satellite and surface energy balance analyses (2001–2020) link this to reduced soil evaporation, increased sensible heat, and altered land–atmosphere interactions."

 The primary sources of recent summer Arctic moistening trends in reanalysis are uncertain, hindering attribution of observed Arctic warming due to radiative effects from water vapor changes. Here, we use a combined online numerical water tracer and circulation nudging approach in the Community Earth System Model to track the sources of water vapor beyond its initial sources. Trends in boreal summer large-scale circulation have driven moistening of the Arctic over recent decades, having a large impact on the Arctic radiative budget, accounting for 94% of the strengthening water vapor radiative feedback. We identify two key regions supplying the Arctic water vapor feedback: Northeast North America and western/central Eurasia. In both regions, anticyclonic circulations over the southwest Atlantic and eastern Europe move moisture from the tropical oceans poleward to high latitude land through precipitation in winter and spring. During summer, evapotranspiration over land releases this water vapor, and it is transported by winds into the Arctic. We refer to this sequence of terrestrial moisture storage and release as the land capacitor effect. Thus, the impacts of circulation changes on poleward moisture transport and land-atmosphere interactions over high latitudes represent the underlying mechanisms of the recent moistening and warming in the Arctic.
