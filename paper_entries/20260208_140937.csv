Kamstra,Mechanistic Insights of BPA Alternatives on PPARγ Binding and the Consequence on Adipocyte Differentiation,"The obesity epidemic is increasingly linked to environmental factors like endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Bisphenol A (BPA), a known EDC, has been suspected to be linked to adiposity through activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a key regulator of adipogenesis. Though many BPA alternatives have been introduced as substitutes, their effects on metabolic health remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the mechanistic interactions of 11 BPA alternatives with PPARγ and their adipogenic potential. Using a PPARγ reporter assay, we assessed the binding affinity and activation potential of BPA alternatives, followed by X-ray crystallography of two potent activators, 4-benzyloxyphenyl 4-hydroxyphenyl sulfone (BPS4BE) and bisphenol PH (BPPH). Additionally, adipogenesis was assessed via a human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) differentiation assay. Results revealed that the alternatives BPPH and BPS4BE potently activated PPARγ (BMD20 (μM): 0.23 and 0.34 respectively). Both significantly induced adipogenesis and a positive correlation was found between PPARγ activation and adipogenic differentiation. Crystallography revealed distinct binding modes for BPPH and BPS4BE compared to rosiglitazone, indicating partial agonism. These findings raise significant concerns about the safety of BPA alternatives and underscore the need for structure-based risk assessment to ensure safer substitutes."

However, the effects of urinary DEHP metabolites on the progression of bladder cancer remain unclear. Here, we aimed to identify the representative chemical and explore its effect and mechanism on bladder cancer progression with epidemiological and experimental methods based on the adverse outcome pathway (AOP). The quantile-based g-computation (QGC) model showed a positive association between urinary plasticizer metabolites and bladder cancer risks in older men (NHANES 2005–2018), with mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP, the secondary-metabolite of DEHP) identified as a main driver factor. We treated human bladder cancer cells with MEOHP at environmentally relevant concentrations (10, 100, and 1000 nM) and found that 100 nM MEOHP exposure activated a hybrid EMT (epithelial–mesenchymal transition) phenotype. Mechanically, we confirmed that the environmental dose of MEOHP increased nuclear transposition of YAP and β-catenin (molecular initiating event, MIE), thereby sustaining the hybrid EMT phenotype of bladder cancer cells through a series of key events. Our study first investigated the effects of plasticizer secondary metabolite on bladder cancer progression, highlighting the potential damage to urinary system health caused by the metabolites of environmental chemicals and providing a new perspective for the toxicity assessment of pollutants in the future."

Nevertheless, the nationwide H2 backbone networks required have not yet been fully investigated. Employing a techno-economic analysis of solar photovoltaic and wind power on a scale of 1 km combined with source-sink matching among potential multisectoral H2 hubs, this study develops a decision support system (dubbed China Shared Hydrogen Infrastructure Network Enabler (SHINE)) to explore renewable H2 layouts commensurate with China’s climate ambition, accounting for varying degrees of H2 demand and reuse of oil and gas pipeline corridors. Given total H2 demand scenarios of 54, 77, and 100 Mt/yr in 2060, the total length of the proposed trunkline networks will reach roughly 11,700, 18,300, and 29,900 km, with a levelized cost of production and transport of 1.55, 1.62, and 1.72 USD/kg, respectively. Additionally, by incorporating the spatial heterogeneities and sectoral disparities of H2 deployment expansion into the model, distinct policy instruments can be crafted for the shared nationwide H2 network."

With new developments in MS instrumentation and analysis software, the approach has gained substantial momentum over the past decade. However, achieving high-quality analytical data that is reproducible and comparable across laboratories can be a bottleneck in non-targeted metabolomics and organic matter chemical analysis, especially for data reuse in repository-scale analyses. Understanding the capabilities as well as challenges of comparing LC–MS/MS data from different laboratories is necessary for inferring global trends from public data sets. To illuminate instrumentation factors that drive differences and variability, we used a standardized data analysis pipeline, including classical (CMN) and feature-based molecular networking (FBMN), to analyze data from a ring trial by 24 laboratories on identical sample sets of algal and DOM extracts that were mixed in predefined concentrations and spiked with standards. Our results showed that data sets from similar mass spectrometer types with unified instrument parameters were qualitatively comparable, resolving the same general trends and shared mass spectral features. Interlaboratory comparability was best for high-intensity features, while low-intensity features showed greater detection variability. Our analysis also highlights challenges when comparing data from instruments with different acquisition rates or operating with less standardized methods. Lastly, we provide recommendations for data integration, public data sharing, standardization, and best practices for standardized LC–MS/MS data acquisition, which will be critical for long-term time series and intercomparability of DOM chemical analyses."

These components can interact with plastic particles in different ways that may alter their surface properties and environmental behavior. In this study, we examined how soil solution affects the aggregation kinetics and colloidal stability of nanoplastics made from a soil-biodegradable plastic (poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate), PBAT) and a conventional plastic (polyethylene). Without the soil solution, both PBAT and polyethylene nanoplastics aggregated more readily in CaCl2 than in NaCl, with critical coagulation concentrations of 344 and 284 mM in NaCl and 31 and 36 mM in CaCl2, respectively. The addition of the soil solution promoted the aggregation of both nanoplastics, as evidenced by the larger aggregate sizes, despite that the critical coagulation concentrations did not decrease correspondingly. Such an increase in aggregate sizes was induced not only by the formation of an eco-corona on nanoplastics, which enhanced aggregation through polymer bridging and attractive patch-charge interactions, but also by the heteroaggregation between nanoplastics and colloids present in the soil solution. These results suggest that interaction with soil solution can promote the aggregation of nanoplastics through eco-corona formation and heteroaggregation, underlining the role of the complex interactions between nanoplastics and their surrounding matrices on the environmental behavior of nanoplastics."

However, the resulting large-scale production may pose health risks due to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) emissions. Here, we present the first trade-off analysis between PFAS wastewater treatment burdens and associated health benefits in electronics and semiconductor manufacturing and benchmark the costs against market values. Specifically, by 2035, the rapid expansion of these sectors is projected to discharge 4.4–10.9 kilotons of PFAS annually into wastewater, resulting in an estimated upper-bound range of 25–103 million comparative toxic units for human toxicity (CTUh) in the absence of treatment. Achieving the toxicity reduction via granular activated carbon (GAC), ion-exchange resin (IER), or reverse osmosis (RO) membranes will require annual investments of $16.5–50.0 billion across regions in 2035, equivalent to ∼0.5% of the respective electronics market value via IER. Moreover, we find that variations in breakthrough performance substantially alter both economic and environmental burdens, particularly in electronics wastewater, which is dominated by short-chain PFAS, whose limited removal efficiency amplifies these effects. By quantifying the cost-health nexus, our findings provide actionable insights for PFAS governance and reinforce the urgency of globally coordinated efforts to align industrial growth with environmental and public health protection."

However, inefficient electron transfer and metabolic imbalance between acidogenic bacteria and sulfidogens limit SSA performance, especially from mariculture solid wastes (MSW) containing high-strength sulfate. This work unveiled the neglected role and mechanism of rhamnolipid (RL) in modulating microbial interspecies electron transfer for SSA during MSW anaerobic fermentation. RL, at environmentally relevant levels of 20–200 mg/g suspended solids, simultaneously improved sulfide (40.1–87.9%) and short-chain fatty acids (8.0–19.3-fold) yield. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) exhibited higher capacitance and electroactivity to store or transfer electrons in the presence of RL. Proper RL facilitated pili-like filament formation and redox mediator secretion. The flavins and cytochrome c combination was promoted by RL to mediate one-electron transfer with a higher transfer rate via the flavin semiquinone intermediate. RL increased the dipole moment of the α-helix peptide and spontaneously interacted with the C═O of amide groups, enabling efficient electron hopping in EPSs. RL also activated key components in the intracellular electron transfer system, delivering more electron flow to sulfate reductase. Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses verified the differential enrichment of microorganisms and key gene upregulation related to SSA, EPS secretion, quorum sensing, ATP, type IV pili, and electron shuttle synthesis. These findings provide new insight into the roles and interactive mechanisms of biosurfactants in modulating microbial electron transfer."

However, its underlying radiative processes remain unclear. This study integrates GEWEX satellite observations with ERA5 and MERRA‐2 reanalysis, applying surface energy balance diagnostics to quantify the WTV's radiative forcing on T2m variability. We find the WTV explains ∼66% of T2m variance (R = 0.81) across the western TP and the adjacent Southwest Asia. Downward shortwave radiation (DSW) emerges as the primarily radiative factor modulated by the WTV via cloud radiative forcing (CRF) processes. Specifically, anticyclonic WTV events reduce cloudiness, generating positive CRF anomalies that enhancing surface DSW and cause warming. Conversely, cyclonic events increase cloudiness, producing negative CRF anomalies that diminish DSW and induce cooling. These findings advance understanding of the radiative processes by which the upper circulations modulate the surface climate over the TP."

Solar SXR irradiance is highly variable, particularly during solar flares. Solar SXR photons at ∼< ${\sim} <  $2.5 nm produce oxygen Auger photoelectrons by photoionizing atmospheric constituents. More specifically, we derive the fit function between the Auger photoelectron fluxes observed by Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) and the 0.1–0.8‐nm solar irradiance observed by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) X‐ray Sensors (XRS). The fit function is applied to the MGS data to produce a proxy for the 0.1–0.8‐nm SXR irradiance and to classify 167 identified solar flare events from 1999 to 2006 at Mars, which is an additional vantage point away from Earth. These results are of particular interest for studying Mars's atmospheric response to solar flares and over‐the‐limb and far‐side solar activities."

We present the first comprehensive analysis of topside ionospheric ambipolar diffusion using the difference between the field‐aligned ion drifts and neutral winds observed by the Ionospheric Connection Explorer (ICON) satellite. The ambipolar diffusion exhibits a distinct evening enhancement within ±10° MLAT. The reversal of its direction near ±10° MLAT demarcates the boundary between the trans‐equatorial diffusion‐dominated region (within ±10° MLAT) and the area governed by the vertical gradient‐driven diffusion‐dominated region (out of ±10° MLAT). For the field‐aligned drift, the neutral wind contribution is also significant, but less influential than diffusion. The equatorial fountain effect further modulates diffusion, enhancing winter‐hemisphere transport and creating its longitudinal structures. These findings provide crucial observational evidence to strengthen the understanding of ionospheric diffusion mechanisms, offering reliable and critical inputs for ionospheric theoretical models."

King;Brian Green;Aditi Sheshadri,Steady Source Gravity Wave Parameterizations and the Observed Momentum Flux Intermittency,"Observational estimates of gravity wave momentum fluxes obtained from analyses of super‐pressure balloon tracks show an approximate log normal distribution in space and time. One study has suggested that a non‐orographic gravity wave parameterization with a steady source could reproduce this distribution through variability in the background wind, which “dynamically filters” the source spectrum. We use an implementation of a simple steady source gravity wave parameterization to show that this observed distribution is not reproduced, the most prominent departure from it being a large negative skew. We perform a crude tuning of the scheme's parameters to show that the discrepancy in the distribution cannot be corrected. We observe that at higher levels, parameterized fluxes are still skewed but less so. We suggest that dynamical filtering alone cannot introduce enough variability to obtain fluxes that are log normally distributed."

We perform injection‐reactivation experiments on critically stressed faults to test how different injection strategies shape slip and seismic moment release. We find that injection strategies regulate the cadence of slip events rather than the total seismic moment. Compared to continuous injection, cycled injection triggers frequent and smaller events, reducing maximum moment magnitude and deformation energy of individual events. Injection–extraction cycles actively reduce pore pressure, temporally partition successive slip events, and effectively suppress delayed seismicity. Regardless of constant or cycled injection rates, maximum seismic moment (M0 ${M}_{0}$) scales with cumulative injection volume (ΔV ${\Delta }V$) i.e.,M0∝ΔV3/2 $\left(\mathrm{i}.\mathrm{e}.,{M}_{0}\propto {\Delta }{V}^{3/2}\right)$.

This raises a concern about the changing seasonality of exceptional hot extremes in the region which might leave population there underprepared. Based on station observations, we found that since 1990 early summer hot extremes have warmed 2–3 times faster than those in peak and late summer stages. A Lagrangian decomposition points to the main driver for the intra‐seasonally disproportionate warming rates as the enhanced adiabatic heating, contributed by more frequent arrival and intensified descent of upper‐level air particles from west and south. We further illustrated that the past‐decade prevalence of a ridge pattern well atop North China was essential to the enhanced adiabatic heating. Our results highlight the critical yet overlooked role of changing atmospheric dynamics in altering regional extremes."

We investigate the sufficiency of large‐scale anticyclones in forming moist and dry heatwaves by analysing local land‐atmospheric conditions prior to 10 heatwaves in IGP. Using Eulerian temperature decomposition, we show that horizontal heat advection (remote) process contributes minimally to both heatwave types compared to diabatic and adiabatic (local) processes. Antecedent factors highlight the critical role of pre‐monsoon showers, followed by nocturnal low‐level clouds and surface moisture, creating a conducive environment for moist heatwaves. In contrast, dry heatwaves form due to anticyclonic conditions, high sensible heat flux, lack of moisture advection, and cloud‐free conditions. This study highlights the role of local land‐atmosphere interactions in triggering the onset of heatwaves and help in distinguishing heatwave regions from adjacent non‐heatwave regions. Monitoring these precursors is essential for developing reliable early warning systems to improve heatwave detection and response."

While the clusters reflect seasonal and regional differences in MCS occurrence, they do not consistently distinguish between MCSs that do and do not produce flash floods. Systems in the southern Great Plains are more flood‐prone when a synoptic‐scale forcing, located near the system, drives strong water vapor transport from the nearby moisture source.

While previous studies have primarily focused on the brine acidification induced by CO2 injection, triggering geochemical reactions in carbonate rocks and leading to mechanical degradation, the mechanical behavior associated with salt precipitation in drying zones, particularly the failure mechanisms, remains poorly understood. In this work, we designed a reservoir‐condition displacement system to mimic near‐wellbore drying process and further investigated the rock failure modes due to salt precipitation in red sandstone samples. Our study demonstrates that, despite the densification of the pore structure due to salt precipitation, the overall mechanical performance of the rock undergoes significant deterioration. More importantly, for the first time, we observe a distinct transition of failure mode from shear‐to tensile‐dominated under uniaxial compression. Microstructural analysis further shows that the growth of polycrystalline and bulk crystals induces microcrack initiation and propagation, with the failure mechanism of rocks subjected to salt precipitation primarily characterized by intercrystalline damage at weak bonding interfaces under external loading."

Despite consistent efforts to develop the irrigation network for increased agricultural production, approximately 60% of India's cropped area still remains rain fed, thereby functional to the strength of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM). The probability of a weak monsoon is strongly correlated with the occurrence of droughts during the ISM season. The possible influence of atmospheric drivers in initiating these droughts is observed through the dynamics of low‐level jets (LLJ) over the northern Arabian Sea forming the core of LLJ during the ISM. Interestingly, since the past 72 years, from 1951 to 2022, the core of LLJ has become dry (increased saturation deficit by 17%) and weak (reduced wind speed by 5%). Additionally, the wind speed (saturation deficit) at the core shares close dependence (75%–80%) with the initiation of dry (wet) extremes exhibiting maximum correlation at a 2‐day lag. Furthermore, we observed a 50% (40%) increase in the dry (wet) extremes driven by the lower‐atmospheric dynamics of the LLJ core. Consequently, these dry (wet) extremes are characterized by a 6% (12%) enhancement in duration (intensity). Such conditions act as strong precursors for monsoon droughts."

We find a shape‐induced enhancement of global dust extinction of +20% ${+}20\,\mathrm{\%}$ (±1%) $(\pm 1\,\mathrm{\%})$, resulting in a global cooling increase of +24% ${+}24\,\mathrm{\%}$ (±3%) $(\pm 3\,\mathrm{\%})$ at the top of atmosphere and +12% ${+}12\,\mathrm{\%}$ (±2%) $(\pm 2\,\mathrm{\%})$ at the surface. The ellipsoidal shapes increase the total dust extinction per unit mass, improving our model representation of the dust optical depth compared to a semi‐observational constraint and ground‐based measurements. However, our analysis shows that the database of ellipsoidal scattering properties covers only one‐third of the observed distribution of shapes. This represents a major uncertainty in evaluating the dust shape effect in model applications."

The Year of Polar Prediction, an international effort to improve weather prediction over the southern polar region, presents an opportunity to study the clouds and precipitation associated with winter atmospheric river events. This study uses enhanced surface, profile, and remote‐sensing observations from the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) during a Targeted Observing Period around 16 May 2022, when an event occurred with local warming similar to a warm front. We compare regional atmospheric simulations with the polar‐optimized version of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model to various in situ and remote‐sensing observations. The study emphasizes data from three stations: Escudero, Vernadsky, and Rothera. Mixed‐phase clouds were simulated at the three stations, with the precipitation being primarily rain at Escudero and primarily snow at Vernadsky and Rothera. The model produced reasonable simulations of the clouds and precipitation. Furthermore, modeled longwave cloud forcing at Escudero had small errors compared to observed values. A sensitivity test enhancing secondary ice production indicates mixed‐phase cloud sensitivity to the Hallett‐Mossop process, especially at Rothera."

This study examines the influence of anthropogenic warming on intense tropical cyclones (TCs) over the Arabian Sea using convection‐permitting simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. In particular, we provide the first quantitative assessment of the impact of anthropogenic forcing on recently observed TC‐induced extreme rainfall. Human‐induced changes were assessed through two experiments: all forcings (ALL) and natural forcings only (NAT). Anthropogenic warming “delta” patterns of sea surface temperature, relative humidity, and air temperature were derived from CMIP6 models and applied in WRF under a pseudo‐global warming framework. Three major TCs—Ockhi (2017), Kyarr (2019), and Maha (2019)—were simulated, and the model reproduced their tracks, intensities, and rainfall with high fidelity. Comparison of ALL and NAT runs shows a clear anthropogenic signal: TC‐induced total and extreme rainfall both increases, linked to stronger vertical motion and greater moisture availability that enhance latent heat release and deep convection. Furthermore, there is a statistically significant expansion in the area experiencing extreme rainfall by ∼16%–34%, and an enhanced intensity of extreme rainfall by ∼4%–12% under anthropogenic warming. Additional differences in vertical thermal profiles and warm‐core structures further highlight the impact of human‐induced climate change on TC dynamics."

Our method provides several improvements on existing projection methods, including accounting for how variability in storm surges, tides and mean sea level impact the timing of annual maxima within and between years. Our method presents projected future water levels with autocorrelation and other key statistical properties of observations preserved. Under a sea level rise scenario of approximately 0.8 m by 2100, new record sea levels will be set at least once at 86% of Australian tide gauges between 2020 and 2050. By the 2090s, even a small storm surge can exceed the 2020 current day record sea level at most locations, with exceedances especially likely at times of higher tides. The impacts of future extreme sea levels will be more extreme than current or past record sea levels.

 CRISPR/Cas9-based gene-editing technologies offer promise for treating inherited retinal diseases (IRDs), however safe and efficient ocular delivery of precision editors remains challenging. To address this challenge, we report a class of Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB)-derived lipidoids that bind and deliver proteins. Subretinal injection of Cre complexed with these lipidoids into mT/mG mice leads to robust recombination in the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors. We employ the CBB-lipidoid platform to deliver adenine base editor (ABE) ribonucleoproteins (RNP). Incorporating CBB lipidoids into liposomes improves delivery efficiency. CBB11 stands out for facilitating precise in vivo ABE-mediated gene editing. Delivery of liposome-CBB11-RNP complexes results in a 120-fold increase in base editing compared to RNP alone and restores the scotopic ERG b-wave response in the rd12 mouse model. These results demonstrate the potential of CBB-augmented, liposome-RNP systems for therapeutic gene editing in the eye, paving the way for single-dose precision medicines to treat IRDs.

 Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) inflammation is considered as an important contributor of aging, however, whether there is endogenous factor(s) in VAT that counteract this process remains obscure. Here we reported that interleukin (IL)−10 expressing B lineage (B-10) cells are greatly expanded in aged VAT in human and mouse. In aged VAT, B-10 cells are the primary source of IL-10. B cell-specific knockout of IL-10 exaggerated aging-related inflammation and insulin resistance (IR) and reduced lifespan, which could be partially recovered via adoptive transfer of B-10 cells from wild-type mice. Aged VAT microenvironment enhanced IL-10 secretion and proliferation of B-10 cells. The proliferation of B-10 cells was mediated by increases in BAFF in aged VAT. Knock-down of BAFF in VAT compromised aging-related expansion of B-10 cells. On the contrary, VAT-specific overexpression of BAFF promoted B-10 cells expansion, improved aging-related inflammation and IR, and prolonged lifespan.

 In neuromorphic photonic systems, device operations are typically governed by analog signals, necessitating digital-to-analog converters (DAC) and analog-to-digital converters (ADC). However, data movement between memory and these converters in conventional von Neumann architectures incur significant energy costs. We propose an analog electronic memory co-located with photonic computing units to eliminate repeated long-distance data movement.

Furthermore, maintaining a minimum analog memory retention-to-network-latency ratio of 100 maintains  >90% inference accuracy, enabling leaky analog memories without substantial performance degradation.

 Hydroxyl Radical Protein Footprinting is a powerful tool to probe protein higher-order structure, protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions. It is mostly performed in vitro, but recent advances have extended its use to live cells, nematodes, and 3D cultures. However, to the best of our knowledge, application in living mammalian tissues has not been accomplished. Here, we present the successful use of radical protein footprinting (RPF) in mammalian whole blood from wild-type and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice. Using persulfate photoactivated with the FOX Photolysis System, we achieve effective protein labeling without significant disruption to blood cell morphology. An optimized quenching protocol eliminates background labeling. We report oxidative modifications for the eleven most abundant proteins detected, revealing disease-associated conformational changes in multiple proteins. We validate that in-blood RPF identifies changes in protein structure resulting from complement activation and increased transferrin iron saturation in T2DM mice. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of RPF in mammalian blood and create opportunities for structural proteomics in preclinical models and clinical samples.

 The Rab11 endosomal recycling pathway is exploited by important respiratory RNA viruses such as IAV and RSV, aiding viral egress from the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells. Late in infection, Rab11-containing vesicles specifically transport viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes towards the cell surface before packaging and budding. Rather than employing traditional Rab11-positive recycling endosomes, virus-infected cells generate remodelled Rab11-containing vesicles, as observed during IAV infection. Besides Rab11, no other conserved host co-factors have been identified among these various vRNP trafficking vesicles. Here we discover and confirm myoferlin’s association with IAV vRNPs in the cytoplasm and colocalisation with Rab11 during late stages of infection. We also find that this role is conserved in late-stage vRNP trafficking of other viruses, including RSV and SeV. Myoferlin likely recruits the EHD family of proteins, which are involved in endosomal biogenesis, to these unique vRNP trafficking endosomes, highlighting myoferlin’s pivotal role in viral replication.

Here, the authors present a fast two-stage framework that detects atomic and torsional errors with quantum-mechanical accuracy. 
 Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized the field of 3D molecule generation. However, the lack of effective evaluation methods for 3D conformations limits further improvements. Current techniques, in order to achieve the necessary speed for evaluating large number of AI-generated molecules, often rely on empirical geometric metrics that do not adequately capture various conformational anomalies, or on molecular mechanics energy metrics that exhibit low accuracy and lack atomic or torsional details. To address this gap, we propose a two-stage approach that achieves both high speed and quantum mechanical level accuracy. The first stage, termed the validity test, employs an AI-derived force field to identify atoms with elevated energy resulting from implausible neighboring environments. The second stage, known as the rationality test, utilizes a deep learning network trained on data with density functional theory accuracy to detect rotatable bonds with high torsional energies. To demonstrate the functionality of our evaluation system, we applied our approach to five recently reported 3D molecule generation AI models across 102 targets in Directory of Useful Decoys-Enhanced dataset. To facilitate accessibility for the academic community, our method is available as an open-source package.

 Non-Abelian geometric phases offer fault-tolerant unitary operations that are essential for holonomic quantum computation. While the “all-geometric” approach has successfully enabled robust control of atoms, ions, and electrons in various quantum systems, its photonic implementations have remained limited by a lack of tunability—an essential feature for modern classical or quantum optical information processing. Here, we demonstrate nonvolatile multilevel tunable generic special-orthogonal (SO) geometric phases on a multilayer silicon photonic platform incorporating the phase-change material (PCM) of Sb₂Se₃. By toggling Sb₂Se₃ between crystalline and amorphous states, we dynamically control the number of degenerate states involved in the holonomy, enabling switching between different holonomic paths and SO(m) geometric transformations. Our results bridge the key gap between robust geometric-phase control and in-memory reconfigurable photonics, establishing a paradigm for fault-tolerant, high-dimensional operations in integrated optical systems.

 Spintronics has emerged as a revolutionary frontier in the pursuit of faster, more energy-efficient, and technologically advanced electronics. However, the transmission distance of conventional ferromagnetic spin–orbit torque is typically limited to <10 nm, posing a critical challenge for spin current transport. Here we grow Mn3Sn films with a 30° canted magnetic octupole moment oriented out of plane, in which the Kagome spin structure is fully perpendicular to the film surface. By introducing a spin–orbital coupled amorphous Pt overlayer, we demonstrate the electrical switching dynamics of magnetic octupoles in Kagome antiferromagnetic Mn3Sn. Remarkably, perpendicular spin currents reverse Mn3Sn layers up to 60 nm thick. The switching efficiency of Mn3Sn/Pt bilayers increases with antiferromagnetic thickness, peaking near 40 nm before decreasing, reflecting a long spin diffusion length sustained by twin topological spin structures. Direct observation of magnetic octupole dynamics further validates the presence of such twin spin orders. Moreover, our theoretical analysis reveals that twin topological spin canting intrinsically supports ultralong-distance octupole switching. These findings establish antiferromagnetic Mn3Sn as a robust platform for efficient spin transport and highlight the pronounced long-range nature of spin-orbit torque enabled by twin spin order.

 The 2017 Pohang Mw 5.5 earthquake is currently the largest seismic event induced by Enhanced Geothermal Systems. The high uncertainty on geological and mechanical conditions of the rupture fault of this earthquake has originated a debate on its triggering mechanisms. Here, we propose a stochastic poromechanical analysis approach that combines Monte Carlo sampling and poromechanical models to address the uncertainty problem. By conducting a large number of coupled poromechanical simulations varying the uncertain geomechanical parameters, we yield an exceedance probability of 7%-15% for the Pohang mainshock. Remarkably, this physics-based stochastic prior forecast is quite comparable to the posterior likelihood inferred from the magnitude-frequency relationship of recorded seismicity. Our results reveal a scaling relationship between the earthquake magnitude and the initial fault stability, which indicates a threshold of the initial Coulomb Failure Stress to differentiate if faults are initially, critically stressed, and thus, the earthquake magnitude. This Pohang threshold is −0.2 to −0.1 MPa, about one order of magnitude larger than that proposed for natural earthquakes. This study highlights that the reactivation of critically stressed faults may trigger damaging earthquakes even for small poromechanical perturbations and opens a promising avenue for assessing the likelihood of induced earthquakes based on physical understanding.

 Land-to-water hydrological connections represent a key regulatory mechanism of carbon transport, controlling carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from lakes; however, as of yet, there is no assessment of its role at a pan-Arctic scale across large climatic and topographical gradients. We hypothesized that hydrologically well-connected lakes in wetter regions are CO2 sources fueled by stronger lateral fluxes of external carbon relative to drier regions. However, based on data from >200 Arctic lakes, we found that lakes in drier regions have higher and more variable annual CO2 emissions ($${37.0}_{6.2}^{146.0}$$ gC m-2 yr-1, $${{median}}_{Q1}^{Q3}$$) compared to lakes in wetter regions ($${8.0}_{1.7}^{17.3}$$ gC m-2 yr-1), with both the lowest and the highest fluxes recorded among dryland lakes. We hypothesize that with increasing wetness, the relative proportion of fluvial emissions increases, whereas in drier landscapes where lakes often have limited stream export, carbon inputs can be retained and more efficiently emitted from lakes. CO₂ emissions from Arctic lakes are higher and more variable in drier regions than in wetter ones, likely due to limited fluvial export that allows carbon to accumulate and be more efficiently emitted, based on the analysis of a pan-Arctic CO₂ dataset."

 High-resolution ocean observations and numerical simulations are increasingly in demand. However, conventional multi-source remote sensing wind products often struggle to capture the spatiotemporal consistency and dynamic variability required for mesoscale and submesoscale oceanic studies. This paper proposes an Optical Flow-based Temporal Displacement Correction (OF-TDC) method to improve the temporal alignment and mitigate structural misalignment in global multi-satellite wind fields (MSWF). The method treats satellite wind fields as sequential images while utilizing ERA5 winds as a dynamic reference. To ensure consistent input quality for this process, a robust bias correction scheme combining hierarchical Bayesian shrinkage and dual-reference LOESS smoothing is introduced. OF-TDC then estimates advection trajectories of MSWF over time and projects satellite wind fields observed at different times to a unified reference time to complete temporal registration. Evaluations show robust performance under moderate winds of 4 to 20 m/s and effective correction over medium to long timescales, with error standard deviation (STD) reductions of 1° in direction and 0.03 m/s in speed. Tropical cyclone analysis shows error STD improvements of up to 0.19 m/s and 2.24°, respectively, indicating that stronger, compact cyclones enable more accurate OF tracking. Validations against independent GNSS-R data and heavy rainfall confirm significant robustness. OF-TDC enhances MSWF temporal consistency, especially in structured, moderate-evolution environments, facilitating integrated wind and air-sea interaction studies."

 Southeast Asia exhibits strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity in aerosol loading due to mixed emission sources and monsoon–land–sea circulations, and its interannual variability is strongly modulated by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This study evaluates the applicability of the Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) aerosol products in Southeast Asia during 2015–2024 by integrating AERONET ground-based observations, MERRA-2 reanalysis data, and GHSL population grids within a cloud-based workflow. Hourly MERRA-2 AOD at 550 nm and Ångström exponent were validated against observations from 26 AERONET stations. The results show pronounced site-dependent performance, with stronger agreement over inland sites and degraded skill over coastal and marine-influenced environments. A segmented analysis further reveals a clear loading-dependent bias pattern: MERRA-2 shows a weak positive bias under clean conditions (AOD <0.2) but shifts to systematic underestimation as aerosol loading increases, reaching a pronounced negative bias under heavy loading (AOD >0.6), particularly at coastal stations. Component-resolved analyses indicate that organic carbon and sulfate are the dominant contributors to regional AOD, and ENSO-year contrasts show increased organic carbon contributions relative to normal years. Population-weighted AOD maps reveal persistent exposure hotspots over the Indochina Peninsula and major urbanized corridors, with peak exposure years aligned with El Niño episodes. A process-oriented assessment using regional fire density and precipitation time series further supports that El Niño periods are associated with enhanced fire activity and suppressed precipitation, providing a physically consistent interpretation for ENSO-related AOD anomalies in Southeast Asia."

 Global climate change is intensifying sea level rise (SLR) and sea surface temperature (SST) variability, placing low-lying coastal regions at increasing risk. This study evaluates historical (1993–2023) and future (2030–2089) trends in sea surface height (SSH) and SST along Oman's coast by combining satellite data, CMIP6 GCMs, and a novel hybrid downscaling approach capable of addressing non-stationarity biases, unlike Quantile Mapping (QM) alone. Historical analysis reveals significant trends, with SSH rising to 47.86 mm/decade and SST warming by 0.48 °C/decade, driven by steric expansion, monsoon dynamics, and regional heat fluxes. Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis identifies dominant variability modes linked to the Indian Ocean Dipole and ENSO. Among 15 CMIP6 models, HadGEM3-GC31-LL performs best in simulating SSH/SST and is selected for future projections under SSP126, SSP245, and SSP585 scenarios. For downscaling, a hybrid Quantile Mapping–Random Forest (QM + RF) model is introduced, demonstrating superior accuracy (NSE = 0.77–0.90) compared to standalone QM. Projections highlight stark spatial contrasts: under SSP126, mid-century SSH rebounds to +14.3 mm/decade after an initial decline, while SSP585 drives a relentless SST rise (0.85 °C/decade by 2089), exacerbating marine heatwaves. Coastal urban centers like Muscat and Salalah face compounded risks from SLR-induced inundation and ecosystem degradation, with northern Oman emerging as a warming hotspot. This study underscores the importance of integrating hybrid downscaling methods for regional climate adaptation and emphasizes the need for Oman to prioritize nature-based defenses and adaptive infrastructure in its National Adaptation Plan."
