Their price, size, and power consumption are lower than those of traditional OPCs. We tested the ability of the low-cost OPC-N3 from Alphasense to estimate dust emission flux during erosion events in Jordan. N3 estimated the dust flux well, with differences of less than 30 % compared to a traditional OPC. Our results confirm the potential of low-cost OPCs for dust erosion research. 
 The recent development of low-cost optical particle counters (OPCs) presents new opportunities for improving spatial coverage of particle concentration in the atmosphere as they are more affordable, compact, and energy efficient than traditional OPCs. In particular, these OPCs could improve our ability to quantify dust emissions in complex environments during aeolian soil erosion. The high-frequency sampling capacity (1 Hz) of some sensors may make them suitable for estimating dust emissions using the eddy-covariance method. Here, the capability of the low-cost OPC-N3 from Alphasense to estimate size-resolved dust flux using the eddy-covariance method is evaluated. During the Jordan Wind erosion And Dust Investigation (J-WADI) experiment, we tested one OPC-N3 against two traditional reference OPCs, the Promo and Fidas,  from Palas GmbH. The N3 and Promo OPCs were located in close proximity to a sonic anemometer, enabling the correlation of dust concentration and vertical velocity fluctuations for estimating dust fluxes. Despite the high-temperature and dusty wind conditions of the campaign, the N3 monitored the dynamics and magnitude of dust concentration with reasonable precision. The turbulence characteristics of the dust concentration fluctuations measured by the N3, including variance, skewness, kurtosis, and energy spectrum, were similar to those from the Promo. However, the N3 flow rate exhibited variations under these outdoor conditions that affected the concentration of fine dust particles, and certain particles around 1 µm appeared to be misclassified in the upper size bin. After correcting the N3 dust concentration to address these discrepancies and after calibrating it against a reference OPC, the N3 accurately estimated the dust emission flux, with differences of less than 30 % compared to the reference OPC. Our results confirm the potential of low-cost OPCs for dust erosion research. Nonetheless, further evaluation of low-cost OPCs is still needed across different environments and weather conditions."

Its data have improved weather forecasting, with Mie-cloudy winds proving to be especially precise. Challenges have emerged, such as unexpected misalignments in signal angles and reduced signal levels due to beam clipping and laser issues. Lessons from Aeolus highlight the need for better optical alignment and active control systems for future lidar missions. 
 This paper presents an extensive investigation of the signal fringe profile for the Fizeau interferometer used in the first spaceborne wind lidar Aeolus and considers the fundamental implications for the wind measurement accuracy in Aeolus and future systems. The early Aeolus design phase considered that the basic fringe would be made up of a Fizeau instrumental component of ≈100 MHz (full width at half maximum, FWHM), folded with the laser pulse spectral width of ≈50 MHz (FWHM), both of Lorentzian form. Fringe anomalies observed before the mission and related to surface defects in the interferometer plates triggered the development of wave-optic methods for analysis of the fringe formation. These methods, herein described in an instructional appendix, were subsequently found to be essential for rigorous modelling of complex fringes for different physical and optical arrangements. Initial signal returns from Aeolus suggested that the Fizeau fringe profile was in fact broadened with a large Gaussian component. The laser pulse was subsequently shown to have a profile close to Gaussian of ≈45 MHz (FWHM) and thus provided a partial contribution. However, detailed examination of experimental Aeolus fringes constructed from ground return signals showed a large Gaussian component up to ≈130 MHz (FWHM). Wave-optic modelling established that Fizeau “aperture broadening”, of this form and magnitude, would be generated for the input signal beam of 500 µrad field of view (FOV) set at a large angle of incidence (AOI) of 300 µrad. These findings have strong implications for fringe shift and wind measurement accuracy, as given in the quantum-limited Cramér–Rao expression and the paramount importance of minimizing line width. Extensive modelling and simulation for the broadened profiles calculated above shows good agreement with measured Aeolus global wind measurement accuracies and indicates that loss of signal could be due to beam clipping at the field stop for such a large AOI. It is established that optimization of the present Aeolus Fizeau parameters could lead to a factor of 2.5 improvement in wind measurement precision. Future upgrades of the Fizeau interferometer and the laser within reasonable parameters suggest the potential for an factor of 7.6 improvement on the in-orbit performance."

Tourian,Satellite Altimetry-based Extension of global-scale in situ river discharge Measurements (SAEM),"Our study addresses the need for better river discharge data, crucial for water management, by expanding global gauge networks with satellite data. We used satellite altimetry to estimate river discharge for over 8700 stations worldwide, filling gaps in existing records. Our data set, SAEM, supports a better understanding of water systems, helping to manage water resources more effectively, especially in regions with limited monitoring infrastructure. 
 River discharge is a crucial measurement, indicating the volume of water flowing through a river cross-section at any given time. However, the existing network of river discharge gauges faces significant issues, largely due to the declining number of active gauges and temporal gaps. Remote sensing, especially radar-based techniques, offers an effective means to this issue. This study introduces the Satellite Altimetry-based Extension of the global-scale in situ river discharge Measurements (SAEM) data set, which utilizes multiple satellite altimetry missions and estimates discharge using the existing worldwide networks of national and international gauges. In SAEM, we have explored 47 000 gauges and estimated height-based discharge for 8730 of them, which is approximately 3 times the number of gauges of the largest existing remote-sensing-based data set. These gauges cover approximately 88 % of the total gauged discharge volume. The height-based discharge estimates in SAEM demonstrate a median Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) of 0.48, outperforming current global data sets. In addition to the river discharge time series, the SAEM data set comprises three more products, each contributing a unique facet to better usage of our data. (1) A catalog of virtual stations (VSs) is defined by certain predefined criteria. In addition to each station's coordinates, this catalog provides information on satellite altimetry missions, distance to the discharge gauge, and relevant quality flags. (2) The altimetric water level time series of those VSs are included, for which we ultimately obtained good-quality discharge data. These water level time series are sourced from both existing Level-3 water level time series and newly generated ones within this study. The Level-3 data are gathered from pre-existing data sets, including Hydroweb.Next (formerly Hydroweb), the Database of Hydrological Time Series of Inland Waters (DAHITI), the Global River Radar Altimetry Time Series (GRRATS), and HydroSat. (3) SAEM's third product is rating curves for the defined VSs, which map water level values into discharge values, derived using a nonparametric stochastic quantile mapping function approach. The SAEM data set can be used to improve hydrological models, inform water resource management, and address nonlinear water-related challenges under climate change.

Using advanced data-cleaning and machine learning techniques, we filled gaps in sea level records caused by equipment outages and storms. Our results show faster sea level rise in this region than in global datasets, helping scientists better understand climate-related changes in coastal seas. 
 This study presents a comprehensive approach for reconstructing a high-quality, continuous monthly sea level time series at the Ieodo Ocean Research Station (IORS) from 1993 to 2023 using advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models. After applying quality control to the in-situ KIOST data, including inverse barometric effect correction, 3σ filtering, and a 75 % data coverage threshold, we validated trends using nearby PSMSL tide gauges and four ocean reanalysis datasets (CMEMS, GLORYS, ORAS5, HYCOM). The trend analysis showed a higher rate of sea level rise from in-situ data (4.94 mm/yr, Oct 2003–Dec 2023) compared to satellite and model-based estimates (e.g., CMEMS: 3.53 mm/yr, Jan 1993–Dec 2023), suggesting localized sea level rise in the East China Sea. Initial gap-filling used statistical models such as harmonic regression and regression-based climatology. A blended approach combining climatology and trend components achieved the best accuracy (RMSE ~0.056 m, R2 = 0.688). We then implemented various AI/ML models through an Iterative Imputer framework. Ensemble models (e.g., XGBoost) performed perfectly after 2003 but did not generalize well before 2004. Deep learning models like LSTM and GRU effectively captured seasonal and nonlinear patterns post-2003, with LSTM achieving RMSE = 0.023 m and R2 = 0.95. Time series models Prophet and SARIMA-SIN successfully reconstructed the full time series, with SARIMA-SIN estimating the highest trend (5.61 mm/yr). Multiple linear regression using reanalysis data served as a baseline, but AI/ML models outperformed it in both accuracy and generalization. This study provides a reproducible, interpretable, and physically consistent framework for reconstructing sea level variability in semi-enclosed coastal seas."

Shum;Michael Bevis;Xiaoxing He;Yu Zhang;Yihang Ding;Chaoyang Zhang;Jean-Philippe Montillet,Sea level reconstruction reveals improved separations of regional climate and trend patterns over the last seven decades,"Sea level rise is a major consequence of climate change, affecting the well-being of humankind. We combined long-term tide gauge records and satellite data to create a new global sea level record from 1950 to 2022. Our results reveal how natural climate patterns, including El Niño, La Niña, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, influence rapid present-day sea level change. The data product enhances understanding of climate–sea level interactions. 
 Rapidly rising sea level is one of the major adverse consequences of anthropogenic climate change. Sea level rise poses an existential threat to coastal populations, particularly for urban settlements with accelerating growth rates. Contemporary empirical sea level reconstructions have been used to conflate short-term (~3 decades) satellite altimetry geocentric sea level data and long-term (50 years or longer) tide gauge records to better estimate reliable sea level rise towards multi-decadal to centennial time scales. However, adequate separations and quantifications of low-frequency climate patterns and sea level trends globally at regional scales remain elusive. Here, we propose a new sea level reconstruction framework that incorporates Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) into the contemporary Cyclostationary EOF with Reduced Space Optimal Interpolation (CSEOF-OI) algorithm to better reconstruct sea level fields. Using 225 selected long-term gap-filled tide gauge records with vertical land motion adjusted and satellite altimetry, our global reconstructed monthly sea level time series, January 1950– January 2022, exhibit distinct delineations between modeled climate patterns and sea level trends at regional scales. The separated sea level patterns include trends, modulated annual cycles, the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The third principal component of the reconstructed sea level exhibits a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.87 with the Niño 3.4 ENSO index, and the fourth principal component correlates at 0.75 with the PDO index, indicating excellent agreement. The global mean sea level trend, accounting for the predominant climate periodicities, is 1.9 ± 0.2 mm yr⁻¹ (95 % confidence), and the estimate during the satellite altimetry era (January 1993–December 2021) is 3.2 ± 0.3 mm yr⁻¹ (95 % confidence). Compared with previous studies, we conclude that our 72-year sea-level reconstruction allows us to better separate the ENSO and PDO climate patterns, as well as the sea level they induced. Finally, we show that the short-term (5-year) rates of ENSO and PDO patterns significantly affect sea level both on a global and regional scale, altering global mean sea level trends by up to 1.1 ± 0.5 mm yr¹ (January 2011–January 2016). Over the past seven decades, the climate pattens exerted a minor impact on sea level trends, but substantially modulated apparent regional sea level accelerations, particularly in the western Pacific (e.g., 0.09 ± 0.05 mm yr⁻² at the Kuroshio Current), and in the east and central equatorial Pacific Ocean (e.g., −0.04 ± 0.03 mm yr⁻² near Costa Rica).

Amy,Nontargeted Analysis Reveals Organofluorine Pharmaceutical Compounds Responsible for Formation of Toxic Disinfection Byproducts in a Drinking Water Treatment Plant in China,"Toxic disinfection byproducts (DBPs) formed during chlorination are a significant concern for drinking water safety. These compounds were analyzed using nontargeted methods, and their chemical formulas and structures were determined through tandem mass spectrometry combined with a novel fragmental chain characterization (FCC) algorithm. This FCC algorithm significantly improved annotation rates, achieving a four-fold increase compared to traditional mass spectral matching strategies. Transformation linkages were identified between precursor compounds and DBPs, based on their shared fragmental chains. Using this advanced nontargeted analysis approach, we identified organofluorine precursors as key contributors to the formation of toxic DBPs in chlorinated water. These findings were validated using chemical standards, including fluoroquinolone antibiotics (e.g., enrofloxacin and difloxacin) and fluorosteroids (e.g., fluocinolone acetonide and triamcinolone). Fluoroquinolone-derived DBPs were found to be 2.5 times more toxic after chlorination, exceeding the 1.5 times overall toxicity increase observed in actual water samples. Fluorosteroids showed smaller toxicity increases (1.3–1.5 times), but their conversion rates in real water were 1.7–2.3 times higher than in laboratory conditions. This study highlights the role of organofluorine precursors in DBP formation and provides an innovative method to identify unknown DBPs, elucidate their formation pathways, and trace their sources, advancing water treatment safety."

Previous studies have demonstrated that a few milligrams per liter of powdered activated carbon (PAC) can dramatically accelerate this process, but catalytic efficiency varies widely across different PAC types. In this study, various chemical and physical modifications were applied to coal- and straw-based PAC to enhance their catalytic efficiency and identify the key characteristics decisively influencing catalysis. The results showed that chemical treatments with HNO3 or NaOH had no notable impact on the PAC-catalyzed Mn(II) oxidation. In contrast, physical modifications, steam-reactivation, and ultrasonication substantially enhanced PAC’s catalytic performance, increasing Mn(II) oxidation rates by 50–300%. Characterization revealed that alterations in surface functional groups, induced by chemical treatments, had no noticeable impact on the Mn(II) oxidation. Instead, enhancements in pore structure achieved through physical modifications remarkably accelerated the Mn(II) oxidation process. The specific surface area of PAC exhibited a strong positive correlation with both the Mn(II) oxidation and chlorine decay rates. Mn(II) oxidation by chlorine retained by PAC (not chlorine in water) demonstrated the occurrence of Mn(II) and chlorine reactions in PAC pores. The increased local concentrations of the reactants and confined catalysis in nanoscale pores were proposed to interpret the rapid Mn(II) oxidation."

Tang,Design Ultrathin Polyamide Membranes against Funnel Effect: A Novel Zone-of-Influence-Based Approach,"Ultrathin polyamide membranes have gained significant attention due to their potential to achieve high water permeance. Nevertheless, their water permeance is constrained by the substrate-induced funnel effect. For years, researchers have been investigating how substrates impact membrane water permeance. However, these studies generally rely on a trial-and-error approach to find the optimal substrate porosity, which is often time-consuming and offers limited insights. To establish a more intuitive framework for membrane design, we introduced a novel zone-of-influence (ZOI)-based approach for the first time. We first analyze the distinctively different funnel behaviors for thin and thick films through numerical simulations. Thin films, characterized by small ratios of film thickness over substrate pore size (i.e., aspect ratio θ ≤ 0.5), show a highly localized influence of substrate pores and present a more severe funnel effect than thick films with θ ≫ 1. This analysis leads to the concept of ZOI–a region of polyamide over a single substrate pore with water permeation efficiency exceeding a predefined threshold value. A linear relationship between ZOI and θ was observed, which enables an intuitive design to achieve a target water permeance by simply overlapping ZOIs of multiple pores, making it far more efficient than the traditional trial-and-error approach. We further developed an analytical model based on the superposition principle to unravel the fundamental structure-performance relationship between water permeation efficiency, aspect ratio and substrate porosity. This study provides convenient design tools for optimizing ultrathin membrane structure, offering critical guidance and deep insights for the advancement of high-performance membranes."

Here we track future glacier runoff through the hydrological system and estimate ∼95% directly reaches the ocean through the river systems for all emissions scenarios, while the remaining 5% is lost (consumed) via evapotranspiration or stored on land. Endorheic basins in High Mountain Asia account for 76%–82% of the glacier runoff that does not directly reach the ocean. The remaining 18%–24% is lost or stored in exorheic basins, including those with considerable anthropogenic water use like the Indus and Ganges. While the percentage of glacier runoff reaching the ocean differs between basins, the percentages are roughly constant over time for most basins."

Birkholzer,Hydromechanical Modeling of Fault Rupture in Geologic CO2 Sequestration: A Comparison of Two Failure Criteria,"The large‐scale implementation of geological carbon sequestration has raised concerns about potential fault activation and induced seismicity, which could compromise storage integrity and pose seismic risks. We theoretically compared two failure criteria, Mohr‐Coulomb (MC) and Modified Cam‐Clay criteria (MCC), to assess fault rupture during CO2 storage. Both criteria characterize fault behavior in a specific stress regime but differ in reducing the complexity of fault rupture to a few key mechanisms. Using a coupled hydromechanical model, we demonstrate that the choice of a failure criterion and the physics of fault weakening associated with these criteria strongly condition fault response to a given fluid injection. MC mainly relates rupture to friction, while MCC relates rupture to fault poro‐plasticity. Our findings highlight that the selection of a failure criterion, being inherently subjective, can significantly alter the predicted fault behavior during CO2 storage, thereby impacting the reliability of geomechanical risk assessments."

ARs are often accompanied with explosive extratropical cyclones (EECs) over oceans. This paper investigates the characteristics of 118 super ARs associated with EECs over the Northern Pacific Ocean. Nearly 78.0% of ARs are associated with strong or super EECs, indicating that stronger ARs may lead to more explosive development of EECs. The composite analyses of ARs suggest that the AR is typically located in southwest of the cyclone center, in front of the cold front, with mean value of AR top pressure of approximately 693.51 hPa. In addition, water vapor from low latitudes and that evaporating from the sea surface are two important water vapor sources for ARs.

We find that neural network‐based parameterizations, though predicting GW forcings from wind profiles with 99% accuracy, lead to unstable simulations when RFs are too small to capture non‐local dynamics. Additionally, we demonstrate that learning non‐local dynamics is crucial for the stability of a data‐driven spatiotemporal emulator of the zonal wind field.

Atlas,The Impacts of Gravity Waves and Wind Shear on the Lifecycle of Cirrus Clouds in the Tropical Tropopause Layer,"In this study, we use two‐dimensional simulations to investigate the impacts of wind shear and gravity wave temperature fluctuations on the lifecycle of thin cirrus clouds in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL). Initial conditions for the simulations are based on a case study from high‐altitude aircraft observations of a narrow layer of abundant small ice crystals just after a homogeneous freezing ice nucleation event. Analysis of high‐resolution radiosonde observations shows that the TTL is a region where strong wind shear (often 10–20×10−3 $20\times 1{0}^{-3}$ s−1 ${\mathrm{s}}^{-1}$) prevails. We find that the strong TTL wind shear alters the structure of TTL cirrus, accelerates the reduction in ice concentration, and shortens the cloud lifetimes. The typically thin laminar structure of the clouds indicated by lidar observations is likely a direct result of the strong wind shear in the TTL. Gravity‐wave temperature fluctuations further accelerate the reduction in ice concentration as the clouds evolve. The simulations show that TTL cirrus lifetimes decrease with decreasing initial ice concentration, decreasing initial supersaturation and increasing turbulent diffusivity. Based on simulations with observed TTL wind shear, wave properties, and initial cloud properties, we show that TTL cirrus lifetimes are typically less than 1 day. Clouds produced by heterogeneous nucleation, with lower initial ice concentration and supersaturation, will have even shorter lifetimes. Persistence of TTL cirrus for multiple days would require sustained upward vertical wind with an amplitude of at least ≃ $\simeq $0.2 cm s−1 ${\mathrm{s}}^{-1}$."

This study leverages a unique set of in situ aircraft observations from the NASA Convective Processes – Aerosols and Winds (CPEX‐AW) field campaign and a high‐resolution, fully coupled atmosphere‐wave‐ocean model simulation to examine the complexity of compound dry‐dusty air intrusions during the genesis of Tropical Storm (TS) Kate (2021).

We complement CPEX‐AW observations with atmospheric tracers from the high‐resolution coupled‐model simulation to better understand the origins and transport of these air masses and their impacts on TS Kate. Two distinct intrusions are observed: one within the precursor easterly wave and one during the Tropical Depression (TD) stage. Within the precursor wave, low‐θe ${\theta }_{e}$ marine air associated with subsidence within the subtropical high undercuts the SAL as both air masses are entrained along two pathways: (a) lateral entrainment following the wave‐relative inflow and (b) vertical entrainment downward into the boundary layer and subsequently upward within deep convection.

However, a key challenge lies in selecting appropriate tracers chemicals used to estimate contributions from different emission sources. Accurate tracer selection is crucial for improving source apportionment accuracy, yet it is often constrained by local emission inventories and may not fully capture rapid atmospheric chemical transformations introducing uncertainty in OVOC apportionment. This study presents a novel approach integrating eight different machine learning methods to identify optimal tracers for OVOCs during extreme summer temperatures (experimental group) and average spring temperatures (control group). Our results demonstrated notable differences in tracer effectiveness between these two groups. In the spring, toluene and carbon monoxide (CO) were identified as the most effective tracers for OVOCs with high and low reactivity, respectively. In the summer, acetylene or CO were better suited for moderate and low reactivity OVOCs. By incorporating machine learning for tracer selection, we significantly improved the accuracy of the photochemical age parameterization model. The machine learning outputs correlated well with the model's performance particularly in terms of fitting accuracy of OVOCs. However, extremely high temperatures during summer disrupted the usual patterns of OVOC production and removal, which led to inconsistencies in matching high reactivity OVOCs with their tracers. Future research involves collecting more data on OVOC behavior under high‐temperature conditions and applying Fourier transformation techniques. This will help in identifying characteristic patterns and improving the dynamic accuracy of our model."

As climate warming and sea ice decline continue, understanding how Arctic ARs evolve is essential. While studies suggest an increase in Arctic ARs and storms, a comprehensive understanding of their changing behavior, seasonal patterns, and sea ice impacts remains incomplete. This study investigates the changing dynamics of Arctic ARs in response to a warming climate, examining the drivers of these changes and their impact on sea ice. Using the Community Earth System Model, Version 2 (CESM2), we find CESM2 effectively simulates Arctic ARs compared to ERA5. To analyze ARs under different climate conditions, we apply three detection methods: using present climate thresholds, scaling thresholds with projected future moisture changes, and calculating unique thresholds for each decade. Our results show increased AR frequency and intensity in the future, with changes strongly influenced by the chosen AR definition. Depending on the method, we find that AR frequency increases range from 30%–50% up to 400%, or even show decreases in some regions. During fall and winter, the North Atlantic experiences increased AR frequency, while more intense ARs occur in the North Pacific during summer. We also explore the effects of future ARs on sea ice, finding a net increase in sea ice loss, particularly in winter and spring.

Modeling studies investigating the effects of INPs and/or CCN on deep convection typically retain a volume‐dependent raindrop freezing relation. The resulting neglect of aerosol accumulation in raindrops via drop collisions has likely produced unrealistic storm responses to INPs in past studies. To address this deficiency, a new immersion freezing algorithm was developed and embedded in a bulk microphysics scheme that freezes both cloud drops and raindrops using the same immersion freezing INP (IF‐INP) activity spectrum based on measurements. Multiple idealized simulations of a single case of deep convection observed during the Clouds, Aerosols, and Complex Terrain Interactions (CACTI) field campaign were conducted, with microphysical differences produced by independently altering IF‐INP temperature dependencies and CCN number concentrations from their observed values. Surface precipitation in all simulations resulted almost exclusively from riming graupel that melted upon descending to the surface. Rainfall and cold pools were substantially and systematically weakened with increased CCN due to decreased graupel riming rates but were relatively insensitive to variations in the magnitude and slope of IF‐INP spectra due to compensating depletion of supercooled liquid water. These compensating processes were a consequence of the accumulation of IF‐INPs in raindrops, encouraging caution in studying IF‐INP effects upon thunderstorms using traditional volume‐dependent drop freezing relationships."

Achieving this goal presents a challenge, especially given (a) adjustment costs, which penalize a swift transition away from fossil fuels owing to, for example, skilled labor scarcity, and (b) climate uncertainty that complicates the link between emissions reductions and global warming. This paper presents a modeling framework that explores optimal decarbonization investment strategies with adjustment costs and climate uncertainty. The findings show that climate uncertainty impacts investment in three ways: (a) the cost of policy increases, especially when adjustment costs are present; (b) abatement investment is front‐loaded relative to a scenario without uncertainty; and (c) the sectors with the largest changes in investment are those that are “hard‐to‐abate”, such as heavy industry and agriculture, each of which have high investment costs and annual emission rates. The longer learning about climate uncertainty is delayed, the more these impacts are amplified. Each of these effects can be traced back to the carbon price distribution inheriting a “heavy tail” when climate uncertainty is present.

 Friction is the central cause for about 1/3 of the primary energy dissipation, severely impacting the performance limits of micro and nanoscale mechanical devices. Especially in two-dimensional semiconductor devices, electronic friction energy dissipation becomes particularly pronounced. However, the dynamic mechanisms underlying electronic friction energy dissipation remain unclear due to the ultrafast timescales of electronic behavior. Here, the ultrafast dynamics of electronic friction energy dissipation in monolayer WS2 is observed using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. We find that friction exhibits a significant enhancement as the rate of electron energy dissipation increases. It is experimentally found to be closely related to the generation of atomic defects at the sliding interfaces. These defects capture electrons in picoseconds and provide a new energy dissipation channel, resulting in increased friction.

 Social touch is critical for communication to impart emotions and intentions. However, certain autistic individuals experience aversion to social touch. Here, we used Neuropixels probes to record neural responses to social vs. non-social interactions in somatosensory cortex, tail of striatum, and basolateral amygdala. We find that wild type mice show aversion to repeated presentations of an inanimate object but not of another mouse. Cortical neurons are modulated especially by touch context (social vs. object), while striatal neurons change their preference depending on whether mice could choose or not to interact. In contrast, Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice, a model of autism, find social and non-social interactions equally aversive, especially at close proximity, and their cortical/striatal neurons are less able to discriminate social valence. A linear model shows that the encoding of certain avoidance/aversive behaviors in cortical neuron activity differed between genotypes. Thus, a reduced capacity to represent social stimuli at the circuit level may underlie social avoidance in autism. Some autistic individuals experience aversion to social touch.

 Kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment for end-stage renal disease and is limited by donor organ availability. Normothermic Machine Perfusion (NMP) might facilitate safe transplantation of marginal organs. NKP1 is a single centre, phase 1, 36-patient, three-stage cohort study investigating the safety and feasibility of up to 24 hours of renal NMP prior to transplantation. 30-day graft survival (primary endpoint) was 100%. Secondary objectives were assessment of the effect of NMP on post-transplant clinical outcomes and ischaemia-reperfusion injury, identification of predictive biomarkers, and characterisation of the performance of the preservation system. Clinical outcomes were comparable to a matched control cohort with 12-month estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 46.3 vs 49.5 mL/min/1.73m2 (p = 0.44) despite much longer total preservation times (15.7 vs 8.9 hours controls, p < 0.0001). We saw strong correlations between biomarkers measured ex-situ and post-transplant outcomes, including graft function at one year (correlation between GST-Pi delta and 12-month eGFR, R = 0.54, p = 0.001). Renal NMP is useful for optimising logistics and as an organ assessment technique, and has potential to expand the donor pool. Trial registration number: ISRCTN13292277.

 Due to their importance in monitoring and modelling Earth's climate, the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) designates leaf area index (LAI) and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) as essential climate variables (ECVs). The Simplified Level 2 Biophysical Processor (SL2P) has proven particularly popular for decametric (i.e. 10 m to 100 m) retrieval of these ECVs. Comprehensive validation has shown that due to simplifying assumptions in the underlying radiative transfer models (RTMs), biases persist in SL2P retrievals. To avoid RTM assumptions altogether, an empirical data-driven approach might be considered. Yet, such a strategy has historically been prevented by the limited quantity and quality of available in situ reference measurements, as well as the large number of training samples traditionally required by machine learning regression algorithms. New opportunities are now offered by recently established continental-scale environmental monitoring networks, advances in automated data processing and uncertainty evaluation, and machine learning regression algorithms that require many fewer training samples. The Ground Reference Observations Underlying Novel Decametric Vegetation Data Products from Earth Observation (GROUNDED EO) project was initiated to take advantage of these opportunities. We describe the empirical data-driven LAI and FAPAR retrieval approach adopted within the project, involving i) generation of a database containing over 16,000 fiducial reference measurements covering 81 National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS), and Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) sites between 2013 and 2022, ii) development of an empirical data-driven algorithm for Sentinel-2 LAI and FAPAR retrieval based on Gaussian processes, and iii) evaluation of GROUNDED EO retrievals through intercomparison with the current state-of-the-art in decametric retrieval (i.e. SL2P, and a modified version of SL2P developed by the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing – SL2P-CCRS), as well as validation against unseen fiducial reference measurements. In the majority of cases (and despite not making use of ancillary data such as land cover), the empirical data-driven GROUNDED EO retrievals were subject to reduced bias than those from SL2P and SL2P-CCRS, as well as increased fulfilment of user requirements (i.e. 74% of LAI and 69% of FAPAR retrievals overall). Consequently, the approach has potential to reduce uncertainty in key inputs for climate monitoring and modelling, agricultural and forest management, and biodiversity assessment."

 Land surface temperature (LST) plays an important role in Earth energy balance and water/carbon cycle processes and is recognized as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) and an Essential Agricultural Variable (EAV). LST products that are issued from satellite observations mostly depict landscape-scale temperature due to their generally large footprint. This means that a pixel-based temperature integrates over various components, whereas temperature individual components are better suited for the purpose of evapotranspiration estimation, crop growth assessment, drought monitoring, etc. Thus, disentangling soil and vegetation temperatures is a real matter of concern. Moreover, most satellite-based LSTs are contaminated by directional effects due to the inherent anisotropy properties of most terrestrial targets. The characteristics of directional effects are closely linked to the properties of the target and controlled by the view and solar geometry. A singular angular signature is obtained in the hotspot geometry, i.e., when the sun, the satellite and the target are aligned. The hotspot phenomenon highlights the temperature differences between sunlit and shaded areas. However, due to the lack of adequate multi-angle observations and inaccurate portrayal or neglect of solar influence, the hotspot effect is often overlooked and has become a barrier for better inversion results at satellite scale. Therefore, hotspot effect needs to be better characterized, which here is achieved with a three-component model that distinguishes vegetation, sunlit and shaded soil temperature components and accounts for vegetation structure. Our work combines thermal infrared (TIR) observations from the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) onboard the LEO (Low Earth Orbit) Sentinel-3, and two sensors onboard GEO (geostationary) satellites, i.e. the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) and Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI). Based on inversion with a Bayesian method and prior information associated with component temperature differences as constrained, the findings include: 1) Satellite observations throughout East Asia around noon indicate that for every 10 degrees change in angular distance from the sun, LST will on average vary by 0.6 K; 2) As a better constraint, the hotspot effect can benefit from multi-angle TIR observations to improve the retrieval of LST components, thereby reducing the root mean squared error (RMSE) from approximately 3.5 K, 5.8 K, and 4.1 K to 2.8 K, 3.5 K, and 3.1 K, at DM, EVO and KAL sites, respectively; 3) Based on a dataset simulated with a three-dimensional radiative transfer model, a significant inversion error may result if the hotspot is ignored for an angular distance between the viewing and solar directions that is smaller than 30°. Overall, considering the hotspot effect has the potential to reduce inversion noise and to separate the temperature difference between sunlit and shaded areas in a pixel, paving the way for producing stable temperature component products."

 In spite of the efforts made for canopy water content (CWC) mapping in the community, including vegetation water proxy from microwave-based vegetation optical depth (VOD) as well as optical-based indices, there is still no operational CWC product from optical satellites up to now. To fill this gap, this study proposes a unified algorithm for CWC mapping at both decametric and coarse spatial resolution from several widely used optical satellites. Based on machine learning trained on radiative transfer model simulations, we comprehensively parameterized the distribution of the canopy and vegetation input variables (i.e., leaf traits and soil background) of the PROSAIL model, by relying on the largest open integrated global plant and soil spectral databases. We investigated the impact of diverse band combinations as well as the inclusion of optical indices for CWC estimation using RTMs. The performances of this algorithm were first evaluated at decametric resolution based on ground measurements distributed over five ground campaigns corresponding to diverse climate and biome types. The retrieved CWC from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 exhibits satisfactory performance, with coefficient R of 0.81 and RMSE of 0.046 g/cm2. We then evaluated CWC at 500 m resolution from MODIS by comparing it with Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 aggregated values over a globally distributed selection of LANDVAL sites, representative of the existing biome types combined with a range of precipitation, soil moisture and vegetation density conditions. The MODIS CWC global maps show reasonable seasonal and spatial patterns compared to multi-frequencies microwave-based VOD, and improvements compared to the conventionally and extensively used optical indices such as NDWI. The CWC product developed in this study is expected to provide new insights for global or regional vegetation water variations monitoring from optical satellites, with the strength of high spatial resolution compared to the microwave passive VOD (i.e., 20-500 m vs 22.5 km). These two products could be further combined for more accurate global vegetation water and biomass mapping in the future to improve our understanding of carbon uptake and hydrological applications."

 The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), the highest plateau in the world, plays an important role in climatic systems, making it a focus region for the monitoring of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). In this study, a ground-based portable Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer was used for atmospheric CO2 and CH4 column observations in Nyingchi (94.44°N, 29.46°E, 3128 m a.s.l.) from March 29 to May 1, 2021. The mean and standard deviation of the column-averaged dry air mole fraction of CO2 (XCO2) and CH4 (XCH4) were 415.58 ± 0.81 ppm and 1859.23 ± 8.41 ppb, respectively. Ground-based observations in Nyingchi were compared with simultaneous measurements at the Hefei site, revealing an average difference of 2.82 ± 0.97 ppm for XCO2 and 34.42 ± 7.64 ppb for XCH4. This difference is likely due to the fact that measurements in Nyingchi were less influenced by human activities than those in Hefei, which is geographically located within one of China's most densely populated and industrially intensive metropolitan areas. To identify CH4 sources and local emissions, the ratio of anomalous XCH4 (ΔXCH4) to XCO2 (ΔXCO2) was calculated for both Nyingchi and Hefei. The ΔXCH4/ΔXCO2 ratio was found to be 5.51 ± 0.11 and 3.93 ± 0.14 (ppb/ppm) in Nyingchi and Hefei, respectively. Compared to the Hefei site, the ΔXCH4/ΔXCO2 ratio in Nyingchi was higher than the corresponding value observed in eastern China, which is one of the most industrialized and polluted regions in the country. The calculated FLEXPART backward trajectories showed that the lower ratios of XCH4 and XCO2 in Nyingchi were influenced by anthropogenic emissions from northern India. However, the concentrations of XCH4 and XCO2, which were likely affected by conditions in northern India, were lower than the background results in Nyingchi, suggesting that surface sources, vertical convection within the boundary layer, and stratosphere-to-troposphere transport may have an influence on these values. Ground-based FTIR observations of XCO2 and XCH4 in Nyingchi, Tibet, provide insights into the background concentrations of these greenhouse gases and their variations in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau."

 To classify prevailing synoptic patterns on the Korean Peninsula during the seasonal PM2.5 management from 2015 to 2019, K-means clustering analysis was performed using 925 hPa geopotential height from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Final Analysis (FNL) data. Additionally, we analyzed synoptic patterns based on the PM2.5 pollution standards for each cluster to understand the differences in high and low PM2.5 concentrations under similar synoptic meteorological conditions. The synoptic patterns were classified into five types. Clusters (C1, C3, C4) with a west-high, east-low pressure distribution experienced worsened PM2.5 levels due to a reduction in the east-west pressure gradient. This weakening caused the northwesterly winds to slow down, leading to the accumulation of pollutants. Clusters (C2, C5) with a south-high, north-low pressure pattern were characterized by conditions of high PM2.5, when a high-pressure system over the southeastern region of the Korean Peninsula approached or receded from the Korean Peninsula, accompanied by a reduction in the pressure gradient.

 This study examines the mean annual cycles of monthly cumulated fog-water amounts (CFW) in the central Mediterranean Iberian Peninsula (MIP), highlighting the interplay between meteorological conditions, topography, and geographic location. Seasonal asymmetry in fog-water collection is evident, with summer exhibiting higher fog collection frequency but lower water volumes. In contrast, non-summer seasons feature lower frequency but higher intensity fog events.Tropospheric circulation anomalies at mid- and low-tropospheric levels reveal that fog-water collection is influenced by moisture transport from the Mediterranean, particularly during high fog-collection months. Positive specific humidity anomalies near coastal areas, driven by southeasterly wind anomalies, are crucial for frequent fog formation, while broader, less concentrated anomalies characterize higher-intensity fog events. These findings align with prior research emphasizing the role of cyclonic conditions and maritime moisture advection in enhancing fog-water collection yields.Additionally, seasonal variations in tropospheric circulation anomalies are linked to large-scale teleconnection patterns such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Arctic Oscillation (AO), and Eastern Atlantic-Western Russia (EAWR) patterns. These modulate moisture advection, precipitation anomalies, and low-level winds that drive fog formation and collection. In summer, subtropical high-pressure weakening contributes to increased fog-water cumulates, while winter anomalies highlight the impact of quasi-stationary cyclonic circulations and autumn anomalies, positive NAO/AO phases.These results underscore the climatic importance of fog-water collection for water resource management in drought-prone regions and provide a foundation for future climate monitoring and prediction under anthropogenic radiative forcing.

 Reliable and accurate estimation of large-scale evapotranspiration (ET) is fundamental for research in Earth System Science, however, large-scale ET estimation remains a challenge. Bias correction of the land surface model (LSM) simulated ET is a popular approach for providing large-scale, long-term estimations. Previous correction methods often ignore stochastic errors, making them unsuitable for complex conditions. Therefore, this study evaluated the performance of the Community Land Model 5.0 (CLM 5.0) in simulating ET based on the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) product and in situ observations across mainland China, analyzed the main factors influencing model performance, developed a time-variant bias correction strategy using the random forest (RF) method. Results show that precipitation is crucial in influencing the performance and uncertainty of CLM 5.0 simulations since it determines whether ET is limited by energy or water. The CLM 5.0 performed worse but with lower uncertainty in water-limited regions due to soil water stress, while it performed better but with higher uncertainty in energy-limited regions. Future research should focus on refining the depth limits of dry surface layer (DSL) parameterization to improve model performance in water-limited regions. Furthermore, the CLM 5.0 overestimated ET in the Northern China (NC) region but underestimated ET in the other seven regions. The overestimation is attributed to the model's overestimation of leaf area index and the underestimation of GLEAM data in farmland. After bias correction, the national average correlation coefficients (R) increased by 0.102, root mean square errors (RMSE) decreased by 0.178 mm/d, absolute mean bias (BIAS) values decreased by 0.006 mm/d, Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) values increased by 0.154, and uncertainty coefficients with 95 % confidence level (U95%) decreased by 0.195 mm/d. The performance of bias corrected simulations is significantly improved. The trends of both overestimation and underestimation of ET simulations by CLM 5.0 at a regional scale have also been alleviated. The time-invariant bias correction strategy proposed in this study demonstrates more reliable performance compared to the previous studies that applied monthly scaling factors. This advancement is essential for estimating more reliable large-scale ET under complex conditions."

 Severe thunderstorm gales are the predominant meteorological phenomena associated with convective storms. Accurately estimating the extreme wind speed of thunderstorm gales (ESTG) is crucial for both forecasting services and disaster investigations related to severe convective weather. This paper proposes a method for estimating the ESTG based on dual-polarization weather radar hydrometeors classification products (EESonHC). This method utilizes changes in hydrometeors, combines these changes with the atmospheric vertical momentum equation, and estimates the ESTG by approximating the average vertical acceleration of storm cells. Experimental tests were conducted using cases of thunderstorm gales in both strong and weak wind shear environments, demonstrating that this estimation method achieves an accuracy rate as high as 75 % for extreme thunderstorm gales exceeding 25 m/s, with an average error in estimated wind speed of approximately 0.5 m/s. The primary issues include: 1. When multiple storm cells are in close vicinity, accurately isolating the vertical motion acceleration pairs for each individual cell becomes challenging, thereby complicating wind speed estimation; 2. Overestimating ice-phase hydrometeors in HCL could lead to underestimating wind speed or make it impossible to estimate accurately."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108204,True,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文主要探讨了利用船载激光测高仪（ceilometer）遥感探测北极海洋雾的方法。论文提出了一种新的北极海洋雾检测算法，并利用2019年至2020年北极气候研究多学科漂流观测站（MOSAiC）的实测数据进行了验证。研究结果表明，该算法能够有效地检测北极海洋雾，并揭示了北极海洋雾的季节性变化规律、厚度分布以及与大气边界层的关系。虽然论文侧重于雾的探测而非传统的气体成分分析，但它利用了大气环境遥感技术（激光雷达的原理），并对大气边界层进行了研究，因此与大气环境遥感技术有较强的关联性。,"['Arctic marine fog', 'ceilometer', 'remote sensing', 'fog detection', 'atmospheric boundary layer', 'backscatter coefficient']",Jin Ye;Lei Liu;Yuan Shang;Jinfeng Ding;Hailing Xie,Remote sensing of Arctic marine fog using ship-based ceilometer,"•A novel Arctic marine fog detection algorithm is constructed using ship-based ceilometer. •The probability of Arctic marine fog occurrence exhibits seasonal cycle, and the duration of fog in summer is longest. •The fog thickness over the Arctic Ocean is less than 300 m, and its microphysical parameters exhibit seasonal cycles. 
 Arctic marine fog is a severe disastrous weather characterized by drastically reduced visibility, and its occurrence often poses great challenges to navigation and aviation. Accurate measurement of the characteristics of the Arctic marine fog plays a significant role in improving the accuracy of marine fog forecasts in the Arctic region. The Vaisala CL31 ceilometer, with its high sensitivity to liquid water content (LWC), is an effective means of detecting and obtaining the vertical structure of marine fog. In this work, a method to detect fog and retrieve fog thickness based on the ceilometer's backscatter coefficient profile has been proposed. The dataset collected at the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition from September 2019 to September 2020 is analyzed. Results indicate that compared with fog detection results of present weather detector (PWD22), the average deviation of marine fog occurrence probability of the proposed algorithm is within 5 %. Meanwhile, Arctic marine fog has obvious seasonal cycle, with the probability of high-concentration large-particle Arctic marine fog reaching up to 40 % in summer, accompanied by the thickness basically below 300 m. The distribution of marine fog thickness in summer is more concentrated and can last longer, with an average duration of about 6.24 h. In addition, there is an obvious correlation between the marine fog and the atmospheric boundary layer, with the correlation coefficient (CC) between the boundary layer height and the marine fog thickness being 0.7. However, the marine fog is generally shallower than boundary layer height in most cases."

However, the roles of auxin and the immune signaling factor, reactive oxygen species (ROS), in resistance to the brown planthopper (BPH), a notorious rice-specific piercing–sucking insect that causes severe yield losses, remain unclear. We revealed that moderate naphthalene acetic acid treatment activates rice resistance to BPH, BPH infestation induces ROS accumulation, and increase in ROS content promotes BPH resistance. Underlying these phenomena, the auxin receptors OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 positively, whereas the posttranscriptional regulator OsmiR393 negatively, regulate BPH resistance. Downstream of the OsmiR393/OsTIR1 module, through successive genetic function analysis of each gene, solid genetic relationship analysis, and various biochemical assays, we established an OsmiR393/OsTIR1-OsIAA10-OsARF12-OsRbohB genetic pathway that mediates BPH resistance, in which ROS are integral. Such cross-talk between auxin and ROS reveals the intricate signaling network underlying BPH resistance, which might assist with BPH resistance breeding."
