10.5194/acp-25-15567-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇研究论文主要探讨了气溶胶与云相互作用对地球辐射平衡的影响，并利用GiOcean全球再分析数据，结合卫星观测，评估了气溶胶对云微物理性质的影响。研究重点在于分析云滴数量和液态水路径的变化，以及气溶胶和气象因素在其中的作用。论文还提到了气溶胶对降水的抑制作用，并使用随机森林分析来确定影响云特性的主要因素。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是卫星观测在气溶胶和云特性研究中的应用。,"['aerosol-cloud interactions', 'satellite observations', 'cloud microphysics', 'aerosol effects on cloud properties', 'cloud droplet number', 'liquid water path', 'precipitation', 'radiative balance']",Ci Song;Daniel McCoy;Andrea Molod;Donifan Barahona;Travis Aerenson,Signatures of aerosol-cloud interactions in GiOcean:  a coupled global reanalysis with  two-moment cloud microphysics,"Uncertainty in how clouds respond to aerosols limits predictions of future warming. This study uses GiOcean, a global reanalysis with detailed cloud microphysics to represent aerosol–cloud interactions (ACI). We assess warm cloud responses by comparing variables important for ACI between GiOcean and satellite observations and further evaluate changes in cloud properties using a source–sink budget framework. 
 Aerosols influence the Earth's radiative balance through direct interactions with radiation and by affecting cloud properties. Anthropogenic aerosols have led to cooling during the industrial era through aerosol–cloud interactions (ACI), including aerosol effects on cloud microphysical properties and the subsequent adjustments.  However, large uncertainties remain in Earth system models (ESMs) regarding the magnitude of this cooling. In part, ESMs substantially disagree on cloud properties, thermodynamics, the hydrological cycle, and general circulation. Reanalysis provides a useful avenue for exploring the impact of ACI on clouds and radiation because its atmosphere is forced to match realistic conditions through the assimilation of observations. Here, we explore the impact of ACI on clouds in the GiOcean reanalysis – the first to incorporate aerosol-cloud interactions. We contrast variables important for ACI between GiOcean and satellite observations and develop 2-dimensional lookup tables of ACI for both using a source-sink budget perspective to attribute the changes in cloud droplet number (Nd) and liquid water path (LWP) to aerosol and meteorology. A compositing analysis using lookup tables shows that GiOcean captures key aspects of aerosol–cloud–precipitation interactions, including (1) activation of aerosol into cloud droplets, (2) effective precipitation scavenging of Nd, (3) suppression of precipitation by high Nd in regions with heavy aerosol emissions. In contrast, satellite observations do not exhibit clear patterns for processes (2) and (3). Random Forest analysis shows that interannual variability in Nd and LWP over the Northern Hemisphere ocean in GiOcean is primarily driven by precipitation, consistent with satellite observations."

Park;Mahmoudreza Momeni,Modeling on the drought stress impact on the summertime biogenic isoprene emissions in South Korea,"Isoprene, which is emitted from the vegetation, is important to regional air quality. Drought is one of the most important meteorological events that can modulate isoprene emissions by high temperature and low soil moisture. The drought stress impact on isoprene emissions is still uncertain, and we aimed to constrain it in South Korea using observation and model simulation. The results presented in this study may give useful information for future studies on drought stress on isoprene emissions. 
 Biogenic isoprene emissions play an important role in air quality so it is important to quantify their response to extreme events such as drought. This study aims at constraining drought stress on biogenic isoprene emissions in South Korea using satellite formaldehyde (HCHO) column, the key product of isoprene oxidation, and a chemistry transport model (GEOS-Chem) with Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature version 2.1 (MEGAN2.1). It was found that the HCHO column from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) increased by 5.4 % under the drought condition compared to the normal condition, but GEOS-Chem simulated a 20.23 % increase indicating an overestimation of isoprene emissions under drought. We implemented two existing drought stress algorithms in MEGAN2.1 and found they were not effective to reduce HCHO column biases in South Korea because those algorithms were proposed and developed for the Southeast United States (SE US). To improve this, we applied an iterative finite difference mass balance (IFDMB) method to estimate isoprene emissions using the OMI HCHO column. With this method, isoprene emissions were reduced by 60 % under the drought condition compared to those simulated by the standard MEGAN2.1 implemented in GEOS-Chem. The increase of HCHO column under the drought condition compared to the normal condition was also reduced to 10.71 %, which is comparable to that in the satellite retrievals. Based on isoprene emission difference between MEGAN2.1 and IFDMB, we developed the empirical equations to adjust isoprene emissions in South Korea that also improved model prediction of the secondary pollutant such as ozone."

Our results reveal that the commonly used biomass burning emission inventories significantly underestimate the fire emissions and emphasize the importance of the ground-based remote sensing data in reducing uncertainties in the estimated emissions. 
 We perform a global inverse modelling analysis to quantify biomass burning emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) from the extreme wildfires in Canada between May and September 2023. Using the GEOS-Chem model, we assimilated observations at 3 d temporal and 2° × 2.5° horizontal resolution from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) separately and then jointly with Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) measurements. We also evaluated prior emissions from the Quick Fire Emissions Dataset (QFED), Blended Global Biomass Burning Emissions Product eXtended (GBBEPx), Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS), and Canadian Forest Fire Emissions Prediction System (CFFEPS). The assimilation of TROPOMI-only measurements estimated posterior North America emissions for QFED, GBBEPx, GFAS, and CFFEPS of 110.4 ± 20, 112.8 ± 20, 127.2 ± 17, and 125.6 ± 18 Tg CO compared to prior estimates of 37.1, 42.7, 91.0, and 90.2 Tg CO, respectively. The joint assimilation of TROPOMI+TCCON reduced the posterior 1σ uncertainty on the North American emission estimates by up to about 30 %, while showing only a modest impact (<5 %) on the mean estimate of the inferred emissions. An evaluation against independent measurements reveals that adding TCCON data increases the correlations and slightly lowers the biases and standard deviations. Additionally, including an experimental TCCON product at East Trout Lake with higher surface sensitivity, we find better agreement of the assimilation results with nearby in situ tall tower and aircraft measurements. This highlights the potential importance of vertical sensitivity in these experimental data for constraining local surface emissions. Our results demonstrate the complementarity of the greater temporal coverage provided by TCCON with the spatial coverage of TROPOMI when these data are jointly assimilated."
10.5194/acp-25-15469-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注的是新型推进剂HFO-1234ze(E)在加压定量吸入器（pMDI）中的应用，以及其在大气中氧化后产生的副产物三氟乙酸（TFA）对环境的影响。论文通过大气模型和流域模型，预测了HFO-1234ze(E)排放后TFA的沉降速率，并评估了其在河流流域中的浓度水平，最终判断其对人类健康和环境的风险较低。虽然涉及大气成分，但主要侧重于特定化学物质的排放、转化和归趋，而非利用遥感技术进行大气环境监测，卫星观测或大气成分分析等。,"['trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)', 'HFO-1234ze(E)', 'atmospheric modeling', 'watershed modeling', 'pMDI emissions', 'air quality']",Shivendra G.

Papanastasiou;Paul Giffen;Holly Kimko;Megan Gibbs;Stefan Platz,Atmospheric and watershed modelling of trifluoroacetic acid from oxidation of HFO-1234ze(E) released by prospective pressurised metered-dose inhaler use in three major river basins,"This study indicates that using HFO‑1234ze(E) as a medical propellant in pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) reduces environmental impact compared with current propellants, and that associated trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) formation levels are predicted to be significantly below all reported safety thresholds. The results suggest this next‑generation propellant supports climate goals with its near‑zero global warming potential (GWP) and offers a sustainable substitute, helping ensure future pMDI supply for people with chronic respiratory diseases. 
 Trans-1,3,3,3-tetrafluoroprop-1-ene (HFO-1234ze(E); E-CF3CH=CHF) is a hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) with near-zero global warming potential, developed as a propellant for use in pressurised metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs). HFO-1234ze(E) contains a “–CF3” moiety, which makes formation of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) possible in the atmosphere. To quantify the contribution of TFA formed from prospective HFO-1234ze(E)-based pMDIs, we applied a global atmospheric model coupled with detailed watershed modelling. Our atmospheric model incorporates the master chemical mechanism for HFO-1234ze(E) and assumes pMDIs as its sole emission source. Based on global pMDI volume-sales data, we estimate HFO-1234ze(E) emissions at 4.736 Gg yr−1. Although emissions are higher in northern-temperate regions, our model predicts that the highest TFA deposition rates occur in the tropics, likely due to more intensive photolysis of trifluoroacetic aldehyde in temperate zones (favouring non-TFA products) and/or transport of TFA into the tropical zone from nearby regions. Using predicted TFA deposition rates around the Hudson, Cauvery, and Rhine river basins, we applied a fate-and-transport model to estimate TFA concentrations in surface water, soil, and sediments over 30 years. Modelled surface-water TFA levels ranged from 0.8 to 19.3 ng L−1 across the three watersheds, indicating substantial variability between regions. Comparison of Rhine results with the conservative Netherlands drinking-water thresholds (2200 ng L−1) yields a margin of exposure of approximately 700-to-2500-fold. These findings suggest that modelled TFA levels from continuous pMDI-related HFO-1234ze(E) emissions over the study period in the Rhine region are unlikely to pose a risk to human health or the environment."
10.5194/acp-25-15487-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注中国东部地区PM10和PM2.5的污染下降情况，并着重分析了城市和乡村地区PM污染变化的差异。研究采用了包括卫星观测数据在内的多种数据源，结合气象因素，通过机器学习方法来识别影响PM污染变化的关键驱动因素。研究结果表明，城市地区的PM污染下降速度快于乡村地区，且温度和年际变化是主要的驱动因素。此外，研究还强调了城市和乡村地区在PM污染控制策略上需要有所区分。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是卫星观测在空气质量监测和大气成分分析方面的应用。,"['particulate matter (PM)', 'PM10', 'PM2.5', 'satellite observations', 'air quality monitoring', 'urban-rural air pollution', 'meteorological factors', 'air pollution control strategies']",Zhihao Song;Bin Chen,Urban-rural patterns and driving factors of particulate matter pollution decrease in eastern China,"This study reveals that 2015–2023 particulate matter (PM) pollution in eastern China declined faster in urban than rural areas. Temperature and interannual variability were key drivers, with urban reductions concentrated in urban core zones and suburbs. The effect of interannual variability on PM decreased significantly, while other factors showed periodic fluctuations. 
 Understanding the urban-rural patterns and driving drivers behind the recent decrease in particulate matter (PM) pollution across eastern China is essential for assessing the efficacy of environmental policies and ensuring equitable health co-benefits. By employing an interpretable, end-to-end machine learning framework integrating satellite observations, meteorological factors, and auxiliary datasets, this study reveals changes in urban and rural PM pollution and the underlying drivers. During the period 2015–2023, the average decrease rates of PM10 and PM2.5 in eastern China were −4.02 ± 1.29 and −2.41 ± 0.91 µg m−3 yr−1, respectively. The rate of decrease in urban areas was higher than that in rural areas, which played a dominant role in PM reduction. Significant reductions in PM concentrations were observed in urban core areas, suburbs, towns and regions with high agricultural pressure. The interpretability analysis showed that temperature and interannual variability were the main drivers of PM pollution reduction. However, only interannual variability showed a significant decreasing trend in its effect on PM pollution, while other driving factors showed periodic variations. Furthermore, there were differences in the drivers of PM reduction between urban and rural areas, particularly with interannual variability in particular contributing to PM pollution reduction in urban areas, but having a lesser impact in most rural areas. This study reveals the urban-rural patterns of PM pollution reduction in eastern China, and highlights the need for differentiated air pollution control strategies in urban and rural areas."

Asa-Awuku,Hygroscopicity of isoprene-derived secondary organic aerosol mixture proxies: importance of diffusion and salting-in effects,"This study looks at how natural compounds when mixed with salts in the air affect how clouds form. These compounds come from plants and are found all over the world. They are sticky, and this changes how water droplets and clouds form. Sometimes the compound spreads more easily when mixed with salt, while the other compound does not change. Depending on the condition, these mixtures can behave differently, which affects how we predict cloud formation. 
 Isoprene-derived secondary organic aerosol (SOA) constituents, such as the 2-methyltetrols (2-MT) and 2-methyltetrol sulfates (2-MTS), have been readily detected in atmospheric aerosols (PM2.5) and within mixtures containing ammonium sulfate (AS). Despite its prevalence, the water uptake of 2-MT, 2-MTS, and their mixtures is not well understood. In this study, we determine the physicochemical properties (e.g., surface activity, diffusivity, phase morphology) of synthesized 2-MT and 2-MTS samples and their mixtures with AS. 2-MT and 2-MTS have been identified as surface active and viscous. Thus, dynamic surface tension (σs/a) measurements were taken to determine organic diffusion coefficients (Ds). The droplet growth of organic / AS mixtures was measured under subsaturated conditions using a humidified tandem differential mobility analyzer (H-TDMA) at 88.2 % RH ±1.5 %. Droplet activation was measured under supersaturated (>100 % RH) conditions using a cloud condensation nuclei counter (CCNC); supersaturation (SS) ranged from 0.3 %–1.4 %. Hygroscopicity in both regimes was parameterized by the single hygroscopicity parameter κ.This study demonstrates how diffusion and salting-in effects influence the water uptake of synthesized, isoprene-derived SOA mixtures. Results show that when mixed with AS, organic diffusion for 2-MTS / AS becomes an order of magnitude faster, while 2-MT diffusivity remains unchanged. Both 2-MT / AS and 2-MTS aerosols present a plateau in subsaturated κ values close to pure AS. However, under supersaturated conditions, 2-MTS / AS behaves ideally and well mixed and can be characterized by κ-Köhler theory. Isoprene-derived SOAs like 2-MT and 2-MTS samples are ubiquitous, and thus, the impact from biogenic sources and its non-ideal thermodynamic properties must be considered in aerosol–cloud interactions."
10.5194/acp-25-15593-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文关注农业氨排放的局部尺度反演，并以荷兰斯希蒙尼克岛为例进行了案例研究。论文利用地面测量数据和LOTOS-EUROS空气质量模型，结合高分辨率排放清单，通过贝叶斯反演方法评估了该岛牲畜数量减少后氨排放的变化。研究结果表明，反演方法能够捕捉到氨排放的减少趋势，并提出了改进排放监测网络的建议。虽然论文没有直接涉及卫星观测或遥感技术，但它与大气环境监测、大气成分分析以及空气质量模型的应用密切相关，因此可以认为与大气环境遥感技术有较强的关联性。,"['ammonia emissions', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'Bayesian inversion', 'emission reduction', 'LOTOS-EUROS air quality model', 'ground-based measurements']",Simeng Li;Enrico Dammers;Arjo Segers;Jan Willem Erisman,"Local-scale inversion of agricultural ammonia emissions: a case study on Schiermonnikoog, the Netherlands","Between 2019 and 2022, a notable reduction in livestock numbers has been observed on Schiermonnikoog, a small island in the north of the Netherlands. We have assessed ammonia emissions using real-world measurements on the island, demonstrated emission decrease, and proposed a network to improve emission monitoring. 
 Quantifying real-world emission reductions is a core goal of atmospheric inversion methods, yet direct validation against known events remains rare, especially for reactive species like ammonia. In this study, we have applied local-scale Bayesian inversions using ground-based measurements and the LOTOS-EUROS air quality model, with high-resolution emission inventories as prior input, not to explore a theoretical scenario, but to evaluate a documented emission reduction. On the island of Schiermonnikoog in the Netherlands, where GVE (grazing livestock units) decreased from 639 to 541, with a particularly notable reduction in dairy cattle, ammonia emissions are expected a 23 % reduction between 2019 and 2022. Our inversion captured a similar trend, estimating a 51 % decrease, which may be overestimated, largely attributed to uncertainties in the 2019 posterior emissions.  The posterior for 2022 shows consistency with the validation and indicates a 27 % reduction compared with the prior emissions of 2019. The associated uncertainty, derived from the posterior error covariance, highlights both the potential of the method and its limitations for policy verification. Moreover, we developed a method to assess the usefulness of individual observations and propose that adding a single high-quality continuous measurement in a strategically chosen location can significantly enhance the inversion performance. This strengthens the observational constraint and enhances the system’s ability to resolve temporal variations in emissions."

Groos;Nicolas Brand;Murat Bronz;Andreas Philipp,Atmospheric sounding of the boundary layer over alpine glaciers using fixed-wing UAVs,"We have developed a low-cost, lightweight, and open-source fixed-wing drone to study vertical changes in air temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, wind direction and turbulence in the atmospheric boundary layer over mountain glaciers. The results of four measurement campaigns on a glacier in the Swiss Alps demonstrate the potential of the new measurement technique and reveal characteristic insights into glacier-atmosphere interactions and the mountain-valley wind circulation. 
 Glaciers are an integral part of the high mountain environment and interact with the overlying atmosphere and surrounding terrain in a complex and dynamic manner. The energy exchange between the glacier surface and the overlying atmosphere controls ice melt rates and promotes a characteristic microclimate, including the formation of a low-level katabatic jet that interacts with other, often thermally driven winds in alpine terrain. Information on the local circulation and structure of the atmospheric boundary layer over glaciers is crucial for studying cryosphere-atmosphere interactions and for investigating the characteristics of the katabatic wind, its broader cooling effect, and its susceptibility to be disrupted by strong valley or synoptic winds that promote heat advection from the ice- and snow-free periphery towards the glacier. While the number of ground-based measurements from weather stations and meteorological towers installed on glaciers for boundary layer research has increased in recent years, a lightweight and mobile measurement technique for atmospheric sounding over alpine glaciers has not yet been available. Here we describe a new measurement technique based on a low-cost and open-source fixed-wing UAV, which allows sounding the atmospheric boundary layer over glaciers up to several hundred metres above the surface. In the frame of a feasibility study in 2021, two half-day (16 June, 23 September) and two 24 h campaigns (9/10 July, 25/26 August), including nocturnal soundings, were performed, demonstrating the UAV's capability to reach heights of up to 800 m above the glacier surface. From these campaigns, 40 profiles of air temperature, specific humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and turbulence were derived. The results highlight characteristic features of the glacier boundary layer, including a persistent surface-based inversion, a cool and dry katabatic wind confined to the lowest 50 m a.g.l., an overlying shear layer, and a warmer, often more humid valley wind above 100–200 m a.g.l. These observations illustrate how the boundary layer responds to synoptic forcing and local winds and demonstrate the potential of UAV-based atmospheric soundings for advancing glacier meteorology in complex alpine terrain."

Major contributions to the budget arise from the correction of the analog non-linearity, the black body characterization, the scan mirror reflectivity and the background radiance instability. The estimated uncertainty remains relatively stable throughout the lifetime of the instruments. 
 The Infrared Atmospheric Sounder Interferometer (IASI) is a Fourier Transform Spectrometer onboard the Eumetsat MetOp (Meteorological Operational) polar orbit satellite series. The three MetOp satellites (A, B, and C) were launched in October 2006, September 2012 and November 2018, respectively. IASI-B and IASI-C are still operational, while IASI-A was decommissioned in November 2021. IASI's mission is to provide accurate atmospheric spectra primarily for meteorological and climate applications, and as such a high measurement precision is required. Furthermore, the estimation of the measurement uncertainty is a valuable element, especially concerning climate studies and the establishment of long climate series. This study presents the global radiometric uncertainty budget as estimated for the IASI instruments. Four major contributors, the correction of the analog non-linearity, the black body characterization, the scan mirror reflectivity, and the background radiance instability, have been identified and their impact is presented alongside other minor contributors. For black body or earth view scenes under investigation, the global budget was found to be lower than 0.2 K for a reference temperature of 280 K, when all uncertainties were considered fully correlated. These estimates are expected to remain relatively stable throughout the instrument lifetime."

Bishop,"A detailed streamflow and groundwater salinity dataset for Muttama Creek Catchment, NSW, Australia","A detailed water quality dataset for a 1000 km2 catchment in New South Wales, Australia is presented. The water quality data for surface and groundwater was collected over 14 years and contains more than 1000 records. Despite missing values and different sampling methods and groups, the data provides a consistent overview of the hydrogeochemistry of the catchment. This dataset is valuable for global modelling studies as well as better understanding of local dryland salinity and water quality processes. 
 Dryland salinity remains a major global natural resource management concern, and which is amplified in Australia. However, limited detailed space-time data sets with observations of stream and groundwater salinity has constrained a deep understanding of the range of processes that can lead to dryland salinity problems in landscapes. The aim of this study is to report on the open dataset (https://doi.org/10.25910/m0wp-8890, Vervoort et al., 2025) resulting from a 14 year data collection effort in a subcatchment of the Murrumbidgee catchment in New South Wales, Australia. Over a 14 year period a series of different sampling campaigns has resulted in a large dataset with hydrogeochemical data which includes both in-situ (field) data and post laboratory analysis of major anions and cations. This data is augmented with observed groundwater levels and publicly available streamflow and climate data (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/BEUWK, Vervoort and Akter, 2024). The data set covers 23 groundwater sample sites and 39 surface water sites. Because the data was collected by four distinct groups and over many years, we investigate whether this has caused a bias in the dataset. In addition, we show the major spatial and temporal trends to provide an overview of the dataset. The dataset is made open access to encourage further research and the current paper shows the richness of the collected data and opportunities for further research."

 As potent greenhouse gases with high global warming potentials, fluorinated gases (F-gases) have emerged as significant contributors to global radiative forcing. Owing to minimal anthropogenic influences, Antarctica provides an exceptional natural environment for investigating background atmospheric F-gas concentrations.

The datasets are publicly available at the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center at https://doi.org/10.11888/Atmos.tpdc.302283 (Tian et al., 2025). The concentrations of most F-gases significantly increased throughout 2021 at ZOS. The concentrations of F-gases in East Antarctica were greater than those in the Antarctic Peninsula and the interior on the basis of data comparisons with three other Antarctic stations. Back trajectory and clustering analyses using the HYSPLIT model revealed that the contributions of different trajectory clusters were nearly identical at each station.  Source apportionment analysis via the PMF model identified industrial processes, refrigeration, fire suppression, and electronics as key contributors to F-gas concentrations in the Antarctic atmosphere. While the one-year observation period precludes long-term trend assessment, these high-frequency measurements capture the baseline variability critical for detecting future anomalies. Continuous multiyear monitoring at ZOS is necessary to establish statistically robust growth rates."

Due to scarce snow data in remote areas, this project involved local communities in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan to measure snow depth using simple tools and share results via Telegram. This community data improved satellite snow observations, enhancing water forecasts. Local involvement enhances accuracy and supports better water management in this challenging region. 
 Central Asia is a landlocked region with its freshwater resources originating in the mountains of Pamir, Tianshan, and Hindukush. Water resources in this area are formed mainly due to seasonal snowmelt, with glacier melt being the second largest hydrological component contributing to river flow, primarily in late summer. Water resources are shared among all Central Asian countries and used mainly for agricultural production purposes as well as hydropower generation. Proper management of water resources requires an accurate assessment of water availability originating in the mountains, mainly due to snowmelt. This requires data on snow depth, which is limited in the region. Snow surveys that were initiated during the 1980s have not continued in many parts of the region. The limitation of data on snow depth observations creates a challenge in forecasting water availability with the required accuracy."
10.5194/essd-2025-649,False,Earth System Science Data Discussions,该论文主要关注青藏高原湖泊范围的月度变化数据集的构建，使用MODIS数据和Google Earth Engine，通过随机森林分类器提取湖泊边界，并分析了2000-2024年间湖泊面积的变化趋势。研究重点在于湖泊水文特征、气候变化影响以及生态系统管理，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测大气成分等）关联不大。,"['MODIS', 'lake extent', 'Tibetan Plateau', 'hydrology', 'climate change']",Siyu Zhao;Xiang Zhao;Jiacheng Zhao;Xin Zhang;Xingyu Liu;Chengzhi Yao,TPLake-MED: A Monthly Extent Dataset for Lakes on the Tibetan Plateau,"We constructed a monthly vector boundary dataset (2000–2024) for lakes ≥10 km² on the Tibetan Plateau using Google Earth Engine and MODIS data. A spectral-index random forest (93.21 % accuracy) and post-processing enhanced boundary precision. The dataset (TPLake-MED) shows steady lake expansion (~ 34.91 km² per year) with peak area in September/October. Monthly changes are more significant in the west, and smaller lakes are more sensitive, offering insights for climate and ecosystem management. 
 Lakes on the Tibetan Plateau have expanded markedly over recent decades, reflecting complex interactions between the regional water cycle and the cryosphere. Whereas annual datasets capture long-term trends, they often overlook short-term hydrological responses and seasonal transitions that are resolved by monthly observations. Consequently, a systematic understanding of intra-annual lake variability remains limited, largely because most existing datasets are designed for interannual scales, which makes monthly variations and seasonal patterns difficult to characterise. These limitations hinder investigations into the driving mechanisms and complicate assessments of climate-change impacts. To address this gap, we utilised Google Earth Engine (GEE) and the MODIS Surface Reflectance product MOD09A1 (500 m) to construct a monthly vector boundary dataset for lakes larger than 10 km2 across the Tibetan Plateau for 2000–2024. Within this dataset, the number of large lakes larger than 50 km2 ranged from 142 to 175, and the number of smaller lakes (10–50 km2) varies between 232 and 260 across the study period. A random forest classifier based on spectral indices was developed and validated with 533 balanced water/non-water samples, achieving an overall accuracy of 93.21 % and an F1 score of 0.927. To enhance spatial precision, we implemented a boundary optimisation workflow integrating filtering, morphological operations, and geometric rectification, thereby improving agreement between extracted and actual lake extents. Aggregate lake area on the Plateau increased at 34.91 km2 per year, and typically reached its annual maximum in September or October. The relative monthly rate of area change showed higher values in the west, lower in the east, and stronger variability centrally; for individual lakes the maximum monthly relative change reached 28.43 % from 2000 to 2024. In addition, smaller lakes were more sensitive to environmental change than larger lakes. To our knowledge, this is the first monthly resolution vector dataset of Tibetan Plateau lakes that couples multi-temporal classification with morphological optimisation. The dataset provides critical support for climate-change research, ecological conservation, and policy formulation, and is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.12443/BNU.RSEC.TPLake-MED20251028."

These storms, called Polar Mesoscale Cyclones (PMCs), sometimes cause extreme winds and waves, threatening marine operations. IMPMCT combines remote sensing measurements and reanalysis data to construct a comprehensive PMCs archive. It includes 1110 PMCs tracks, 16 001 cloud patterns, and 4472 wind records, providing fundamental data for advancing our understanding of their development mechanisms. 
 Polar Mesoscale Cyclones (PMCs), particularly their intense subset known as Polar Lows (PLs), characterized by short lifespans of 3–36 h and horizontal scales below 1000 km, pose significant hazards to polar maritime activities due to extreme winds exceeding 15 m s−1 and wave heights surpassing 11 m. These intense weather systems play a critical role in modulating sea-ice dynamics and ocean-atmosphere heat exchange. However, current understanding remains constrained by sparse observational records and an overreliance on single data sources (e.g., remote sensing or reanalysis). To address these gaps, this study presents the Integrated Multi-source Polar Mesoscale Cyclone Tracks (IMPMCT) dataset, a comprehensive 24-year (2001–2024) record of wintertime (November–April) PMCs for the Nordic Seas. The IMPMCT dataset was created by combining vortex-tracking algorithms applied to ERA5 reanalysis data with a deep learning-based method for detecting cyclonic cloud features in Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) infrared imagery. It also incorporates near-surface wind data from Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) and Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) measurements. The dataset contains 1110 vortex tracks, 16 001 cyclonic cloud features including length, width, position and morphological characteristics (spiral/comma shape), and 4472 wind speed records (wind vector imagery and cyclone maximum winds). Corresponding ERA5-derived hourly vortex tracks are also provided, including 850 hPa vorticity and proximate sea-level pressure minima. Validation demonstrates statistical agreement with existing PLs track datasets while providing more complete cyclone life cycle trajectories, more intuitive cloud imagery visualization, and a richer set of parameters compared to previous datasets. As the most comprehensive PMCs archive for the Nordic Seas, the IMPMCT dataset provides fundamental data for advancing our understanding of the genesis and intensification mechanisms, enables the development of enhanced monitoring and early warning systems, supports the validation and refinement of polar numerical weather prediction models, and facilitates improved risk assessment and safety protocols for maritime operations. The dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17142448 (Fang and Ding, 2025)."

Compared to an instantaneous dispersion approach, the plume approach estimates 15 % lower aviation aerosol number concentrations, due to more efficient coagulation at plume scale. The model is sensitive to background conditions and initialization parameters, such as ice crystal number concentration and fuel sulfur content. 
 Aviation emissions of aerosol particles and aerosol precursor gases alter the Earth's radiation budget via both direct and indirect aerosol effects, resulting in a significant climate effect. Current estimates of aviation-induced climate effects are based on coarse-resolution global aerosol-climate models, which are not able to resolve the microphysical processes at the aircraft plume scale. This results in large uncertainties in the aviation-induced impact on aerosol number and size, which are key quantities for estimating the aerosol indirect effect, especially for low-level liquid-phase clouds. In this work, a double-box aircraft exhaust plume model is developed to explicitly simulate the aerosol microphysics inside a dispersing aircraft exhaust plume, together with a simplified representation of the vortex regime (which begins ∼ 10 s after the aircraft emissions and captures the dynamics of aerosol particle interactions with contrail ice particles). The aircraft exhaust plume model is used to quantify the aviation-induced aerosol number concentration at the end of the dispersion regime (∼46 h) and the results are compared with the result obtained by the instantaneous dispersion approach commonly applied by the global models. The difference between the plume approach (simulated using two boxes) and the instantaneous dispersion approach (simulated by a single box) is defined as the plume correction: for typical cruise conditions over the North Atlantic and typical aviation emission parameters, the plume correction for aviation-induced particle number concentration ranges between −15 % and −4.2 %, depending on the presence or absence of the contrail ice in the vortex regime, respectively. A tendency-based process analysis shows that the negative value of the plume correction is due to the higher efficiency of coagulation and nucleation processes in the plume approach, leading to lower total particle number concentrations compared to the instantaneous dispersion approach. Sensitivity studies over different regions highlight the role of background conditions for the plume microphysics, with the plume correction varying between −12 % for Europe and −42 % for China in a scenario with contrail ice in the vortex regime. Parametric studies performed on various aviation emission parameters used to initialise the plume model demonstrate the high relevance of contrail ice in the vortex regime to considerably reduce the aviation-induced aerosol number concentration in the plume approach. Moreover, the parametric studies show a large sensitivity towards aviation fuel sulfur content, driving sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions and the sulfuric acid (H2SO4) formation, which in turn is a primary driver for the nucleation process. Thanks to its flexible configuration and minor additional computational costs, the plume model presented here can readily be applied in coarse-resolution global aerosol-climate models or used as offline parametrisation to quantify the climate effects of aviation-induced aerosol particles."

This paper, detailing the software system, and a companion paper, detailing the chemical basis, represent the first complete documentation of MechGen. This paper includes examples and instructions for generating explicit and reduced mechanisms. 
 MechGen is a software system designed to derive gas-phase reaction mechanisms for reactive organic compounds under atmospherically relevant conditions for use in chemical models and for data analysis and interpretation. It has been used to derive versions of the SAPRC mechanisms used in airshed models, with SAPRC-22 being the most recent. MechGen derives fully explicit mechanisms for many types of organic compounds and their oxidation products when they react in the atmosphere in the presence of oxides of nitrogen and other pollutants and then uses these explicit mechanisms to derive reduced or lumped mechanisms more suitable for use in airshed models. This paper gives an overview of the system, describes the procedures it uses to generate explicit and reduced mechanisms, and presents several types of applications. The assignments and estimates used to derive individual chemical reactions and assign rate constants are discussed in a separate companion paper. The system is publicly accessible for generating explicit mechanisms for single compounds and viewing associated documentation using a web-based interface. A separate terminal login is available for deriving mechanisms for multiple compounds, multi-generation mechanisms, and portions of lumped mechanisms for airshed models, as well as for system programming and management. MechGen is designed to accommodate updates to the chemical estimates and assignments that it uses to reflect our evolving knowledge of and ability to estimate atmospheric reactions of organic compounds."

 Nitrite is a key intermediate in both aerobic and anaerobic nitrogen-cycling pathways. Although it rarely accumulates in the ocean, nitrite reaches micromolar concentrations in anoxic zones for reasons that remain unclear. Microorganisms are responsible for the production and consumption of nitrite, and their interactions are fuelled by the dynamic supply of organic substrates to anoxic waters. Here we use a mechanistic ecosystem model to study the microbial community response to such variations in the supply of organic matter over time. Our results demonstrate that nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, despite consuming nitrite, contribute to this accumulation through interactions with other microorganisms, mainly denitrifiers. Aerobic nitrite-oxidizing bacteria capitalize on the nitrite produced by nitrate-reducing denitrifiers, outcompeting and suppressing nitrite-reducing denitrifiers. Oxygen limits nitrite-oxidizing bacteria before all the nitrite is consumed, leading to nitrite accumulation. In an eddy-resolving, three-dimensional model, this shift in microbial activity in time manifests as shifts in both time and space, closely matching observed depth profiles of nitrite, its fluxes and the abundance of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria. These results reveal a mechanism driving nitrite accumulation, which maintains the standing stock of bioavailable nitrogen in anoxic zones, demonstrating that microbial interactions within fine-scale ocean currents dictate the fate of nitrogen.

 While cascaded second-order nonlinear processes have revolutionized shorter-wavelength light generation through up-conversion, their potential for longer-wavelength emission via parametric down-conversion remains fundamentally unexplored – constrained by narrow phase-matching bandwidths, insufficient parametric gain and stringent requirements on complex poling. Here, we break this paradigm through a reverse-polarization dual-layer lithium niobate nanophotonic waveguide that achieves broadband phase matching and record 15.3% conversion efficiency for mid-infrared (MIR) generation. Pumped at 1.03 μm, the cascaded optical parametric generation and difference frequency generation processes produce dynamically tunable MIR emissions spanning 2.06–3.09 μm – a relative bandwidth of 40%. By strategically engineering dispersion characteristics, we further extend the versatility of this platform: pumping at telecommunications-compatible wavelengths (1.3–1.6 μm) generates discrete MIR lines at 3.59, 3.93, 4.31, and 4.6 μm, penetrating the crucial molecular fingerprint region. This work not only establishes cascaded down-conversion as a viable strategy for efficient long-wavelength generation but also provides a blueprint for designing reconfigurable nonlinear photonic systems, with transformative implications for spectroscopy, sensing, and wavelength-division multiplexing technologies.

 Block copolymer (BCP) self-assembly – neat, or in a homopolymer/second BCP containing molecular blend – enables complex nanostructures including spherical micelles, co-continuous cubic gyroids and Frank-Kasper phases. Emergent properties in metallic and high entropy alloys inspire a paradigm shift: treating chemically distinct BCP micelles as functional building blocks to pave a path for multicomponent assemblies with molecularly engineered property profiles. Slowing current progress are challenges associated with the structural characterization of such BCP assemblies with poor atomic contrast.

This, combined with machine-learning assisted image segmentation, allows component classification via routine scanning electron microscopy. Results are supported by mechanistic insights from Voronoi analysis, cluster analysis and Monte Carlo/Brownian Dynamics simulations, revealing rich and controllable non-equilibrium surface structural behavior.

 Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) remains one of the most critical challenges in drug development, causing patient safety concerns, clinical trial failures and drug withdrawals. We introduce ToxPredictor, a toxicogenomics framework combining RNA-seq data from primary human hepatocytes with pharmacokinetic data to predict dose-resolved DILI risks and safety margins. At its core is DILImap, an RNA-seq library tailored for DILI research, comprising 300 compounds at multiple concentrations.

It flagged recent phase III clinical failures, including Evobrutinib, TAK-875, and BMS-986142, overlooked by animal studies. Beyond prediction, ToxPredictor provides mechanistic insights into hepatotoxic pathways, enabling early de-risking and actionable safety decisions. Unlike single-endpoint readouts—even from 3D models—transcriptomics offers a multi-dimensional system-level view of hepatocyte responses, capable of detecting diverse DILI mechanisms not captured by conventional assays.

 Most chromophores exhibit an aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect, resulting in minimal or weak emission when incorporated into covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Consequently, the development of luminescent COFs, particularly those utilizing ACQ chromophores, presents both a compelling and formidable challenge. Herein, we report the construction of highly emissive ACQ chromophore-based COFs by an energy level matching strategy. This approach effectively modulates the electronic structures within the COFs, thereby suppressing intralayer charge transfer to ACQ chromophores, such as the imine linkage and dibenzo[g,p]chrysene unit, while simultaneously inhibiting interlayer charge transfer and non-radiative decay pathways. As a result, the undesired ACQ effect is mitigated, enabling the realization of highly emissive COFs. Notably, COF-BT-PhDBC demonstrates high brightness with a solid-state photoluminescence quantum yield of 14.7%, standing among the best ACQ chromophore-based COFs. Furthermore, COF-BT-PhDBC has been successfully utilized for in vivo three-photon fluorescence imaging of murine brain vasculature, achieving an impressive imaging depth of approximately 800 µm.

Here, the authors identify a role for DNAJA2 in regulating insulin signaling and glucose metabolism, loss of which causes insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes phenotypes. 
 Dysregulation of heat shock protein DNAJA2 induces genomic instability and was consequently hypothesized to promote tumorigenesis. However, DNAJA2 knockout mice do not develop cancer but exhibit neonatal lethality and the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that DNAJA2 maintains homeostatic glucose metabolism by regulating insulin signaling. Mechanistically, DNAJA2 binds to the insulin receptor (IR) and prevents adaptor protein 2 (AP2)-mediated spontaneous IR endocytosis by inhibiting the IR-AP2 interaction. Thus, DNAJA2 defects lead to reduced IR localization on the plasma membrane and suppression of the insulin-stimulated signaling cascade, thereby inhibiting glycogen synthesis and storage in the liver during embryogenesis, further resulting in neonatal lethality of DNAJA2-deficient mice. Analysis of public datasets reveals a strong association between DNAJA2 and metabolic phenotypes, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity, in both humans and mice. In conclusion, our study elucidates the mechanism by which DNAJA2 regulates IR endocytosis, insulin signaling and glucose metabolism, shedding light on the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders.

 We present a potentially eco-friendly, cost-efficient strategy for synthesizing high-purity Li2S, a key precursor for sulfide-based solid electrolytes. While these electrolytes surpass conventional organic counterparts in both safety and performance, their widespread application is hindered by the high cost of Li2S. Here, a solvent-free metathesis route is developed, in which thiourea serves as an S2⁻ donor to sulfurize LiOH, enabling scalable Li2S production (∼100 g per batch) with significantly reduced projected costs. During the process, intermediates (H2NCN, H2O) are transformed into benign gases (CO2, NH3) that spontaneously leave the system, thereby driving Li2S formation without ΔGmix limitations. The as-synthesized Li2S is successfully applied to prepare sulfide-based solid electrolytes such as Li10GeP2S12 and argyrodite-Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5, achieving laboratory-scale (1 kg) production costs reduction of up to 27.5% and 92.9%, respectively. Furthermore, all-solid-state batteries employing Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 demonstrate electrochemical performance comparable to those fabricate with commercial Li2S. This scalable methodology thus may provide a proming pathway to bridge low-cost Li2S synthesis with the practical deployment of sulfide-based solid electrolytes, which may accelerate the commercialization of high-performance all-solid-state batteries.

Here, the authors investigate ultrafast relaxation and structural evolution of morpholine with enhanced temporal resolution, following excitation via RDWs. 
 Optical sources exploiting resonant dispersive wave (RDW) emission are set to revolutionize ultrafast science. We demonstrate this approach by investigating excited state dynamics in morpholine using time-resolved photoelectron imaging. Excitation at 250 nm was achieved via RDW emission inside a helium-filled capillary fibre which, when combined with a short 800 nm probe, realized an instrument response of just 11 ± 2 fs. Two pathways initiate N–H bond fission: an extremely fast (<10 fs) process and a frustrated mechanism (380 fs) with hindered electronic ground state access. Photoelectron angular distributions also indicate average molecular geometry evolving on an intermediate (~100 fs) timescale. This clean distinction between population lifetimes and structural dynamics is enabled by the excellent temporal resolution inherent in RDW-based sources. Electronic structure and nonadiabatic surface hopping calculations support our data interpretation, and the synergy between experiment and theory is vital for developing a complete mechanistic picture.

 The evolution of seeds transformed life on earth and is responsible for our most important food crops. Gymnosperms, the oldest living seed plants, are an untapped genomic reservoir for genes involved in seed evolution. To tap this resource, we assemble deep transcriptomes of 14 gymnosperms, four angiosperms, and two ferns and identified 22,429 phylogenetically informative ortholog groups. We observe that genes differentially expressed in ovules or leaves provide the majority of phylogenomic support for the evolutionary splits between 1) seed and non-seed plants; 2) gymnosperms and angiosperms; and/or 3) within gymnosperms (conifers vs. “ancient” gymnosperms). Our gymnosperm data identifies unreported candidate ovule regulated genes in Arabidopsis. Moreover, prior knowledge from Arabidopsis helps uncover 4,076 candidate ovule genes that influence these evolutionary splits.

 Arctic sea ice has undergone non-monotonic changes since the middle of the last century. Here, we investigate the cause of this behavior by isolating and quantifying the effects of anthropogenic aerosols, well-mixed greenhouse gases, and biomass burning on sea ice dynamics through climate model simulations. We find minimal changes in Arctic sea ice from 1956 to 1980, which largely reflect a balance between the warming effect of greenhouse gases and the cooling effect of aerosols. This balance, however, is disrupted in subsequent decades. Both sea ice area and volume exhibit marked declines between 1981 and 2005, owing primarily to intensified warming by greenhouse gases and a shift in aerosols’ role from mitigating to exacerbating sea ice loss. Our sea ice volume budget analysis demonstrates that sea ice changes since 1956 are mostly driven by thermodynamic processes: greenhouse gases significantly promote surface melting, whereas aerosols and biomass burning diminish surface melting by reducing surface shortwave radiation during boreal summer. From 1956–1980 to 1981–2005, the transitional effects of aerosols are associated with increased bottom ice melting and decreased bottom ice formation, which are primarily driven by changes in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation."

 Satellite remote sensing has provided valuable information on fire radiative power (FRP), which is an important indicator for estimating biomass burning emissions and understanding fire dynamics. However, FRP evaluation faces challenges due to limited field measurements and the high variability of satellite sensor characteristics. Previous studies have tried to quantify the uncertainty of FRP by intercomparison, but they are limited to small numbers of cases and are not free from the detection capacity. To address this issue, we presented a comprehensive global evaluation of FRP from three satellite sensors—Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR)—by integrating all possible fire clusters after minimizing differences in fire occurrence detection while preserving inherent differences in detection extent across sensors. Furthermore, we applied extended triple collocation analysis (ETC) to evaluate the consistency of FRP without relying on true reference data for the first time. Intercomparative results highlight robust consistency when the fire clusters overlap well across all three sensors, even under varying sample selection criteria. Notably, SLSTR and VIIRS have slightly higher FRP than MODIS, even after aligning detected fire events, due to the superiority of observing small or weak fires at the edge of fire clusters. ETC revealed high consistency in boreal forests, where large-scale, strong fire clusters are well matched.

 California experiences hundreds of wildfires each year, posing increasing risks to ecosystems and communities. This study investigates how hydrometeorological drivers influence wildfire occurrence and severity across four ecological zones from 2000 to 2023, using satellite imagery and in situ data. Complementary Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (CEEMD), Pseudo–Tri-Dimensional CEEMD, and Time-Dependent Intrinsic Correlation (TDIC) were applied to decompose short- and long-term variability, and Intensity–Duration–Frequency (IDF) curves were utilized to characterize event intensity and duration. Results show that wildfire severity has increased statewide even as occurrence rates diverged regionally. In the Sierra, the number of fires declined by approximately 25 %, yet the average daily burned area doubled, indicating fewer but more destructive events. In the North Coast, fire frequency decreased after 2010, but severity continued to rise, while the Central and South Coasts experienced more frequent ignitions that peaked around 2018. TDIC-based analysis revealed that wildfire occurrence decreases sharply with higher precipitation (≈ −0.7) and soil moisture (≈ −0.8), while hot and dry conditions strongly amplify fire activity, with temperature (≈ +0.8) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD; ≈ +0.6) emerging as dominant drivers. Vegetation greenness, measured by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), exerted contrasting effects: in the Sierra, dense summer biomass fueled larger fires once dried (+0.7), whereas in the South Coast, senescent grasses supported more ignitions (−0.8). IDF analysis further demonstrated that two- to five-day events often reached daily intensities exceeding 500,000 ha, while longer events accumulated greater total burned areas despite lower daily rates. These findings provide quantitative evidence that wildfire–climate interactions in California are region-specific and increasingly shaped by hotter, drier conditions, underscoring the need for adaptive fire management tailored to both short-term extremes and long-term fuel dynamics."

 Natural phenomena such as earthquakes and heavy rainfall can trigger landslide events hundreds or even thousands of times in a given area. Therefore, rapid and efficient intervention in affected regions is essential. Existing studies have demonstrated good detection performance using optical remote sensing images; however, optical data has significant limitations under cloud cover. Moreover, current multi-modal fusion methods struggle to effectively capture the nonlinear interactions between different modes when processing data with large informational disparities. To address these issues, we developed the China Luding multi-modal landslide dataset, which includes optical and polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images. We also propose a multi-modal network for landslide detection based on multi-label classification, called multi-modal cross Swin Transformer network (MCSTNet). Additionally, a new weighted asymmetric loss function (WASL) is proposed to improve multi-label classification tasks. Our proposed network consists of two stages: feature extraction and feature fusion. In the first stage, two independent branches extract high-level semantic features from optical and PolSAR images. In the second stage, a multi-modal cross multi-head self-attention (MCMSA) mechanism fuses the high-level semantic features from the multi-modal information. Therefore, the model enhances the learning and feature representation capabilities through parallel processing the input data information in different representation subspaces. Compared to other recent landslide detection methods, our results indicate that the proposed method is more effective, achieving an F1 score of 88.24% for landslide detection, with greater accuracy in identifying landslide-prone areas. Therefore, our model can provide reliable and effective decision support for disaster emergency responses."

 Rapid expansion of China’s aquaculture ponds (APs) has significantly contributed to food security and economic development, yet simultaneously triggering ecological degradation. However, the absence of high-resolution national datasets has constrained systematic analyses of APs’ spatiotemporal dynamics and their transboundary environmental footprints. To fill this gap, we developed a robust approach for accurately monitoring APs across China and elucidating the spatiotemporal dynamics and underlying mechanisms driving their changes. The Optical-SAR Aquaculture Pond Mapper (OS-APM) was developed, a novel framework integrating spatiotemporal-spectral signatures to synergistically leverage multi-sensor time series for precision AP mapping. The OS-APM comprised a hierarchical segmentation strategy for large-scale AP delineation, multi-modal feature fusion to distinguish spectrally ambiguous classes, and an ensemble classifier integrating optical, SAR, geometric, and topographic features. The framework achieved individual-pond-scale extraction accuracy (OA > 90 %) and generated China’s first 10-m resolution annual AP dataset (China_AP), derived from 119,882 Sentinel-1 and 579,436 Sentinel-2 scenes (2016–2023). This dataset revealed previously undocumented spatiotemporal patterns, indicating a 2023 AP inventory of 19,919.52 km2, with inland systems (55.56 %) now surpassing coastal ones (44.44 %) to dominate China’s aquaculture landscape. Spatially, four provinces (Jiangsu, Hubei, Shandong, Guangdong) collectively host 56 % of national APs, with 58 % clustered in the Yangtze-Huaihe River corridors. Temporally, the AP area exhibited an inverted-U trajectory, increasing from 20,685.20 km2 (2016) to a peak of 23,256.84 km2 (2019), then contracting below initial levels to 19,919.52 km2 by 2023. This reversal strongly correlates with China’s ecological civilization initiatives, notably the 2017 Aquaculture Water and Tidal Flat Plan. This study establishes multi-sensor data for national AP monitoring, quantifies inland AP expansion patterns under policy regulation, and delivers a scientific foundation for reconciling aquaculture intensification with wetland conservation."

 Arctic lake color and quality are changing in response to the warming climate, permafrost degradation, and intensifying disturbances. These changes have important implications on carbon and nutrient cycling, wildlife habitat, and water resources planning. However, the drivers, spatial distribution, and long-term trajectories of these changes remain poorly characterized on regional scales (∼100 km). In this study, we examined over 3,000 lakes in part of the Mackenzie Delta, Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands, and adjacent upland tundra in the Northwest Territories, Canada, to quantify both gradual and abrupt changes in lake color using harmonized Landsat time series from 1985 to 2022. Across the region, we found average declines of surface reflectance in the red and green bands by 13 % and 15 % over the last four decades, respectively. In comparison, the Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI) trends differed between sub-regions, with a decadal increase in the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands and a decrease in the Mackenzie Delta. We identified a positive, lagged correlation between abrupt lake color change and mean summer air temperature (MSAT), particularly in the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands (R = 0.7, lag = 2 years), indicating a delayed impact of warm summers on lake color. One important mechanism of such impact was lakeshore thaw slumping intensified by rising summer temperatures, with slump-affected lakes experiencing abrupt increases in surface reflectance and NDTI driven by sediment input. We identified fire as another important driver of lake color dynamics, which led to greater changes in lake surface reflectance (p < 0.01) and NDTI (p = 0.1) compared to surrounding lakes. These findings demonstrate the value of harmonized Landsat time series for characterizing multifaceted Arctic lake color dynamics, along with their drivers and impacts."

 The associations of walkability and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) with risk of osteoporosis remain understudied. We included a total of 22,534 participants from a population-based prospective cohort in Ningbo, China, enrolled from 2015 to 2018. Walkability was evaluated using a walk score that derived from geographic information systems (GIS) data and PM2.5 exposure levels were estimated by applying land use regression (LUR) models. Our primary outcome was osteoporosis, which was ascertained through diagnostic records from the Yinzhou Health Information System (YHIS). We employed Cox proportional hazards regression models to examine the associations of walkability and PM2.5 with risk of developing osteoporosis. Furthermore, we investigated whether there were additive or multiplicative interactions between walkability and PM2.5. After a 111,464 person-years of follow-up period, we identified 3739 incident osteoporosis cases. In the full adjusted model, the hazard ratios were 0.93 (95 % CI, 0.89–0.98) for walkability, and 1.03 (0.96–1.10) for PM2.5 in every interquartile range increase. Moreover, a significant additive scale interaction between PM2.5 and walkability were identified. In conclusion, walkability was protectively associated with osteoporosis. Importantly, high concentrations of PM2.5 appeared to attenuate the protective effect of neighborhood walkability."

 Air quality in central Taiwan is strongly influenced by meteorological conditions, particularly sea-land breeze circulation and atmospheric vertical stability, which govern the horizontal transport and vertical dispersion of pollutants. Douliu City, an inland urban area, experienced the highest PM2.5 concentrations in the region. Despite nearly a 50% reduction in PM2.5 levels from 2005 to 2020 due to emission control measures, stable atmospheric conditions accompanied by low average wind speeds (∼1.4 m s−1) continued to favor pollutant accumulation. This study combined long-term observations with an intensive autumn 2015 field campaign in Douliu, utilizing surface aerosol optical measurements and ground-based remote sensing instruments. Results indicated that daytime sea breezes transported pollutants from coastal to inland areas within 2–4 h, increasing surface PM2.5 concentrations from 39 to 54 μg m−3 and reducing AE440–870 from 1.34 to 1.04 (i.e., coarser particle). At night, the planetary boundary layer descended from approximately 1 km to below 300 m, resulting in elevated surface PM2.5 concentrations and higher AE450–700 values, which reflected the accumulation of fine-mode aerosols. Analyses of both surface and vertical measurements demonstrated that the effects of sea-land breeze circulation significantly influenced pollutant transport and accumulation, leading to higher PM2.5 concentrations in the inland site compared to the coastal site. Moreover, atmospheric stability plays a critical role, as low wind speeds and temperature inversions favor pollutant accumulation and suppress the vertical dispersion of aerosols in inland regions. This study highlights the critical role of meteorology in shaping inland air quality and suggests that future research to focus on vertical profiling with lidar and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to better elucidate pollutant accumulation mechanisms."
