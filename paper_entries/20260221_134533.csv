We evaluated the sociodemographic characteristics of tropical cyclone-impacted regions during the 2024 calendar year in the recent historical context of 1980–2024. In 2024, tropical cyclone-force winds affected an estimated 429 902 820 people (5.5% of global population), the 12th highest since 1980, in disproportionately more deprived areas. Hurricane-force winds affected an estimated 59 672 600 people (0.8%), the 10th highest since 1980, in disproportionately less deprived areas. Our findings provide a global context for tropical cyclones to better guide resilience and recovery efforts."

Alongside orographic influences, urban areas can also act to intensify storms, but their impact on heavy rainfall in high elevations has not yet been investigated in detail. Here, we quantify the contribution of a high-altitude city to both rainfall intensification and its daytime and nighttime patterns, focusing on the city of Cuenca in the Ecuadorian Andes. Modeling several observed storms with and without the city suggests that the urban area can enhance downstream precipitation by over 20% over a pre-existing hotspot of orographically induced precipitation. This urban-induced rainfall intensification seems to exceed that observed for cities of comparable size outside mountainous regions. This may be explained by Cuenca’s valley setting and its high humidity compared to its surroundings, suggesting that high-altitude cities with similar morphologies could amplify combined orographic-dynamic and urban-thermodynamic effects."

They can facilitate or impede collective action. Although simulation models help to explore norm dynamics, modeling approaches remain scattered and lack synthesis specific to social-ecological systems. This systematic review aims to map existing computational approaches to modeling social norms within social-ecological systems, identifying trends, gaps and implications for research and policy. We conducted a systematic search of Web of Science and Scopus (search date: 15 November 2024), screened abstracts using validated large language models, and selected 153 relevant studies for analysis. Key aspects analyzed included publication trends, thematic focus, modeling methods, spatial scale, empirical data used behavioral theory incorporation and norm representation. Publications increased over 25 years, with most studies originating from Europe and North America. Two dominant themes emerged: common-pool resource management and individual consumption behavior. Agent-based and evolutionary game-theoretic models prevail, but many omit explicit behavioral theories beyond rational choice theory. Models are mostly local or regional in scale and theoretical in nature and often lack empirical data for the quantification of the social norm modeled. Norms are generally modeled on an observation base, meaning that the majority of models include norms based on what others do. Interactions between norm types and dynamic norm signaling remain under-explored. To strengthen social-ecological modeling and its policy relevance, future work should enhance geographic diversity, integrate behavioral theories more deeply and develop models that capture dynamically signaled norms in order to advance our understanding of human–environment interactions and sustainability transitions."

Efforts to counter anthropogenic pressures on Amazonian ecosystems have largely excluded freshwater ecosystems despite their central role in supporting biodiversity and human communities. Nature based solutions (NbS) are garnering attention as a holistic strategy that address ecological and human dimensions of resilience, offering a promising approach to couple freshwater biodiversity conservation and equitable adaptation in the Amazon. The extent to which NbS projects in the Amazon are incorporating freshwater biodiversity objectives and aligning with principles of equitable adaptation is unresolved. Synthesizing across existing NbS cases is key to distilling lessons learned and identifying remaining gaps to inform current and future project implementation. We evaluate four cases of implemented NbS projects in the lowland Amazonian basin to assess three themes: freshwater biodiversity impacts, equity considerations, and guiding policies of each case. Freshwater biodiversity outcomes are evaluated by assessing against Couto (Couto et al 2024 Conserv. Sci. Pract.6 e13241)’ five themes for freshwater biodiversity conservation; equity implications evaluated by comparing project documents to the Stockholm Environment Institute’s Principles for Just and Equitable NbS; and the degree to which freshwater biodiversity is prioritized by relevant policies is assessed through a search for keywords. The case studies demonstrate alignment with principles of equitable and just NbS in the Amazon basin, but links to freshwater biodiversity are minimal, suggesting an oversight of the importance of sustaining and protecting freshwater biodiversity, particularly among vulnerable local communities. We provide recommendations to expand freshwater NbS-A project implementation, monitoring and data sharing, and policy in the region with the aim of safeguarding freshwater ecosystems and local communities in the face of environmental change."

Understanding the drivers of N2O fluxes remains elusive, making it difficult to predict emissions in time and space and to develop and evaluate ways to lower emissions through management. Major scientific uncertainties underlying the understanding of the drivers of N2O fluxes identified in a workshop of N2O emissions experts include poor process-based understanding of controls on soil N2O emissions in the field; insufficient data to reduce uncertainty in N2O budgets from the field to regional scales, including N2O emission measurements and importantly, field-scale N balances; and high uncertainty in model predictions of soil N2O emissions across environmental and management conditions. To reduce these uncertainties, we present the concept of N2Onet, a global collaborative initiative to accelerate advances in N2O measurement, analyses, and mitigation. N2Onet will serve as an observational network of supersites with multi-scale measurements; a database hub for N2O flux and ancillary data; and a catalyst for community building, information sharing, and training. By coalescing and coordinating the global community of researchers, N2Onet will provide a roadmap for reducing N2O emissions from agriculture worldwide."

However, such extreme events are mostly studied based on air temperature that does not fully capture thermal stress on Earth’s surface layer. Here we explored the evolution of global heatwaves from near-surface air, land surface, to subsurface soils worldwide during 1980–2024. Results show heatwaves have strengthened across all layers, with a pronounced acceleration since the early 21st century. Relative to air and land surface, soils generally exhibit a greater heatwave exposure and severity. The peak intensity weakens as depth increases, with inter-layer differences closely linked to soil moisture, clay, and organic carbon content. The northern high latitudes are more prone to events of greater severity, particularly during summer, while lower latitudes and the Southern Hemisphere are characterized by events of greater persistence. Forests tend to buffer heat extremes, whereas non-forest land covers readily amplify heat exposure. Our findings imply that reliance on air temperature alone might underestimate heatwave risks to soil ecosystems, and soil temperature should be incorporated into monitoring and early-warning systems."

This study identified distinct QDV in TCG during June–October, characterized by two leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) modes. The first mode (EOF1) exhibits a north-south dipole pattern and is indirectly modulated by solar variability through circulation anomalies over the mid-latitude North Pacific. The second mode (EOF2) exhibits a west-east dipole pattern and is driven by internal variability linked to the Pacific Quasi-decadal Oscillation (PQDO), represented by sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTa) in the tropical central Pacific (TCP). Both modes strongly correlate (r > 0.83) with key regional indicators: regional mean 200 hPa geopotential height (150° E–180°, 34° N–44° N) and SSTa (164° E–164° W, 10° S–10° N). The direct influence of solar variability on TCG is weak, primarily due to offsetting effects of solar-associated in-phase SSTa between the mid-latitude North Pacific and the TCP. Solar variability and PQDO affect TCG primarily through dynamic factors, explaining about 85% of TCG changes, with relative vorticity contributing around 30%. These findings highlight the complex interplay between solar and internal forcings in modulating TCG, providing valuable insights for improving long-term TC forecasts."

While the amplification of intraseasonal rainfall variability across Australia has been reported, the spatial heterogeneity of this intensification has been overlooked. Here, we observe that the intraseasonal rainfall variability has been intensified, particularly over northeastern Australia during the wet season (November–April) over the past four decades. The intensified intraseasonal rainfall variability is primarily attributed to enhanced intensity of precipitation events, rather than drier spells. Moisture budget analysis indicates that the intensification of intraseasonal abnormal rainfall events over northeastern Australia is primarily due to the strengthened vertical advection of background moisture caused by the intraseasonal vertical motion anomalies. In this process, the strengthening of intraseasonal vertical velocity driven by changes in intraseasonal wind convergence plays a dominant role, accounting for over 90%, whereas the effect of background moisture changes is relatively less significant. Our findings highlight northeastern Australia as a hotspot for amplified intraseasonal rainfall variability, rather than the whole of Australia. This study provides fundamental insights into northern Australia’s changing climate, and highlights the important role of intraseasonal circulation on northeastern Australia rainfall variability."

Previous research has mainly emphasized physical form and single outcomes, neglecting functional dimensions and potential ecological trade-offs due to the lack of fine-grained data. Here, we introduce a multi-source data fusion-based urban functional compactness (UFC) indicator and integrate it with urban physical compactness (UPC) into a form-function coupling framework. Using structural equation modeling across 176 Chinese cities, we reveal dual impacts: stronger UFC enhances land use efficiency and public transport performance but is associated with reduced green space provision and weaker waste treatment. A 1% increase in UFC raises infrastructure utilization efficiency by about 2% while also indirectly elevating environmental pollution by 0.74%. In contrast, a 1% increase in UPC directly enhances water conservation by 3% and reduces energy consumption by 6% but indirectly increases pollution impacts by 2.59%. These findings challenge the assumption that compactness is inherently green, demonstrating instead that form–function coupling produces divergent pathways: efficiency gains coexisting with amplified ecological risks."

This study demonstrates a quantitative environmental, social, and governance framework using data from India’s Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting to evaluate the environmental performance of corporations using novel intensity measures. Key findings show that cement industry exhibits some of the highest purchasing power parity (PPP)-adjusted emissions at nearly 0.89 tCO₂e/₹ crore (tonnes of CO₂ equivalent per rupee crore or per 10 million Indian Rupees) or nearly 7.5 tCO₂e/ million US$ revenue. Mining operations in water-stressed regions show a 19%–37% excess over basin recharge capacity. Additionally, 88% of the companies do not report Scope 3 emissions, leaving behind critical lacunae in value chain accountability. Data validation shows the existence of a 72% accuracy in the emission reporting and 68% accuracy in water metrics. The equations in the framework that factor in regional PPP factors and aquifer stress percentages give the model a replicable methodology for quantifying corporate environmental impacts in data-scarce regions with potential for adaptation across developing nations with similar industrialisation-environment trade-offs."

Because future responses will have to build on the legacy of past trajectories, addressing this challenge requires a sound, fine-grained understanding of those trajectories. In the present study, we address this challenge by compiling a dataset (1990–2019) quantifying nitrogen flows across the agri-food systems of 120 European territories. Using this dataset, we apply the generalized representation of agri-food systems framework to classify agri-food systems into six types representing different degrees of specialization. Our results show that agricultural systems became increasingly specialized, rising from 22% of specialized territories in 1990 to 36% in 2019, indicating a growing reliance on external feed and fertilizer inputs. Most of these transitions occurred in eastern Europe, predominantly toward stockless cropping systems. Although these evolutions unfolded within broader processes of market liberalization, transition patterns also displayed clear path-dependency effects rooted in the material configuration of agri-food systems. This is evidenced by the analysis of transition frequencies, which shows that some transitions occurred repeatedly while others never occurred, pointing to the influence of initial system configurations on subsequent trajectories. By contrast, changes in agro-environmental performance were only weakly linked to system transitions. The increases in nitrogen use efficiency (from 0.57 to 0.70) and declines in nitrogen surplus (from 68 to 49 kg N ha−1) rather coincided with higher yields and increased nitrogen input application rates, pointing to the dominant role of factors not explicitly captured here, such as shifts in agronomic practices and pedo-climatic conditions. Taken together, these findings provide both a critical dataset and a robust understanding of recent territorial agri-food trajectories, thereby offering a solid empirical basis for anticipating future transitions and developing scenario-based analyses."

The results showed that COF2 has a much lower global warming potential than conventional fluorinated gases. Thus, it validates the use of COF2 as a sustainable alternative for reducing the climate impact of semiconductor and display manufacturing processes. 
 Carbonyl fluoride (COF2) has gained interest as a low-GWP replacement candidate for the high-GWP fluorinated gases employed in semiconductor and display manufacturing. In this study, the infrared absorption cross-section of COF2 was experimentally measured using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and its radiative efficiency was determined to be 0.119 W m−2 ppb−1 using the stratospheric-adjusted Pinnock curve. Atmospheric e-folding lifetimes derived from exponential decay measurements were 7.56 h in dry O2 and 54.86 and 36.67 min under low- and high-humidity ambient air, respectively. Incorporation of these lifetimes into the absolute GWP framework yielded GWP100 values of 4.05×10-4 (dry air), 6.82×10-6 (low humidity), and 3.16×10-6 (high humidity), demonstrating that rapid hydrolysis in the presence of water vapor suppresses the climate impact of COF2 to effectively zero under typical tropospheric conditions. Because CO2 is the terminal atmospheric degradation product, the long-term climate impact of COF2 emissions is equivalent to releasing only the stoichiometrically corresponding amount of CO2. These findings provide a fully experimental basis for determining the GWP100 of COF2 under atmospherically relevant conditions and demonstrate that its GWP100 is effectively near zero. This experimentally validated assessment confirms that COF2 is a viable low-GWP replacement gas for chamber-cleaning applications in semiconductor and display manufacturing."

Ozone concentrations at this level have important implications for atmospheric chemistry and circulation. In this work, we explore how tropical tropopause ozone varies in observations and chemistry-climate models. We show that fluctuations in the elevation of the tropical tropopause play a role in controlling the nearby ozone levels, with implications for future climate and stratospheric ozone. 
 Ozone is a key radiative species near the tropical tropopause, which acts as a gateway to the stratosphere for ascending air. Ozone concentrations at fixed heights in this region fluctuate seasonally and interannually as the strength of stratospheric upwelling varies, influencing local temperatures and stratospheric composition. Models ranging in complexity suggest that an accelerated stratospheric circulation, along with tropospheric expansion, could reduce tropical lower stratospheric ozone following surface warming. These modes of variability are often equated with variability at the tropical tropopause; however, tropopause height varies seasonally and interannually, and it is expected to rise as Earth's surface warms. Here, we explore how tropical tropopause ozone varies when considering changes to tropopause pressure. We first examine 15 years of MERRA-2 reanalysis data to distinguish variability at the tropical tropopause from nearby fixed pressure levels on annual-to-interannual timescales. We show that changes to tropopause pressure drive ozone's annual cycle at the tropical tropopause to be substantially smaller and out of phase from those at 95 or 105 hPa. We then investigate how tropical tropopause ozone responds to surface warming under a range of forcing scenarios using output from the Chemistry-Climate Modeling Initiative (CCMI). We find that pressure-dependent ozone production coupled with tropospheric expansion leads tropical tropopause ozone variability to remain distinct from fixed pressure levels following surface warming, with divergent trends in the strongest forcing scenario. Finally, we show that increases to tropical tropopause ozone correspond with local warming in CCMI projections, while tropospheric expansion increases lower stratospheric ozone."

 Since the Clean Air Act was implemented in 2013, China has witnessed a reduction of over 50 % in the annual average concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Despite emission cuts, the formation mechanism of secondary organic aerosols (SOA), a crucial constituent of PM2.5, remains inadequately understood. In this study, we performed a model-assisted analysis of field sampling data collected in Shijiazhuang. The results show that, compared to 2014, the contribution of SOA to the total organics (from 27 % in 2014 to 75 % in 2024) exceeded that of primary organic aerosol (POA) during the winter haze in 2024. The current model, which includes SOA formation pathways involving aromatic oxidation, aqueous formation, and SVOC/IVOC oxidation, underestimates the measured SOA levels by 60 % in 2024. However, incorporating the transformation of transported POA into SOA (accounting for up to 50 % of SOA) under high relative humidity (RH) conditions helps bridge the gap between model predictions and field measurements. The pathway of SOA formation via POA aging is consistent with the identified POA aging factor derived from biomass burning and coal combustion. The increase in SOA contribution occurred amidst large emission reductions, which accounted for 70 % of the decline in POA levels, while meteorological factors contributed an additional 10 %. Increased contribution of SOA was also found in other North China Plains areas, which underscores the pressing necessity for coordinated regional initiatives to effectively mitigate SOA levels across the NCP, thereby tackling the transboundary nature of air pollution."

Welton,Volcanic plume height during the 2021 Tajogaite eruption (La Palma) from two complementary monitoring methods – implications for satellite-based products,"This manuscript describes the instrumental coverage deployed during the Tajogaite eruption (19 September–25 December 2021) by the Instituto Geográfico Nacional (IGN), the Spanish State Meteorological Agency (AEMET), and other Spanish members of ACTRIS (Aerosol, Clouds and Trace Gases Research Infrastructure) to monitor its atmospheric impact. Two complementary methods provide consistent plume height data for future operational surveillance. 
 Volcanic emissions from the Tajogaite volcano, located on the Cumbre Vieja edifice on the island of La Palma (Canary Islands, Spain), caused significant public health and aviation disruptions throughout the eruption (19 September–13 December 2021, officially declared over on 25 December). Nonetheless, it is considered the most significant volcanic event in Europe over the past 75 years due to the substantial amount of SO2 released into the atmosphere. The Instituto Geográfico Nacional (IGN), the authority responsible for volcano surveillance in Spain, implemented extensive operational monitoring to track volcanic activity and to provide a robust estimation of the volcanic plume height using a video-surveillance network. In parallel, the State Meteorological Agency of Spain (AEMET), in partnership with other Spanish ACTRIS (Aerosol, Clouds, and Trace Gases Research Infrastructure) members and collaborating institutions, conducted an unprecedented instrumental deployment to evaluate the impacts of this volcanic event on atmospheric composition. This effort included a network of aerosol profilers surrounding the volcano. A total of four profiling instruments were installed on La Palma: one MPL-4B lidar and three ceilometers. Additionally, a pre-existing Raman lidar on the island contributed valuable data to this study. These efforts are undertaken due to the importance of monitoring volcanic plume height in terms of air quality (necessary for the implementation of effective civil protection policies), volcanic activity surveillance (for tracking and forecasting eruptive behaviour), and, from a scientific perspective, for improving our understanding of the climatic and radiative impacts of this type of aerosol.In this study, the eruptive process was characterised in terms of the altitude of the dispersive volcanic plume (hd), measured by both IGN and AEMET-ACTRIS, and the altitude of the eruptive column (hec), measured by IGN. Modulating factors such as seismicity and meteorological conditions were also analysed. The consistency between the two independent and complementary datasets (hd,IGN and hd,AEMET) was assessed throughout the eruption (mean difference of 258.6 m).Our results confirmed the existence of three distinct eruptive phases, encompassing a range of styles from Strombolian explosive to effusive activity. While these phases have been characterised in previous studies, the results of the present work provide complementary information and novel insights from an alternative observational approach, which may be of use in future volcanic crises and will be applied to operational surveillance during such events.A subsequent comparison of hd,AEMET with the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aerosol layer height product (ALHCALIOP) revealed a systematic underestimation by the satellite product, with a mean difference of 392.2 m.Finally, the impact of using hec in estimating SO2 emissions from the NASA MSVOLSO2L4 satellite-based product was evaluated. When a fixed (standard) plume altitude of 8 km was used instead of the observed hec, the total SO2 emission was significantly underestimated by an average of 56.2 %, and by up to 84.7 %. These findings underscore the importance of accurately determining the volcanic plume height when deriving SO2 emissions from satellite data."

The O3 pollution was found to be transported from inland areas to coastal areas. The transport process can be roughly divided into three phases: downdraft control, horizontal transport, and vertical mixing. 
 Tropical cyclones (TC) exert a profound influence on the dynamics of ground-level ozone (O3) pollution in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) of China's Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao. Although TC-related O3 transport processes are well recognized, their three-dimensional characteristics are still inadequately characterized. This study provides the first comprehensive observational analysis of O3 pollution transport mechanisms in the GBA under the influence of TC, integrating high-temporal-resolution wind profile measurements with hourly meteorological and air quality data and model simulations. The findings indicate that TC activity accounts for 39.9 % of O3 pollution episodes in the region, with pollutants advection from northern mainland areas to coastal cities. When TCs are located at a distance of approximately 1800–2000 km, horizontal transport mechanisms dominate (about 54.26 %), facilitating the conveyance of inland ozone to coastal regions. As the proximity of the TC decreases to within 1000–1700 km, the descending air currents intensify, driving ozone from coastal areas into the boundary layer and resulting in reduced O3 concentrations inland while they increase along the coast. In particular, when TCs approach Taiwan (less than 800 km, NE), increased vertical wind shear occurs about 34.25 % than before, with the contribution of vertical mixing also sharply rising by over 34.15 %. This is especially evident over coastal zones, where it facilitates the injection of free-atmosphere ozone into the boundary layer. This mechanism prolongs surface O3 pollution episodes. Our findings offer critical insights for O3 pollution mitigation strategies in the GBA and are of relevance for other globally significant bay regions susceptible to TC impacts, including Hangzhou Bay (China), Tokyo Bay (Japan), and the Bay of Bengal (India)."

We demonstrate that variation in soil warming with depth is driven largely by warming methodology, while soil moisture changes due to warming differ by ecosystem. This work serves a foundation for future syntheses with SWEDDIE. 
 Field-warming experiments offer insight into the response of ecosystems to rising temperatures, but cross-site comparison is needed to determine both the general tendencies of warming responses and the context dependencies of deviations from those norms. These responses are not limited to the direct effects of temperature but also their indirect effects on soil moisture, a critical factor controlling ecosystem productivity and carbon fluxes. Here we introduce SWEDDIE: the first database to characterize the whole soil profile warming response across 26 distinct soil warming experiments, encompassing forest, grassland, cropland, tundra, and wetland ecosystems. SWEDDIE is needed because prior databases and syntheses of warming effects on ecosystems were dominated by aboveground warming studies, many of which warmed soil modestly or negligibly during much of the growing season and reported only growing season averages."

 We describe Global Atmosphere 8.0 and Global Land 9.0 (GA8GL9) that are science configurations of the Met Office Unified Model and Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) land surface model developed for use across weather and climate timescales. GA8GL9 builds upon GA7GL7. It not only consolidates the changes made for the climate branch configuration GA7.1GL7.1 (the atmosphere and land components of the physical model used in HadGEM3-GC3.1, UKESM1 and UKESM1.1 which were all used in the Met Office's CMIP6 submissions) and NWP branch configuration GA7.2GL8.1 (the operational global NWP model at the Met Office between 2019 and 2022), but also includes developments to most areas of the science. Some of the key changes include: prognostic-based entrainment, which adds convective memory and improves precipitation rates and spatial structures; time-smoothed convective increments, which improves the convection-dynamics coupling and greatly reduces the detrimental dynamical effects of convective intermittency; a new riming parametrisation, which increases the amount of supercooled water and hence reduces Southern Ocean biases; and a package of land surface changes, which improves the forecast of near-surface fields and hence removes the need for the aggregate surface tile in NWP applications. Several changes are  made that reduce numerical artefacts and improve the numerical stability of the model. The NWP and climate performance of GA8GL9 is evaluated against the previous configuration, GA7GL7. In NWP tests GA8GL9 is shown have reduced errors and improved spatial structure. The mean climate in GA8GL9 is shown to be improved relative to GA7GL7 with notable improvements in the top of atmosphere outgoing shortwave radiation. GA8GL9 is the atmosphere and land component of GC4, and GC4 has been used as the operational global NWP model at the Met Office since May 2022."
10.5194/gmd-19-1519-2026,False,Geoscientific Model Development,该论文主要关注NetCDF-4文件访问优化，涉及数据压缩和子块索引技术，但并未直接提及大气环境遥感技术、空气质量监测或卫星观测等具体领域。,"['NetCDF', 'compression', 'data access']",Cédric Penard;Flavien Gouillon;Xavier Delaunay;Sylvain Herlédan,"A new sub-chunking strategy for fast netCDF-4 access in local, remote and cloud infrastructures, chunkindex V1.1.0","In this work, we propose a novel approach, called chunkindex, that was designed to improve the access to time series from native NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) files in the cloud. The advantage of our approach is that it keeps existing data as they are without requiring any reformatting. The idea is to reduce the amount of data read from the NetCDF file by creating sub-chunks that allow extracting smaller portions of compressed data without reading the entire chunk. 
 NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) is a self-describing, portable and platform-independent format for array-oriented scientific data which has become a community standard for sharing measurements and analysis results in the fields of oceanography, meteorology, and space domain.The volume of scientific data is continuously increasing at a very fast rate and poses challenges for efficient storage and sharing of these data. The object storage paradigm that appeared with cloud infrastructures, can help with data storage and parallel access issues.The availability of ample network bandwidth within cloud infrastructures allows for the utilization of large amounts of data. Processing data where the data is located is preferable as it can result in substantial resource savings. However, for some use cases downloading data from the cloud is required and results still have to be fetched once processing tasks have been executed on the cloud.However, networks bandwidth and quality can exhibit significant variations depending on the available resources in different use cases: networks can range from fiber-optic and copper connections to satellite connections with poor reception in degraded conditions on boats, among other scenarios. Therefore, it is crucial for formats and software libraries to be specifically designed to optimize access to data by minimizing the transfer to only what is strictly necessary.By design, the NetCDF data format offers such capabilities. A netCDF file is composed of a pool of chunks. Each chunk is a small unit of data that is independent and may be compressed. These units of data are read or written in a single I/O operation. In this article, we reuse the notion of sub-chunk introduced in the kerchunk library (Sterzinger et al., 2021): we refer to a sub-chunk as a sub-part of a chunk.The sub-chunking strategies help reducing the amount of data transferred by splitting netCDF chunks in even smaller unit of data. Kerchunk limits the sub-chunking capability to uncompressed chunks. Our approach goes further: it allows the sub-chunking of compressed chunks by indexing their content. In this context, a new approach has emerged in the form of a library that indexes the content of netCDF-4. This indexing enables the retrieval of sub-chunks without the need to read and decompress the entire chunk. This approach targets access patterns such as time series in netCDF-4 datasets formatted with large chunks and it has the advantage of not requiring the entire file to be reformatted.This report provides a performance assessment of netCDF-4 datasets for various use cases and conditions: POSIX (see POSIX) and S3 local filesystems, as well as a simulated degraded network connection. The results of this assessment may provide guidance on the most suitable and most efficient library for reading netCDF data in different situations.Another outcome of this study is the impact of the libraries used to access the data: while extensive existing literature compares different file formats performance (open, read and write), the impact of specific standard libraries remains poorly studied. This study evaluates the performance of four Python libraries (netcdf4-python, xarray, h5py, and a custom chunk-indexing library) for reading parts of the datasets through fsspec or s3fs. To complete the study, a comparison with the cloud-oriented formats Zarr and ncZarr is conducted. Results show that the h5py library provides high efficiency for accessing netCDF-4 formatted files and performance close to Zarr on a S3 server. These results suggest that it may not be necessary to convert netCDF-4 datasets to Zarr when moving to the cloud. This would avoid reformatting petabytes of data and costly adaptation of scientific software."

Traditional codes represent the systems of equation by setting up the associated matrix. However, at the scales we want to operate, even forming this matrix is hardly possible. Thus, we use the matrix-free framework HyTeG to create the geophysical model and verify it with numerical experiments while assessing the scalability of the framework and laying out the difficulties involved. 
 High-resolution geodynamic simulations of mantle convection are essential to quantitatively assess the complex physical mechanisms driving the large-scale tectonic processes that shape Earth's surface. Accurately capturing small-scale features such as unstable thermal boundary layers requires global resolution on the order of 1 km. This renders traditional sparse matrix methods impractical due to their prohibitively high memory demands and low arithmetic intensity. Matrix-free methods offer a scalable alternative, enabling the solution of large-scale linear systems efficiently. In this work, we leverage the matrix-free Finite Element framework HyTeG to conduct large-scale geodynamic simulations that incorporate realistic physical models. We validate the framework through a combination of convergence studies of the Finite Element approximations against analytical solutions and through geophysical community benchmarks. The latter include test cases with temperature-dependent and nonlinear rheologies. Our scalability studies demonstrate excellent performance, scaling up to problems with about 100 billion (1011) unknowns in the Stokes system."

The absence of a validated UV-LED reactor or a validation protocol may limit its application. The first full-scale UV-LED280 reactor in the Americas was installed at a municipal well for Legionella pneumophila disinfection. USEPA guidance was used to design validation bench- and full-scale tests with two surrogates (MS2 and T1UV). Full-scale parameters were varied over relevant ranges (893–1000 GPM, 90–99% UVT280, 12–100% power levels, and varying LED280 bank operation) to understand effects on performance. The Calculated Dose Approach successfully generated L. pneumophila-tailored UV intensity setpoints and a validated reduction equivalent dose (RED) monitoring equation. Validated L. pneumophila REDs of 3.7–47 mJ/cm2 were found through the incorporation of an L. pneumophila UV sensitivity factor in the equation, not only reducing RED over/underestimation but also removing the need for UVDGM bias factors. The UV-LED280 REDs exceeded the requirements under a variety of extreme conditions. Although this study successfully demonstrates a UV-LED280 reactor and validation approach, guidance specifically addressing UV-LED would provide clarity and assurance to utilities seeking to implement and receive treatment credit with this promising new technology."

Policy gaps and inadequate enforcement exacerbate pollution transfer to under-regulated regions, causing substantial environmental and health problems. To address this, we investigated chronic exposure hazards and developed rapid pollution identification technologies. We recruited 2028 participants from e-waste recycling sites and other industrial parks, profiling their urinary organic pollutant exposome (>200 chemicals), oxidative damage, and metabolome by integrating nontargeted and targeted screening methods. Results showed that exposure to pollutant mixtures was significantly associated with increased oxidative damage to nucleic acids and cholesterol. Moreover, these pollutant mixtures collectively explained 46.2% of the variance in urinary metabolome alterations among e-waste workers. The affected metabolites were primarily associated with inflammatory diseases, metabolic disorders, neurological conditions, and cancers. By identifying e-waste exposure characteristic pollutants, we further developed accurate e-waste exposure prediction models (AUC > 0.986; ACC > 0.938) and derived simplified prediction functions and diagnostic indexes with comparable efficacy, which performed well across populations and industrial settings. Overall, this study underscores the significant health risks of e-waste exposure in occupational workers and offers rapid screening tools for e-waste pollution in informal settings, advancing the repurposing of large-scale national exposure monitoring databases for pollution tracking."

Their occurrence in groundwater, an important drinking water resource, remains underexplored. We investigated 180 PM chemicals in 82 groundwater samples across Saxony, Germany, using freeze-drying and supercritical fluid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (SFC-HRMS). 163 PM chemicals were determined, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals, PFAS, other industrial chemicals, and transformation products; concentrations of 72 compounds are reported in groundwater for the first time; 57 chemicals exhibited detection frequencies >50%. The median total PM chemical concentration was 23 μg L–1, with pesticides (0.77 μg L–1) and pharmaceuticals (0.69 μg L–1) of similar totals and industrial chemicals being much higher (19 μg L–1). Trifluoroacetic acid was the dominant single compound (median of 3.0 μg L–1, n = 81). Median concentrations of single chemicals correlated with physicochemical properties (water solubility, lipophilicity, etc.). Site-specific factors (nitrate, dissolved organic carbon, depth) were also associated with PM chemical levels. Chemical co-occurrence revealed benzothiazole and N,N-dimethylformamide as indicators of higher overall PM chemical concentrations.

We experimentally determined Kca for 46 diverse VOCs, including carbonyls, aromatics, amines, amides, alkenes, acids, alcohols, furan, and siloxanes. Results showed that compounds with a lower vapor pressure and higher molecular weight exhibited stronger sorption. Water sorbed in cotton contributed less than half an order of magnitude to Kca for most VOCs, except for some highly water-soluble species. Octanol–air partition coefficients (log Koa) correlate well with log Kca for homologous compounds but demonstrate limited predictive capacity across different VOC classes. The predictions of log Kca using methyl cellulose as a cotton surrogate led to deviations of up to one log unit. We developed a polyparameter linear free energy relationship (pp-LFER) model for log Kca prediction based on the experimental data. The model shows good agreement with experimental data (adjusted R2 = 0.73, root-mean-square error ∼ 0.55 log units), providing a useful tool for chemical distribution and exposure assessment. Field investigations further demonstrated that environmental factors (temperature, humidity, particle deposition, and interfering compounds) can induce 1–2 orders of magnitude variation in Kca values compared to controlled laboratory measurements."

However, laboratory studies often examine MP transformation at micromolar (μM) levels due to analytical constraints, potentially overlooking certain MP behaviors under environmentally relevant concentrations. This study investigated the oxidation kinetics (kobs) of model MPs across a wide range of initial concentration (C0), with particular emphasis on the distinct roles of short- and long-lived reactive species (SLRS and LLRS) formed in irradiated dissolved organic matter (DOM) solutions. A generalized kinetic framework was developed and revealed that SLRS, such as triplet-state DOM, dominated MP oxidation at higher C0 (≥μM), while LLRS, primarily DOM radicals, drove MP degradation at sub-μM levels. Laser flash photolysis confirmed that LLRS exhibits much longer lifetimes (∼ms) than SLRS (∼μs), enabling elevated LLRS concentrations under trace MP conditions and significantly enhancing MP oxidation. The observed kobs–C0 relationship features a characteristic “three-platform” behavior governed by RS formation rates, reactivities, and lifetimes. These findings advance our understanding of MP fate under real-world conditions and underscore the critical yet often overlooked role of LLRS in aquatic systems."

Identifying its precursors in source water is necessary for reducing or eliminating NDMA formation. Previous studies focused on model precursors with a dimethylamine group (DMA: −N(CH3)2), missing precursors without DMA that can form NDMA during chloramination. Here, we aimed to develop a new approach enhancing the discovery of various NDMA precursors. By analyzing MS/MS spectra of 39 model NDMA precursors, we identified three diagnostic fragment ions: [C2H6N]+, [C2H7N]•+, and [C2H8N]+. Using these fragments to query the NIST23 MS/MS library revealed 763 candidate compounds. Among 21 commercially available candidates, seven were experimentally confirmed as NDMA precursors through chloramination─four with DMA moieties and three without. Additionally, five drugs lacking DMA were newly identified as NDMA precursors. To facilitate large-scale screening, we developed NitrosAmine Precursor eXplorer (NitraPreX) for nontargeted LC-HRMS analysis. When applied to analyze Suwannee River Humic Acid reference material and real local water samples, NitraPreX tentatively identified over 200 potential NDMA precursors and confirmed two non-DMA-containing compounds, hydroxychloroquine and N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)dodecanamide, as NDMA precursors.

To address this limitation, we developed the HEDGE index (Hazard and Exposure Index from Data-Driven Generation), a data-driven framework integrating real-world exposure with multidimensional hazard profiles. We classified 16 priority PAHs into three distinct hazard subgroups (High-, Medium-, Low-Risk) using an ensemble clustering approach on 16 toxicological and environmental fate descriptors. Subsequently, an interpretable XGBoost machine learning model was trained to identify the key structural drivers, such as density, underlying these classifications. Epidemiological case study in Guangzhou, China, demonstrated that the HEDGE index exhibited improved model fit for daily nonaccidental mortality compared to the traditional toxic equivalency quantity (TEQ) approach (ΔAIC = 6.2). An interquartile range increase in HEDGE-weighted exposure corresponded to a 14.7% (95% CI: 12.5%, 17.0%) rise in total mortality, a risk estimate substantially greater than that from TEQ. The association was robust after adjusting for copollutants.

Pellets collected from an affected beach located in Galicia, Spain, along with solvent extracts and aqueous leachates, were subjected to both target and nontarget chemical analyses and tested in a battery of toxicity assays including a green microalga (Raphidocelis subcapitata), a marine copepod (Apocyclops royi), a fish model (Danio rerio), and a human cell line. Chemical screening identified on the order of 50 chemical substances in addition to Tinuvin UV-622, including a range of known plastic additives and nonintentionally added substances (NIAS). Toxicity assays revealed significant growth inhibition and stress-induced cell aggregation in R. subcapitata and acute toxicity causing immobilization in copepods, which could have potential implications in the environment via the disruption of primary producers and food web dynamics. In contrast, zebrafish embryos showed no significant developmental effects, while human cells exhibited modest, time-dependent reductions in viability.

Nevertheless, little is known about how the natural polyphenols influence the environmental behavior of copper sulfide minerals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In this work, the role of natural polyphenols in the degradation of waterborne emerging contaminants during CuS-x (a composite of Cu2S and CuS) oxygenation was investigated, where protocatechuic acid (PCA) was selected as a representative natural polyphenol. It was demonstrated that PCA could significantly enhance the degradation of target contaminant by substantially boosting surface-bound •OH (•OHbound) generation via a three-electron O2 activation pathway. Experimental analysis and theoretical calculations unveiled that PCA favored the adsorption and activation of O2 on the CuS-x surface, thus facilitating the formation of O2•– (an important precursor of both •OH and singlet oxygen (1O2)). The contributions of 1O2 and •OHbound to contaminant degradation in the CuS-x/PCA system were 31.8% and 60.2%, respectively. Notably, besides PCA itself, the oxidation products (i.e., ortho-quinones and semiquinone radicals) and S vacancies also played a crucial role in accelerating the Cu redox cycle to activate O2. These findings provide valuable insights for advancing sulfide mineral-based green remediation technologies."

Using a three-dimensional human skin equivalent (3D-HSE), we quantified percutaneous penetration for benzylalkyldimethylammonium compounds (BACs), dialkyldimethylammonium compounds (DADMACs), and alkyltrimethylammonium compounds (ATMACs) with C8–C18 chains. Shorter-chain (C8–C10) BACs and ATMACs showed rapid uptake (>50% at 24 h; >70% at 48 h), whereas long-chain homologues (C16–C18) exhibited minimal permeation (<15%) and greater retention within the skin. The correlation between the octanol–water partition coefficient (log Kow) and molecular weight (MW), combined with molecular docking analysis, revealed that both passive and active transport were involved in the skin exposure of QACs. By integrating sweat leaching and 3D-HSE data, estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of total QACs were 1.82 ng/kg bw/d for dry clothing, increasing to 96.9 ng/kg bw/d for sweaty clothing, while these values reached 51.3 and 1960 ng/kg bw/d in the high-exposure scenario, respectively. Finally, transcriptomics and lipidomics showed downregulation of keratinization and epidermal genes and broad depletion of structural and signaling lipids, consistent with impaired skin integrity and immune activation. These results identify textiles as a significant sweat-mediated exposure source and demonstrate chain-length-dependent dermal kinetics and toxicity of QACs."

The kinetic and mechanisms of PAR reactions with dissolved organic matter (DOM), a major sink and reactive matrix in natural waters, have been poorly understood. In this study, we quantitatively characterized the reactivity of PAR toward diverse DOM isolates using a competitive kinetic method. The second-order rate constants between PAR and DOM isolates (kPAR,DOM) were determined, ranging from (4.0 ± 0.2) × 101 to (4.0 ± 0.2) × 102 L mgC–1 s–1 at pH 7.3. Our results demonstrated that phenolic moieties are the dominant PAR-reactive sites in DOM. The measured kPAR,DOM values correlated strongly with bulk DOM properties, including the phenolic content, electron-donating capacity (EDC), and optical E2/E3, enabling empirical prediction of DOM reactivity toward PAR. Beyond quenching, DOM exhibited dual effects on PAR-mediated contaminant oxidation. Anilines or phenols with an electron-drawing group (e.g., −CN and −Cl) were inhibited through back reduction of their radical cations by DOM, while those with an electron-donating group (e.g., −CH3) were promoted through secondary oxidation by reactive DOM-derived intermediates (RIsDOM). These findings establish the first comprehensive kinetic framework for PAR–DOM reactions in aquatic environments."

To facilitate intraurban studies in Denver, Colorado, we developed land use regression models for seven species─copper (Cu), iron (Fe), titanium (Ti), zinc (Zn), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg). As part of the Healthy Start Cohort study, we collected filter-based PM2.5 using personal air samplers at 67 locations across Denver. Sample collection occurred from May 2018 through March 2019, accounting for all meteorological seasons. Exposure models were informed by 83 geospatial covariates, with traffic-related predictors as the strongest and most consistent across models. Model performance was evaluated using 10-fold cross validation and overall, varied by sampling campaign and season, with R2 values ranging from 0 to 0.63. At best, our model predicts Cu and Fe during fall (R2 = 0.56 and 0.63, respectively); whereas it fails to capture species unrelated to traffic year-round (R2 < 0.40). This highlights the influence of missing predictors (e.g., wildfire smoke, atmospheric transport and other meteorological factors) on PM2.5 concentrations and spatial gradients. Despite limitations, resulting models enable estimation of intraurban metal exposures and support future analyses of long-term health impacts in Denver."

There has been growing interest in relying less on accounting-style methods and more on direct emissions measurements. However, translating raw emission measurement data, whether from continuous monitoring systems, aerial flyovers, or operational cause analyses, into emissions inventories is nontrivial, and inventory numbers published by operators often lack any information about the methodology used to produce them. In this paper, we introduce the concept of a comprehensive measurement-based emissions inventory, which represents all emissions across the entire time frame, across all assets, and of all emission sizes for the target scope. We introduce practical extrapolation methods to account for incomplete measurement data across time, space, and emission sizes and focus on the impact that different extrapolation methods can have on the resulting emissions estimate. Understanding these methods is essential to create defensible and comparable emissions inventory reports that adhere to reporting frameworks such as Veritas and the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0."

However, existing research primarily focuses on their acute toxicity using high doses, overlooking chronic low-dose exposure scenarios (more relevant to real environments) and the potential indirect effects mediated by gut microbiota (GM). Here, we compared the acute and chronic effects of AgNPs on Daphnia magna, examining survival, reproduction, GM alterations, and metabolic profiles. We found that acute exposure led to immediate mortality and metabolic disruptions, primarily affecting lipid and amino acid metabolism, whereas chronic exposure caused more severe reproduction failure and broader metabolic alterations, including changes in amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, energy production, and neural function. Both exposures disrupted GM composition, increasing Proteobacteria and decreasing Bacteroidetes, with chronic exposure causing more severe and lasting dysbiosis. Multiomics correlation analysis revealed that the GM plays a critical role in mediating AgNP-induced metabolic disturbances. Overall, our study highlights the differential toxicological effects of acute versus chronic AgNP exposure and underscores the importance of considering both the direct effects of nanoparticles on the host and the indirect effects mediated through the GM when assessing nanoparticle health risks. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of AgNP toxicity and emphasize the need for integrated approaches in environmental risk assessment."

However, current research has largely centered on polystyrene NPs (PS NPs), which constitute only a minor portion of total NPs in freshwater environments. In this study, we applied a toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TK-TD) modeling framework to comparatively assess the accumulation, elimination, and toxicity of four polymer types of NPs (PS, polyvinyl chloride [PVC], poly(methyl methacrylate) [PMMA], and polycarbonate [PC]; all ∼ 80 nm) in Daphnia magna. Aggregation-induced-emission fluorogen labeling enabled precise tracking of NPs. Our findings revealed clear polymer-type-dependent differences: D. magna accumulated and eliminated PMMA and PC NPs more efficiently than PS and PVC NPs. Toxicity followed the order: PS > PVC > PMMA > PC. Transcriptomic analyses indicated that NPs disrupt nutrient digestion, oxidative stress responses, and nervous system function. Using TK-TD modeling, we further predicted the time-dependent median lethal concentrations (LC50) and no-effect concentrations (NEC) for the NPs. The 48-h LC50 values for PS, PVC, PMMA, and PC NPs were 15.0, 43.1, 66.5, and 389.7 mg L–1, respectively, while the corresponding NECs were 4.5, 7.0, 13.5, and 60.0 mg L–1.

A distinct emission and density depletion occurs between 190° ${}^{\circ}$–240° ${}^{\circ}$W, possibly reflecting magnetic topology influences, analogous to ionospheric dark regions at Jupiter.

Recent field observations reveal a systematic three‐phase evolution in BC coating thickness during plume aging: rapid initial growth, quasi‐equilibrium, and gradual coating loss. Current models misrepresent this evolution due to oversimplified treatment of organic aerosol volatility. Here we demonstrate that incorporating semi‐volatile organic partitioning through the MATRIX‐VBS model fundamentally improves simulation accuracy compared to traditional non‐volatile approaches. Evaluation against four field campaigns spanning fresh to aged plumes shows MATRIX‐VBS successfully captures the observed three‐phase pattern, and global application reveals universal three‐phase evolution with substantial regional variations. These advances address critical gaps in aerosol mixing state representation and provide essential improvements for climate model predictions in wildfire‐affected regions."

Using high‐precision measurements from the Sanya incoherent scatter radar, we discovered a previously overlooked decrease in electron temperature. We report a daytime event and a nighttime event. During daytime, the electron temperature first decreased sharply by ∼650 K within 5.5 min, then increased by ∼1000 K before gradually recovering over ∼1 hr. Multi‐beam observations indicated that this cooling was localized near the rocket trajectory, much narrower than the accompanying electron density depletion. Moreover, the ion temperature increased by 550 K. The nighttime electron and ion temperatures decreased by ∼450 and ∼150 K, respectively, without subsequent electron temperature increase. Analysis indicated that these temperature perturbations resulted from the initial expansion cooling following the exhaust injection and the subsequent hole formation, which disrupted the thermal equilibrium in the ionosphere."

While the plasma instrument, PLS, could have provided an independent density measurement and resolved ambiguity in the PWS analysis, calibrated PLS data were never published from E12. Here we present high‐resolution (∼18 s) PLS moments and velocity distributions from E12. Plasma densities near closest approach were between 398±72cm−3 $398\mathit{\pm }72\,{\text{cm}}^{-3}$ (assuming m/q=16 $m/q=16$) and 563±103cm−3 $563\mathit{\pm }103\,{\text{cm}}^{-3}$ (assuming m/q=32 $m/q=32$), in agreement with the original interpretation of PWS densities by Kurth et al. (2001, https://doi.org/10.1016/s0032‐0633(00)00156‐2). We thus discount a plume encounter. PLS measurements near Europa imply a highly asymmetrical and inhomogeneous ionosphere (as expected).

In this study, we assess how this relationship is represented in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) at low (110 km), high (25 km), and ultra‐high (3.25 km, SCREAM) resolutions, using the Stage IV and IMERG data as observational references. The convection‐permitting SCREAM performs well in capturing the EPI variations with temperature and saturation deficit under a wide range of atmospheric saturation levels. When the near‐surface atmosphere is close to saturation, observations show a continuous increase in EPI with temperature, a pattern qualitatively well reproduced by SCREAM, although its short simulation of 40 days limits the range of temperature variation needed for a quantitative scaling rate comparison. In contrast, E3SM at 110 and 25 km resolutions produces an increase of EPI with temperature, followed by an erroneous negative scaling at high temperatures, even in saturated conditions. These comparisons are robust across all sample regions covering the midlatitudes, tropics, high altitudes, and mountainous areas, revealing that unless the spatial resolution is high enough to resolve deep convection, model physics dominates over spatial resolution in improving the performance in capturing the emergent relationship between EPI and the environmental drivers. Among other factors, our analyses indicate that the biased EPI scaling with temperature in the low‐ and high‐resolution E3SM simulations might be related to deficiencies in parameterizing the dependence of atmospheric convection on relative humidity."

The flashes occurred in two summer thunderstorms in Florida and were bipolar in that some of the strokes (leader/return‐stroke sequences) in a given flash transported to ground positive charge, while others transported negative charge. Positive strokes tended to have higher NLDN‐reported peak currents and all terminated essentially on the ground surface, each time forming a new channel. Negative strokes tended to terminate on tall towers and all that did so produced characteristic wideband E‐field signatures that exhibited oscillations after the initial peak. Additionally, we examined a negative flash composed of seven strokes all of which terminated on a tall tower. There were a total of three tall (451–497 m) towers involved, with one of them (497‐m tall) being strike object for each of the four flashes examined here. The maximum GLM group energy for positive strokes was one to two orders of magnitude higher than for negative strokes. The oscillating E‐field signatures are indicative of bouncing current waves that are manifestations of the transient response of a tall object to the lightning‐caused excitation at or near its top (e.g., Rakov, 2001, https://doi.org/10.1109/15.974646); it is due to impedance discontinuities at the lightning attachment point and at the ground.

Understanding how rising temperatures influence VPD dynamics is therefore crucial in the context of global warming. In this study, we reconstructed April–August VPD variability from 1864 to 2022 using a composite tree‐ring stable carbon (δ13C) and oxygen (δ18O) isotope chronology derived from Chinese pine (Pinus tabuliformis) in Eastern China, a typical monsoon region. Our reconstruction shows that VPD from 1864 to 2022 has generally increased, and the drying trend is more significant since 1955. This accelerated VPD rise is attributed to both increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation, with temperature being the dominant driver. Future projections from the IPSL‐CM6A‐LR model, validated against our reconstruction, point to a marked and sustained increase in VPD across all four scenarios over the next century, thereby constituting a fundamental threat to regional ecosystems."

Here we introduce the first record of 60 million avalanche deposits across 10,701 small catchments, compiled from 33 years of Landsat data from 1990 until 2022 using a snow index. Potential damages from avalanches in areas at risk in HMA include nearly 20% of the buildings and up to 22% of the road network annually blocked by deposits temporarily disconnecting villages from food, energy, medicine, and communication infrastructures. Across 85% of HMA, no long‐term trends of deposits were detected due to variable snow and temperature during winter. Nonetheless, in 15% of the 214 larger aggregated catchments comprising HMA, the number of deposits increased by 10 every year. Multivariate analysis among these increases of deposits and winter snow and temperature parameters from reanalysis data revealed that a few areas of western HMA experienced increases in snow water equivalent (5 mm in three decades) and air temperature (2°C) contributing to the increase of avalanche activity. There, a decrease in snowfall of 50 mm, with an increase of rainfall, contributed to the formation of weak and unstable snowpacks. Most deposit trends could not be explained by snow‐temperature variables because of the complex and variable interactions between avalanches and climate. These results call for an adoption of mitigation measures in HMA to address avalanche impacts on infrastructure and human lives, especially in areas where avalanche occurrence may increase with time due to climate tendencies."

 Ultrathin, broadband microwave absorbing materials (MAMs) are crucial for weight-sensitive and space-constrained applications. This study introduces the electromagnetic frequency dispersion coefficient (EFDC), a synergistic dielectric-magnetic parameter that moves beyond conventional complex mechanisms. Our model directly links EFDC to microwave absorption (MA) performance, guiding the design of advanced MAMs. By optimizing EFDC, we achieved an ultra-wide effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 7.04 GHz at 1 mm and 9.28 GHz at 1.3 mm. Moreover, the temperature invariance of EFDC ensures consistent MA performance from 298 K to 473 K, despite the differing thermal responses of permittivity and permeability. This principle outlines a systematic design strategy for fabricating ultrathin and broadband MAMs, establishing a robust framework for developing high-attenuation absorbers suitable for complex frequency and thermal environments.

 Viewing urban spatial structure from a three-dimensional (3D) perspective provides important insights for environmental sustainability. While existing studies mainly examine 3D built-up volume, the spatial distribution of vertical growth remains insufficiently understood. This study investigates centrality and intensity of vertical expansion in newly urbanized areas. Using multi-source remote sensing data, we develop a Centrality Index (CI) and an Intensity Index (II) to characterize 3D urban expansion and compare it with conventional two-dimensional (2D) measures. Results show that: (1) 3D expansion is generally more centralized than 2D expansion. (2) Vertical growth is stronger in the Global South; however, Global South cities outside China, especially in Africa, often demonstrate low 3D centrality. (3) 3D expansion patterns are closely associated with natural and socioeconomic conditions and display strong path dependency. As urbanization shifts toward Africa and South Asia, prevalent low-centrality patterns may improve land-use efficiency but increase commuting-related carbon emissions.

 Prostate cancer lineage plasticity is associated with changes in DNA methylation and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) activity. How these epigenetic programs functionally interact to modulate transcriptional reprogramming in neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is not well understood. In this study, we demonstrate that hypomethylated regions of DNA preferentially accumulate the repressive mark, H3K27me3. We established an NEPC mouse model with deletion of Ezh2 in the background of Pten and Rb1 loss plus human MYCN overexpression. Deletion or pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 in NEPC murine or patient-derived models leads to a genome-wide rewiring of DNA methylation, characterized by hypomethylation and upregulation of neuroendocrine-lineage genes along with hypermethylation and repression of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) targets. On the other hand, deletion of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) results in significant changes in H3K27me3 distribution, particularly affecting bivalent promoters bearing both H3K27me3 and active H3K4me3 marks. In NEPC models, neuroendocrine-lineage genes are repressed upon DNMT1 deletion associated with increased H3K27me3. Conversely, in prostate adenocarcinoma models, DNMT1 deletion leads to de-repression of neuroendocrine lineage genes with a loss of H3K27me3 marks. Our findings reveal a functional interplay between two repressive epigenetic machineries that mediates lineage plasticity in prostate cancer. In this study, the authors identify a collaboration between the epigenetic regulators, EZH2 and DNA methyltransferase that contributes to prostate cancer lineage reprogramming."

Here the authors genetically engineer an optoswitch that enables photo-induced complementation of an albino mutant restoring transcription and chloroplast biogenesis on demand. 
 Photosynthesis genes in plant chloroplasts are transcribed by the plastid-encoded RNA polymerase called PEP. Consequently, PEP-deficient mutants cannot generate a photosynthetic apparatus and develop non-viable albino seedlings. Inducible complementation of such mutants thus could provide interesting insights in PEP action and chloroplast biogenesis. Here we show the effects of photo-inducible complementation in the albino Arabidopsis mutant pap7-1 using a red/blue optoswitch with monochromatic LEDs. Expression of a blue-light-induced PAP7 construct that is silent under red light reconstitutes PEP at any time point of pap7-1 development resulting in proper chloroplast biogenesis that rescues the non-viable mutant. Induction of chloroplast biogenesis, however, can only occur in very young leaf tissues indicating the existence of a cell-autonomous, biogenic coupling between cell and organelle development. We further uncover that initial PEP formation and function is independent of photosynthesis. The optoswitch termed blue-light valved biogenesis opens experimental avenues to study non-viable plant mutants. Plants require the plastid encoded RNA polymerase PEP to generate viable photosynthetic apparatus. Here the authors genetically engineer an optoswitch that enables photo-induced complementation of an albino mutant restoring transcription and chloroplast biogenesis on demand."

Here, the authors show this expansion is part of a global cycle of currents and plasma flows shaped by dayside and nightside reconnection. 
 Geomagnetic substorms transfer solar wind energy into the planetary magnetosphere and ionosphere, producing auroral displays and ground magnetic disturbances, particularly intense during the expansion phase. Despite decades of study, the mechanisms governing the expansion phase remain unresolved. Based on coordinated observations of storm-time intense substorms, we reveal that substorm expansion is temporally embedded within a global cycle of field-aligned currents and auroral electrojets, coupled to large-scale plasma convection. The cycle manifests as a coherent movement of current peaks across magnetic longitude and latitude—first antisunward and equatorward, then sunward and poleward—and coincides with enhanced sunward ionospheric convection. This cycle involves two components of the auroral electrojets: the convection-driven DP-2 current and the expansion-phase DP-1 substorm current. The antisunward-equatorward phase, corresponding to intervals of dominant dayside reconnection, begins with DP-2 and can stepwise transition into DP-1. During the subsequent sunward-poleward phase, reflecting intervals of dominant nightside reconnection, DP-1 either persists from the earlier interval or develops within this phase. These observations show that expansion onset can occur under dominance of either dayside or nightside reconnection, while the full development of DP-1 generally involves nightside reconnection, providing insight into substorm evolution. Geomagnetic substorms abruptly release energy, producing intense auroras and magnetic disturbances during an expansion phase. Here, the authors show this expansion is part of a global cycle of currents and plasma flows shaped by dayside and nightside reconnection."

 Although most patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) receiving CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy achieve remission, loss of CAR T cell functionality and subsequent relapse remains an unmet therapeutic need. Herein, we apply an integrative approach to study the immunometabolism of pre- and post-infusion CD19-CAR T cells of patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL. Pre-infusion CAR T cells of long-term responders (LTR) have increased oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid oxidation, and pentose phosphate pathway activities, higher mitochondrial mass, tighter cristae, and lower mTOR expression compared to products of short-term responders. Post-infusion CAR T cells in bone marrow (BM) of LTR have high immunometabolic plasticity and mTOR-pS6 expression supported by the BM microenvironment. Transient inhibition of mTOR during manufacture induces metabolic reprogramming and enhances anti-tumor activity of CAR T cells. Our findings provide insight into immunometabolic determinants of long-term response and suggest a therapeutic strategy to improve long-term remission.

 The extent of ice-free land across Antarctica will increase in a warming world, driven by ice sheet retreat and sea-level change. Here we project an up to ~120,000 km2 (~550%) increase in the extent of Antarctic ice-free land over the next three centuries, using a state-of-the-art sea level model combined with ice sheet melt predictions for a range of greenhouse gas emission scenarios. New ice-free land is projected to emerge in all regions with existing territorial claims as well as in the unclaimed sector in West Antarctica. The geologic setting and distribution of known mineral occurrences indicate that ice-free land emergence will expose new mineral deposits in these regions. With the likely rise in the economic viability of Antarctic mineral resources over the coming centuries, the environmental impacts of mineral resource extraction activities will be weighed against societal pressure for sustainable resource development.

 The spatial heterogeneity of meteoroid impact flux has shaped the space weathering environment across the lunar surface, driving key evolutionary processes such as crater degradation, regolith gardening, and soil grain exposure. This study investigates the spatial weathering environment of the Chang’E-6 (CE-6) landing site using a comprehensive approach combining remote sensing analysis, gardening simulations, and soil measurements. Our results reveal that meteoroid fluxes at sub-meter scales exhibit remarkable similarity between the lunar nearside and farside over million-year timescales, resulting in analogous regolith gardening and crater degradation patterns. Lunar soil samples primarily originate from an impact ~17.5 Myr ago. Soil gardening simulations estimate a grain exposure duration of ~1.54 Myr, consistent with the measured exposure age of 1.76 ± 0.88 Myr. These findings demonstrate that the exposure history of CE-6 lunar soil grains is principally governed by the most recent major impact event.

 Microbial-driven processes, particularly denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), convert inorganic nitrogen (N) in soils into gaseous forms, causing substantial N losses. However, their responses to global change across ecosystem types remain unclear. Here, we synthesized global data on denitrification and anammox from experiments examining major global change factors (GCFs), including elevated CO2, N addition, warming, and altered precipitation. Our analysis shows that N addition markedly stimulated both processes, and warming enhanced denitrification. On average, multiple GCFs exerted stronger effects on N-loss processes than single or two GCFs. These effects are ecosystem dependent, with croplands being the most affected, particularly under N addition. Furthermore, the sensitivity of N-loss processes to each GCF varies greatly among ecosystems and is largely explained by local climate and soil conditions. Our findings reveal accelerated soil N losses under multifactor global change and offer insights for improving future N-cycle predictions and sustainable N management.

 The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite altimetry mission, with its high spatial resolution and global coverage, offers unprecedented opportunities for studying coastal environments. Although primarily designed for observing open ocean and inland water bodies, recent studies have demonstrated its ability to capture intertidal topography at low tide. One key challenge in such applications lies in separating intertidal pixels from water ones, as current SWOT classification lacks a dedicated intertidal class. This study introduces a standalone methodology that relies exclusively on SWOT level-2 High Resolution (HR) pixel cloud dataset. Intertidal pixels are identified using a simple approach based on the probability distribution function (PDF) of sea surface height anomalies relative to a nearby reference open water point. This method was applied to the macro-tidal, geographically complex coastal region of Pertuis Charentais along the French Atlantic coast. Validation against airborne LiDAR topography shows good agreement, with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) below 30 cm for both single-cycle and temporally stacked SWOT observations. Performance was consistent across different bottom types, with highest accuracy over low slope (<1°) muddy and sandy bottoms and moderate degradation over rocky bottoms. Elevation profile analysis suggests that SWOT has a potential for detecting spatiotemporal morphological evolution in highly dynamic environments. While single-cycle observations are limited by inherent interferometric noise, annual stacks show promises in resolving long-term changes. These findings highlight SWOT's potential to fill key observational gaps in intertidal mapping, supporting coastal morphodynamic studies, hydrodynamic modeling and climate resilience efforts in data-sparse or rapidly evolving environments."

 Remote sensing technology development has facilitated the emergence of numerous vegetation-related indicators, which may reflect the hydrological and sediment transport processes operating at different scales. However, few studies have investigated which vegetation-related indicator can best capture the variability in runoff and sediment discharge at multiple time scales, especially in ecologically fragile karst regions where the relationship between vegetation and hydrological process is highly complex and variable. To address this issue, five satellite-derived vegetation-related indicators (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Kernel Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (kNDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF)) were selected to assess their associations with runoff and sediment discharge across six karst catchments in Southwest China during 2003–2020, and these associations were conducted in nine karst catchments of France and Central United States to validate the findings of this study. The Mann–Kendall trend test results indicated a significant increasing trend in vegetation, whereas sediment discharge generally exhibited a decreasing trend. Continuous Wavelet Transform analysis detected significant cyclic oscillations in runoff (9-13 months) and vegetation-related indicators (8-16 months), but no persistent periodicity was observed for sediment discharge. The Cross Wavelet Transform and Wavelet Coherence analyses were then applied across all 15 karst catchments. The proportion of areas showing significant coherence between vegetation and runoff ranged from 4% to 33%, whereas this proportion between vegetation and sediment ranged from 6% to 29%. Subsequently, the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution was employed to evaluate the relative explanatory capacity of hydrological variables for vegetation-related indicators. The results identified SIF as the most effective explanatory variable for both river runoff and sediment in global karst areas. These findings provide new insights into the complex relationships between vegetation and hydrological processes in karst catchments and offer valuable guidance for improving water and soil resource management strategies."

 Accurate assessment of grassland ecosystem structural and functional indicators, such as percent canopy cover (CC) and aboveground biomass (AGB), are crucial for sustainable rangeland management. Conventional CC and AGB mapping studies lack extrapolation robustness and induce uncertainty as they upscale limited in situ samples to broad spatial extents. Therefore, we proposed and tested a spatial cross-scale approach. We integrated small unoccupied aerial systems (sUAS) imagery as a bridge to upscale in situ data to satellite-based estimates across Mongolia (MN) and Kazakhstan (KZ). We sampled in situ herbaceous CC (%) and AGB (g/m2) and conducted sUAS overflights in 84 sites (n = 252) across two provinces in KZ (North to South gradient in 2022) and dominant grassland steppe types of MN (East to West gradient in 2023). We employed a random forest (RF) regression model first to scale up quadrat-based field estimates to site scale (3.5 cm resolution) using spectral-textural-structural metrics from drone imagery and then to regional-scale (10 m resolution) using predictor variables from Sentinel-2 imagery and environmental covariates from various satellite sensors. We derived per-pixel uncertainty estimates to quantify the reliability of CC and AGB predictions. Results showed superior RF model performance during the cross-scale approach with an estimated R2 (RMSE) of 0.83 (10.4%) and 0.83 (31.74 g/m2) for upscaling CC and AGB estimates, respectively, from quadrat-to-site and 0.85 (5.14%) and 0.69 (31.8 g/m2) from site-to-regional. Notably, the cross-scale approach improved predictions over the conventional approach, with 44.0% and 43.7% lower RMSEs for CC and AGB, respectively.

 Accurate delineations of Earth’s surface features are crucial for environmental science, but for dynamic landscapes like thawing permafrost, these datasets rapidly become outdated and inaccurate. Manual refinement of these outdated labels is prohibitively slow, while existing foundation segmentation models often fail to accurately segment complex natural features in satellite images. To address this, we aim to use inaccurate labels as geospatial priors to prompt a vision foundation model for zero-shot semantic segmentation of Earth observation objects with current satellite imagery. We developed an interactive segmentation framework that synergistically combines the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with expert oversight. Our system features two components: (1) a scalable automated pipeline that uses historical delineations as a strong geospatial prior for prompting SAM, and (2) an interactive tool that enables experts to refine outputs and create new, high-fidelity labels rapidly. Using the challenging case study of retrogressive thaw slumps, we demonstrate that this human–AI partnership achieves robust segmentation performance, with a best Intersection over Union of 0.80 ± 0.10 for routine updates. This approach matches the quality of manual expert digitisation but at twice the efficiency. This model- and task-agnostic framework offers a practical, transferable solution for generating the dense, time-series data required to monitor landscape changes, transforming a laborious mapping task into an AI-assisted, expert-overseen workflow."

 Water scarcity and unprecedented rapid depletion of groundwater reserves are challenges for global sustainable agricultural development. Understanding water usage is especially critical in key agricultural production regions. In this study, we focus on the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Plain (LMAP) region, one of the most important intensive agricultural regions in the United States and facing severe groundwater depletion. However, the total consumptive water use and its relationships with drought events across different land cover types remain a key unknown in this region. Here we use recently developed field-scale monthly evapotranspiration (ET) data from OpenET to investigate water use dynamics over multiple years under various drought conditions. Water use patterns for soybeans, corn, cotton, rice, and surrounding forests are analyzed, with drought impacts assessed using the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM). The results show that the water consumption for all four crops peaks in July, but early-season patterns differ by crop type and water use practices. Rice shows the highest average total ET for the growing season (688 mm), while cotton has the lowest (612 mm). In comparison, forest ET is higher than crop ET in the LMAP and also shows a seasonal peak in July. Crops show higher variability in ET than forests during the growing season, with larger differences in standard deviation in drought years. Across the three mid-drought years during the study period, groundwater consumption by the four major crops exceeded that of forests by an average of 109 m3 per growing season. Anomalies in ET normalized by reference ET (fRET), a metric of evaporative stress, exhibited rapid response to drought as USDM drought severity intensified, demonstrating the potential of remote-sensing ET metrics for early drought detection. This study utilizes the OpenET dataset to analyze vegetation water use patterns at field scale (30 m), highlighting its value for detailed, spatially explicit monitoring of crop water dynamics and drought impacts and providing critical information for regional water accounting for the development of sustainable agriculture and effective water resources management in agriculture-intensive and drought impacted regions."

 Accurately distinguishing between natural forests and planted forests underpins effective biodiversity monitoring and climate policy, yet their spectral similarity and limited reference data challenge large-scale classification efforts. This study focuses on Guangxi Province, China, combining Sentinel-2 imagery, multi-source ecological indicators—including vegetation traits such as leaf chlorophyll content and LAI—and over 12 million visually interpreted forest stands to map the distribution of natural and planted forests. We assessed pixel- and object-based classification models under various sample scenarios, with accuracy independently validated using additional samples interpreted from high-resolution Google Earth imagery. Model evaluation relied primarily on random splits, supplemented with spatially stratified validation across ecological sub-regions to assess spatial generalization. Results show that the object-based random forest classifier achieved the highest accuracy (OA: 84.52%, F1: 84.04%), with topographic and vegetation functional traits as key predictors. Spatially, natural forests dominate mountainous zones, while planted forests prevail in flatter areas. This work delivers the first 10 m resolution forest type map for Guangxi based on a uniquely large training and validation dataset and demonstrates that combining functional traits with robust sampling improves classification performance. Our framework supports scalable forest monitoring and contributes to improved management and conservation strategies."

 Driven by global carbon neutrality initiatives, China’s rapid expansion of photovoltaic (PV) power generation necessitates large-scale and precise extraction of photovoltaic power stations (PPS) for effective resource management. However, in 10 m resolution remote sensing imagery, PPS targets frequently exhibit multi-scale and fragmented spatial distributions. Such characteristics often lead to limited model generalization, high omission rates, and elevated commission errors, particularly under sparse-sample conditions. To address these challenges, this study introduces PPS-SAM, a spectrum- and structure-aware extraction framework developed for sparse-sample scenarios based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM). PPS-SAM integrates a Spectral Enhancement Encoder to fuse near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave-infrared (SWIR) bands, thereby improving the spectral separability of PV targets from heterogeneous backgrounds. It also incorporates a High-Quality Mask Decoder to maintain edge integrity and delineate fragmented arrays more effectively. Evaluated on a newly developed 10 m multispectral PPS dataset (MSPV-Dataset), PPS-SAM demonstrated robust segmentation performance with only 11 training samples (F1: 91.47% ± 0.13%; mIoU: 91.40% ± 0.08%), notably surpassing baseline models trained on the complete 634-sample dataset. Ablation and generalization assessments indicate the effectiveness of each module in enhancing foreground detection and background suppression, with stable performance across diverse, unseen terrains and environmental disturbances (F1: 92.19%; mIoU: 92.19%). Applying this framework, nationwide PPS distribution maps for 2022 and 2024 were generated (excluding distributed rooftop systems). The results indicate that the total PPS area expanded from 3,486.41 km2 to 5,900.89 km2, representing an increase of approximately 70%. Regional analysis shows that Northwest China was characterized by predominantly centralized growth (78.77%), whereas eastern and southwestern regions exhibited significant distributed expansion. Although national spatial clustering weakened slightly (Global Moran’s I decreased from 0.4155 to 0.3112), it intensified within central and southwestern provinces. Land-use transition analysis suggests that new PV installations primarily originated from grasslands (59.04%) and barren lands (96.40%), highlighting substantial land-cover conversion. These spatio-temporal patterns underscore regional disparities in PV expansion and shifting spatial structures. This study offers a robust methodological framework for high-precision PPS identification at 10 m resolution under sparse-sample constraints, supporting efficient renewable energy management and evidence-based policy formulation. The dataset is publicly available via Figshare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.29618429)."

 Predicting fine-grained population distribution is crucial for effective urban planning. However, existing models widely ignore Region-Distinctive Geographical Factors (RDGF) in regional population modeling. This omission may compromise prediction accuracy, particularly in coastal zones where over 50% of the global population. To address this gap, we proposed an RDGF-incorporated approach for fine-grained population prediction, using the coastal Pearl River Delta as a case study. Leveraging multi-source geospatial data, based on generalized geographical factors (GGF) (e.g., topography, POI density, nighttime light intensity, etc.), we supplemented multi-dimensional RDGF including ecology, agriculture and transportation, etc. derived from unique regional environments (e.g., distance to shoreline, aquaculture, ports, etc.). We employed an interpretable machine learning framework (Random Forest + SHAP) to model and explain factor contribution. Results demonstrate: (1) incorporating RDGF substantially improves prediction accuracy in both model performance (with the average R2 increasing by 6% under spatial cross-validation) and output (The relative error in densely populated areas can be reduced by up to 40%), thereby providing opportunity for more effective infrastructure planning and disaster risk management. (2) GGF still make the primary contribution to the model; however, RDGF are able to reveal local spatial heterogeneity and geographic decay patterns in population distribution, demonstrating greater potential for reducing prediction errors.

 The tidewater glacier in Marian Cove has retreated substantially toward the coastal cliffs over the past six decades. Using 19 satellite and aerial images from 1956 to 2022, we quantified frontal changes along 17 transects defined by glacier orientation and topography. The glacier exhibited a non-linear retreat pattern, alternating between phases of rapid retreat, slower retreat, and short advances. Mean retreat rates fluctuated from −10.8 to 178 m year−1 over the study period. From 1956 to 1978, the terminus remained stable while grounded on a shallow sill, but detachment from this topographic control initiated sustained retreat. The onset of major retreat coincided with a transition from negative to positive Southern Annular Mode (SAM) anomalies, which enhanced atmospheric warming and promoted oceanic heat delivery. Retreat accelerated during positive ocean and air temperature anomalies, whereas cooler phases slowed retreat. Variability across transects was strongly linked to bathymetry and vertical temperature stratification. Time series of surface elevation revealed land ice thinning after 2017, corresponding to the rapid retreat observed between 2017 and 2019. By integrating the longest record of glacier frontal change in Marian Cove with environmental observations, this study demonstrates how coupled fjord geometry–ocean–atmosphere interactions govern retreat behavior. These findings improve understanding of the sensitivity of tidewater glaciers in the northern Antarctic Peninsula under climate change."

 Urbanization in arid regions simultaneously intensifies air pollution and urban heat stress, yet their coupled interactions remain poorly understood. This study investigates the spatiotemporal relationships between land surface temperature (LST) and atmospheric pollutants in Urumqi, a representative arid-zone megacity of Northwest China, during 2019-2024 by integrating multi-source satellite retrievals and numerical simulations. MODIS LST and Sentinel-5P column pollutant data (O3, NO2, SO2, CO, CH2O) were analyzed using trend statistics and spatial autocorrelation methods. Results show that daytime LST exhibited a decreasing trend, whereas nighttime LST increased significantly, reflecting an enhanced nocturnal urban heat island. Pollutants displayed distinct seasonal cycles, with O3 increasing and NO2 declining over time. Bivariate Moran's I and Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) revealed that O3 exhibited the strongest positive spatial coupling with LST, especially at night, whereas NO2 and SO2 showed weaker and seasonally variable correlations. To explore mechanisms, WRF and WRF-Chem experiments for February 2023 indicate that ozone and co-emitted pollutants enhanced near-surface warming, leading to daytime temperature differences of about 0.4-1.6 °C and to ozone-linked nocturnal warming when O3 exceeds its multi-day mean. These results highlight ozone as a dominant driver of pollutant-temperature feedbacks in arid urban ecosystems and provide a quantitative basis for jointly managing air quality and urban heat risks in arid basin cities."

 On 18 August 2022, an exceptionally intense and fast-moving convective system crossed the western Mediterranean and parts of central Europe, causing widespread wind damage, large hail, and storm surges. Wind gusts exceeding 60 m/s were reported and the event exhibited the typical structure of a derecho, extending over 1000 km and resulting in 12 fatalities and over 100 injuries.This study provides a detailed analysis of the event's evolution and its impacts along the northwestern Italian coastal regions. The analysis is based on observational data, reports, and post-event surveys. The atmospheric characteristics conducive to the extreme event are reconstructed through high-resolution numerical simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, in a configuration that includes the assimilation of RADAR and lightning data (3DVAR). The simulations realistically reproduced the two main convective pulses that affected Liguria and northern Tuscany, capturing both the timing and the spatial distribution of maximum wind gusts (30–40 m/s) and rainfall.Post-event surveys documented wind damage up to EF2/IF2 intensity and confirmed the occurrence of downburst-like phenomena in Liguria. Soundings and model diagnostics indicated extreme instability (CAPE >4000 J/kg), strong low-level shear (> 40 m/s), and a dry mid-level layer favorable to intense downdrafts. A concurrent marine heatwave (SST anomalies up to +3 °C) likely enhanced low-level moisture fluxes and convective potential.The results emphasize that such marine heatwave–supported derechos represent a growing threat to Mediterranean coastal regions and highlight the need for improved short-term forecasting frameworks."

 The Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) provides high-resolution observations that contain cloud structure and distribution information. Previous studies have shown that all-sky assimilation of AGRI data can improve numerical weather prediction. However, the associated nonlinear and non-Gaussian characteristics still pose challenges. This study develops an assimilation framework based on the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) and the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) using the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) with the scatter capability that supports the all-sky satellite observations, and applies a Localized Particle Filter (LPF) method to assimilate the observation from FY-4A AGRI water vapor channels. A series of cycling assimilation experiments are conducted for the “23.7” extremely heavy rainfall event in northern China. Sensitivity experiments demonstrate that the localization and inflation strength are critical for LPF. In this case, the LPF performs better under all-sky than clear-sky, and exhibits superior performance with more reasonable hydrometeor adjustment and better simulation of rainfall compared to the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), which demonstrating the advantage of the LPF in handling non-Gaussian problems. Specifically, the precipitation skill scores in terms of equitable threat score and fraction skill score are improved by 5.3% (24.8%) and 2.6% (15.2%) respectively compared with the EnKF (LPF but under clear-sky). Such improvements are accompanied by more coordinated moisture, thermodynamic and dynamic conditions conducive to precipitation development. These results demonstrate the potential of LPF in all-sky infrared data assimilation."

 As a key indicator for water vapor, precipitable water vapor (PWV) presents the total atmospheric water vapor along a vertical column, but it cannot reflect the detailed information on the vertical distribution of water vapor. Various techniques, including radiosonde and GNSS tomography, have been developed to obtain the layer water vapor because of its important role in climate change and weather forecasting. However, high temporal-spatial and vertical resolution LPW data remain scarce due to the sparsity of the distribution of radiosonde stations, the limitation of detection time, and the instability of tomography algorithms. Therefore, this study generates refined layer precipitable water vapor (LPW), which is based on the numerical integral using the geostationary interferometric infrared sounder (GIIRS) mounted on FengYun-4B satellite (FY-4B). The performance comprehensively evaluated across seasonal, spatial, and climatic perspectives for conventional LPW and refined LPW using ERA5 reanalysis data as reference. The continental LPW shows RMSE of 3.50 / 1.72 / 2.03 / 1.27 mm for PWV, LPW low, LPW middle and LPW high. The refined LPW enhance the advantages of continental LPW, further provide vertical distribution of water vapor, and the RMSE ranged from 1.72 mm in sigma 0.9 to 0.01 mm in sigma 0.1. Although water vapor is generally slightly underestimated and the MAPE is marginally higher in the upper layers, strong overall accuracy and correlation are retained throughout the vertical layer. This study made the first attempt to retrieve more finer LPW from the FY-4B/GIIRS, which fill the data gap for high vertical resolution and more detailed water vapor information."

 Heatwaves are intensifying across the Middle East with distinct daytime and nighttime impacts. We quantify the climatology and trends of daytime, nighttime, and compound heatwaves using station observations for 2005 to 2025, and evaluate four AI-weather models for near-surface air temperature during a recent high-impact episode.Daytime heatwaves recur from the eastern Mediterranean through northern Iraq and Iran into Anatolia during warm seasons, whereas nighttime and compound events cluster along the southern Red Sea and Arabian Gulf coasts. Trends show significant summer and autumn increases across all classes (daytime: + 4.09 and + 6.09; nighttime: + 4.13 and + 6.22; compound: + 3.42 and + 2.40 per year), a winter increase led by nighttime events, and a spring increase in both nighttime and compound events, consistent with asymmetric diurnal warming, strong land–atmosphere coupling over arid interiors, and coastal humidity that limits nocturnal cooling.A case study of 10 to 27 June 2024 documents record-breaking daytime anomalies over the northern Middle East and persistent nocturnal warmth along maritime margins, with peak impacts around 17 June in the Mecca region.

 The implementation of PM2.5-focused control strategies in China has inadvertently contributed to the emergence of compound pollution, characterized by the co-occurrence of PM2.5 and O3 pollution. Biomass burning (BB) in Southeast Asia is a significant natural source of PM2.5 and Ozone (O3) in southwestern China. However, the regulatory mechanisms by which BB influences PM2.5 and O₃ concentrations remain poorly understood. In this study, a multi-source dataset together with the backward trajectory model and WRF-Chem were used to investigate the underlying mechanisms governing concurrent PM2.5 and O3 pollution. Four distinct pollution regimes were identified as: (1) PM2.5-dominated, (2) O3-dominated, (3) PM2.5-O3 pollution, and (4) clean episodes. HYSPLIT results reveal that both O3-dominated and PM2.5-O3 pollution regimes share consistent potential source regions, with >90% of air trajectories originating from northern India, southern Bangladesh, and northern Myanmar. The WRF-Chem simulations further demonstrate that BB contribute 96 μg/m3 to surface PM2.5 and 2 ppb to O3. Additionally, the enhanced atmospheric oxidation capacity, induced by elevated O3 concentrations, significantly promotes the formation of secondary inorganic aerosols, particularly sulfate (SO42‐), nitrate (NO3‐) and ammonium (NH4+), contributing substantially to PM2.5. Integrated process rate (IPR) analysis reveals that vertical mixing positively contributes to O3 enhancement, and chemical process shows greater impact on inland versus border cities. These findings establish a scientific basis for designing region-specific and optimized control strategies to address the intertwined compound pollution challenges in southwestern China."

 The quantitative effect of aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI) on O3 concentrations remains unclear after implementation of anthropogenic emission controls in recent years. This study investigates the effects of the aerosol-radiation interactions (ARI) and ACI on O3 concentrations during four PM2.5–O3 compound pollution episodes (Episode 1: 19–26 July 2019, Episode 2, 25 April to 2 May, Episode 3: 20–26 September, and Episode 4: 20–29 September 2022) in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (BTH) and Yangtze River Delta (YRD) by conducting sensitivity experiments using the USTC-version WRF-Chem model with an embedded integrated process rate (IPR) analysis scheme. Both ARI and ACI reduce daytime surface downward shortwave radiation (SWDOWN), but their spatial influence varies: ARI has a stronger effect in the BTH (2–89 W m−2) than in the YRD (1–42 W m−2), whereas ACI exerts a more substantial reduction in the YRD (2–89 W m−2) than in the BTH (1–45 W m−2). This reduced SWDOWN disrupts the near-surface energy balance, leading to lower 2-m temperatures, higher humidity, weakened convection, and a decreased planetary boundary layer height (PBLH). For liquid water path, ACI increases it (4–128 g m−2) which is much larger than the decrease (2–34 g m−2) induced by ARI. ARI and ACI consistently increase PM2.5 concentrations but decrease O3 levels. Averaged at all the compound pollution sites of the four episodes, ARI elevates PM2.5 more in the BTH (6.1 μg m−3, 15.7%), while ACI-induced PM2.5 enhancements are more pronounced in the YRD (7.0 μg m−3, 16.6%). The corresponding ARI-induced O3 reduction is 4.6 μg m−3 (5.4%) in the BTH and 2.3 μg m−3 in the YRD (2.9%), while the ACI-induced O3 reduction is more extensive in the YRD (4.9 μg m−3, 6.3%) than that in the BTH (2.6 μg m−3, 3.1%). ARI exerts a more pronounced influence in more polluted regions, while ACI has a more significant impact in cloud-covered areas. ARI and ACI significantly suppressed photolysis rates (J[O1D]) while elevating precursor (NOx, NOy, and VOCs) concentrations indicating that the suppression of photolysis rates and chemistry production as the primary reason for O3 reduction, which is also confirmed by IPR analysis. The IPR results further indicated that vertical mixing reduced surface O3 by facilitating its transport to middle altitudes. The study concludes that under future strict emission controls, the reduction in PM2.5 may weaken ARI and ACI, potentially increasing O3 concentrations predominantly clear sky or lightly clouded meteorological scenarios. Therefore, strengthening controls on O3 precursors and optimizing regional joint prevention mechanisms are crucial to counteract this risk."

A broad range of aromatic compounds, including benzene, were successfully transformed into their corresponding aromatic nitriles. Both experimental and computational evidence suggested that the reaction proceeds primarily via the in situ generation of •CN radicals from N2and CH4within the plasma zone. Subsequent radical addition to aromatic rings allowed the one-pot formation of aryl nitriles.

We find that the rhombohedral/tetragonal mixtures deliver the best results in most cases, mainly due to their low switching barriers and substantial local inhomogeneity. These results offer a detailed view of improved energy storage in relaxor ferroelectrics and provide theoretical guidance for designing high-performance capacitors."

Given the large-scale coupled variability of western boundary currents and extensions (WBCEs), further investigation into its seasonality, predictability, and potential future changes is needed. Observations and high-resolution climate simulations reveal distinctive covariance between North Pacific and North Atlantic WBCE sea surface temperatures during boreal summer, possibly linked to preceding Arctic sea-ice variability. Model simulations suggest that cold-season Greenland and Barents Sea ice loss enhances anomalous planetary-scale atmospheric waves and meridional jet shifts, contributing to summertime WBCE temperature anomalies. Although we show that summer WBCE covariability arises from intrinsic variability, future climate projections and targeted model experiments imply that this internal coupled variability may be modulated by radiatively forced changes. Our findings suggest that summer WBCE covariability has increased in the historical record but may weaken in response to future reductions in Arctic sea ice under higher radiative forcing."

Although the basal forebrain (BF) is known to modulate cortical activity and support attention, it remains unclear whether BF activity directly conveys an attention signal. Here, we show that selective attention to auditory and visual stimuli converges onto a shared population of noncholinergic BF neurons. Using a cross-modal task where rats rapidly switched attention between modalities, we found that these neurons responded strongly to attended targets but weakly to the same stimuli when ignored, regardless of modality. These effects closely tracked both task-driven and spontaneous attention shifts on a single-trial basis. Moreover, BF responses reflected the linear summation of attended and ignored inputs, suggesting that sensory streams are filtered in parallel before converging in the BF. These findings suggest that the BF may serve as a subcortical hub integrating attention signals across modalities to guide adaptive behavior."

Helicases emerged as the most commonly mutated cancer driver enzyme family, altered in two-thirds of all cancers. Functional screens and genomic analyses revealed that helicase dysfunctions contribute to genomic instability and faulty DNA repair. We observed a marked phenotype of Aquarius helicase (AQR), which was recurrently hemizygously deleted as an early clonal event in cancer genomes. These deletions were associated with high genomic instability and homologous recombination deficiency signatures. Furthermore, we found hemizygous loss to be a common tumor suppression mechanism among helicases, present in 35% of all cancers.

Although the role of RAD51 paralogs is well established in homologous recombination (HR)–mediated DNA repair, little is known about their role during replication stress responses.

CX3 complex suppresses R-loops, transcription-replication collisions (TRCs), and associated genome instability under physiological and replication stress conditions. Mechanistically, the CX3 complex physically interacts with FANCM and facilitates its recruitment to the R-loop sites to promote its resolution. Notably, cells expressing the RAD51C R258H pathological mutant exhibit defective interaction with FANCM and display inefficient R-loop processing. The CX3 complex–mediated R-loop resolution is independent of its fork maintenance function.

Furthermore, a 2.6-angstrom structure of C3bBb-properdin in complex with C3 uncovers unique substrate-binding features of C3bBb and properdin’s stabilizing role in the alternative pathway. These results offer comprehensive mechanistic insights into complement activation."

The co-chaperone Bag1 links Hsp70 to the 26Sproteasome, recruiting Hsp70-bound clients for proteasomal degradation. Here, we present cryo–electron microscopy structures of the Bag1-bound 26Sproteasome, revealing unprecedented conformational rearrangements within the 19Sregulatory particle. Bag1 binding to the Rpn1 induces a marked reconfiguration of AAA+adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) ring, disrupting its canonical spiral staircase and remodeling the central channel architecture. This reconfiguration generates a large cavity above the substrate entry gate of the 20Score particle. The conserved pore-2 loops of ATPases Rpt2 and Rpt5 play critical roles in opening of the 20Sgate, enabling substrate entry into proteolytic chamber independently of ubiquitination. These findings suggest a previously unknown mechanism of the proteasomal degradation, by which remodeling the central cavity and 20Sgate in the presence of Bag1, possibly bypassing the need for ubiquitination."

Here, we assess the potential of glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs)—archaeal lipid biomarkers—as a quantitative proxy for paleobathymetry. Analyzing a global dataset of marine surface sediments, we find that GDGT distributions exhibit systematic shifts with water depth. Using random forest machine learning models trained on combined isoGDGT and OH-GDGT profiles, we achieve high predictive performance (R2= 0.85, RMSE = 646 m). Applying this approach to a 6-million-year sedimentary record from the northwest Australian Shelf reproduces key features captured by foraminifera-based reconstructions and reveals tectonically driven bathymetric evolution, including potential influences on the development of the Leeuwin Current. These results demonstrate the GDGT-based machine learning models offer a robust and effective framework for reconstructing paleo-ocean depths and probing the links between oceanography and tectonics."

Chemosensation plays an essential role in larval settlement preferences. However, the mechanisms for sensing chemical cues underlying these preferences remain unknown. Using urochordate ascidian larvae, the prominent marine fouling organisms affecting coastal ecosystems, we explored the mechanism of larval chemosensation and its role in settlement preference. Here, we identified taurine, a specific sulfur-containing amino acid secreted from marine adult animals, as a chemical attractant for ascidian larvae to locate salubrious environments for metamorphosis. Taurine stimulates primary sensory neurons within larval papillae, and this neuronal excitation is integrated in the simple brain (also known as sensory vesicle) to elicit chemoattraction and attachment of swimming larvae. We discuss the implications of this study in the emerging field of marine Eco-Evo-Devo research by establishing a model system for understanding developmental mechanisms in the context of marine ecosystems and aquaculture. Of interest is the potential development of antifouling strategies by targeting taurine chemosensation."

Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) are critical for this defense, and their developmental progression and subset balance are essential for effective immune function. Here, we show that the nuclear receptor Nur77 helps control NKp46+ILC3 development in newborn mice. Mice lacking Nur77 have fewer ILC3s and failed to convert one ILC3 subtype (NKp46−) into a more protective form (NKp46+), reducing their ability to fightSalmonella entericaserovar Typhimurium infection. We found that 12R-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12R-HETE), a natural lipid found in the intestine, binds to Nur77 and boosts the expression of transcription factor T-box expressed in T cells (T-bet), promoting the shift to NKp46+ILC3s and increasing the production of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), a key immune molecule. This response is dependent on Nur77. Further analyses have revealed that Nur77 directly regulates a gene calledImpdh1, which supports this immune transition. Our findings uncover a Nur77-driven pathway that helps shape gut immunity in early life."

Here, we demonstrate that the glomerulus actively transcytoses circulating tumor-derived sEVs into urine. Using CRISPR guide RNA–tagged glioma sEVs and bioluminescent/fluorescent green-enhanced nano-lantern (GeNL)–tagged lung and pancreatic cancer sEVs, we tracked their journey from tumors to urine in multiple mouse models. In vivo and in vitro analyses revealed endocytic uptake and transcytotic release by glomerular cells, accompanied by changes in sEV size and surface composition. GeNL-tagged sEVs consistently showed higher signals in urine than plasma, indicating selective excretion. These findings redefine the glomerulus as a dynamic regulator of sEV processing and establish a mechanistic foundation for urinary liquid biopsy."

Here, we generated single-cell ATAC-seq profiles from patients with RCC and integrated them with three previously published datasets to identify chromatin programs in tumor cells. We identified an interferon response program enriched inBAP1-mutant tumors, and, in bulk ATAC-seq cohorts with linked clinical data, this program was associated with poor prognosis. Mechanistic analyses in isogenic models suggested thatBAP1loss induces a tumor-intrinsic interferon response, with dysregulated endogenous retroviruses as a potential upstream trigger. We further characterized theBAP1mutation–associated tumor microenvironment across single-cell, bulk, and multiplex immunofluorescence data, identifying features of both inflammation and immune evasion. Together, our findings nominate tumor-intrinsic interferon signaling as a candidate driver ofBAP1-associated aggressiveness in RCC and highlight immune evasion pathways as potential therapeutic targets."

This study presents a breakthrough in dual-range and precise pore size modulation of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) through a ligand functionalization strategy. By tailoring steric configurations and spatial orientations of light-responsive azobenzene groups, we achieved broad-range pore tuning (0.41 to 0.68 nanometers) via functional group length variation, coupled with subnanometer precision through reversible trans-to-cis photoisomerization. Four representative branched alkanes were selected to validate the MOF’s high selectivity. Results showed its capacity to generate a constant carbon-atom-count–dependent permeation gradient, realizing a four-step sequential separation that increased C6H14purity from 25 to 92.2%. This synergistic approach uniquely combines large-scale pore adjustment with dynamic fine-tuning, decoupling separation efficiency from energy-intensive processes. The membranes’ structural stability and reversible light responsiveness further highlight their potential for sustainable hydrocarbon processing. By integrating molecular design with stimuli-responsive control, this work advances MOF-based membranes as a transformative solution for energy-efficient petroleum fractionation and precise molecular sieving."

Here, we demonstrate the strategic repurposing of these nonidealities as functional resources for advanced stochastic analog computing. We leverage two underutilized phenomena—deep-level channel trap-induced generation-recombination (G-R) noise and impact ionization–induced negative differential resistance (NDR) in body current—which have received limited attention compared to the extensively studied 1/fnoise and monotonic drain current behavior in logic-centric transistors. By exploiting G-R noise with controllable temporal correlation and NDR with an unprecedented peak-to-valley ratio (2.78 × 104) within fully depleted silicon-on-insulator transistors fabricated in industry silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process, we achieve multifunctional analog computation at the single-device level. Our transistor seamlessly performs stochastic encryption, deterministic signal readout, and analog inversion simply through reconfiguration of applied bias conditions, thereby eliminating the need for peripheral random-number generators, dedicated analog inverters, or amplifiers. This approach not only reveals the previously unrecognized computational potential embedded in mature CMOS technologies but also presents a scalable and energy-efficient alternative to architecture based on exotic materials, laying the foundation for next-generation analog computing systems."

We found that gains of 1q were the second most common gain, occurring in 213 (39.8%) of PDACs. Single-cell analysis via fluorescence in situ hybridization on 33 cancers confirmed these results. A portion of 1q, rather than the entire 1q arm, was gained in 75 (14.0%) PDACs, allowing us to pinpoint two ~3-megabase regions of 1q that were nearly always gained. These two regions containedNCSTNandPSEN2, genes that code two subunits of the γ-secretase complex. Evaluation of 267 precancerous lesions revealed that extra copies ofNCSTNandPSEN2were common (49%) in noninvasive neoplasms (high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms), which are at relatively high risk for progression to PDACs, but uncommon (6%) in low-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesions, which have low malignant potential. We hypothesize that γ-secretase genes are genetically activated oncogenes in the early phases of pancreatic neoplasia."

The Fe-TiOX/titanium paper electrocatalyst achieves a faradaic efficiency of 74.3% with >60% GC selectivity at industrially relevant current densities (~100 milliamperes per square centimeter), stable for ~60 hours, which is a record high in electrochemical conversion of OX to GC. In situ spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that the Feδ-sites dynamically stabilize H* intermediates while inhibiting H2formation, while Ti3+sites form a σ─π coordination bond with the carbonyl oxygen in OX, lowering the energy barrier of the rate-determining step.

While the signaling lipid leukotriene B4 (LTB4) reinforces cellular polarity, how mechanical cues regulate its production remains unclear. We now show that cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α), which is essential for the synthesis of LTB4, functions as a nuclear curvosensor. cPLA2α responds to nuclear squeezing by localizing to ceramide-rich inner nuclear membrane microdomains and incorporating onto the exofacial surface of nuclear envelope–derived exosomes. This unique topology enables localized LTB4synthesis, which synchronizes calcium spikes, promotes myosin light chain II phosphorylation, and sustains polarity and directional persistence after constriction. In neutrophils passing through tight spaces, cPLA2α activity drives the chemotactic response to nuclear squeezing by promoting exosomal LTB4production and persistence after constriction. These findings uncover a cPLA2α-dependent mechanochemical axis linking nuclear architecture to chemotactic efficiency and offer alternative strategies to modulate inflammatory responses."

However, these water-soluble steroid drugs are rapidly cleared from the desired sites of action in the body, necessitating multiple doses. Therefore, the development of particle-based steroid medications that offer elongated therapeutic activity is of paramount medical importance. Accordingly, steroid microparticles were developed via three fabrication processes in this work, where a metal or an organic acid facilitates steroid microparticle formation. Particles fabricated using these methods exhibit consistent shape, size, and crystallinity. Furthermore, results from our coarse-grained computational model show that hydrogen bonding dictates steroid monomer-monomer interactions that determine overall particle shape and size. In addition, we demonstrate the ability to induce steroid particle formation and tune the morphology of steroid drug particles by replacing the C21 side group (tail) with chemical analogs.
