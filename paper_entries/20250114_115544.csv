10.5194/acp-25-397-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究的是利用大气中的CO2和放射性碳（Δ14CO2）反演欧洲地区化石燃料二氧化碳排放的方法。研究者使用Lund University Modular Inversion Algorithm (LUMIA)模型，结合CO2和Δ14CO2的合成观测数据，对欧洲地区的化石燃料排放进行估算。结果表明，该方法在观测网络密集的西欧和中欧地区能够准确估算化石燃料排放，而在观测覆盖率低的地区，例如南欧和不列颠群岛，估算精度较低。该研究使用了大气成分分析和反演建模技术，与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是卫星观测数据（尽管文中使用的是合成数据）和空气质量监测中的排放量估算。研究的目的是改进对化石燃料排放的估算，这对于评估各国减排目标的实现情况具有重要意义。,"['CO2', 'Δ14CO2', 'Fossil fuel emissions', 'Atmospheric composition', 'Inverse modeling', 'Satellite observations', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Emission estimation']",Carlos Gómez-Ortiz;Guillaume Monteil;Sourish Basu;Marko Scholze,A CO2–Δ14CO2 inversion setup for estimating European fossil CO2 emissions,"In this paper, we test new implementations of our inverse modeling tool to estimate the weekly and regional CO2 emissions from fossil fuels in Europe. We use synthetic atmospheric observations of CO2 and radiocarbon (14CO2) to trace emissions to their sources, while separating the natural and fossil CO2. Our tool accurately estimates fossil CO2 emissions in densely monitored regions like western/central Europe. This approach aids in developing strategies for reducing CO2 emissions. 
 Independent estimation and verification of fossil CO2 emissions on a regional and national scale are crucial for evaluating the fossil CO2 emissions and reductions reported by countries as part of their nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Top-down methods, such as the assimilation of in situ and satellite observations of different tracers (e.g., CO2, CO, Δ14CO2, XCO2), have been increasingly used for this purpose. In this paper, we use the Lund University Modular Inversion Algorithm (LUMIA) to estimate fossil CO2 emissions and natural fluxes by simultaneously inverting in situ synthetic observations of CO2 and Δ14CO2 over Europe. We evaluate the inversion system by conducting a series of observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs). We find that in regions with a dense sampling network, such as western/central Europe, adding Δ14CO2 observations in an experiment where the prior fossil CO2 and biosphere fluxes are set to zero allows LUMIA to recover the time series of both categories. This reduces the prior-to-truth root mean square error (RMSE) from 1.26 to 0.12 TgC d−1 in fossil CO2 and from 0.97 to 0.17 TgC d−1 in biosphere fluxes, reflecting the true total CO2 budget by 91 %. In a second set of experiments using realistic prior fluxes, we find that in addition to retrieving the time series of the optimized fluxes, we are able to recover the true regional fossil CO2 budget in western/central Europe by 95 % and in Germany by 97 %. In all experiments, regions with low sampling coverage, such as southern Europe and the British Isles, show poorly resolved posterior fossil CO2 emissions. Although the posterior biosphere fluxes in these regions follow the seasonal patterns of the true fluxes, a significant bias remains, making it impossible to close the total CO2 budget. We find that the prior uncertainty of fossil CO2 emissions does not significantly impact the posterior estimates, showing similar results in regions with good sampling coverage like western/central Europe and northern Europe. Finally, having a good prior estimate of the terrestrial isotopic disequilibrium is important to avoid introducing additional noise into the posterior fossil CO2 fluxes."

Our instrument was launched in 2018 and 2021 from Norway. The heaviest particles were detected around 80 km, while medium particles could be found even above 100 km. Our measurements show that different particles are formed and not just one predominating compound. The most likely compounds that form meteor smoke particles in our measurements are made up of oxides of iron, magnesium and silicon. 
 We present mass spectroscopic in situ data from rocket flights of two improved ion mass spectrometers in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere region. The instruments were optimized to detect large ions with a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z, mass) of up to m/z 2000 and 20 000 respectively, for analysis of meteor smoke particles. The flights were performed in the framework of the polar mesospheric winter echo (PMWE) campaigns, initiated and coordinated by the Leibniz Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP), to investigate polar mesospheric winter radar echoes in Andøya (Norway) in 2018 and 2021. Both flights were successful and allowed the mass number and chemical composition of charged meteor smoke particles to be investigated. We found a complex and diverse composition of positively and negatively charged molecules and particles within our mass range in a region that is notoriously difficult to get mass spectroscopic data from. While at altitudes below 85 km we observed negatively charged particles of up to several thousands of atomic mass units, above this altitude we found possible building blocks of these large particles that form right after their ablation from the parent meteorite material. In the first flight we detected no positively charged particles above m/z 100 and a difficult-to-interpret signal for negatively charged particles beyond our mass range of m/z 2000. In the second flight, however, we detected positively charged particles between around m/z 180 and 350 and a number of different negatively charged particles up to m/z 5500. Due to the very large mass range of m/z 20 000 used in the second flight and the subsequent lower mass resolution, unambiguous mass identification is not possible. A particular interesting pattern was found at 80.8 km of a compound that seems to double its mass around m/z 225, 450, 900 and 1800.Comparing our findings to proposed meteor smoke particle compounds by other authors, our observations would be consistent with magnetite, fayalite and forsterite. However, other possible compounds cannot be excluded."

The overall aerosol and water vapor impact on the Earth’s radiation budget for the whole period is negative (cooling, -0.82 ± 0.35 W m-2) and dominated by the aerosols. At the Earth’s surface, aerosols are the main drivers and produce a negative (cooling, -1.04 ± 0.36 W m-2) radiative impact. 
 This study attempts to quantify the radiative impact over Réunion Island (21° S, 55° E) in the southern tropical Indian Ocean of the aerosols and water vapor (WV) injected into the stratosphere by the eruption of the Hunga underwater volcano in the South Pacific on 15 January 2022 . Ground-based lidar and satellite passive instruments are used to parameterize a state-of-the-art radiative transfer (RT) model for the first 13 months after the volcano eruption. The descending rate of the aerosol volcanic plume is −8 m d−1. At this rate, aerosols are expected to be present in the stratosphere until the first half of 2025. The overall aerosol and water vapor impact on the Earth's radiation budget for the whole period is negative (cooling, −0.82 ± 0.35 W m−2) and dominated by the aerosol impact (∼ 95 %; the remaining ∼ 5 % is due to the water vapor). At the Earth's surface, aerosols are the main drivers and produce a negative (cooling, −1.04 ± 0.36 W m−2) radiative impact. Water vapor has hardly any radiative effect at the surface. Between the short-term (months 2 to 4 after the eruption, February–April 2022) and mid-term (months 5 to 14 after the eruption, May 2022–February 2023) periods, the aerosol and water vapor radiative effect at the surface and top of atmosphere (TOA) reduces by 22 % and 25 %, respectively. During the mid-term period, heating / cooling (H / C) rate profiles show a clear vertical difference locally in the stratosphere between the aerosol warming impact (18 to 26 km) and the water vapor cooling (22 to 30 km). The resulting aerosol and water vapor heating / cooling rate profile follows an S-shaped curve with peaks slightly larger for the moist layer (−0.09 K d−1) than for the sulfate layer (+0.06 K d−1)."

We have developed a new detection method that can directly observe and analyze the generation and dissipation mechanisms of turbulent energy at different heights in the vertical direction of the boundary layer. This research result will extend our study of TKE budget terms from near the ground to high altitude, providing a higher and more detailed perspective. 
 The turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) budget terms, which collectively are a key physical quantity for describing the generation and dissipation processes of turbulence, are crucial for revealing the essence and characteristics of turbulence. Due to limitations in current observational methods, the generation and dissipation mechanisms of atmospheric turbulent energy are mainly based on ground or tower-based observations, and studies on the budget terms of TKE of vertical structures are lacking. We propose a new method for detecting TKE budget terms based on coherent wind lidar and compare it with data obtained with a three-dimensional ultrasonic anemometer. The results indicate that the error in the buoyancy generation term estimated by the wind lidar is relatively small, less than 0.00014 m2 s−3, which verifies the accuracy and reliability of our method. We explore the generation and dissipation mechanisms of turbulence under different weather conditions, and find that the buoyancy generation term plays a role in dissipating TKE under low-cloud and light-rain conditions. During the day, turbulent transport and the dissipation rate are the main dissipation terms, while buoyancy generation is the main dissipation term at night. The results show that the proposed method can accurately capture the vertical distribution of TKE, the dissipation rate, shear generation, turbulent transport, and buoyancy generation terms in the boundary layer and can comprehensively reflect the influence of each budget term on the vertical structure of turbulent energy. This research provides a new perspective and method for studies of atmospheric turbulence, which can be further applied to fine observations of the vertical structure and dynamics of turbulence."

Chan,"Enhanced sulfate formation in mixed biomass burning and sea-salt interactions mediated by photosensitization: effects of chloride, nitrogen-containing compounds, and atmospheric aging","This study provides laboratory evidence that the photosensitizers in biomass burning extracts can enhance sulfate formation in NaCl particles, primarily by triggering the formation of secondary oxidants under light and air conditions, with a lower contribution of direct photosensitization via triplets. 
 Discrepancies persist between modeled simulations and measured sulfate concentrations in the marine boundary layer, especially when the marine air is influenced by biomass burning plumes. However, there has been a notable dearth of research conducted on the interactions between sea-salt aerosol and biomass burning plumes, impeding a comprehensive understanding of sulfate formation. This work studied sulfate formation by mixing real biomass burning (BB) extracts and NaCl, mimicking internal mixtures of BB and sea-salt particles. BB–NaCl particles had a significantly higher sulfate formation rate than incense burning (IS)–NaCl particles. For fresh particles, the sulfate formation rate followed the trend of corn straw (CS)–NaCl > rice straw (RS)–NaCl > wheat straw (WS)–NaCl > IS–NaCl. The filter sample aging was achieved by exposure to OH• generated from UV irradiation. After aging, RS–NaCl particles exhibited the highest enhancement in sulfate formation rates among all the BB–NaCl particles due to interactions between RS and NaCl. Bulk aqueous experiments spiked with NaCl using mixtures of model photosensitizers (PSs) and nitrogen-containing organic compounds (NOCs), pyrazine (CHN), and 4-nitrocatechol (CHON) revealed positive effects of chloride in the PS–CHON system and negative effects in the PS–CHN system in sulfate formation. Our work suggests that BB reaching or near coastal areas can affect sulfate formation via photosensitizer-mediated reactions, potentially exacerbating air pollution."

Fleming;Karina Adcock;Emmal Safi;Tim Arnold,Direct high-precision radon quantification for interpreting high-frequency greenhouse gas measurements,"We present a protocol to improve confidence in atmospheric radon measurements, enabling site comparisons and integration with greenhouse gas data. As a natural tracer, radon provides an independent check of transport model performance. This standardized method enhances radon’s use as a metric for model evaluation. Beyond UK observatories, it can support broader networks like ICOS and WMO/GAW, advancing global atmospheric research. 
 We present a protocol to improve confidence in reported radon activity concentrations, facilitating direct site-to-site comparisons and integration with co-located greenhouse gas (GHG) measurements within a network of three independently managed observatories in the UK. Translating spot measurements of atmospheric GHG amount fractions into regional flux estimates (“top-down” analysis) is usually performed with atmospheric transport models (ATMs), which calculate the sensitivity of regional emissions to changes in observed GHGs at a finite number of locations. However, the uncertainty of regional emissions is closely linked to ATM uncertainties. Radon, emitted naturally from the land surface, can be used as a tracer of atmospheric transport and mixing to independently evaluate the performance of such models. To accomplish this, the radon measurements need to have a comparable precision to the GHGs at the modelled temporal resolution. Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) dual-flow-loop two-filter radon detectors provide output every 30 min. The measurement accuracy at this temporal resolution depends on the characterization and removal of instrumental background, the calibration procedure, and response time correction. Consequently, unless these steps are standardized, measurement precision may differ between sites. Here we describe standardized approaches regarding (1) instrument maintenance, (2) quality control of the raw data stream, (3) determination and removal of the instrumental background, (4) calibration methods, and (5) response time correction (by deconvolution). Furthermore, we assign uncertainties for each reported 30 min radon estimate (assuming these steps have been followed) and validate the final result through comparison of diurnal and sub-diurnal radon characteristics with co-located GHG measurements. While derived for a network of UK observatories, the proposed standardized protocol could be equally applied to two-filter dual-flow-loop radon observations across larger networks, such as the Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) or the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) baseline network."

The study aimed to identify disparities in the widely used OP dithiothreitol assay and assess the consistency of OP among labs using the same protocol. The results showed that half of the labs achieved acceptable results. However, variability was also found, highlighting the need for standardisation in OP procedures. 
 This paper presents the findings from a collaborative interlaboratory comparison exercise designed to assess oxidative potential (OP) measurements conducted by 20 laboratories worldwide. This study represents an innovative effort as the first exercise specifically aimed at harmonising this type of OP assay, setting a new benchmark in the field.Over the last decade, there has been a noticeable increase in OP studies, with numerous research groups investigating the effects of exposure to air pollution particles through the evaluation of OP levels. However, the absence of standardised methods for OP measurements has resulted in variability in results across different groups, rendering meaningful comparisons challenging. To address this issue, this study engages in an international effort to compare OP measurements using a simplified method (with a dithiothreitol (DTT) assay).Here, we quantify the OP in liquid samples to focus on the protocol measurement itself, while future international OP interlaboratory comparisons (ILCs) should aim to assess the whole chain process, including the sample extraction. We analyse the similarities and discrepancies observed in the results, identifying the critical parameters (such as the instrument used, the use of a simplified protocol, the delivery and analysis time) that could influence OP measurements and  provide recommendations for future studies and interlaboratory comparisons even if other crucial aspects, such as sampling PM methods, sample storage, extraction methods and conditions, and the evaluation of other OP assays, still need to be standardised. This collaborative approach enhances the robustness of the OP DTT assay and paves the way for future studies to build on a unified framework. This pioneering work concludes that interlaboratory comparisons provide essential insights into the OP metric and are crucial to move toward the harmonisation of OP measurements."

This study developed a hybrid ship clutter identification algorithm based on artificial intelligence and heuristic criteria, effectively mitigating the issue. The successful reproduction of ship tracks in the Gulf of Finland supports this conclusion. 
 With the rapid development of active-phased arrays and solid-state transmitters, pulse compression technology has become increasingly important. Currently, pulse compression waveforms with peak sidelobe levels better than -50 dB have been developed, enabling the broader application of pulse compression technology in weather radar systems. However, existing sidelobe suppression levels are still insufficient to ensure that radar data quality is unaffected by range sidelobes for ship clutter, which have a high echo intensity and cannot be removed by conventional quality control methods. In this study, we introduce a Hybrid Ship Clutter Identification (HSCI) algorithm to address this issue in pulse compression polarimetric radar observations. The HSCI algorithm comprises two parts: mainlobe and sidelobe identification (including the range and antenna sidelobes). Mainlobe identification uses a random forest model that integrates multiple features to identify the mainlobe of ship clutter. Sidelobe identification uses a series of heuristic criteria derived from the statistical characteristics of ship clutter to distinguish them from precipitation echoes. The analysis results of two typical cases indicate that after implementing the HSCI algorithm, the impact of ship clutter on radar data is visually imperceptible. The statistical results show that the HSCI algorithm achieves a ship clutter mainlobe identification rate of 97.25 % with a misidentification rate of only 0.08 % in the precipitation data. Application of this algorithm to the University of Helsinki C-band dual-polarization Doppler weather radar data successfully reproduced ship tracks in the Gulf of Finland."

 In this work, we present the results of an observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) in which we investigate the emergence of a surface reflectance-dependent bias in retrieved column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of methane (XCH4). Our focus is on single-band type retrievals in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) at 2.3 µm. This particular bias manifests as artificial gradients in XCH4 fields that relate to surface features on the ground and can, for example, cause erroneous estimates of methane source emission rates."

However, our best estimates of heat and freshwater transports into the ocean remain uncertain. In this work, we use a new method called the Optimal Transformation Method (OTM), to reconcile air-sea heat and freshwater transports with ocean temperature and salinity observations, representing a meaningful improvement on existing estimates. Our improved air-sea transport estimates are publicly available. 
 A substantial portion of the transport of heat and freshwater in the climate system occurs through the ocean. Heat and fresh water enter the ocean as air-sea fluxes, which are typically estimated based on observationally constrained ‘reanalyses’ of the atmosphere. However, these estimates are uncertain, with broad differences in space and time between different products, and do not align with estimates of integrated ocean temperature and salinity. As a result, inferred global heat and freshwater transport, including transport trends, remain unclear. In this work, we use a novel water mass-based inverse modelling method, the Optimal Transformation Method (OTM), to reconcile reanalysis-based changes in surface heat and freshwater fluxes with changes in observed ocean temperature and salinity. We present estimates of air-sea surface fluxes since the 1970s, derived from reanalysis products ERA5, JRA-55 and COREv2, which are adjusted to be physically consistent with observation-based 3D ocean temperature and salinity products EN4 and IAP. OTM adjusts air-sea surface fluxes in a consistent manner, thereby also enabling estimation of meridional heat and freshwater transports. Inferred mean meridional heat transport is relatively consistent, and aligns with independent ocean transport observations and the spread of estimates from historical reconstructions from the 6th Climate Model Intercomparison Project. Mean freshwater transport and trends in both heat and freshwater transport are less consistent. Either a narrowing of the range of estimates provided by reanalyses and/or additional constraints to OTM (in addition to the thermodynamic constraints currently provided) are therefore still needed."

Parquer;Eric A. de Kemp;Boyan Brodaric;Michael J. Hillier,Checking the consistency of 3D geological models,"This is a proof-of-concept paper outlining a general approach to how 3D geological models would be checked to be geologically reasonable. We do this with a consistency-checking tool that looks at geological feature pairs and their spatial, temporal, and internal polarity characteristics. The idea is to assess if geological relationships from a specific 3D geological model match what is allowed in the real world from the perspective of geological principles. 
 Three-dimensional geological modelling algorithms can generate multiple models that fit various mathematical and geometrical constraints. The results, however, are often meaningless to geological experts if the models do not respect accepted geological principles. This is problematic as use of the models is expected for various downstream purposes, such as hazard risk assessment, flow characterization, reservoir estimation, geological storage, or mineral and energy exploration. Verification of the geological reasonableness of such models is therefore important. If implausible models can be identified and eliminated, it will save countless hours and computational and human resources.To begin assessing geological reasonableness, we develop a framework for checking model consistency with geological knowledge and test it with a proof-of-concept tool.

Females, in contrast to males, exhibit unique pathways for PFAS exposure and excretion, leading to complex health outcomes. The health status of females is largely influenced by hormone-related processes. PFAS have been reported to be associated with various aspects of female health, including reproductive system disorders and pregnancy-related diseases. In this article, we provide insights into the correlations between PFAS and female-prevalent diseases. Current epidemiological and toxicological evidence has demonstrated that the adverse effects of PFAS on the health of the female reproductive system are primarily attributed to the disruption of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis and hormonal homeostasis. However, these findings do not sufficiently elucidate the intricate associations between PFAS and specific diseases. Furthermore, autoimmune disorders, another category that is more prevalent in women compared to men, require additional investigation. Immune biomarkers pertinent to autoimmune disorders have been observed to be influenced by PFAS exposure, although epidemiological evidence is insufficient to substantiate these relations. Further thorough exploration encompassing epidemiological and toxicological studies is essential to elucidating the inherent influence of PFAS on human pathologies. Additionally, comprehensive investigations into female health issues beyond their reproductive functions is essential."
10.1021/acs.est.4c08231,True,Environmental Science & Technology,"这篇论文研究了富氮原料制备生物炭过程中产生的气体和溶解性黑碳（DBC）的形成机制及其对大气和水环境的影响。研究者利用热重-傅里叶变换红外光谱法和二维相关光谱法，揭示了不同温度下主要非冷凝气体的释放顺序（H2O→CO2→HCN, NH3→CH4→CO）与生物质脱官能团阶段（脱水、脱羧、脱氮、脱甲基和脱羰）之间的关系，并发现蛋白质是气体释放的主要贡献者，低挥发性热解产物是DBC的主要来源。通过质谱分析，研究发现44-60%的DBC分子组成与主要气体释放反应相关，不同温度下，脱水、脱羧和脱酰胺反应对DBC的形成贡献不同。此外，研究还推断了气体释放形成的DBC产物芳香性的变化。这些关于热解副产物的见解有助于预测和调控DBC的特性，减少其对环境的负面影响。

该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为DBC作为一种重要的气溶胶成分，会影响大气成分和空气质量，可以通过卫星观测和大气成分分析技术进行监测。论文中使用的FTIR技术也是大气遥感中常用的分析手段。研究结果可以为改进大气环境模型，提高空气质量监测的精度提供数据支持。","['Black carbon', 'Aerosols', 'Air quality', 'Satellite observation', 'Atmospheric composition', 'FTIR', 'Gas emissions']",Xiaoxiao Zhang;Zibo Xu;Yuqing Sun;Sanjay K.

Tsang,Implications of Pyrolytic Gas Dynamic Evolution on Dissolved Black Carbon Formed During Production of Biochar from Nitrogen-Rich Feedstock,"Gases and dissolved black carbon (DBC) formed during pyrolysis of nitrogen-rich feedstock would affect atmospheric and aquatic environments. Yet, the mechanisms driving biomass gas evolution and DBC formation are poorly understood. Using thermogravimetric-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy, we correlated the temperature-dependent primary noncondensable gas release sequence (H2O → CO2 → HCN, NH3 → CH4 → CO) with specific defunctionalization stages in the order: dehydration, decarboxylation, denitrogenation, demethylation, and decarbonylation. Our results revealed that proteins in feedstock mainly contributed to gas releases, and low-volatile pyrolytic products contributed to DBC. Combining mass difference analysis with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, we showed that 44–60% of DBC molecular compositions were correlated with primary gas-releasing reactions. Dehydration (−H2O), with lower reaction energy barrier, contributed to DBC formation most at 350 and 450 °C, whereas decarboxylation (−CO2) and deamidization (−HCNO) prevailed in contributing to DBC formation at 550 °C. The aromaticity changes of DBC products formed via gas emissions were deduced. Compared to their precursors, dehydration increased DBC aromaticity, while deamidization reduced the aromaticity of DBC products. These insights on pyrolytic byproducts help predict and tune DBC properties via changing gas formed during biochar production, minimizing their negative environmental impacts."

The contribution of the hydrogen radical (•H) as a companion active substance in the photoreduction and electrocatalytic degradation of PFASs has been neglected. Herein, we demonstrate that perfluorocarboxylic acids and perfluoroether compounds such as PFOA and hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (GenX) underwent near-complete photodegradation and effective defluorination by continuously generating •H through perfluoroalkyl radical activation of water under UV irradiation without any reagents and catalysts. Importantly, the initial dissolved oxygen, H+, and impurities in surface water scarcely inhibited the defluorination of the PFASs. The difference in the defluorination mechanism between PFOA and GenX under the action of •H was elucidated by combining theoretical calculations with targeted and nontargeted analysis methods. The investigation of the photodegradation of different PFASs indicates that perfluoroether compounds were not easily photodegraded via reduction of •H compared with other compounds, whereas polyfluorinated compounds in which some F atoms were replaced with Cl were more prone to elimination. However, the UV/•H system was ineffective against perfluorosulfonic acids. This study provides an unprecedented perspective for further development of the removal technology of PFASs and the design of alternative PFASs that are easy to eliminate."

Through comparison of cluster activity within the airborne layers of the PSA and the recorded infrasound signal in the frequency domain, we demonstrate that infrasound is mainly generated from particle clusters suspended by turbulent eddies or ejected from the denser basal layer. Further correlating infrasound amplitudes with radar‐derived spatial distributions of these clusters, we reveal a distributed source extending hundreds of meters behind the avalanche front. Additionally, we establish a relationship between infrasound and kinetic energy of suspended particles.

The increasing frequency and intensity of these events underscore the critical need to understand regional‐scale mechanisms and feedback, exacerbating or mitigating heatwave magnitude. Here, we use an ensemble of convection‐permitting regional climate models (CPRCMs) to elucidate future heatwave changes at fine spatial scales. We explore whether the recently highlighted drier/warmer signal introduced by CPRCMs improves summer temperature extremes representation and if it modulates future heatwave changes compared to convection‐parameterizing regional climate models (RCMs). In historical runs, CPRCMs show a more realistic representation of summer maximum temperature especially on a ground‐station‐based evaluation. CPRCMs project substantially drier conditions than RCMs. This is associated with a modulation of heatwave temperature changes which show diversified spatial patterns, magnitudes, and signs.

The amplitude of seasonal changes increased by 65% from 14.16 cm in 1980–1999 to 23.16 cm in 2000–2020.

Lighter isotope enrichment may indicate that methane could be derived from a combination of abiotic and thermogenic sources and, heavier isotope enrichment is mainly because of microbial methane oxidation.

Record-high selectivities (> 2×104) and SF6 dynamic capacities (~ 2.7 mmol/g) were achieved, while exceptional SF6 productivities (~ 58.7 L/kg), yields (~ 96.8%), and recyclability (~ 1000 cycles) were demonstrated in fixed-bed adsorption-desorption experiments under mild regeneration conditions. 2D solid-state NMR/in-situ FTIR, DFT-D binding/diffusion simulation analyses revealed the multi-site binding mode and the ultra-fast diffusion of SF6 within the channels. The proposed VTSA processes successfully met the dual stringent requirements of both environmental protection and electricity equipment operation: the SF6 recovery of 99.91% accompanied with a SF6 purity/working capacity of 99.91%/2.1 mmol/g, which significantly outperformed the industrial employed adsorbent zeolite 13X and showed only 18.7% the energy consumption of the cryogenic distillation. SF6/N2 separation is crucial for sustainable development. Here, the authors prepared low-cost and robust MOF composite pellets and established a vacuum temperature swing adsorption process with both high recovery and high purity of SF6."

 Collisionless shock waves, found in supernova remnants, interstellar, stellar, and planetary environments, and laboratories, are one of nature’s most powerful particle accelerators. This study combines in situ satellite measurements with recent theoretical developments to establish a reinforced shock acceleration model for relativistic electrons. Our model incorporates transient structures, wave-particle interactions, and variable stellar wind conditions, operating collectively in a multiscale set of processes. We show that the electron injection threshold is on the order of suprathermal range, obtainable through multiple different phenomena abundant in various plasma environments. Our analysis demonstrates that a typical shock can consistently accelerate electrons into very high (relativistic) energy ranges, refining our comprehension of shock acceleration while providing insight on the origin of electron cosmic rays. The mechanisms resulting in particle acceleration to relativistic energies in space plasmas are an open question.

 Early detection of lung function impairment is crucial. However, the sensitivity of spirometry in detecting early lung function deterioration is limited. In this study, lungs of 3180 healthy participants scheduled for annual health check were screened. Electrical impedance tomography measurements were conducted in 130 participants with normal spirometry for concept establishment phase and 105 for validation phase. A follow-up CT examination was suggested for participants with abnormal regional time constant or tobacco consumption ≥10 pack-years. Using CT as reference, the sensitivity and specificity of electrical impedance tomography-based screening were 81.3% and 50.0%, respectively in the concept establishment phase. In the validation phase, the sensitivity and specificity were 77.9% and 50.0%. In this study we show that conventional spirometry may not capture early changes that occur at a regional level.

Here using mouse models, the authors show that maternal asthma is associated with glucocorticoid associated gene changes in foetal offspring ILC2 along with persistent epigenetic changes in these cells potentially contributing to increase of asthma in offspring. 
 The root of asthma can be linked to early life, with prenatal environments influencing risk. We investigate the effects of maternal asthma on the offspring’s lungs during fetal and adult life. Adult offspring of asthmatic mothers show an increase in lung group 2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2) number and function with allergen-induced lung inflammation. Offspring of asthmatic mothers show phenotypic alteration of their lung ILC2s during fetal life, with increased expression of genes related to activation and glucocorticoid signaling. Furthermore, these offspring carry overlapping chromatin-accessible altered regions, including glucocorticoid receptor-binding regions in their lung ILC2s both at the fetal stage and adulthood, suggesting persistent prenatal epigenetic changes. Moreover, maternal exposure to glucocorticoids has similar effects on fetal lung ILC2s and contributes to allergen-induced lung inflammation during adulthood. Thus, asthma during pregnancy may have long-term effects on lung ILC2s in the offspring from the embryonic period, contributing to an increased risk of developing asthma.

 An unexpected record-breaking cold event struck eastern China in December 2023, causing widespread transportation shutdowns, power supply shortages, and agricultural crop damage. The manner in which such an extraordinary cold event was formed under global warming is unclear, as is the way in which anthropogenic climate change may affect the present and future frequency and intensity of similar cold events. Here, we show that the large-scale atmospheric circulation associated with the warm Arctic was the main event driver, explaining 83 ± 2% of the intensity of the 2023 cold event, whereas the thermodynamic effect of climate change suppressed the event intensity by −6 ± 3% in ERA5 and −22 ± 2% in HadGEM3-A-N216. An attribution analysis based on coupled model simulations shows that, due to anthropogenic climate change, the frequency and intensity of 2023-like events decrease by 92.5 ± 2.5% and 1.9 ± 0.2 °C, respectively, under the 2023 climate state. The thermodynamic effect of anthropogenic climate change outweighs its dynamic effect. Future projections indicate that the frequency and intensity of these 2023-like events will further decrease by 95 ± 3% and 2.05 ± 0.25 °C by the end of this century under an intermediate-emissions scenario compared with estimates made under the present climate. In contrast, 2023-like events will be similar to present events when the 1.5 °C target of the Paris Agreement is achieved. These findings highlight the dampening effect of anthropogenic climate change on cold events, but adaptation measures for future risks of 2023-like cold events will be needed by the end of the century if carbon neutrality is achieved."

 Anthropogenic aerosols could weaken the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). This study investigated the regional effects of varying aerosol optical depth (AOD) on the EASM through qualitative and quantitative analyses for three subregions in eastern China. After assessing 38 CMIP6 models, four models (ACCESS-CM2, CanESM5, MIROC6, and MRI-ESM2-0) were selected for detailed analysis. Results showed that the weakening of EASM was predominantly attributed to anthropogenic aerosols. Increased AOD reduced land-sea temperature and pressure differences, weakening the EASM as indicated by the EASMI. Higher aerosol levels decreased surface shortwave radiation, land surface temperature, and evaporation, weakening the land-sea thermal contrast. Enhanced aerosol-induced cooling increased atmospheric stability and downward flow, suppressing upper air water vapor flux and precipitation. These findings underscore the critical role of anthropogenic aerosols in altering regional climate patterns and the importance of emission control to mitigate their effects on the EASM."

 Reduction in aerosol cooling unmasks greenhouse gas warming, exacerbating the rate of future warming. The strict sulfur regulation on shipping fuel implemented in 2020 (IMO2020) presents an opportunity to assess the potential impacts of such emission regulations and the detectability of deliberate aerosol perturbations for climate intervention. Here we employ machine learning to capture cloud natural variability and estimate a radiative forcing of +0.074 ±0.005 W m−2 related to IMO2020 associated with changes in shortwave cloud radiative effect over three low-cloud regions where shipping routes prevail. We find low detectability of the cloud radiative effect of this event, attributed to strong natural variability in cloud albedo and cloud cover. Regionally, detectability is higher for the southeastern Atlantic stratocumulus deck. These results raise concerns that future reductions in aerosol emissions will accelerate warming and that proposed deliberate aerosol perturbations such as marine cloud brightening will need to be substantial in order to overcome the low detectability. Reductions in aerosol cooling as a result of shipping fuel regulations implemented in 2020 led to substantial positive radiative forcing globally, but this change is difficult to detect against a background of high natural variability,according to neural-network based analyses."

 Organic aerosols (OA) are a main component of PM2.5 (20–90%), which contains thousands of compounds. Thus, the formation processes and sources of OA remain poorly understood. In this study, the seasonal and diurnal variabilities of submicron PM chemical composition (both inorganic and organic aerosols) and OA sources were characterized by aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS) and an aethalometer at a rural background site in the Czech Republic (National Atmospheric Observatory Košetice – NAOK) from January to October 2019. The effects of meteorological conditions and local, regional, and long-range atmospheric transport influences in Central Europe were also studied. The overall average submicron PM concentration was 9.26 ± 5.88 μg m−3. Using positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis, we identified four OA factors for summer and five for all other seasons. Three factors were associated with primary sources of OA (POA): hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), biomass-burning OA (BBOA), and OA from coal burning (CCOA, absent in summer), the CCOA factor enabling a better description of the residential heating effect on the background station in Central Europe. Two remaining factors represented oxygenated OA (OOA) sources: less oxidized OOA (LO-OOA) and more oxidized OOA (MO-OOA).Higher pollution episodes of submicron PM and all OA sources were predominantly associated with continental air masses. The effect of dispersion conditions, as assessed by the ventilation index (VI) and not yet been studied at a rural background site, proved to be a critical factor. The extension of the number of primary factors to include CCOA in PMF analysis, together with the reflection of the influence of seasonality, air mass origin and changes in meteorology, especially dispersion conditions, has elucidated the origin and fate of OA in the atmosphere at this type of European background stations."

 Nitrogen-containing heterocyclic aromatic compounds (NHACs) significantly contribute to urban air pollution but remain understudied. This study investigates the formation and transformation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from prototypical NHACs, indole, under various day- and night-time atmospheric processes. We examined the relationship between the evolving redox potential and cytotoxicity of indole-derived SOA (Indole-SOA) and its chemical alternations. Results show that Indole-SOA exhibits high oxidative potential (OPDTT of 88–268 pmol min−1 μg−1) and antioxidant capacity (AOC of 0.41–0.83 nmol trolox μg−1), exceeding most biogenic and anthropogenic organic aerosols. Indole-SOA induces significant cytotoxicity in lung epithelial cells, characterized by oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and CYP1A1-driven detoxification pathways. The strongly correlated OPDTT and cytotoxicity of Indole-SOA are influenced by atmospheric agings and are closely related to particulate-phase products of aromatic carbonyl and reduced-nitrogen compounds.
