Kazakhstan is a middle-income country with a highly centralized government, dependent on extractive industries for 21.3% of its GDP. Kazakhstan has positioned itself as a ‘strong state’ that promotes sustainable development in its pursuit of international investment. Utilizing a centralized approach to energy policy, Kazakhstan is seeking to become a center for the manufacturing of renewable energy equipment and a key player in the global energy transition. Yet, this seems to be at odds with their goals of creating a sustainable environmental future in local communities. To better understand the energy transition policies pursued, this article examines the energy sector through a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis. Drawing on expert stakeholder interviews, this study examines the SWOT to Kazakhstan’s energy transition from the perspective of stakeholder groups. Based on the findings from the interviews, this article suggests policies that Kazakhstan can adopt from other emerging economies to balance socio-economic needs with sustainability goals to achieve its 2060 carbon neutrality target. The findings provide practical insights for policymakers, local government officials, and development practitioners seeking to align national energy goals with the needs of local stakeholders. Additionally, the study contributes to academic debates on decentralized governance and energy transition by providing a nuanced, stakeholder-informed assessment relevant to researchers in environmental policy and sustainability studies."
10.1088/1748-9326/addee0,True,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文探讨了人为气溶胶排放变化对全球热浪灾害和人口暴露的影响。论文利用气候模型（NCAR Community Earth System Model）研究了自1920年以来气溶胶排放增加如何抑制人口密集地区的热浪频率，以及随着排放模式的转变和全球净排放量的下降，这种趋势如何逆转。研究结果表明，气溶胶对热浪的影响与人口分布密切相关，导致显著的人口暴露。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及气溶胶这种大气成分的分析，以及它们对气候和人类健康的影响。虽然论文没有直接提及特定的遥感技术或卫星观测，但其研究结果对利用遥感数据进行空气质量监测、大气成分分析和气候变化研究具有重要意义。,"['anthropogenic aerosols', 'aerosol emissions', 'air quality', 'atmospheric composition', 'climate change', 'heatwave hazard', 'population exposure', 'climate modeling', 'NCAR Community Earth System Model']",Geeta G Persad;Cameron Cummins;Jane W Baldwin,Anthropogenic aerosol changes disproportionately impact the evolution of global heatwave hazard and exposure,"Understanding and predicting heatwave risk is a societal imperative in the face of climate change. Anthropogenic aerosol emissions impact heat extremes more strongly per unit of mean warming than do greenhouse gases, but the influence of aerosols’ evolving spatial pattern on time-varying heatwave hazard and resulting population exposure has been largely ignored. Aerosols’ spatially heterogeneous forcing is often co-located with population centers due to aerosols’ industrial sources and short atmospheric lifetime, potentially resulting in amplified exposure to aerosol-driven climate effects. Here, we quantify the influence of historical and projected future changes in aerosol emissions through 2100 on global patterns of heatwave hazard (i.e. the frequency of heatwave days) and exposure (i.e. population-weighted hazard) using the NCAR Community Earth System Model v1 single forcing large ensemble (LE). Our results show that increased aerosol emissions since 1920 have suppressed heatwave frequency (HWF) over populated regions by roughly half through present-day—a trend that is now reversing with shifting emission patterns and net global declining emissions. This may already be leading to an aerosol-driven acceleration in HWF, a signal that is amplified in populated regions. Aerosols’ influence on heatwaves is strongly co-located with population, creating out-sized exposure, which evolves through time with aerosols’ evolving emissions pattern within this LE. Our results suggest that near-term changes in aerosol emissions will be a disproportionate driver of trends in heatwave exposure, meriting dedicated future study, and that aerosols’ evolving spatial pattern should be considered in attempts to attribute recent heatwave trends to human activity."

While previous studies have examined ETS and provincial reduction targets separately, the impacts of the potential integration of these approaches on welfare and the spatial distribution of air quality-related health remain underexplored. In this study, we employ an integrated modeling framework to compare the economic impacts and health outcomes associated with PM2.5 and ozone under three provincial control mechanisms with the same target for national total carbon emissions in 2035. Our findings indicate that ETS improves national welfare by at least US$18.9 billion (0.12%) compared to the conventional provincial control mechanism (PRO_CAP). The partitioned carbon regulation mechanism (PART_REG), which applies the national ETS to power and energy-intensive industry sectors while assigning reduction targets to other sectors at the provincial level, achieves 85% of the welfare improvement observed under full ETS coverage (FULL_ETS). ETS redistributes CO2 and co-emitted air pollutant emissions from northern to southern China, improving air quality in northern provinces but worsening it in central and southern provinces. The national premature deaths increase by 32 700 (95% CI: 23 200–41 600) under PART_REG compared to PRO_CAP. When comparing the changes in welfare and monetized health damages, ETS remains cost-effective nationally, with a median net benefit of US$6.6 billion under PART_REG—20% higher than that under FULL_ETS. Northern and southeastern coastal provinces experience net positive benefits, while some central provinces face net negative impacts."

An assessment of vulnerability and resilience to consecutive disasters in the Portland metro region,"Climate-related disasters threaten urban areas worldwide, yet gaps remain in understanding how multiple stressors interact to shape resilience. This study examines exposure, vulnerability, and resilience across three consecutive extreme events in the Portland metro area: the September 2020 wildfire-related air pollution, the February 2021 snowstorm, and the June 2021 heatwave. We used geographically weighted regression and Spearman rank correlation analysis to investigate relationships between hazard impacts, the social vulnerability index (SoVI), Baseline Resilience Indicators for Communities (BRIC), and proximity to community-based organizations (CBOs) in 416 census tracts. Our analysis reveals strong spatial correlations between wildfire-related air pollution, winter storm impacts, and extreme heat exposure. Communities already burdened by poor air quality, freezing precipitation, and urban heat island effects faced heightened cumulative risk. While this varied by neighborhood, racial minorities, migrant workers, non-US citizens, and low-income households were significantly affected. In contrast, affluent communities with lower SoVI scores and higher BRIC values exhibited greater resilience and were less exposed to these hazards. Although CBOs were concentrated in areas with high SoVI, they were insufficient in mitigating disaster impacts. This study underscores the urgent need for multi-hazard resilience planning centered on advancing environmental justice, vulnerability reduction, CBO capacity building, and investment in critical infrastructure in at-risk communities."

It influences climate and weather such as surface air temperatures downstream over Eurasia through establishing a large-scale teleconnection, but past studies on the NAO’s downstream teleconnection have been largely limited to observational data, and further evidence of downstream impacts and associated mechanisms from comprehensive climate modeling is desirable. This study quantifies and analyzes this teleconnection on an interannual timescale by using both ERA5 reanalysis, and five large ensembles from four climate simulation models. A particular focus is placed on dynamical pathways, as well as variability among ensemble members that modulates the teleconnection strength. Results suggest that NAO signals are propagated downstream by Rossby waves, efficiently transmitted through waveguides along both the polar and subtropical jet streams to Eastern Eurasia; while heat can be advected weakly from upstream, advection plays a rather local effect inducing temperature anomalies from the Pacific Ocean onshore. Multiple linear regression shows that internal climate variability significantly modulates the teleconnection: a more locally dominant NAO pattern, and narrower waveguides could strengthen the teleconnection. These two factors combine to explain up to 70% of variance in the teleconnection strength, with each contributing almost equally. Reanalysis data marginally agree with the regression model (1.9 standardized residuals higher in strength), suggesting potential model biases in jets and the NAO variability. Monitoring these modulating factors would be crucial to understanding downstream climate predictability and improving climate prediction models linked to the NAO."

This study examines the impacts of recent climate change and variability on run-of-river (RoR) hydropower production and electricity systems planning. We present an end-to-end pipeline to convert runoff and hydropower specifications into hydropower generation and subsequently integrate it into an electricity systems model. Applying this methodology to Switzerland, we provide a re-analysis of hydropower generation for each RoR power plant with capacities of 300 KW or more for the period 1991–2022. When aggregated on a national scale, our estimations match well nationally reported production and displays a climate-driven year-to-year variability. Our results show an overall tendency towards decreased RoR production in the past decades in Switzerland due to climate change (decrease in water availability). This trend was compensated at a national level with an infrastructure expansion. Based on the derived hydropower time series, we simulate the electricity system under scenarios with either no or a high renewable energy target and showcase contrasting sensitivities of electricity prices to climate variability."

Approximately 88% of Norway’s power comes from hydropower, produced by over 1770 plants. We assess how 285 potential new or revised environmental constraints affect hydropower production and flexibility in the Northern European power system. To do so, we combine a method for estimating environmental flow releases in bypass reaches and stochastic power system optimization. Our results show that reductions in hydropower output due to these constraints are consistent across power system scenarios and two power system models. The reductions amount to 3 TWh yr−1 (2% of Norway’s production), by our estimates. These reductions are primarily driven by flow diversions to bypass river sections. Further, we find that high power prices increase and low prices decrease, reflecting reduced system flexibility. Price increases typically occur in dry spring periods and are linked to activation of season-dependent reservoir restrictions in that period, while price decreases result from higher reservoir volumes entering periods of rain-heavy summer or autumn periods, indirectly linked to restrictions active earlier in the year. In our simulations, we observe that flexibility losses due to environmental constraints to some degree are offset by increased flexible operation of unaffected reservoirs and transmission interconnectors. Finally, our findings suggest that reservoir restrictions may cause spilling, as higher water levels in regulated reservoirs increase the risk of spilling during wet summer or autumn periods. This system-level understanding is crucial for regulatory authorities designing new environmental requirements and revising the terms of hydropower licenses. Our study contributes to informed discussions for balancing hydropower production with local environmental benefits and offers a framework for studying similar constraints in other regions, such as Sweden, North America and European Alpine countries."

However, the magnitude of this potential natural climate solution (NCS) remains uncertain across ecoregions. Few studies have evaluated riparian planting C sequestration and storage, particularly in highly productive wet riparian ecosystems. In recent decades, riparian reforestation has accelerated in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) of the United States, primarily aiming to restore ecosystem functions and associated benefits. Using these plantings as a ‘natural experiment’, we assessed C storage in woody vegetation (trees and shrubs) and soils across a chronosequence of PNW riparian reforestation sites. Our study evaluated changes in C storage with planting age and identified key covariates affecting C storage in plants and soils and their relationship with planting age across a ∼430 km latitudinal gradient in western Oregon, USA. We found that woody and soil C stocks increase with planting age, averaging 24% and 1% per year, respectively. Increases in tree C were strongly driven by increasing planting age and tree stem density. Understory C was weakly related to stand characteristics and geomorphic properties, and strongly related to planting age. Soil C gains were positively driven by precipitation. We find that riparian reforestation can result in increased C storage, with woody vegetation comprising most of the increase. Our results highlight the importance of including both trees and shrubs in plantings to realize C accumulation gains in the earlier years. Because C accumulation is gradual, yet compounding (i.e. 10+ and 15+ years for total C stocks to increase by 1.95, and 19.2 Mg C ha−1, respectively), riparian reforestation projects implemented today could take over a decade to deliver high NCS benefits, emphasizing the urgency to implement these projects to limit the worst of climate change impacts."

Yet the space time pattern of such events on a global scale and their relationships with temperature and wind speed are not well understood. Based on over 9000 global meteorological stations and multi-source weighted-ensemble precipitation covering the warm seasons of 1980–2022, the characteristics and trends in sub-daily extreme precipitation (3 h time interval) were examined and their relationships with temperature and wind speed were explored across global major river basins. The results revealed a similar spatial pattern in the annual frequency, intensity, duration, and total amount of 3 h extreme precipitation events, though notable discrepancies were observed in specific regions such as Southeast Asia and eastern North America. Over half of the stations, particularly in South America, exhibited decreasing trends in extreme precipitation frequency, while significant increases were documented in Europe and Southeast Asia. The relationship between extreme precipitation intensity and temperature over different river basins exhibited diverse behaviors, characterized by monotonic increase (sub-daily Clausius–Clapeyron scaling, mostly in Europe), hook structure (mostly in North America), monotonic decrease (mostly in Africa), and nearly constant (mostly in Mid East, South Africa and South America). Moreover, wind speed generally increased with extreme precipitation intensity for tropical and subtropical basins, while in high-latitude basins strong winds tended to occur with lower precipitation intensity. These insights are vital for improving resilience against sub-daily extreme precipitation."

We investigated the AEW-TC relationship further by examining the effects of suppressing the two AEW periodicities individually on TC activity. Using regional model simulations, AEWs were prescribed or suppressed in the 2–6 d or 6–10 d ranges through the lateral boundary conditions. Seasonal TC frequency increased significantly when either AEW periodicity was suppressed, with a larger increase when the 2–6 d waves were suppressed. We also found that suppressing the 2–6 d waves increased mid-tropospheric moisture by up to 8%, as well as overall atmospheric instability, near the western coast of northern Africa. Furthermore, the convective disturbances that developed into TCs exhibited stronger rotation, increased ascending motion, and higher rainfall.

This study evaluates the impact of land use and housing policies on building whole life carbon (WLC) emissions, introducing a novel approach that incorporates carbon stock losses from urban land expansion. Using geospatial data and standardized life cycle assessment methodologies, it analyzes residential buildings in Helsinki from 2001 to 2020. These are grouped into four regional housing portfolios (HPs), with 1040 observations, based on construction period and socioeconomic attributes. Findings show a 42% reduction in WLC emissions (from 24 to 14 kgCO2e m−2 a−1 in Vuosaari) during the study period. These reductions are primarily driven by energy system decarbonization and supported by improved building energy performance in new builds. However, embodied carbon remains a hidden challenge, though some progress is seen in one HP where a rise in biogenic construction led to 13% lower embodied emissions and a substantial increase in carbon storage (from 0.1 to 1.3 kgCO2e m−2 a−1). Densification efforts have mitigated carbon losses from land use change, yet they remain meaningful (4%–8% of new build emissions). While lower-density areas show greater carbon losses, the overall variation in emissions between densities in relatively small due to factors pertaining to other life cycle stages. Municipalities and developers must account for these carbon losses from new urban development to better reflect urban sustainability. Additionally, the study presents that carbon emissions per floor area offers only a partial view of building sustainability, as the functional unit moderately correlates with emissions per capita. Hence, a wider array of functional units are required in assessing building emissions. Future research could elaborate on such policies by proposing concrete operational plans."

Here, we assess how different fire frequencies and intensities influence tree mortality and carbon dynamics in southeastern Amazonia. Using a replicated randomized block design with 24 plots (40 × 40 m), we applied four treatments: unburned control, one burn in 2016 (B1), two burns in 2013 and 2016 (B2), and two burns with added fuel (B2+) to increase fire intensity. Forest inventories conducted from 2012 to 2024 measured tree mortality, diversity, composition, and aboveground biomass. Fire frequency and intensity significantly increased mortality, particularly among small trees, but impacts on forest structure and productivity were more nuanced. Aboveground biomass declined modestly in burned plots, with the greatest loss in B2+ (13%). Aboveground net primary productivity dropped immediately post-burn, especially in B2 and B2+, and partially recovered by 2022–2024. In contrast, leaf area index and litterfall rebounded within a couple of years, suggesting a degree of structural and functional resilience. Species richness and composition remained relatively stable in the years following the first experimental fires, but gradually declined and shifted in B2 and B2+ plots beginning in 2014. These results indicate that the experimental forests’ resilience to low-intensity and infrequent fires can prevent widespread forest collapse, but repeated and intensified burns likely undermine long-term resilience by altering forest structure, composition, and carbon dynamics. With the southeastern Amazon forests projected to burn more often in the coming decades, our results highlight both the vulnerability and recovery potential of these ecosystems. Maintaining ecological integrity and minimizing additional disturbances that influence fuel availability will be critical for sustaining forest functions under future fire regimes."

This dipole pattern remains remarkably stable in a warmer world, with strong model agreement. This suggests that the global and southern African circulation responses to ENSO (the teleconnection) remain robust under warming. However, parts of eastern southern Africa, including the water-critical Integrated Vaal River System catchment, the ENSO signal weakens or even reverses in CMIP6 model projections. This likely reflects a general wetting of eastern escarpment regions, especially during El Niños, which may be linked to mesoscale and oceanic processes associated with relatively warm El Niño events under future climate conditions."

Past observations have revealed rapid thinning of ice shelves, driven primarily by ocean-induced basal melting of their undersides. These processes weaken the shelves’ buttressing effect, potentially accelerating inland ice discharge, and raising concerns about marine ice-sheet instability. Despite recent advances in multi-mission satellite altimetry, gaps remain in quantifying the most recent basal melt trends at high spatial resolution and over shorter timescales. Here, we present a 5 year (2019–2023) time series of ice-shelf basal melting across major glaciers in the ASE, using new laser altimetry data from the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2). Our results reveal pronounced spatial melt patterns and substantial temporal variability in basal melt rates, highlighting a clear temporal coherence linked to El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phase transitions and associated atmospheric drivers. Furthermore, regional geometry significantly influences local variability in melt trends, underscoring the necessity of incorporating detailed bathymetric and climatic factors into predictive ice–ocean models. These ICESat-2—derived melt-rate estimates provide an up-to-date assessment of basal melting in the ASE and reinforce the urgent need to refine coupled ice–ocean models.

Although global studies have examined the CF of the healthcare sector, there remains a notable gap in research concerning the CF of long-term care (LTC) services, which are essential to human health and welfare. We harmonized environmental input–output analysis with data derived from the national representative consumer-expenditure survey and LTC insurance statistics obtained from domestic economic and medical datasets to detail the CF of Japanese households requiring LTC. In Japan, the CF per capita associated with care was boosted as the care level increased. Notably, there is a disparity of up to 14 times between the care level with the lowest CF emissions and that with the highest CF emissions. Furthermore, households with LTC insurance demonstrate higher per-capita CF than those without such insurance, even when other household consumption needs are considered. This trend may mitigate the reduction in total CF related to household consumption, despite a national population decline, due to the anticipated rise in demand for LTC driven by an aging population by the year 2050 which is the target year for achieving carbon neutrality in Japan. Although renewable energy promotion represents an effective supply-side solution, a demand-side approach, such as the prevention of LTC, offers benefits for both climate change mitigation and human health."

Austin,Quantifying the oscillatory evolution of simulated boundary-layer cloud fields using Gaussian process regression,"It is difficult to study the behaviour of a cloud field due to internal fluctuations and observational noise. We perform a high-resolution simulation of the boundary-layer cloud field and introduce statistical and numerical techniques, including machine-learning models, to study the evolution of the cloud field, which shows a periodic behaviour. We aim to use the numerical techniques to identify the underlying behaviour within noisy observations. 
 Average properties of the cloud field, such as cloud size distribution and cloud fraction, have previously been observed to evolve periodically. Identifying this behaviour, however, remains difficult due to the intrinsic variability within the boundary-layer cloud field. We apply a Gaussian process (GP) machine-learning model to the regression of the oscillatory behaviour in the statistical distributions of individual cloud properties. Individual cloud samples are retrieved from high-resolution large-eddy simulation, and the cloud size distribution is modelled based on a power-law fit. We construct the time series for the slope of the cloud size distribution b, a slope that is consistent with satellite observations of marine boundary-layer clouds, by observing the changes in the slope of the modelled cloud size distribution. Then, we build a GP model based on prior assumptions about the cloud field following observational studies: a boundary-layer cloud field goes through a phase of relatively strong convection where large clouds dominate, followed by a phase of relatively weak convection where precipitation leads to formation of cold pools and suppression of convective growth. The GP model successfully identifies the oscillatory behaviour from the noisy time series, within a period of 95±3.2 min. Furthermore, we examine the time series of cloud fraction fc and average vertical mass flux M‾, whose periods were 93±2.5 and 93±3.7 min, respectively. The oscillations reveal the role of precipitation in governing convective activities through recharge–discharge cycles."

A new analytic formulation is presented to compute coagulation partition coefficients, allowing us to lower the numerical diffusion associated with the resolution of aerosol dynamics. The significance of this effect is assessed in a 0D box model and over greater Paris with a chemistry transport model, using different size resolutions of the particle distribution. 
 As the health impacts of ultrafine particles become better understood, accurately modelling size distribution and number concentration in chemistry-transport models is becoming increasingly important. The number concentration is strongly affected by processes linked to aerosol dynamics: coagulation, condensation, gas- and particle-phase partitioning, and nucleation. Coagulation is usually solved using an Eulerian approach, relying on a fixed discretization of particle sizes. In contrast, condensation and evaporation processes are rather solved using a Lagrangian approach, requiring redistribution of particles on the fixed-size mesh. Here, a new analytic formulation is presented to compute efficiently coagulation partition coefficients, allowing us to dynamically adjust the discretization of the coagulation operator to the size mesh evolution  and  therefore solve all the processes linked to aerosol dynamics with a dynamics mesh approach, avoiding the redistribution on the fixed-size grid. This new approach has the advantage of reducing the numerical diffusion introduced by condensation. The significance of these effects on number concentrations is assessed in an idealized box setting, as well as over greater Paris with the chemistry-transport model Polyphemus/Polair3D coupled to the aerosol model SSH-aerosol, using different size resolutions of the particle distribution."

To accurately understand the physical–biogeochemical processes at the regional scale, physical and biogeochemical models were coupled at a high resolution. The results successfully simulated the seasonal variations of chlorophyll and nutrients, particularly in the marginal seas, which were not captured by global models. The developed model is an important tool for studying physical–biogeochemical processes. 
 The Northwest Pacific is characterized by the presence of the warm and nutrient-depleted Kuroshio Current and the cold and nutrient-enriched Oyashio Current. In this region, surface primary production leads to increased nutrient consumption and CO2 exchange. The Yellow and East China Seas (YECS) are predominantly influenced by freshwater input. A high resolution regional numerical model tailored to the specific features of each area is required to reproduce the different characteristics of each region. Therefore, to accurately analyze the physical and biogeochemical system, this study developed a new coupled physical–biogeochemical model combining the three-dimensional Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) and the Generic Ocean Turbulence Model Tracers of Phytoplankton with Allometric Zooplankton (TOPAZ) for the Northwest Pacific, including the YECS. The simulated physical and biogeochemical variables in the ROMS–TOPAZ (NPRT) were evaluated by comparing them with available observational data. NPRT successfully simulated the seasonal variability of chlorophyll and nutrients, capturing two peaks in spring and autumn that were not captured by the CMIP6 data. Particularly in the YECS, NPRT effectively represented the high phytoplankton biomass driven by the riverine effect, which is difficult to reproduce in global biogeochemical models with low-resolution. However, NPRT still exhibits significant biases in the subarctic region and marginal seas. To minimize the uncertainties in biogeochemical variables, it is necessary to refine the initial and boundary conditions, adjust parameters, and apply discharge forcing based on observational data. Despite these limitations, NPRT is an important tool for studying the interaction between ocean physics and biogeochemistry at a high resolution."

Designing low-dose exposure strategies is critical for biological nanosystems to avoid oxidative stress and subsequent inhibitory reactions. However, knowledge gaps remain in exploring adaptive evolutionary theories of low-dose exposure strategies, particularly in understanding the full complexity of transcriptional responses. In this study, systemic metrics and extracellular secretion behavior were analyzed holistically. A self-organizing mapping network algorithm was introduced to reveal key transcriptional patterns under low-dose nZVI exposure. Low-dose nZVI triggered extracellular secretion as the initial response, with uniform network structures in tightly bound extracellular polymers reflecting the core interaction variability. Moreover, the characteristic responses of the redox activity and energy exchange were found to underlie the transcriptional pattern of low-dose exposure. In contrast, the characteristic response pattern to high doses of nZVI suggested the activation of various repair and adaptation processes in the microbial community. These findings highlight a unique evolutionary mechanism for low-dose nZVI exposure and deepen our understanding of the selection of nZVI binding strategies by biological treatment processes."

We found that LFP exhibited a stronger inhibitory effect on plants than LMFP at the same exposure concentration. Molecular-level toxicological assessment shows that LFP and LMFP can damage cellular structures, trigger plant stress responses, alter metabolic processes, and reduce antioxidant levels, ultimately resulting in phytotoxicity. Mn doping in LMFP increases particle surface polarity, enhancing soil immobilization and reducing plant uptake. Molecular dynamics show LFP causes greater cellular membrane damage than LMFP, exacerbating plant stress. Notably, LFP inhibits antioxidant metabolism pathways, reducing plants’ ability to cope with abiotic stresses.

However, the increased electrical capacity provided by these offshore wind projects could result in some reduction in onshore electrical generating (EGU) facilities. Here, multiple air quality models (a reduced complexity tool and a more sophisticated photochemical grid model) were applied to predict annual average PM2.5 and seasonal average maximum daily 8 h average O3 impacts from offshore wind projects and resulting reductions in onshore EGUs. The reduced complexity tool reasonably replicated the magnitudes and spatial gradients of impacts predicted by the photochemical transport model. Air pollution impacts from the offshore wind energy projects tended to be highest nearest the projects. Air pollution impacts were much higher from the construction phase compared to postconstruction (operation and maintenance). Predicted reductions to onshore EGUs due to increased offshore energy capacity resulted in regional decreases in PM2.5 and O3 that outpaced increases related to offshore wind projects. This effect was more pronounced for population influenced PM2.5 compared to that for O3. This is likely due to offshore wind energy capacity being highest in the winter, which results in more onshore EGU emissions reductions outside of the summer season when precursor emissions would be most impactful on O3 production. Reductions in onshore EGU emissions were based on assumptions that the increased energy capacity would not simply meet increased demand over present-day levels or be balanced by non-fossil-fuel-based energy sources such as nuclear, solar, or onshore wind farms."

Strong La Niña induces negative SPMM more effectively than El Niño induces positive SPMM, due to differences in ENSO teleconnections and their intensity. During boreal summer and fall of strong La Niña, intense transient eddy feedback reshapes the Pacific‐South America pattern into a South Pacific Oscillation‐like pressure dipole, strengthening trade winds and promoting negative SPMM growth, a process absent in El Niño. In boreal winter, stronger La Niña teleconnections sustain negative SPMM into spring.

Here with numerical modeling, we demonstrate that the open central Eurasian seaway constitutes a conveyor for heat and salt transport from subtropical to high‐latitude waters, accompanied by wind‐induced northward currents through the WSS. The closure of the Kara Strait disrupts this poleward transport, leading to cooling and freshening of both the Arctic Ocean and the WSS. The resultant decline in Arctic surface salinities might have favored the Azolla Event."

However, the impact of flash droughts on the socioeconomic conditions has not been sufficiently explored. Here, we elucidate the evolutionary characteristics of flash droughts in China and project future trends in their impacts on socioeconomic conditions under different climate scenarios by analyzing soil moisture and socioeconomic data. We estimate that the frequency of flash droughts is projected to increase in specific regions of China, along with an increasingly substantial socioeconomic impact over time. Under SSP2‐4.5, the population and gross domestic product exposed to flash droughts are anticipated to reach 33% and 35% by the end of this century, respectively. Furthermore, richer subgroups face higher economic risks and greater social vulnerability. These findings may help policymakers assess the adverse effects of flash droughts and formulate policies to mitigate the threats to sustainability."

However, existing methods have limitations in capturing this process. The dielectric contrast between frozen and thawed soil induces diurnal amplitude variation (DAV) in brightness temperature at L‐band, providing a basis for tracking land‐atmosphere interactions. Our study shows that DAV effectively captures cold air masses' origin and seasonal movement. During a cold wave, its phase relationship with air and soil temperatures falls into four categories: precedes (−1.1 to −0.6 days), lags (0.71–0.98 days), in between (−0.62 to 0.34 days), and synchronized. Moreover, DAV lags air temperature in 63% of cases and precedes soil temperature in 59%, consistently fluctuating within their overlap region. This suggests DAV is a more direct indicator of freeze–thaw, reflecting the conditions at the atmosphere–land interface."

Millifluidic visualization revealed concentration‐dependent retention mechanisms: irreversible straining dominated at high CNT concentrations, while site‐blocking enabled delayed redistribution during flushing. SIP detected real‐time retention by chargeability (R2 = 0.82–0.96), while a DNN decoded SIP signals to predict spatially resolved CNT deposition (R2 = 0.926), outperforming phenomenological Cole‐Cole modeling.

We found that a palm swamp peatland in the Peruvian Amazon that was a strong annual sink for 2 years switched to carbon neutral in the absence of a major anthropogenic disturbance. We attributed the change in carbon sink strength to (a) photoinhibition of canopy photosynthesis when skies were clearer and thus solar irradiance higher and (b) increased ecosystem respiration when the water table position was below the peat surface, and heterotrophic respiration was amplified. These mechanisms were not, however, synchronous in time. The importance of photoinhibition as a driver of changes in peatland carbon budgets is a novel finding, and an understudied mechanism of canopy photosynthetic impairment. Shifts in climate that increase periods with sustained high solar irradiance and/or low water table are thus likely to amplify interannual variability in the carbon sink strength."

LiNGAM effectively identifies causal directions among variables of interest, revealing robust relationships such as those among the lifting condensation level (LCL), level of free convection (LFC), and convective inhibition (CIN), aligning with prior knowledge. Relative humidity is shown to directly influence LMD; however, this relationship exhibits strong nonlinearity and becomes difficult to detect when the contrast between oceanic and continental environments is excluded from the analysis.

Coarse‐resolution climate models do not resolve small‐scale structures at the air‐sea state, which, due to nonlinearities in the coupling bulk formulas, can impact the large‐scale air‐sea exchange—a mechanism that has received little attention in the literature. Since observations at the temporal and spatial coverage needed to study this problem do not yet exist, we quantify the impact of this small‐scale heterogeneity on the large‐scale air‐sea heat flux by analyzing 1/10° coupled simulations. This effect systematically cools the ocean by about 4 W/m2 ${\text{W/m}}^{2}$ globally, with regional impacts reaching up to 100 W/m2 ${\text{W/m}}^{2}$.

Under greenhouse warming, ENSO is projected to strengthen pre‐2100 and weaken thereafter, but how ENSO asymmetry may change is unclear. Here we show that despite a muted change in the 21st century, ENSO amplitude asymmetry in sea surface temperature (SST) weakens substantially post‐2100 under persistent greenhouse warming. In a warming climate beyond 2100, the eastern Pacific continues to warm faster than the surrounding regions, pushing SSTs above the convective threshold. A wetter background favors a larger rainfall reduction in response to cold SST anomalies, thereby diminishing the nonlinearity of convective response and associated coupled feedbacks with respect to El Niño and La Niña.

Consistent with previous studies, poleward jet shifts displace storm‐track clouds, creating lower tropospheric radiative heating anomalies poleward of the mean jet latitude and cooling anomalies on the equatorward side of the mean jet latitude where large‐scale subsidence increases low cloud fraction. Whether these radiative heating anomalies can affect SAM persistence is also investigated in CMIP6 models. If observed sea surface temperatures are prescribed, models that simulate low cloud responses more realistically show less SAM persistence, aligning more closely with observations. Our results based on CMIP6 models agree with a recent idealized modeling study and suggest that atmospheric cloud radiative heating anomalies, induced by the poleward jet shift, contribute to a reduction in SAM persistence."

 The retreat of Antarctic ice shelves due to calving and the subsequent reduction in buttressing of the Antarctic Ice Sheet are of major concern for future sea-level rise. Sudden, widespread calving of weakened ice shelves has been linked to fracture amplification forced by ocean swell following regional sea-ice losses, but increases in the magnitudes and durations of swell-induced ice-shelf flexure in the lead-ups to calving events have not been tracked. Here we present 7-year datasets of sea-ice-barrier lengths and shelf-front flexural stress that encompass large-scale calving events for the Wilkins and Voyeykov ice shelves. We find that the ice shelves exhibit similar preconditioning patterns, characterized by prolonged amplifications in flexure and the collapse of adjoining fast-ice barriers. We propose a conceptual model for the swell–sea-ice–shelf-front conditions that lead to calving events, show that it fits other major calving events and discuss the likely importance of sea-ice loss for the future of ice shelves.

 Soil conservation practices such as no-till and straw mulching have been practised worldwide, but they frequently show low potential to increase organic carbon and crop grain production, especially in rice paddy systems. Here a ditch-buried straw return technique is proposed to co-enhance soil carbon and crop yield in paddy systems through injection of straw into the subsoil. This technique can protect most of the surface soil and disturb only 10% of the whole field through deep tillage. A 15-year ditch-buried straw return experiment in rice–wheat cropping has shown that compared to the dominant rotary-tillage straw return management, grain yield was increased under ditch-buried straw return by 15% without any additional fertilization inputs. Ditch-buried straw return also increased soil organic carbon stocks at 0–40 cm depth by 46% (17.2 Mg ha−1) mainly through the enhanced conversion of straw-derived carbon into mineral-associated fungal necromass. Overall, ditch-buried straw return decreased net CO2 equivalent emissions by 34% and increased net economic benefits by 18%. Joint enhancements of soil organic carbon and crop yield under ditch-buried straw return were further validated using meta-analysis around China. We conclude that ditch-buried straw return may work as an effective approach for subsoil management.

Here, the authors present a fabrication method to create patchy active particles of arbitrary shape by microstenciling. 
 Active particles, which locally dissipate energy from their environment to function, are useful across disciplines given their dynamic and programmable behaviors. Altering particle shape or surface asymmetry has led to advancements in controlled locomotion or collective behavior for diverse applications such as microrobotics or biomedicine. However, making arbitrary active particles of precise shape and surface composition remains a significant challenge due to limitations in conventional fabrication methods. This paper introduces a fabrication technique that combines two-photon lithography with sacrificial stencil masking to deposit arbitrary metallic patches onto particles of any shape with a limit of resolution as low as 0.2 µm. Using this method, we demonstrate three varieties of active particles displaying nonconventional dynamics: electrokinetic active spheres with tunable three-dimensional motions, catalytic microdiscs with chiral axial spinning, and steric magnetic particles forming self-limiting microrobots. Overall, this high-resolution microstenciling technique offers a versatile strategy to create well-defined active particles and microrobots for numerous practical uses.

 Iatrogenic nerve injury is a surgical complication with significant morbidity. This clinical trial, now complete, investigates the systemic administration of bevonescein, which selectively binds to nerves, in a single-arm, prospective multi-center, dose-escalation Phase 1 trial in adult patients with head and neck neoplasms undergoing parotidectomy or thyroidectomy in the United States. Twenty-seven participants are enrolled in the trial and receive the systemic agent. The primary outcome is safety with no dose-limiting toxicity among the 27 patients, but a single adverse event was identified that was possibly related to the study drug (vomiting). Secondary outcomes include the pharmacokinetics, optimal dose, and timing of bevonescein. The half-life of bevonescein is 29–72 min, and the optimal dose is 500 mg by objective measures, with the fluorescence signal-to-background ratio (SBR; 2.1 ± 0.8) significantly higher compared to white light (1.3 ± 0.2; p = 0.003). The fluorescent SBR of nerves between the early (1–3 h) versus late (3–5 h) timing cohorts is not statistically different. Here, we present data of a nerve imaging agent showing that preoperative intravenous infusion of bevonescein is well tolerated.

Here, the authors identify a tooth-specific mechanism of bone formation in which the Hedgehog–Foxf pathway regulates the alveolar bone osteoblast fates of DF progenitor cells. 
 The alveolar bone is a specialized mineralized structure supporting the lifelong functionality of the tooth in mastication. The alveolar bone develops from the dental follicle (DF) during tooth root formation due to deliberate epithelial–mesenchymal interactions. However, how DF progenitor cell fates are regulated toward alveolar bone osteoblasts remains unknown. We find that Hedgehog signaling activities are transiently activated during the onset of tooth root formation and alveolar bone formation. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP)-expressing DF cells are highly responsive to Hedgehog signaling, yet constitutive Hedgehog activation using Pthrp-creER and Ptch1-floxed alleles potently suppresses alveolar osteoblast and ligament differentiation of PTHrP+ DF cells, resulting in striking susceptibility to alveolar bone loss. Concomitant inactivation of Hedgehog-target Foxf1 factor in Hedgehog-activated PTHrP+ DF cells partially rescued alveolar bone defects. Therefore, the Hedgehog–Foxf pathway needs to be suppressed to drive alveolar bone osteoblast fates of PTHrP+ DF cells, unraveling a unique tooth-specific mechanism of bone formation requiring deliberate on-off regulations of Hedgehog signaling. The alveolar bone supports the tooth’s lifelong functionality. Here, the authors identify a tooth-specific mechanism of bone formation in which the Hedgehog–Foxf pathway regulates the alveolar bone osteoblast fates of DF progenitor cells."

 Multi-dimensional mechanoreceptors are crucial for both humans and robots, providing omnidirectional force/torque senses to ensure dexterous and precise manipulations. Current six-axis force/torque sensors are bulky, heavy, and rigid with complicated sensing structures and high-cost manufacture. Although flexible force sensors have emerged recently, their perceptive dimension and performance are limited and still unsatisfactory for practical applications.

The sensor accurately perceives six-dimensional force/torque via capturing the spatial strain field of an elastic piezo-thermic material utilizing web-like scattered thin-film thermoreceptors. Integrating the sensor on the fingertip of humans or robots, we or robots can dexterously manipulate objects (e.g., open bottle cap), play games, and accomplish human-robot collaborative operations via easy fingertip-touch, demonstrating a broad prospect in applications of helping disabled and elderly people, intelligent robots, and virtual reality.

 Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change. Yet, little is known about the relationship between exposure to extreme events, subjective attribution of these events to climate change, and climate policy support, especially in the Global South. Combining large-scale natural and social science data from 68 countries (N = 71,922), we develop a measure of exposed population to extreme weather events and investigate whether exposure to extreme weather and subjective attribution of extreme weather to climate change predict climate policy support. We find that most people support climate policies and link extreme weather events to climate change. Subjective attribution of extreme weather was positively associated with policy support for five widely discussed climate policies. However, exposure to most types of extreme weather event did not predict policy support. Overall, these results suggest that subjective attribution could facilitate climate policy support. Literature produced inconsistent findings regarding the links between extreme weather events and climate policy support across regions, populations and events.

 Reactive chlorine chemistry strongly influences the regulation of atmospheric oxidation capacity, thereby exerting profound impacts on the formation of secondary pollutants and air quality. However, current understanding of distributions and formation mechanisms of reactive chlorine species under the influence of air masses induced by pollution remains limited. In this study, we observed a significant increase in the concentrations of ClNO2, Cl2, and HOCl driven by pollution under the influence of continental air masses. By integrating field observations with model simulations, we revealed that unknown sources of these chlorine species are associated with nitrate photolysis and aerosol iron-mediated photochemical processes. The elevated levels of chlorine species promoted the increase in ROx radical concentrations, considerably intensifying the chemical formation of O3 and PAN and changing their sensitivity. These findings highlight the importance of anthropogenic pollutants in driving chlorine chemistry and provide scientific insights into its significance in regulating photochemical pollution."

 Tropical convection anomaly could serve as a crucial driver of global atmospheric teleconnections and weather extremes around the world. However, quantifying the dominances of convection anomalies with regional discrepancies, relevant for the variations of global atmospheric circulations, remains challenging. By using a network analysis of observation-based rainfall and ERA5 reanalysis datasets, our study reveals that El Niño-like convection is the most primary rainfall pattern driving the global atmospheric circulation variations. High local concurrences of above-normal rainfall events over equatorial central-eastern Pacific amplify their impacts, even though the most intense rainfall anomalies are observed near the Maritime Continent. Furthermore, we find that the impacts of El Niño-like convection will be tripled by the end of this century, as projected consistently by 23 climate models. Such “rich nodes get richer” phenomenon is probably attributable to the dipolar rainfall changes over the equatorial western-central Pacific. This study highlights the dominant role of El Niño-like convection on the global climate variations, especially under the future changing climate."

Here, we develop an integrated analytical framework combining a detailed sectoral emission inventory, index decomposition analysis, and a clustering algorithm to investigate China’s synergetic patterns of air pollutant and CO2 emissions across 15 socioeconomic sectors from 2000 to 2020 and uncover the co-drivers behind these trends, with detailed temporal, sectoral, and spatial dynamics revealed. Our analysis suggests that historical policies have effectively curbed air pollutant emissions, while abating CO2 emissions remains a challenge.

 Fine particle (PM2.5) controls in China have achieved great success these years, but heavy haze pollution still occurs occasionally. The sources and evolution of the complex organic mixtures remain poorly resolved. We collected 46 PM2.5 samples during a 12-day severe haze episode in Wuhan, a megacity in central China. We analyzed the molecular-level organic composition and functional groups with high-performance liquid chromatography-orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-Orbitrap MS/MS). The methanol-soluble nitrogenous organics (ONs) contributed 87.6% and 52.5% of total signal intensity in positive electrospray ionization (ESI + ) mode and negative electrospray ionization (ESI-) mode, respectively. Through source apportionment and backward trajectory analysis, we found great contribution of biomass burning (~21.2% of ONs in ESI+ mode and 78.2% in ESI- mode) and significant aqueous/heterogenous products (~71.2% of ONs in ESI+ mode and 18.7% in ESI- mode) during the prolonged, highly-humid evolution (relative humidity ~86.8% lasting for 7 days). We identified C6–C12 amines and C6-C9 nitrophenols as possible molecular markers for biomass burning emissions, while C17-C19 amine oligomers and dicarboxylic acids as secondary markers from heterogeneous/aqueous reactions. The evolution may include three pathways: (1) polymerization of amines with an oxygenated molecule to form long-chain oxygenated amine oligomers; (2) ring-opening fragmentation of nitrophenols to form dicarboxylic acids; (3) ring-retaining functionalization of nitroaromatics to form nitroaromatic carboxylic acids. Pathway 3 has rarely been observed in ambient air, which is possibly related with the extremely high humidity during the periods and deserves further studies. Lastly, we found that ~39.3% of ON compounds had isomers, and ~43.7% of these isomers had distinct timeseries and originated from different sources, strengthening the necessity of measuring isomers. With the help of tandem high-resolution mass spectrometry, this study provides valuable datasets for the molecular and structural information on sources and evolutions of ONs under the highly-humid urban atmospheres."

 Climate responses to external forcings involve processes across a wide range of scales. While the ability of climate models to accurately simulate these responses remains uncertain, the computational cost of high-resolution models limits their use for long-term simulations. However, key atmospheric processes are initiated within days of a perturbation, suggesting that initial responses may offer valuable insight into resolution-dependent differences. Here we investigate initial climate responses to increased carbon dioxide and black carbon using a regional climate model at five resolutions, from 62.5 km to 100 m. Despite large differences in grid spacing, responses in radiative fluxes and temperature are remarkably consistent. Cloud responses are generally similar, though summer differences emerge, while precipitation shows stronger resolution dependence.

 The management of coastal blue carbon ecosystems can contribute to mitigate anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. However, limited information on soil organic carbon (OC) decay rates in tidal marsh, mangrove, and seagrass soils hinders their inclusion in climate strategies and carbon-crediting schemes. Here, we analyzed downcore OC trends in 3761 soil cores from blue carbon ecosystems worldwide. A decrease in OC content with soil depth was measured in 63% of the cores, whereas stable and increasing trends were observed in 22% and 15% of the cores, respectively.

 The weak linkage between heavy rainfall and strong convection hampers predictability of extreme precipitation and hinders efforts to address challenges related to global warming, especially given unclear microphysical differences between convective clouds generating disparate rain rates. Using multi-year records from spaceborne precipitation radars and cloud-permitting ensemble simulations, here we reveal microphysical distinctions between “heavier” and “lighter” rainfall in convective precipitation events worldwide, as well as their differences in environmental conditions. Results suggest that the near-surface rain rates are dictated mainly by liquid-phase processes, but the more extreme rainfall is mostly produced by vigorous mixed-phase processes combined with a rough balance between breakup and coalescence of liquid drops. With comparable convective intensity, “heavier” rainfall-producing events possess substantially higher raindrop concentration with enhanced coalescence, supported by increased environmental moisture and thicker warm-cloud layers due to enhanced water vapor channels from oceans. The “heavier” rainfall-producing weak convection is formed in the most humid environment, which compensates for the lack of vigorous mixed-phase processes leading to a maritime-like characteristic. These novel insights, along with future projections of larger-scale circulation changes by the state-of-the-art climate models, highlight the increased risk of more frequent and extreme rainfall in southern Asia and the maritime continent islands.

 China is a major hotspot of black carbon (BC) emissions, contributing to climate warming and risk to public health. Here, our dual-isotope-constrained observations indicate stringent air pollution controls have drastically reduced coal-burning in North China over the past decade, marking a transition to a “post-coal” era compared to earlier 2012–2014. However, biomass-burning fraction (fbb) for north/central/east winter hazes has doubled from earlier (north/east) ~20%, with significantly higher fbb during polluted winters. Comparisons between observation and transport modelling show good alignment in BC concentrations but substantial discrepancies in source attribution (i.e., fbb). Leveraging radiocarbon measurements, advanced atmospheric modelling, and a Bayesian approach, our study identifies biases stemming from misallocated residential fuel types in emission inventories. These findings underscore the untapped potential to mitigate BC emissions by targeting rural biomass burning, while providing critical insights into BC source evolution to refine emission inventories and formulate effective air quality policies for China and other nations facing severe air pollution.

 The position of continents and oceans in geological time dictates the biogeographic dispersal of life, influences the preservation of mineral resources, and informs our understanding of Earth’s climate trajectory. Reconstructing past crustal locations requires a plate tectonic model that differs depending on whether the model uses a mantle reference frame, or a paleomagnetic reference frame, which considers the rotation between the plate-mantle system and the planetary core (true polar wander). However, reconstructions with mantle or paleomagnetic reference frames have been used interchangeably without quantifying their impact on paleoclimate simulations. Here, we conduct a sensitivity experiment to assess the impact of using a mantle versus a pure paleomagnetic absolute reference frame in simulating global paleoclimate. We show that throughout the Mesozoic and Cenozoic, reference frame choice leads to regional surface temperature differences of over 20 °C and 15 °C respectively. An analysis of Jurassic glendonite and Eocene crocodilian distribution suggest favourable conditions that are more consistent with a paleomagnetic reference frame. These results emphasize the importance of selecting an appropriate tectonic reference frame in deep-time climate research. We advocate for adopting a pure paleomagnetic reference frame, which provides a more reliable record of paleo-latitudes by capturing motions from true polar wander.

 Tungsten deposits are typically associated with crust-derived evolved granitoids. Whether the mantle has contributed to tungsten mineralization, however, is unknown. Here, we provide new and compiled helium‒argon‒mercury‒strontium‒neodymium isotope data in South China and tungsten provinces elsewhere to evaluate this contribution. Our analysis shows that oceanic-subduction-related extension is more likely to facilitate intense tungsten mineralization than other geodynamic processes, e.g., continental collision, post-collisional extension, and intracontinental rifting. During this process, the mantle provides heat for inducing slab devolatilization, whereby abundant helium‒argon‒mercury‒(fluorine) are mobilized into the crust. The 1.8‒1.2 Ga neodymium model ages of the source rocks coincide with the Nuna supercontinent cycle, together with deep-time zircon data, suggesting that the considerable tungsten enrichment of the crust over geological time resulted from mantle-plume-related activities. The above hypothesis is confirmed by the proportion of tungsten-rich basement rocks in major tungsten provinces, highlighting the essential role of the mantle in tungsten recycling and mineralization.

 The seasonal variation of precipitation isotopes (δ18Op) exhibits a north-south dipole in the East Asian monsoon region, correlating with temperature in northern China and precipitation in southern China. However, on longer timescales, δ18Op tends to exhibit spatial coherence. This inconsistency in δ18Op variability across different timescales has sparked considerable debate regarding their climatic interpretation. Here we develop a unified framework to quantify the mechanisms driving δ18Op variability across timescales using water tagging experiments in iCAM5.3 numerical model. Our results demonstrate that δ18Op variations are governed primarily by monsoon-driven changes in moisture source and enroute depletion, rather than local meteorological factors. Furthermore, the relative importance of these processes differs across timescales. Therefore, the evolution of the East Asian summer monsoon, as recorded in δ18Op, should be interpreted through the lens of these two sub-processes of the monsoon system, rather than based solely on the empirical isotopic effects observed on seasonal timescales.

 The United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda), encompassing 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), serves as a framework for global development. However, hurdles such as lack of data, insufficient research methods, and uneven development have hindered progress in implementing the 2030 Agenda. Earth observation (EO) provides objective, space-based data supporting SDG assessments and policymaking for the environmental, socioeconomic development, and human activity. The successful launch of Sustainable Development Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1) in November 2021 marked the beginning of the first science satellite program dedicated to supporting the 2030 Agenda. This paper provides an overview of the SDGSAT-1 mission and its three sensors: Thermal Infrared Spectrometer (TIS), Glimmer Imager (GLI), and Multispectral Imager (MSI), and details the sensors' capabilities in supporting SDG-related research and the future outlook of the Sustainable Development Satellite Constellation. To monitor, evaluate, and study SDGs, SDGSAT-1 collaboratively uses its three sensors to precisely depict traces of human activity day and night, supporting global achievement of the SDGs and research on human-nature interactions. Fostered by the SDGSAT-1 Open Science Program, launched in September 2022, data from SDGSAT-1 is freely available to scientific communities worldwide, accelerating EO-supported SDG applications.

 The availability of long-term, annually harmonized nighttime light (NTL) data is pivotal for monitoring human activities across past decades. The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) has provided over 20 years of NTL observations, facilitating extensive global and regional studies. With the termination of DMSP NTL in 2013 and the subsequent introduction of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) NTL data, we previously developed the global harmonized NTL dataset (H-NTL-v1), which offers a temporally extended and consistent time series data from 1992 to 2022. Despite its widespread use, the H-NTL-v1 dataset has been affected by noise from auroras and transient lights, particularly in high-latitude areas. In this study, we present an innovative method that employs temporal frequency analysis and Pareto surface optimization to address these challenges, resulting in an improved global harmonized NTL dataset (H-NTL-v2). This enhanced dataset markedly improves the consistency between historical DMSP (1992–2013) and the DMSP-like estimates post-2014. For aurora affected city lights, here we did not implement a specific correction algorithm. Our results indicate that the improved H-NTL-v2, spanning 1992 to 2022, significantly reduces auroral noise and inter-annual variability. Compared to the original H-NTL-v1, the improved H-NTL-v2 demonstrates strong agreement with DMSP observation in 2012 and 2013. It exhibits significantly diminished fluctuation in total lit pixels and digital numbers, particularly for low-luminance pixels. This refined dataset minimizes noise impacts from auroras and other sources, enhancing the application potential of NTL data in studies of light pollution, urban slums, and poverty and inequality in developing regions."

 Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a fundamental variable for determining mass (water, carbon) and energy surface fluxes. LST can be obtained from remote sensing but under varying configuration geometries that create directional effects due to the inherent anisotropy properties of most terrestrial targets. Actually, thermal infrared (TIR) measurements obtained from satellites or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are seriously impacted by varying viewing and solar geometries (Cao et al., 2019). In this regard, a computationally efficient approach to handle them is using kernel-driven models (KDM), as they were shown to be an effective solution. However, in high-resolution scenes, the structural features can be very detailed and, in this case, the assumption of homogeneity in considering traditional KDM no longer holds. This is why we propose to develop a novel KDM that is able to handle typical heterogeneous scenes whose structure is dominated by rows. Rather than improving existing point-spread kernels, we propose a line-spread kernel considering the row orientation and radiative occlusion. This new KDM is validated with both airborne measurements and simulated datasets generated by three-dimensional radiative transfer models. Results indicate that: 1) This proposed Heterogenous KDM captures the directional anisotropies of temperatures in row-planted vineyard canopies, whereas the traditional point-spread KDM show limitations. In most cases, root mean squared errors (RMSE) improved up to 0.5 K. 2) A sensitivity analysis based on simulated datasets also showed a better performance of the new proposed KDM under different cases including LAI and row height/width. 3) Further simple validation using UAV and sandbox measurements has demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed KDM in urban and mountainous areas, where stripe characteristics in thermal radiation directionality are present. In conclusion, this study proposes a novel KDM with significant practical implications for heterogeneous scenarios."

 Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) export from non-point sources significantly threaten water quality in mountainous regions undergoing rapid agricultural intensification and urbanization. However, existing research often neglects multi-scale analyses across administrative levels and provides limited insight into the complex drivers of nutrient export in data-scarce mountainous regions. This study presents a novel integrated modeling framework by coupling the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model with Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR) to analyze N and P export dynamics in Yunnan Province from 2000 to 2019. We reveal a temporal turning point around 2011, with declining nutrient exports before 2011 followed by a rising trend linked to policy changes and intensified land use. Spatially, high N and P export clusters occur in densely populated, agriculturally intensive central and southeastern Yunnan, while forested northwestern areas exhibit low export. Prefecture-scale drivers are dominated by population density, fertilizer application, and industrial activity, whereas county-scale drivers highlight cropland area, precipitation, and terrain factors. Importantly, natural and anthropogenic factors interact to shape nutrient export patterns, underscoring the need for spatially differentiated management. The integration of InVEST-GTWR reflects methodological innovations that capture spatio-temporal non-stationarity and provide actionable insights for targeted nutrient pollution control in mountainous regions, with high model accuracy (R2 = 0.98 at the prefecture scale and R2 = 0.95 at the county scale)."

The Cumulative Human Activity Intensity (CHAI) index, incorporating land use, nighttime lights, population density, GDP, and tourism activities, is introduced to assess human activity’s spatial impact on land surface temperature (LST). Key findings include: (1) The nighttime SUHI effect is more pronounced and spatially concentrated, with stronger LST warming and a northwestward shift of the SUHI core; (2) The impact of human activities on LST shows spatial heterogeneity, with urban areas experiencing stronger warming than suburban areas. Specifically, sparsely built areas (LCZ9) and open low-rise zones (LCZ6) contribute significantly to warming; (3) Human activities more strongly influence nighttime LST, with this effect intensified by the synergistic interaction between topographic and meteorological factors.

 Soil moisture (SM) is vital for comprehending the hydrological cycle and managing climatic extremes. Fine-scale accurate SM products hold more and more significant value to water management and precise agricultural irrigation. While in-situ measurements provide high accuracy, their limited spatial coverage and high costs necessitate alternative approaches. Remote sensing enables large-scale monitoring; however, satellite-based SM products have relatively lower spatial resolution, making them less suitable for practical applications. This study presents an innovative high-resolution surface soil moisture (SSM) retrieval framework combining machine learning (ML), change detection and downscaling (CD-DS) methods. The procedure is applied over Catalonia, Spain. The framework integrates Sentinel-1 SAR, Sentinel-2 normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI), and DISPATCH background SSM data to generate 30-m resolution SSM. A novel backscatter difference variable, derived from the change detection method, improves model performance by addressing vegetation. The ML model was trained using in-situ SSM data collected from 2017 to 2021 and validated against independent in-situ measurement datasets. Among the evaluated algorithms, XGBoost model performed best, achieving an R2 of 0.933 and RMSE of 0.023 cm3/cm3. Validation with ground measurements with different landcover types showed an average correlation of 0.63, a ubRMSE of 0.045 cm3/cm3, and minimal bias of 0.024 cm3/cm3. Notably, backscatter difference emerged as the second most important variable in the ML model after background SSM, highlighting its significance in improving SSM retrieval accuracy. Comparisons with data from 54 measurement sites, obtained during a 2015 field campaign, yielded an R value of 0.82, a RMSE of 0.06 cm3/cm3. Temporal analysis revealed strong consistency with in-situ data, capturing seasonal trends and abrupt changes after precipitation and irrigation events. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of SSM is closely aligned with irrigation type maps, showing higher SSM values in irrigated areas and lower values in rainfed regions. This approach delivers precise field-scale SSM estimates, making it a valuable tool for drought monitoring and modern agricultural practices."

 A crop drought process generally consists of meteorological and agricultural drought periods. The temporal-spatial characteristics of meteorological and agricultural droughts during the summer maize (Zea mays L.) drought process from 2000 to 2020 in the Huang-Huai-Hai (HHH) region in China were investigated by using 10-day Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI10) and Vegetation Water Index (VWI) in this study. Variations of meteorological and agricultural droughts for summer maize were basically the same in terms of severity, frequency, extent, and centroid of drought in HHH from 2000 to 2020. Nevertheless, the spatial patterns of extents, high-frequency occurrences, and centroid migration for mild, moderate, and severe meteorological drought may not completely align with those for agricultural drought of the corresponding severity levels. Results indicated that agricultural drought severity was related to the stage in which the meteorological drought occurred. Spatially, drought frequency (>30 %) clustered in western Henan, eastern Shandong, and the northern HHH, with meteorological drought extents consistently exceeding agricultural drought. Three-dimensional drought-day structures revealed agricultural drought persistence while shorter meteorological drought durations, emphasizing recovery lag. The zonal variations of meteorological and agricultural drought centroids were respectively driven by the sea surface temperature (contribution of 58.39 %) and the mid-high latitude atmospheric circulation (contribution of 58.39 %), and the meridional variations of meteorological and agricultural drought centroids were respectively driven by mid-low latitude atmospheric circulation (contribution of 38.44 %) and sea surface temperature (contribution of 52.73 %). Different climatic drivers of the two types of droughts jointly shaped the same migration direction, resulting in consistency in the migration (slightly moving towards the southwest during 2000–2020) of the two types of drought events, with annual longitude variation of −0.05° and − 0.007°, and latitude variation of −0.02° and − 0.01° for meteorological and agricultural droughts, respectively.

 This study investigated the behavior of aerosols influenced by a precipitating extratropical cyclone (ETC) passing over the Korean Peninsula during 11–13 November 2022 using WRF-Chem. The cold front associated with the ETC facilitated the convergence of pollutants along the front, forming a narrow PM2.5 band over China. During this process, the surface PM2.5 concentration in the core increased by 20 %. The converged PM2.5 was uplifted by a strong lifting airstream ahead of the front. The eastward-moving ETC transported PM2.5 from China to Korea through both the upper and lower atmosphere. Sulfate was a major component of transboundary PM2.5, while nitrate was a key contributor to locally elevated PM2.5. The Korean Peninsula benefited from clean and warm air supplied by the warm conveyor belt of the ETC from the East China Sea, which diluted local PM2.5 and volatilized nitrate into its gaseous form based on equilibrium partitioning. Wet scavenging during the cold front passage further reduced PM2.5 concentrations, particularly at altitudes above the boundary layer, by up to −26.1 μg m−3, resulting in very low PM2.5 levels over the Korean Peninsula when the cold front arrived. Additionally, clouds in the ETC provided an environment conducive to sulfate formation via in-cloud phase reactions, with cloud-phase sulfate accounting for 1 %–10 % of the total sulfate.

 Global warming is driving increased cooling demand for air conditioning worldwide, yet the impacts of air conditioning waste heat (ACWH) on urban hydroclimatic extremes remain underexplored. The Shenzhen-Hong Kong area (SHA), one of China's most densely populated and energy-intensive coastal regions, exhibits a notable urban rain island effect. This study investigates the role of ACWH in summer short-duration intense rainfall (SDIR) events in the SHA using a high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with a local climate zone (LCZ) map. The WRF model, with AC settings incorporated, effectively reproduces diurnal variations in local meteorological variables, particularly air temperature and rainfall distribution. Scenario comparisons (AC on/off) reveal that ACWH significantly increases the spatial heterogeneity of afternoon SDIR patterns, with peak rainfall intensity rising by an average of approximately 22 % in Shenzhen and 3 % in Hong Kong's urban areas. ACWH accounts for 12.87 ± 7.79 % of the net all-wave radiation over urban areas in pre-storm environments, altering the land–atmosphere energy balance mainly by increasing sensible heat flux, particularly in compact high-rise areas (LCZ1). This stronger surface heat flux enhances the urban heat island circulation and boundary layer instability (e.g., deepening the planetary boundary layer and raising the lifted condensation level) and carries more moisture supply from the ocean into the urban atmosphere, which together intensify local rainfall. Results underscore the significant role of ACWH in urban summer intense rainfall, emphasizing the need for future numerical models to incorporate AC-related dynamic processes to improve predictions of urban hydroclimatic extremes, especially in rapidly urbanizing cities with high cooling demand."

 Accurate precipitation estimation over the Tibetan Plateau is crucial yet challenging due to its complex terrain, pronounced diurnal thermal variations, and sparse in situ observations. This study comprehensively evaluates three widely used datasets—IMERG-V06F, IMERG-V07F, and ERA5-Land—against gauge observations, focusing on their performance in capturing overall precipitation characteristics and diurnal cycles. A novel bias decomposition method (BDM) is further applied to disaggregate the total bias (Tbias) into frequency (PF) and intensity (PI) components, thereby offering a more nuanced understanding of error sources. The results indicate that while all three datasets replicate the general southeast-to-northwest precipitation gradient, ERA5-Land exhibits a pronounced wet bias, primarily driven by an overestimation of precipitation frequency. IMERG-V07F outperforms IMERG-V06F in mitigating excessive precipitation peaks but introduces sporadic anomalies in regions of complex topography. The BDM analysis reveals a critical insight that ERA5-Land's substantial positive PF bias often masks its negative PI bias, leading to an overall Tbias magnitude deceptively appears similar to that of the IMERG products. Assessments of the diurnal cycle confirm systematic discrepancies in timing: IMERG datasets consistently predict earlier precipitation peak, whereas ERA5-Land triggers midday peaks prematurely. These findings underscore the importance of refining Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE)-based convective parameterizations, enhancing satellite retrieval algorithms for mountainous terrain, and integrating high-resolution observations. The application of the BDM provides a valuable diagnostic framework for targeting specific error components—either frequency or intensity—which can facilitate more accurate precipitation modeling and ultimately improve hydrological forecasts over the Tibetan Plateau."

Key findings demonstrate that ∼55.2 % of DBVs are associated with thunderstorms, with notable variations among different types. Specifically, longer-lived (≥6 h) and mobile types of DBVs exhibit significantly higher thunderstorm co-occurrence rates (∼ 66.3 % and ∼ 79.7 %), in contrast to their shorter-lived (<6 h) and quasi-stationary counterparts. Longer-lived DBVs show thunderstorm and lightning activity peaking during maintenance and development stages respectively, while their shorter-lived counterparts primarily generate thunderstorms in formation stage and concentrate lightning activity in maintenance and dissipation stages. Thunderstorms predominantly occur in DBVs' southeastern quadrant (∼ 55.5 %), with this concentration increasing to ∼ 58.9 % for longer-lived DBVs, contrasting with the least active northwestern quadrant. DBVs' internal structure fundamentally modulates thunderstorm genesis through convective parameter optimization - enhanced energy potential, elevated moisture content, reduced lifting condensation level, intensified vertical wind shear, and amplified updraft intensity - thereby establishing favorable thermodynamic-dynamic regimes that systematically enhance storm development likelihood. DBVs-associated thunderstorms demonstrate greater dependence on dynamic forcings (vertical wind shear, ascending motion, low-level convergence) and moisture supply compared to non-DBV counterparts, with thermodynamic instability playing a subordinate role. Interactions between robust dynamic mechanisms and sufficient moisture availability enable efficient thunderstorm genesis even under suboptimal thermodynamic conditions, elucidating DBVs' unique convective modulation capabilities."
