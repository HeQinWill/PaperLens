However, their sources and transboundary dynamics in ecologically fragile regions such as the Himalayas remain poorly resolved. Here, we combined antimony stable isotopes (ε123Sb), air-mass trajectory analysis, and multivariate mixing modeling to elucidate the sources and seasonal transport mechanisms of SbPM2.5 at Mount Qomolangma Station (QOMS) on the Tibetan Plateau, based on year-round samples collected during the premonsoon, monsoon, postmonsoon, and winter seasons. The annual mean Sb concentration (0.88 ± 0.64 ng m–3) was comparable to values reported for European urban sites, indicating a substantial transboundary influence. Sb isotopic signatures (ε123Sb: −1.92 to +1.61 ε) exhibited clear seasonality: lighter values prevailed in winter and premonsoon samples and were associated with South Asian coal combustion (28 ± 10%) and biomass burning (29 ± 10%), whereas heavier values in the postmonsoon period reflected an increased contribution from desert dust (41 ± 11%). Monsoon-driven precipitation modulated the observed isotopic composition with wet scavenging preferentially removing lighter isotopes. A multivariate mixing model that integrates Sb isotopes and Rb/Sr ratios resolved three primary sources, desert dust (23–64%), coal combustion (13–46%), and biomass burning (14–45%), whose influences are linked to westerly circulation and glacial-valley winds. This study represents the first application of Sb isotopes to trace atmospheric Sb at a high-altitude site and demonstrates monsoon-regulated transport and a dominant anthropogenic signal from South Asia. These findings provide critical insights into trans-boundary heavy-metal pollution in high-altitude ecosystems and inform strategies for mitigating environmental risks in the Himalayas and comparable regions worldwide."

Aarestrup,Sociodemographic and Health Factors Are Associated with Antimicrobial Resistance across Eight States in the United States,"Recent studies suggest that country-level socioeconomic factors may explain antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns better than antimicrobial usage (AMU), but it remains unclear whether this holds for sociodemographic and health variation within countries. We used metagenomic analysis of untreated sewage to cross-sectionally characterize the bacterial resistome as a proxy for AMR at 44 wastewater treatment plants across eight USA states between 2019 and 2020. We examined associations between AMR with site-specific sociodemographic and health indicators and AMU. Spatial autocorrelation analyses were used to identify clusters of AMR. Gradient-boosted multivariate regression trees were applied to evaluate individual and joint predictor effects on AMR. Outpatient AMU explained negligible variation in AMR, whereas predictors related to economy, income, preventive health care, access to health care, social welfare, housing, and racial/ethnic composition showed the strongest associations. These relationships were observed across individual resistance classes and their combinations and predicted AMR nonlinearly, with thresholds where AMR shows sharp increases (risk factors) or decreases (protective factors). Significant interannual differences in resistome and bacteriome composition were observed between 2019 and 2020. Although causal inference is limited, the findings suggest that local-level indicators of health, economic conditions, well-being, and development may play an important role in shaping AMR within countries."

Worsnop;Honglin Yang;Yongchun Liu,High Aerosol Ionic Strength Possibly Affecting Nocturnal Chlorine Formation via Heterogeneous Reaction in Urban Beijing,"Elevated levels of molecular chlorine (Cl2) have been observed during both daytime and nighttime based on limited short-term field observations. However, the long-term trend and sources of Cl2 remain poorly understood, especially regarding the key factors driving nocturnal Cl2 formation under moderately acidic conditions of aerosol. In this study, over a year of continuous Cl2 measurements in urban Beijing revealed a continuous nocturnal increase (from 19:00 to 05:00) in Cl2 concentration (up to 242 ppt), accompanied by increases in ClNO2 concentration and aerosol pH. The mean heterogeneous uptake coefficient of ClNO2 (γClNO2) decreased from 2.2 × 10–4 to 3.6 × 10–5 when the mean aerosol pH varied from 2.6 to 5.2, while Cl2 concentrations were underestimated if only the variation of aerosol pH was accounted for. Multivariate nonlinear regression revealed that although high aerosol pH hindered the Cl2 formation via heterogeneous uptake of ClNO2, this process is possibly promoted by elevated aerosol ionic strength at high aerosol pH values, jointly driving nocturnal Cl2 variability. This finding suggests that aerosol chemical properties, especially ionic strength, may play an important role in promoting reactive chlorine chemistry in polluted urban atmospheres."

Here, this study constructs a textbook-based, China-centered environmental knowledge data set with hierarchical organization to enable reliable fine-tuning and benchmarking. Results show a consistent trade-off that fine-tuned models achieve modest gains in precision (+1%) and response efficiency (+52%) on standardized tasks but exhibit limited adaptability when embedded in agentic workflows (−3%). In contrast, state-of-the-art generalist models consistently outperform in system-level sustainability and interdisciplinary decision tasks (+10%), benefiting from stronger cross-domain reasoning and dynamic tool integration. Together, these findings support a layered LLMs’ deployment strategy for environmental intelligence. Specifically, selective fine-tuning for stable, regulatory, and verification tasks, combined with agentic workflows anchored in up-to-date generalist backbone models for dynamic, data-intensive, and interdisciplinary decision-making. This work provides both a reusable data set foundation and a practical framework for deploying LLMs as scalable and reliable decision-support tools in environmental decision."

Understanding the occurrence and drivers of DBP formation within DWDSs is essential for evaluating water quality and potential health risks. This study examined DBP occurrence and variability across eight utilities in the United States, three using chlorination and five using chloramination (as secondary/residual disinfectants), by analyzing 152 quarterly samples collected from multiple locations within each distribution system. Regulated DBPs were found at the highest concentrations. Haloacetonitriles (HANs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) contributed most to the predicted toxicity. Spearman correlations, redundancy discriminant analysis, and random forest regression revealed how key influencing predictors of DBPs vary between chlorinated and chloraminated systems. Elevated dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and primary disinfectant type were the two most important contributors to DBP formation, with DOC most influential in chloraminated systems and primary disinfectant type (HOCl vs O3) in chlorinated systems. Variations in DBP concentrations within individual DWDS showed a weak dependence on water age. This study provides a novel data set linking DBP occurrence to water quality parameters and demonstrates how such data can be leveraged to understand DBP dynamics and inform future risk management in water distribution systems."

This study presents an interpretable machine learning framework that integrates ensemble learning and SHAP-based analysis to accurately predict and optimize the energy consumption of plasma–water-based nitrogen fixation (PWNF) systems. A total of 224 experimental observations from 21 discharge configurations were used to train and evaluate eight regression algorithms, including XGBoost, CatBoost, and SVR. The best-performing stacking ensemble, led by XGBoost as a meta-learner, achieved a test set R2 of 0.966 and a RMSE of 10.17 MJ/mol, demonstrating excellent accuracy and generalization. SHAP and partial dependence plot analyses identified key variables─such as power, nitrogen percentage, discharge frequency, and water vapor content─and revealed their nonlinear contributions to energy efficiency. Furthermore, bivariate PDPs uncovered synergistic interactions (e.g., between power and gas composition) that guide multiparameter optimization strategies. Experimental validation confirmed the model’s robustness, with prediction errors of less than 7% for boundary cases. This framework not only advances predictive modeling in plasma engineering but also provides actionable insights into the parametric tuning of nitrogen fixation systems. The approach can be scaled to other plasma-assisted or hybrid electrochemical nitrogen conversion routes."

This cohort study explored the associations between DBP exposure, oxidative stress, and sleep quality assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire among young healthy Chinese men who provided 710 blood and 2647 repeated urinary samples over 3 months. We measured trihalomethanes in blood and haloacetic acids and oxidative stress markers in urine samples. In adjusted models, each 2.7-fold increase in urinary trichloroacetic acid (TCAA) concentrations was associated with a greater PSQI score of 0.29 (95% confidence interval: 0.07, 0.50). A clear dose–response relationship was observed when TCAA concentrations were included as quartile variables (P for trend = 0.01). In the analyses of individual PSQI components, TCAA was associated with a greater risk of difficulty in falling asleep, short sleep duration, and daytime dysfunction (odds ratios = 1.33 (1.04, 1.70), 1.35 (1.03, 1.78), and 1.39 (1.08, 1.78), respectively, per 2.7-fold increase in TCAA concentrations). Mediation analyses showed that 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-mercapturic acid mediated 22.24% (4.44%, 80.00%) of the association between TCAA concentrations and PSQI scores. In summary, TCAA exposure may affect sleep quality, which is partly mediated by oxidative stress."

Here, we detail the extent of ENSO's influence on Australian monthly rainfall distributions and clarify its many complexities. We show La Niña to be a long‐lasting and wide‐spread intensifier of Australian rainfall throughout its lifecycle, particularly on extreme monthly rainfall. The reduction of rainfall during El Niño is comparatively limited; confined mainly to El Niño's developing phase and the southeast and northeast of Australia. A further complexity shows El Niño can intensify monthly rainfall during its mature phase. Within these broader impacts of ENSO are strong spatial and temporal differences, such that the expected rainfall impacts may not be consistently felt at the local‐scale. We propose methods to account for these complex climatic impacts at scales comparable to a river catchment scale."

Middle Miocene proxy records show reversed Arabian Sea zonal gradients (warmer west than east) and reduced Indian Ocean meridional gradients compared to today—patterns coupled models cannot reproduce, hindering accurate SASM simulation. To assess these impacts, we conducted three prescribed‐SST experiments with mid‐Miocene boundary conditions: a control using coupled‐model SSTs and two cases imposing reversed zonal and reduced meridional gradients based on proxy‐derived SSTs. Reversed zonal gradients decreased SASM rainfall; reduced meridional gradients showed minimal impact. Since most mid‐Miocene simulations with modern‐like zonal SST gradients overestimate Indian precipitation, capturing zonal gradients is critical for reducing model–data discrepancies. These zonal gradient shifts from reversed mid‐Miocene toward modern‐like late mid‐Miocene conditions, likely driven by high‐latitude cooling, represent key precursors to the modern SASM. Model biases in simulating warm‐climate polar amplification likely underlie their inability to reproduce Miocene monsoon transitions."

However, current generation climate models often fail to capture TC inner‐core dynamical structures, leading to substantial underestimation (>50%) of TC rainfall (TCR). Here, using a set of eddy‐resolving high‐resolution (HR) simulations from the Community Earth System Model (CESM), we show that simulated TCR closely aligns with observations, primarily due to the improved TC upward motion. Under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 warming scenario, projected TCR increases in non‐eddy‐resolving models reach only 15%–50% of those in HR CESM, likely reflecting their large historical TCR biases. Owing to suppressed TC upward motion, the projected TCR fractional increase by non‐eddy‐resolving models remain comparable to or below the Clausius‐Clapeyron (C‐C) scaling. In contrast, HR CESM projects a much larger TCR increase rate (∼12.0% K−1), exceeding the C‐C rate and driven by a strengthened TC upward motion."

The most prominent response is significant increased sea ice coverage in the northern Amundsen Sea and decreased sea ice coverage in the northern Weddell Sea. The northern Amundsen Sea experiences sea surface and near‐surface atmospheric cooling and a strengthened Amundsen Sea Low, while the northern Weddell Sea exhibits warming and above‐normal sea‐level pressure. In the Amundsen Sea, both oceanic thermodynamic and atmospheric dynamical effects contribute to sea ice growth during the freeze‐up season, with atmospheric dynamics playing a dominant role during the melting season. In contrast, sea ice decline in the Weddell Sea is primarily driven by oceanic warming during the freeze‐up season and atmospheric circulation anomalies during the melting season."

The microphysical mechanisms that govern this process, known as glaciation, are expected to act on minute timescales. Nevertheless, stratiform clouds can persist in the mixed‐phase temperature range (from 0° ${}^{\circ}$C to −38° ${}^{\circ}$C) for hours, thus glaciation events remain poorly characterized. Here, we analyze satellite observations of individual cloud tops to track their temporal phase evolution and to quantify the extent of glaciation. We find that most glaciation events do not result in complete freezing; rather, they induce a sustained shift in cloud properties while the clouds remain in the mixed‐phase regime. Our results indicate that higher hemispheric and seasonal concentrations of ice‐nucleating particles correlate with glaciation occurrence rate. Future studies can utilize our phase‐evolution and glaciation data sets to evaluate how well weather and climate models simulate mixed‐phased cloud evolution and phase heterogeneity."

This study investigated the 2013 extreme hot event (EHE) in central and eastern China using Weather Research and Forecasting model with resolution of 25 and 9 km (WRF25 and WRF9) respectively. Results indicated that the simulations of WRF9 outperformed WRF25 and added‐value was primarily attributed to the influence of diabatic heating, which was modulated by land‐atmosphere feedback. The more arid soil moisture limited evapotranspiration and enhanced sensible heat flux, triggering a stronger positive soil moisture‐atmosphere interaction simulated by WRF9 compared to WRF25. The higher net surface energy budget and lower cloud cover in WRF9 can heat the surface temperature even more and amplify the surface‐atmosphere temperature gradient. Notably, the strength of land‐atmosphere coupling in WRF9 was more pronounced than in WRF25. These findings have implications for the importance of model resolution in capturing the complex processes in EHE."

However, climate model simulations indicate that AEWs are not necessary to maintain annual Atlantic TC frequency. Furthermore, small ensembles suggest that AEWs may impact the spatial distribution and landfall of Atlantic TCs. Here, we investigated the influence of AEWs on the spatial distribution of Atlantic TC tracks and landfall using 50‐member ensembles of TC‐permitting regional model simulations for five hurricane seasons characterized by different levels of TC activity. The control simulations are seasonal hindcasts in which AEWs were prescribed through the eastern lateral boundary condition using reanalysis. In the experiments, we suppressed AEWs by applying a 2–10 day filter to the eastern lateral boundary condition. In response to AEW suppression, we discovered statistically significant increases in Atlantic TC frequency (10%–26%) and landfall (16%–44%), a westward shift in TC genesis location and tracks with increased landfall over the Caribbean Islands, southwestern Gulf Coast, and southeastern US coast, and increases in mid‐tropospheric relative humidity in the main development region. In addition, we evaluated TC genesis mechanisms in the absence of AEWs and found evidence that the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) intensified and extended northward, resulting in ITCZ wave‐breaking that shed vortices which served as TC seeds. By uncovering the connections between TC seed types and the likelihood of TC landfall, this research can provide Atlantic coastal and island communities with useful information to prepare for TC impacts."

However, the δ15N signatures from some important anthropogenic NOx sources, for example, the coke and cement industries, are unknown, and reports on the signatures of δ15N(NOx) from coal‐fired power plants and other fossil fuel combustion related industrial processes are limited. Here, we report a comprehensive investigation of δ15N(NOx) from various emission sources in Taiyuan, a megacity in Northern China where coal dominated the energy consumption before 2018. The different sources were investigated in 2023–2024, and the δ15N(NOx) signatures for coal‐fired and gas‐fired power plants are (20.0 ± 2.3) ‰ and (−19.8 ± 0.8) ‰ (mean ± 1σ), respectively. While for residential gas furnaces, municipal solid waste incineration plants, coke industry, and cement industry, the δ15N(NOx) signatures were measured as (−18.5 ± 0.8) ‰, (11.7 ± 2.4) ‰, (−10.9 ± 1.9) ‰, and (8.1 ± 2.3) ‰, respectively. Among them, the coke and cement industries have not been quantified before. In addition to these emission sources, we further collected ambient NOx and found in Taiyuan the ambient δ15N(NOx) values were significantly lower in winter ((−14.1 ± 4.2) ‰) than those in summer ((−4.2 ± 1.7) ‰). This is because in winter Taiyuan natural gas is the predominant NOx emission source. That the winter δ15N(NOx) was lower than that in summer appears to be opposite to previously reported seasonality of δ15N(NO3−) values in Northern China which was suggested to be caused by seasonal δ15N(NOx) differences, and this is likely because after the implementation of the coal‐to‐gas project and clean air policy in 2018, natural gas combustion became the dominant NOx emission source in winter which is the heating season with extensive demand of fuel consumption."

They are believed to be generated by aircraft passing through supercooled cloud layers; however, the exact formation mechanisms remain poorly understood due to the scarcity of observations. In addition, basic HPC formation characteristics, such as expansion speed, are controversial. Using geostationary meteorological satellite Himawari‐8 data and aircraft flight data of Flightradar24, this study clarifies HPC formation and development from 59 HPCs. Two growth stages of HPCs are identified: first, linear HPCs are formed. The length (Lmajor) and width (Lminor) of one of the long HPCs grew at rates of 43 m s−1 and 3.8 m s−1. This occurs within 10–20 min of an aircraft passing through supercooled clouds and their orientations consistent with tracks of aircraft. The upward expansion speed of the HPC was approximately 1.2 m s−1. Second, these linear HPCs expand slowly and homogeneously for over an hour. The growth rate modes of Lmajor and Lminor of all HPCs were both 1–2 m s−1. All observed HPCs initially appeared as lines, thus supporting that HPCs are generated by aircraft. Sub‐grid‐scale cloud‐free areas or extremely thin supercooled cloud layers where aircraft passed would not generate HPCs. This is because not all aircraft that passed supercooled clouds generated HPCs."

Simulated mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are separated into slow and rapid growth by the rate of spatial growth from convection initiation until reaching the MCS scale. A low‐level jet (LLJ) is found more frequently near the deep convection that experiences rapid growth to an MCS, but its presence alone is not predictive of rapid growth. Using spatially‐averaged parameters, we find that rapid growth to MCSs also occurs in environments that are significantly more thermodynamically favorable with greater low‐level moisture and instability. Fewer significant differences are found in the kinematic environment with only the 0–2 km vertical wind shear magnitude being significantly larger for rapid growth MCSs compared to slow growth MCSs, potentially related to LLJs often peaking near this height. When focusing only on MCSs with the slowest and fastest growth rates, elevated‐layer shear is significantly smaller for very rapid growth MCSs, suggesting elevated‐layer shear may help discriminate between the upper and lower bounds of growth rate. Finally, when upscale growth occurs near the Sierras de Córdoba (SDC) with a LLJ present, rapid growth is also supported by favorable wind shear orientation. However, this does not hold for upscale growth occurring away from the SDC, highlighting the importance of interpreting shear direction relative to the orientation of features initiating deep convection."

However, existing studies have neither unraveled the influence of orbital dynamics on such radiation nor quantified how clouds modify these periodic signatures at the planetary scale, which leaves the underlying mechanisms driving disk‐integrated radiation variations obscure and makes it difficult to isolate the authentic signals of the planetary system. In this study, outputs from NASA's Goddard Earth Observing System Version 5 (GEOS‐5) model were mapped onto the Moon‐based Earth observation geometry to simulate time‐series data of disk‐integrated radiation. The variability characteristics of this radiation were quantified via spherical harmonic decomposition, and the constructed spherical harmonic fingerprints effectively separate orbital dynamics and radiation signatures in disk‐integrated observations. Results show that (a) Moon‐based disk‐integrated radiation variations are dominated by 1st‐ and 2nd‐degree spherical harmonics, capturing large‐scale radiative features while smoothing fine‐scale fluctuations; (b) key cycles driven by Earth‐Moon geometry include the synodic month, the sidereal month, and their semiperiodic counterparts, which are primarily governed by sectoral and zonal harmonic components, respectively; (c) clouds systematically reduce disk‐integrated radiation but preserve orbital‐driven periodicities, which averages out local cloud effects while retaining celestial motion signals. This study further discussed the potential of these observations to refine general circulation models (GCMs) via planetary‐scale reality checks, as well as of bridging Earth system science and astrophysics by using Earth as a sample. In general, this study lays a foundation for interpreting disk‐integrated radiation features in future missions."

This is a research approach currently absent from the literature, yet essential for developing transferable Disaster Risk Management (DRM) lessons. Given the increased frequency of hydrometeorological hazards under climate change, the importance of such lessons cannot be overstated. Focusing on the devastating 2021 floods in Europe, this study investigates (1) how did the interplay of impacts, vulnerabilities, and adaptation options produce divergent disaster outcomes in two contrasting European contexts, and (2) what transferable lessons for DRM can be elicited. The selected case studies focus on the areas hardest impacted by the 2021 flood events in Romania (Alba County) and the Netherlands (Limburg Province). The three‐tiered analysis performed at the level of impacts, vulnerabilities, and adaptation options shows that response in the two countries was well‐directed, while vulnerability mitigation remains a critical problem, differing between the two case studies. Another highlight is that development in flood‐prone areas and flood protection standards below (flood) hazard return periods ranked as the most influential vulnerabilities in both case studies. This research provides a new methodology for comparative disaster analysis, offering critical insights for scientists and practitioners in the face of increasingly frequent and impactful hydrometeorological hazards."

 The air-sea interface is a major climate control for our planet. At high winds this boundary layer becomes turbulent and challenging to parameterize. Sea spray is only now emerging as an important but unaccounted for parameter in air-sea models. Here we apply state-of-the-art air-sea surface sea spray generation models coupled to a carbonate system model to predict the spray-driven flux of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas between the atmosphere and ocean at various wind speeds and sea states. When these droplets are injected into air, they experience gas exchange affected by both temperature equilibration and evaporation. The latter process leads to a super-saline and acidic droplet that removes dissolved inorganic carbonate and bicarbonate, chemically converting them to additional CO2 and thereby evading more CO2 than is predicted by traditional models that do not consider this process. At 40% evaporation, the droplet evicts all its dissolved inorganic carbon, which is a 100-fold increase in potential CO2 evasion. Evaporating sea spray acts as a significant feedback to ocean CO2 uptake and could serve important roles in episodic storm events and over longer planetary timescales."

 Although the early tectonic regime of the Earth remains debated, it is generally accepted that the geodynamic system underwent a notable transition during the Neoarchean–Paleoproterozoic. Here, we establish the metamorphic database for the North China Craton, comprising 446 valid data (83 Neoarchean and 363 Paleoproterozoic), which are categorized into high, intermediate, and low types based on the thermobaric ratio (T/P). This framework is used to investigate the thermal history, tectonic evolution, and the initiation of plate tectonics during this period. The results show that the North China Craton is dominated by high and intermediate T/P metamorphism, with only limited low T/P metamorphic records appearing in the late Paleoproterozoic. The Neoarchean–Paleoproterozoic thermal evolution of the North China Craton is overall consistent with the global thermal evolution trend, suggesting a transition from ancient-style plate tectonics to modern-style plate tectonics. The Paleoproterozoic metamorphic T/P curve exhibits relatively lower thermobaric ratios at 2.0–1.95 Ga (~1.97 Ga) and ~1.80 Ga, corresponding to two orogenic events: the collision and amalgamation of internal blocks within the North China Craton, and its final incorporation into the Columbia supercontinent. Furthermore, this study links the evolution of plate tectonics with Earth’s solid–surface systems, providing new insights into material circulation processes.  Ancient-style plate tectonics with warm subduction may have already existed in the Neoarchean, whereas modern-style plate tectonics featuring cold subduction appeared in the late Paleoproterozoic, according to metamorphic thermobaric ratio analysis of the North China Craton."

 River deltas support human settlements, sustain ecosystems, and form hydrocarbon reservoirs in ancient sedimentary basins. Their morphologies are shaped by a complex interplay of environmental factors, posing challenges for predicting their evolution. Here we show that characteristics of delta shoreline and distributary channels are antagonistically influenced by rivers and waves. We analyzed morphologies of 1344 global deltas using a convolutional autoencoder, an unsupervised machine learning model, to encode their characteristics into 70-dimensional feature vectors serving as quantitative morphological metrics. The X-means clustering of these metrics revealed eight distinct delta morphotypes, adding a complementary perspective on their conventional classification schemes. We then performed multiple regression analyses to predict the relative sediment fluxes from rivers, tides, and waves from the morphological metrics. The results exhibited that shoreline protuberance and well-developed distributary channels are promoted by stronger fluvial influences and inhibited by stronger wave influences. In contrast, tidal influences were less clearly associated with these morphological features. This data-driven framework contributes to a better understanding of how specific delta morphologies respond to both natural variability and anthropogenic disturbances, offering additional avenues for sustainable management and future research. Shoreline protuberance and well-developed distributary channels are enhanced by stronger fluvial influences and diminished by stronger wave influences, whereas tidal influences show a less clear relationship with these morphological features, according to machine learning analysis."

 The bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) is a fundamental variable in urban surface energy balance and is crucial for applications requiring surface anisotropy information, such as aerosol monitoring, land cover classification, and so on. However, challenges remain in obtaining accurate BRDF information over urban areas using remotely sensed data. While some existing kernel-driven models provide timely and efficient BRDF retrieval and have been widely used in deriving global products, they were primarily designed for vegetation-covered surfaces with reduced accuracy over urban surfaces. To address these limitations, this study developed the Urban Analytical Kernel-driven Model (UAKM), which incorporates urban structures to better capture illumination and shadow patterns. Comparative experiments were conducted using simulated data from the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model and Landsat surface reflectance to evaluate UAKM's performance compared with RossThick-LiSparse Reciprocal (RTLSR) and RossThick–Roujean (RTROU) models. In DART-based experiments with dense angular sampling, UAKM achieved the lowest RMSEs (<0.008) and uniquely captured two key urban-specific BRDF characteristics: (1) a reduced growth rate in BRDF at the hotspot along the principal plane rather than a peak; and (2) a BRDF minimum displaced approximately 45° in azimuth from the forward-scattering principal plane. In satellite-based retrievals, UAKM also yielded the lowest RMSEs—below 0.016 in visible bands and below 0.026 in the near-infrared band—while exhibiting stronger robustness to uncertainties in solar viewing geometry. Overall, UAKM contributes to advancing BRDF modeling by integrating urban structural features, providing an efficient, accurate, and robust tool for urban monitoring with satellite data."

The event was caused by an object with0.219−0.046+0.075Jupiter masses that is either gravitationally unbound or on a very wide orbit. Through comparison with the statistical properties of other observed microlensing events and predictions from simulations, we infer that this object likely formed in a protoplanetary disk (like a planet), not in isolation (like a brown dwarf).

Polymorphism can be maintained by social selection if competitive interactions allow each morph to increase in frequency when rare. This reliance on negative frequency–dependent selection should make color polymorphism vulnerable to the appearance of novel phenotypes that disrupt competitive interactions among morphs. We show that the origin and adaptive spread of a sexually selected syndrome in common wall lizards (Podarcis muralis) selectively eliminates alleles coding for alternative color morphs that have been maintained for millions of years. The results demonstrate how the arrival of a novel phenotype can disrupt balancing selection, providing a link between rapid phenotypic evolution and the loss of color polymorphisms."

Phonon-driven changes in carrier localization modulated local field effects (LFEs), yielding carrier-, site-, and orbital-specific absorption signatures. LFEs served as sensitive fingerprints of electron-phonon coupling strength across the phonon spectrum and revealed a breakdown of the Born–Oppenheimer approximation: Electrons lagged lattice oscillations by 32 ± 8 femtoseconds, whereas holes responded almost instantaneously (7 ± 7 femtoseconds).

Here, we identified a noncoding regulatory variant, rs17834140-T, that protects against CH and myeloid malignancies by selectively down-regulating the RNA-binding protein MSI2 in HSCs. By modeling variant effects and mapping MSI2 binding targets, we uncovered an RNA network that maintains human HSCs and influences CH risk. Variant rs17834140-T was associated with slower CH expansion, and stem cell MSI2 levels modifiedASXL1-mutant HSC clonal dominance. These findings leverage natural resilience to illuminate posttranscriptional regulation in human HSCs, suggesting that inhibition of MSI2 or its targets could be rational strategies for blood cancer prevention."

To investigate the timing and trajectory of these introductions, we conducted both genomic analyses of 576 pig nuclear genomes and a geometric morphometric analysis of 708 modern and ancient dental remains. Our analyses demonstrate that free-living and domestic pigs in Wallacea and Oceania have diverse ancestries resulting from the introduction of multiple sequential pig populations followed by gene flow. Despite the variability in their genomic ancestry, these pigs all have a distinct tooth morphology as well as a genetic link to the Chinese domestic pig populations that accompanied the dispersal of Austronesian language speakers ~4000 to 3000 years ago via Taiwan and the Philippines."

In cereals, shortening dormancy provides rapid and even postharvest germination, but increases the risk of weather-induced preharvest sprouting, with yearly harvest losses beyond 1 billion dollars. Our understanding of how, why, when, and where cereal dormancy diversification arose is fragmentary. Here, we show in the founder crop barley (Hordeum vulgare) that dormancy is primarily regulated through a mosaic of locus haplotypes comprising copy number variation and inherent kinase activity ofMitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3(MKK3). We provide evidence supporting the historical selection of specificMKK3haplotypes that shaped dormancy levels according to changing climatic pressures and outline a genetic framework for breeders to balance grain dormancy and preharvest sprouting avoidance."

We identified the genetic basis of this polymorphism, which was previously posited to arise from three alleles at one locus. Orange usurper and blue mate-guarder morphs are associated with two divergent haplotypes in the regulatory region of the sepiapterin reductase gene, but yellow sneaker morphs appear to arise through phenotypic plasticity from the same genetic background as blue morphs. Our simulations show that rock-paper-scissors dynamics can better maintain a polymorphism with a genetic system of two alleles plus plasticity than with a three-allele system. This form of balancing selection that combines genetic determination with phenotypic plasticity expands the possibilities for how stable polymorphisms arise in nature."

However, the challenging reduction of benchmark iron salts to active species hinders their application in reductive transformations. In this work, we report a photochemical strategy that exploits the innate reactivity of ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) excited states of iron oxalate complexes to harness oxalate salts as latent terminal two-electron reductants in iron catalysis. The investigation of this activation mode has led to the development of a versatile catalytic platform enabling transformations hitherto inaccessible to previous iron catalyst systems. The synthetic value of this tactic is demonstrated on diverse reductive transformations using readily available building blocks with high chemoselectivity, opening new synthetic opportunities."

We designed protein homotrimers regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved drug amantadine and further designed amantadine-responsive heterodimers and heterotrimers. Biophysical characterization confirmed their amantadine-dependent assembly, and their crystal structures closely matched the design models. We demonstrated their broad applicability in controlling protein localization, membraneless condensate formation, and gene expression. Our approach opens new avenues for designing small molecule–responsive proteins and expands the chemogenetic toolkit for manipulating complex biological processes."

Auxin and ethylene regulate femaleness in cucurbits. In this work, we identified anauxin response factor 3(CsARF3) that plays an essential role in carpel development in cucumber. Deletion ofCsARF3resulted in an androecious phenotype with only male flowers, whereas overexpression ofCsARF3led to an increased number of female flowers. CsARF3 promotes femaleness by directly stimulating the expression of the meristem maintenance geneCsSTMand repressing the activity of the gynoecious geneCsWIP1. Auxin and ethylene exhibit a reciprocal relationship during sex determination, in which ethylene promotes carpel formation through auxin at the early stage of flower development.

In a single experiment, SPARK-seq simultaneously mapped 5535 distinct aptamers to eight surface proteins, capturing interactions across more than two orders of magnitude in protein abundance and spanning diverse biophysical classes. The method discriminated closely related paralogous proteins with no detectable cross-reactivity and provided kinetic information that enabled the prioritization of aptamers with slow dissociation rates. Leveraging this kinetic diversity, we engineered variants with improved off-rate properties. SPARK-seq establishes a platform for high-efficiency discovery and rational variant design of aptamers and functional nucleic acids, unlocking possibilities in diagnostics and therapeutics."

For ligand-gated ion channels, agonist binding triggers rapid transitions through intermediate states leading to a transient open-pore conformation, with these transitions shaping the postsynaptic response. In this work, we determine structures of the muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in unliganded, mono-liganded, and di-liganded states. Agonist binding to a single site stabilizes a closed structure where an entire principal agonist-binding subunit transitions to an active-like conformation, whereas the other unoccupied principal subunit remains inactive, albeit poised for activation. Uniting this intermediate structure with single-channel recordings informs a sequential activation mechanism where asynchronous subunit transitions prime the receptor for activation—a finding with implications for an entire superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels."

The superconducting tunneling spectra display a linear gap-filling behavior with temperature and magnetic field and exhibit the Volovik effect, consistent with a nodal order parameter.

Furthermore, comparisons of the founders between tissues can reveal the patterns of pathogen dissemination. On longer timescales, the emergence of dominant barcoded lineages can also be used to detect within-host evolution. Collectively, barcoding studies quantify the hidden parameters that underlie bacterial colonization and create a quantitative framework for modeling and preventing infectious disease."

However, the analysis of shape dynamics during directional decision-making has been restricted to single junctions. Here, we combined live-cell imaging and a coarse-grained model to study the migratory behavior of highly branched cells while simultaneously facing several junctions. The theoretical model predicts that the choice of a new direction is determined by the competition between the cellular protrusions in the form of seesaw oscillations. We found that macrophages and endothelial cells display different regimes moving on hexagonal networks, despite sharing a mesenchymal (i.e., adhesion-dependent) migratory strategy. The model describes the motility of both cell types and reveals a trade-off between branching and speed: Having many protrusions allows local microenvironmental exploration for directional cues, but long-range migration efficiency improves with fewer protrusions. Collectively, our data highlight the relevance and provide insights for the regulation of shape dynamics during cell navigation in complex geometries."

Here, we studied how this approach’s induction of trained immunity systemically overcomes the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. We found changes in the tumor microenvironment to mirror functional changes in the hematopoietic system in a melanoma mouse model. Single cell sequencing methods disclosed a shift in the tumor-associated macrophage population from immunosuppressive to antitumorigenic. Uniquely, a trained immunity and checkpoint blockade combination therapy mobilized natural killer cells which, in conjunction with the functional changes in the myeloid cell compartment, effectively activated T cells. Last, we established the effectiveness of our approach in mouse models of breast, lung, and pancreatic cancer. Collectively, our data show that the systemic induction of trained immunity rebalances the immune system for effective checkpoint blockade therapy."

Through soft, flexible structures and accurate navigation, previously inaccessible anatomical regions can be safely reached. Dependent on both actuation mode and clinical application, however, rigidity and miniaturization potential can still present substantial challenges. Magnetic soft continuum robots (mSCRs) offer promising solutions to these key questions. Furthermore, micrometer- to millimeter-scale untethered magnetic robots (mUMRs) offer unparalleled miniaturization potential enabling targeted therapeutic delivery. Leveraging the benefits of magnetic actuation, this study introduces a bespoke, continuously magnetized catheter that synergizes the navigational strengths of mSCRs with the functional effectiveness of mUMRs to precisely deliver drug-doped payloads to otherwise unreachable regions deep within the anatomy. In particular, this system uses a magnetic latching mechanism, ensuring precise drug delivery and efficient retrieval, demonstrated in an ex vivo porcine kidney model for organ transplantation–related immunosuppressant delivery."

A lineage trajectory analysis of the glia-to-neuron conversion reveals a distinct lineage pathway to PV chandelier fate, including various neuronal developmental stages and the establishment of synaptic machinery. This analysis reveals PV fate-important genes that are previously unknown to neural reprogramming with promising functional importance for future derivations.

While recent studies have pinpointed the source and timing of this meltwater pulse, it remains controversial whether this freshwater event alone could have caused a millennial-scale cold period. Biomarker reconstructions from the Labrador Sea/Baffin Bay reveal an abrupt sea ice decline during the mid-YD, parallel with partial AMOC recovery and enhanced Irminger Current inflow. This warm water incursion may have initiated Heinrich Event 0, likely causing surface freshening in subpolar North Atlantic and subsequently triggering a second AMOC decline during the late YD. Model simulations further support a two-phase AMOC weakening associated with surface freshening during the YD. Our biphasic freshwater injection hypothesis provides fresh insights into the mechanisms driving the YD and underscores the critical role of surface freshening in the subpolar North Atlantic in shaping deglacial abrupt climate changes."

However, the circuit mechanism underlying the heterogeneous normalization strength is unclear. In this work, we study normalization in a spiking neuron network model of visual cortex. Our model reveals that the heterogeneity of normalization strength is highly correlated with the inhibitory current each neuron receives. The correlation between inhibition and other synaptic inputs explains the experimentally observed dependence of spike count correlations on normalization strength. Further, we find that neurons with stronger normalization encode information more efficiently, and that networks with more heterogeneity in normalization encode visual stimuli with higher information and capacity. Together, our model provides a mechanistic explanation of heterogeneous normalization strengths in the visual cortex and sheds light on the computational benefits of neuronal heterogeneity."

Introducing live or heat-killedL. johnsoniiinto the lungs of HCT mice significantly reduced gammaherpesvirus-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis. This protective effect was mediated in part by the up-regulation of PD-L1 on dendritic cells, which in turn dampened the production of the inflammatory cytokine IL-17A by T helper 17 cells post-HCT.L. johnsoniialso reducedTgfb1expression in lung macrophages. These anti-fibrotic effects of heat-killedL. johnsoniiwere absent in PD-1–deficient mice, highlighting the role of PD-L1/PD-1 signaling. Further analysis showed that dendritic cells uniquely recognizedL. johnsoniiand increased PD-L1 expression via TLR1/2- and TLR9-MyD88 pathways.

Ibarra;Stephen Nelson;Alexander Farnsworth;Paul Valdes;Aradhna Tripati,Quantifying the impacts of rainfall and evaporation on Lake Bonneville,"Improved understanding of hydroclimatic drivers in water-stressed regions enables more accurate forecasting of future climate change impacts. Lake Bonneville was the largest Pleistocene lake in western North America, with a maximum surface area of ~52,000 km2, before shrinking markedly to become the modern Great Salt Lake. After more than a century of study, the balance between enhanced precipitation and reduced evaporation as drivers of lake growth continues to be debated. Multiple studies identify precipitation as the main factor associated with the highest lake levels, but most proxies provide an estimate of net evaporation and cannot independently resolve precipitation from evaporation. Therefore, factors associated with lake size, growth, and retreat remain uncertain. This study uses the thermodynamically based carbonate clumped isotope geothermometer to estimate temperature, evaporation, and precipitation at Lake Bonneville from 23 to 16 thousand years ago (ka). Clumped isotope derived constraints on hydroclimate are also applied to assess the accuracy of regional climate model outputs. During transgressive and open phases of the lake, we find that regional and large-scale precipitation delivery were the driving factors of lake expansion. In contrast, at its maximum extent (~17.5 ka), Lake Bonneville was maintained via suppressed evaporation rates at 50% relative to modern while precipitation rates were similar to modern levels."

Mislocalization of TFs contributes to cancers, making TF relocalization a promising anticancer therapeutic strategy. We engineered anchoring aptamers as a platform for relocalizing TFs. Anchoring aptamers are heterobifunctional nucleic acids consisting of two ligands joined by a linker: one targeting the plasma membrane–anchored protein and the other recruiting the TF. As a proof of concept, we used the Ra1 aptamer targeting Ras and the DNA ligand specific for p65 or E2F1 to construct anchoring aptamers. Simultaneous binding of the anchoring aptamers to Ras and either p65 or E2F1 effectively induces cytoplasmic relocalization and functional inactivation of p65 or E2F1. Using a lentiviral expression system of anchoring aptamers, we achieved sustained cytoplasmic retention of p65 and marked inhibition of tumor growth. This work establishes a universal platform for TF relocalization, offering promising opportunities for innovative anticancer therapeutic strategies."

Retinal pigmentation protects against light-induced damage, yet its genetic and evolutionary bases remain unclear. We developed a deep learning framework (DeepGRP) to quantify retinal pigmentation from high-resolution fundus images and conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS), identifying 42 signals, including 26 previously unidentified loci, with single-nucleotide polymorphism–based heritability of 21.4%. Single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin by sequencing and RNA sequencing of human fetal retinal tissues revealed key cellular contributors, including retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor cells. Among candidate genes,ARHGAP18emerged as a previously unrecognized regulator of melanogenesis. Evidence of polygenic adaptation in Europeans suggests selection driven by snow-reflected light at high latitudes. A polygenic risk score for retinal pigmentation correlated with a 4.8-fold higher risk of myopia and a 1.5-fold lower risk of skin cancer. These findings demonstrate the power of deep learning for large-scale ocular phenotyping and reveal insights into the genetic and evolutionary architecture of retinal pigmentation."

This coassembled protein gel sequentially activated integrin β3–mediated mechanotransduction, promoted cytoskeletal remodeling and Yes-associated protein nuclear translocation, and subsequently up-regulated bioactive factors and ECM synthesis to orchestrate stem cell development. Incorporation of kartogenin provided sustained chondrogenic cues, thereby promoting stem cell differentiation and preserving NP tissue integrity in vivo. Together, these findings establish a phase separation–driven, adaptive protein matrix that orchestrates both mechanical and biochemical signaling for robust intervertebral disc regeneration."

These cells play a complex role during tumor progression; they can inhibit or promote tumor growth depending on disease stage. We developed a mouse model that allows monitoring and selective elimination of cells expressing high levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16 and interleukin-6. These mice, termed SuSe (suicidal senescence), were crossed with the mouse mammary tumor virus–polyomavirus middle T antigen (MMTV-PyMT) model of breast cancer. Functional characterization in SuSe/PyMT mice confirmed that depletion of senescent cells (senolysis) in early and late lesions accelerated and decelerated tumor growth and metastasis, respectively. Tumor acceleration was attributed to expansion of immunosuppressive, protumorigenic macrophages. C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 was identified as an autocrine chemokine essential for their recruitment and maintenance. Depletion of these macrophages reversed the effects of senescent cell clearance, rendering senolysis antitumorigenic even at early stages. Our results suggest that targeting immunosuppressive macrophages can preserve the benefits of senolysis while mitigating adverse effects."

Heterogeneity in red blood cell (RBC) properties within and across individuals has hindered our ability to establish the multiscale mechanisms driving pathological flow dynamics in such diseases. To address this, we develop microfluidic platforms to measure RBC properties and flow dynamics in the same blood samples from patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). We find that effective blood viscosity across individuals is explained by the proportion of stiff RBCs, exhibiting qualitative similarities to rigid-particle suspensions, despite considerable mechanical heterogeneity. By combining simulations with spatially resolved measurements of cell dynamics, we show how features of emergent rheology are governed by spatiotemporal cell organization, via margination at intermediate oxygen tensions, and localized jamming caused by spatial hematocrit variations under hypoxia. Our work defines the suspension physics underlying pathological blood flow in SCD and, more broadly, emergent rheology in heterogeneous particle suspensions."

Myeloid cells (MCs) such as macrophages contribute to resistance. Established clinical evidence links cholesterol to cancer outcomes, with MC function being regulated by cholesterol metabolism. We screened MC-expressed regulators of cholesterol homeostasis linked to survival and identified the cholesterol efflux protein ABCA1. ABCA1 activity increases anticancer functions of macrophages: enhancing tumor infiltration, decreasing angiogenic potential, reducing efferocytosis, and improving support of CD8+ T cell activity. Mechanistically, different AKT isoforms are involved, through both PI3K-dependent and PI3K-independent mechanisms. Highlighting the clinical relevance of our findings are correlations between ABCA1 in macrophages and angiogenic potential,VEGFA, and CD8 T cell abundance and activity. The culmination of these activities was demonstrated through increased tumor growth and metastasis in mice lacking MC-expressed ABCA1. Tumors grown in these mice were also more resistant to immune therapy. Therefore, modulating ABCA1 activity within MCs may represent a previously unidentified approach to immune therapy."

To establish contact, cells generate pushing forces through branched actin polymerization mediated by the actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex, followed by the reinforcement of mechanosensitive AJs in response to actomyosin contractility. To investigate how AJ proteins coordinate these events, we combined kinetic assays of actin polymerization, single actin filament observation in total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, and in vitro reconstitution of AJ mechanosensitivity. Our findings show that actomyosin contractility alone is sufficient to trigger the hierarchical assembly of the AJ mechanosensitive proteins α-catenin, vinculin, and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). Once assembled, these proteins act synergistically to promote actin filament nucleation, elongation, and bundling. The α-catenin-vinculin-VASP machinery inhibits Arp2/3-mediated actin branching and instead promotes the myosin-dependent assembly of actin bundles. Together, these results reveal how AJs integrate actin assembly, actomyosin contractility, and mechanosensitivity in a feedback loop."

High EMT gradients characterize functional MSC subsets that functions as niche supporting hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), while attenuation of the EMT program impairs HSC support and reproduced in degenerative hematological disorders. Notably, enhancing the EMT program in MSCs (aEMT-MSCs) markedly augments their capacity to promote HSC regeneration and restores defective niches in patients with aplastic anemia. Furthermore, the regenerative effects of aEMT-MSCs extend beyond hematopoiesis to neuronal and cardiovascular tissues, suggesting a conserved niche-supporting program across multiple tissue systems. These findings establish the EMT program as a central regulator of the mesenchymal niche and propose a strategy to address unmet needs in regenerative medicine."

By analyzing photo-Hall conductivity versus electrical conductivity under varying light intensities and temperatures, we uncover an astonishingly simple hyperbola relationship that reveals detailed charge transport and trap occupation and applied it in silicon and halide perovskite films. This technique substantially expands Hall effect–based measurements by integrating electric, magnetic, photon, and phonon excitations into a single framework and enables unparalleled extraction of charge carrier and trap properties, offering a powerful tool for semiconductor characterization and device optimization."

Here, we show that the previously uncharacterized LATE-FLOWERING RRM-CONTAINING PROTEIN (LRP) prevents 5′-3′ chromatin looping of the key floral repressor geneFLOWERING LOCUS C(FLC) via direct association with its 5′ and 3′ genomic regions. Loss ofLRPfunction leads to increased 5′-3′ gene looping, reduced RNA polymerase II (Pol II) occupancy at theFLClocus, thereby increasingFLCtranscription and delaying flowering inArabidopsis thaliana. Furthermore, site-specific phosphorylation of LRP at serine 17, mediated by the kinase PRP4KA, is essential for LRP protein stability and its function in preventingFLCchromatin looping and Pol II recruitment. Our findings reveal that site-specific phosphorylation of LRP by PRP4KA precludesFLCgene loop formation, constituting a key mechanism forFLCtranscriptional repression to ensure timely flowering."

Present work proposes and verifies a strategy of multidentate carbodithioate-lead chelation (MCLC), which is able to form a robust one-dimensional structure at the GBs, not only reducing interfacial defects and residual stress but also enhancing interfacial carrier transport in perovskite while substantially improving the photothermal and operational stabilities of PSCs. It was further demonstrated that bifacial modification at both top and buried interfaces of perovskite using MCLC strategy achieved PSCs with a high power conversion efficiency up to 26.15% (certified value of 25.75%) and 24.89% for 1-cm2-area device.

However, there is often an empirical upper limit of electron density in tokamak operation, namely, the Greenwald density limitnG, above which tokamaks generally disrupt. Achieving high-density operation above the density limit has been a long-standing challenge in magnetic confinement fusion research. Here, we report experimental results on the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) achieving line-averaged electron density in the range of (1.3 to 1.65)nG, significantly above the typical EAST operational range of (0.8 to 1.0)nG. This is performed with electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH)–assisted ohmic start-up and sufficiently high initial neutral density. These experiments are shown to operate in the density-free regime first predicted by a recent plasma-wall self-organization theory. These results suggest a promising scheme for substantially increasing the density limit in tokamaks, a critical advancement toward achieving burning plasma."

In acoustofluidics, standing-wave tweezers were widely adopted for particle trapping and translation due to their facile implementation and on-chip integrability. However, those conventional standing-wave fields, typically generated by transducer pairs, exhibit limited manipulation flexibility owing to their simplistic field configurations. Here, we demonstrate topological mass transport along arbitrarily designed trajectories by constructing localized and tunable standing-wave fields based on valley interface states. Precise phase modulation of incident waves enables efficient particle conveyance through continuous displacement of standing-wave pressure nodes or antinodes, leveraging the radiation forces from topologically protected standing waves in scattering systems. Experimental results confirm that such topological tweezing and circulating effect enables robust mass transport, showing antibackscattering characteristics and immunity against various structural defects such as sharp corners or cavities. Our work establishes a foundational paradigm for investigating the radiation forces in topological acoustic fields and advances the development of acoustofluidics technologies."

Upon LPS binding through their amino-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs), these inflammatory caspases oligomerize and activate. However, how LPS binding drives caspase-4/11 activation remains unclear. Here, we show that caspase-4/11 CARDs are intrinsically unstructured in their resting state and adopt an α-helical conformation upon LPS engagement. This structural rearrangement promotes CARD oligomerization, with electron-capture charge reduction–coupled native mass spectrometry and other techniques illustrating that hexa-acylated LPS induces the formation of large oligomers composed of eight or more protomers, whereas underacylated lipids trigger smaller assemblies. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and cross-linking mass spectrometry, we identified a hydrophobic cleft critical for LPS binding and potential intersubunit interfaces that facilitate oligomerization. These findings uncover key structural features underlying LPS recognition and activation of the noncanonical inflammasome, providing mechanistic insight into an essential arm of the innate immune response."

We demonstrate that the critical properties can be accurately determined from the system’s short-time relaxation, a regime where the sign problem remains manageable for quantum Monte Carlo simulations. After validating this approach on two benchmark fermionic models, we apply it to the sign-problematic Hubbard model hosting SU(3)-symmetric Dirac fermions. We present the first numerically exact characterization of its quantum phase diagram, revealing a continuous transition between a Dirac semimetal and a SU(3)-antiferromagnetic phase. This transition defines an unconventional Gross-Neveu universality class that fundamentally reshapes current understanding of Gross-Neveu criticality.

After being asked their position on immigration policy, they used the same data to answer the same empirical question: Does immigration affect public support for social welfare programs? The researchers estimated 1253 alternative regression models, and the estimated impacts ranged from strongly negative to strongly positive. We find that teams composed of pro-immigration researchers estimated more positive impacts of immigration on public support for social programs, while anti-immigration teams estimated more negative impacts. The differences arise because different teams adopted different model specifications.

Here, we report that compared to healthy controls, patients with T1D and their first-degree relatives (FDRs) exhibited significantly increased serum Galectin-3 levels primarily produced and secreted by monocytes/macrophages. Pharmacological inhibition (TD139) as well as knockout of Galectin-3 gene both attenuated Galectin-3–mediated suppression of regulatory T cells (Tregcells) and protected from insulitis and diabetes onset in NOD mice.

This architecture simultaneously enhances the elastic rebound stiffness of the composite and suppresses interfacial slippage, leading to a notable reduction in system-level hysteresis. A strain rate–dependent evaluation framework is proposed to systematically quantify dynamic hysteresis variability.

We demonstrate that the autoencoder can largely capture nonlinear physical relationships, enabling LDA to produce balanced analyses without explicitly modeling physical constraints. Assimilation in latent space also improves both analysis quality and forecast skill compared to traditional model-space DA, under both idealized and real observational settings. Furthermore, LDA exhibits strong robustness across latent dimensions and remains effective even when the autoencoder is trained on inaccurate but physically realistic forecasts, highlighting its flexibility for real-world applications."

Among various physiological stimuli, nutrient starvation is the most potent inducer of autophagy. In response to starvation, transcription factor EB (TFEB) is activated and up-regulates a broad set of autophagy-related genes. However, the mechanisms by which TFEB promotes autophagosome biogenesis remain incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that TFEB-mediated transcriptional induction ofsequestosome 1(SQSTM1; p62) triggers the formation of SQSTM1-positive bodies that recruit essential autophagy factors, thereby initiating autophagosome biogenesis. Genetic disruption of TFEB-dependent SQSTM1 regulation markedly impairs starvation-induced autophagy, underscoring the critical role of the TFEB-SQSTM1 axis in the autophagic response to nutrient stress. Furthermore, we show that these SQSTM1 bodies contain ubiquitinated ribosomal proteins and that TFEB promotes ribosomal protein ubiquitination by inducing the E3 ubiquitin ligase ZNF598. Collectively, our findings uncover a transcriptionally coordinated mechanism that regulates both autophagosome biogenesis and substrate ubiquitination, facilitating efficient cargo clearance during starvation-induced autophagy."

HLA-Shuttle restores antigen presentation in immunologically cold neuroblastoma cells, enabling identification of multiple tumor-associated antigens with therapeutic potential.

Caspase-2, a proapoptotic protease, restricts polyploidization by deleting polyploid and aneuploid cells. While caspase-2 protects against diet-induced hepatic injury, it also acts as a tumor suppressor by controlling genomic instability and oxidative stress. To investigate these roles, we assessed hepatic ploidy dynamics, liver damage, and age-associated tumorigenesis in caspase-2–deficient and catalytically inactive mutant mice. We found that caspase-2 loss promotes early-onset hepatocyte hyperpolyploidy, accompanied by progressive liver inflammation, fibrosis, oxidative liver damage, ferroptosis, and higher incidence of spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma in aged animals. Proteomic profiling revealed a pathogenic polyploidy–associated signature associated with caspase-2 deficiency and increased predisposition to liver disease and malignancy. These findings establish caspase-2 enzymatic activity as a critical regulator of hepatic genome stability and preventing age-related liver cancer that strongly argue against therapeutic caspase-2 inhibition as a strategy for managing liver injury or cancer risk."

Transcriptomic analysis of patients with AU revealed a highly oxidative stress profile as well as an up-regulatedapolipoprotein E(APOE) expression in their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In addition, single-cell RNA sequencing of retinal microglia also identified an up-regulated expression ofAPOEin a murine model of experimental AU (EAU). Our results and others previously suggested that microglia are tightly associated with the development of AU. Meanwhile, althoughAPOEhas been reported to play a myriad of functions ranging from lipid metabolism to neural regeneration, little is known about its detailed mechanism in the development of AU. In this study, a murine EAU model was used to investigate the association betweenAPOE, microglia, and EAU, and it is found thatAPOEis indispensable for EAU induction asAPOE−/−mice failed to develop EAU. In vitro studies using microglial cells further demonstrated thatAPOEis positively corelated with microglial inflammation, which could be reversed by knocking downAPOEusing short hairpin RNA. Proteomic analysis indicated thatAPOE-mediated microglial activation relies on reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathway, throughpeptidyl prolyl isomerase F(PPIF), which was further verified in PBMCs derived from patients with AU. Supplementation ofPPIFreversesAPOEdeficiency–caused ROS activation in vitro. In addition, Adeno-associated virus-mediated overexpression ofPPIFexacerbated EAU phenotype, suggesting its important role in driving uveitis initiation. These results provide an understanding ofAPOEandPPIFin the pathogenesis of uveitis."

FcRL5 is a prominent target in B cell malignancies and has been implicated as a receptor for immunoglobulin G (IgG). However, the molecular mechanism remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that human FcRL5, but not its mouse counterpart, is a bona fide IgG-Fc (Fcγ) receptor that uniquely requires the presence of two Fcγ molecules in close proximity to form a robust interaction. Cryo–electron microscopy reveals that FcRL5 optimally engages two Fcγ molecules positioned at a 60° angle, with its D1-D2 domains binding to the first Fcγ molecule, while its D3 domain arches over the second Fcγ. This distinctive binding capability enables FcRL5 to specifically recognize IgG immune complexes (ICs), with the binding strength correlating with IgG concentration in the ICs. In addition, we demonstrate that FcRL5 can internalize the IgG polymer and IC. These results shed light on FcRL5 function and reveal a unique Fcγ-FcγR binding mode governed by avidity."

Hwang;Donghee Son;Yoonsoo Shin;Dae-Hyeong Kim,Facile and robust integration of functional hydrogels into micropillar-structured elastomer platforms for stable cardiac bioelectronics,"Establishing stable electrical communication between living tissues and bioelectronic devices requires soft, conductive, and conformable interfaces. Conductive hydrogels are attractive for this role because their hydrated polymer networks and mixed ionic/electronic conductivity reduce impedance and enhance charge transfer. Yet, challenges remain in integrating hydrogels with device components and achieving reliable tissue adhesion. Here, we present a materials and structural design strategy that enables electrically and mechanically robust devices through sequential formation of elastomer-metal-hydrogel multilayers and single-step laser patterning. The device consists of a micropillar-structured waterborne polyurethane substrate with a Au layer strongly bonded to the pillars, showing <2% resistance change under 28% strain. Functional hydrogels provide low interfacial impedance (~36.2 ohms at 1 kilohertz), effective insulation (~51,536 ohms at 1 kilohertz), and strong adhesion (~226 newtons per meter on cardiac tissue). Without elastomer-hydrogel decoupling, performance remains stable under dynamic aqueous conditions. Applied to rodent cardiac tissue, the integrated interface enables real-time electrocardiography monitoring and feedback-controlled electrical stimulation."

Bohn,Lost and found: Rediscovering microbiome-associated phenotypes that reshape agricultural sustainability,"Modern agriculture faces an urgent need to improve nutrient use efficiency while reducing environmental impacts. Here, we show that ancestral traits controlling rhizosphere microbiome functions can be reintroduced into elite maize through targeted teosinte introgressions. Using near-isogenic lines, we mapped microbiome-associated phenotypes (MAPs) derived from teosinte that suppress nitrification and denitrification—key microbial processes contributing to nitrogen loss. These introgressions altered root exudate chemistry, resulting in distinct microbial assemblies and enhanced nitrogen retention. We identified candidate loci and exudate metabolites responsible for suppressive activity and demonstrated their functional effects in vitro. These findings reveal a genetic and biochemical basis for rewilding microbiome-mediated ecosystem services in crops, offering a scalable path toward sustainable nutrient management in global agriculture."

We show that a sudden and strong increase in the frequency of MHWs in and after 2003 was linked to widespread and abrupt ecological changes. This upheaval spanned multiple trophic levels, from unicellular protists to whales. Every examined region showed a reorganization from species adapted to colder, ice-prone environments to those favoring warmer waters and the event’s impacts altered socioecological dynamics. This review provides evidence for large-scale connectivity across ocean basins. However, it reveals that the magnitude of ecological impacts seems to vary among events highlighting key knowledge gaps for predicting ecosystem responses to MHWs. Understanding the importance of the subpolar gyre and air-sea heat exchange will be crucial for forecasting MHWs and their cascading effects."
