However, due to the absence of a systematic evaluation benchmark, it remains unclear whether LLMs can be trusted to support core air pollution control tasks such as pollution alarming and mitigation recommendation, which limits their real-world deployment. This study developed a benchmark dataset aligned with the One Atmosphere framework (OneAtmos-Bench), by using a two-stage automated extraction pipeline. Leveraging this dataset, 11 LLMs were evaluated across three key metrics: accuracy, instruction-following (IF), and hallucination rate (HR). Expert validation confirms that the OneAtmos-Bench dataset achieves 95.88% accuracy. The evaluation results indicate that while IF remains consistently strong, both accuracy and hallucination suppression are still constrained, especially for long-tail tasks in the atmospheric domain. Notably, the marginal improvements from scaling up the model size for atmospheric tasks highlight sparse domain adaptation, and common training strategies to enhance reasoning ability, particularly distillation-based supervised fine-tuning, may inadvertently increase the HR. These findings reveal that general-purpose LLMs present reliability challenges in delivering the trustworthy, low-hallucination guidance required for efficient air pollution control decision-making, highlighting the need for environment-specific adaptation."

Biomimetic chromatography utilizes immobilized artificial membrane (IAM), human serum albumin (HSA), and alpha-1-glycoprotein (AGP) stationary phases to determine partition coefficients. A rapid-gradient biomimetic approach was used to determine partition coefficients for 81 target PFAS and 37 suspect PFAS in a 3M aqueous film forming foam. PFAS were categorized as acids, bases, or neutrals and used to interpret lipophilic contributions to binding on IAM, HSA, and AGP columns. Partition coefficients on the IAM membrane (log KIAM: 1.4 to 7.9; median 3.4) and AGP protein (log kAGP: −1.9 to 0.72; median 0.31) increased linearly with increasing fluorinated chain length, while those for HSA protein (log KHSA: 0.45 to 5.1; median 4.3) reached a plateau at a specific chain length (∼C6–C8). Zwitterionic PFAS at pH 7.4 exhibited lower affinities for both the IAM membrane and HSA protein, which are likely due to the smaller fraction of the charged species at pH 7.4. The partition coefficients (CHI log D [chromatographic log D derived from the Chromatographic Hydrophobicity Index scaled to the octanol/water partition coefficient, log D]), log KIAM, log KHSA, and log kAGP) expand our understanding of how PFAS behave in the body and provide a foundation for future toxicokinetic modeling.The rapid-gradient approach offers a novel method for measuring partition coefficients for PFAS in complex mixtures."

Concurrently, electrified processes are gaining prominence for water/wastewater treatment. Herein, we report that electrocoagulation with a low-carbon steel anode and graphite cathode at pH 6.5 and 5.5 and iron dose of 20 mg/L reduced the MS2 coliphage below detection limits (LRVs ≳6.7) in just 11.5 min. Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) of electrocoagulated viruses revealed single, double, and triple oxygen adducts and a negative mass shift peak in its coat protein without cleavage/scission. Density functional theory calculations coupled with computational spatial interaction mapping evidenced the formation of the quintet ferryl ion-cysteine 46 cluster. Hence, inactivation appears to have been accompanied by nonproteolytic capsid damages induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Evidence also pointed to possible ROS interactions with arginine 49 and tryptophan 32 residues. The α‐helixβ‐sheet ratio of viral protein secondary structures quantified by deconvoluting the amide I region of infrared spectra strongly and negatively correlated with inactivation, carbonyl group content, and MALDI-TOF-MS-derived protein alterations. Hence, iron electrocoagulation achieved high virus LRVs by removal (through enmeshment) and inactivation (via specific ROS interactions with coat protein residues)."

This review establishes a conceptual framework positioning the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily as the central integrative hub, where structurally diverse EDC signals converge. Transcending traditional single-chemical paradigms, we detail how mixtures co-opt the NR network through molecular crosstalk, heterodimer competition, and epigenetic reprogramming. Such disruptions trigger pathogenic cascades, including dysregulated neuroinflammation, impaired synaptic plasticity, and bioenergetic collapse, that compromise brain development. We critically evaluate state-of-the-art experimental and computational models, from brain organoids to microphysiological systems, advocating for an integrated systems toxicology approach. Leveraging time-series multiomics and dynamic network modeling is essential to identify mechanistic thresholds and assess potential transgenerational risks. This NR-centered framework provides a robust foundation for evolving the discipline from descriptive toxicology to predictive, next-generation risk assessment, ultimately safeguarding brain health in an increasingly complex chemical environment."

Effective, efficient, resilient, and equitable implementation of on-premise technologies and management systems is part of a One Water approach and necessary to protect public health and the environment, yet inconsistent delivery of essential public health services persists in many regions, including across states, tribes, and territories of the United States. We initiated a groundbreaking effort to understand challenges and to identify research opportunities related to the science and practice of decentralized wastewater. A horizon scanning exercise using a bottom up and transparent key questions approach was performed in which research needs were submitted by over 450 professionals working in academia, government, industry, and nonprofit organizations. We then further considered these research needs through facilitated focus group discussions and identified priority research questions through a consensus process during an in-person synthesis workshop. These key questions included technical and management topics, which were partitioned among six research categories: treatment, performance, and resource recovery; resiliency, efficacy, and sustainability; environmental quality and public health; assessment, monitoring, and operation and maintenance; implementation; and regulations, enforcement, and environmental justice. We offer recommendations to answer the priority research questions presented here; doing so promises to advance the science and improve the practice across rural–periurban–urban gradients."

Machine Learning Reveals Potential Key Influencing Factors,"Microplastics are pervasive environmental pollutants, making human exposure unavoidable. Although previous studies have detected microplastics in human blood and feces, these investigations were limited by small sample sizes and key contributors to microplastic biomonitoring remain underexplored. In this study, we analyzed 229 blood and 227 fecal samples using pyrolysis-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry to quantify microplastic exposure and identify key influencing factors through machine learning modeling. Seven polymer types were detected in both biological matrices, including polyethylene, poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), polypropylene, polystyrene, polyamide 66, poly(ethylene terephthalate), and poly(methyl methacrylate), with polyethylene, PVC, and polystyrene being the most prevalent. A significant negative correlation was observed between blood and fecal PVC levels, while other polymers showed no significant intermatrix association. Demographic, lifestyle, socioeconomic, and dietary information were collected via questionnaires. Age, sex, geographic, and indoor environmental variations in microplastic levels were observed. Machine learning models were developed to predict microplastic levels from anthropometric measurements and questionnaire data. Explainable AI tools revealed that the drinking water source was the strongest predictor of blood PVC levels. Socioeconomic factors, including income and education, were also significant predictors, with lower-income individuals showing higher microplastic burdens. This approach provides a framework for understanding and mitigating microplastic exposure."

However, their spatiotemporal dynamics in response to seasonal oceanographic processes remains insufficiently understood. By integrating basic hydrological and biogeochemical data, this study systematically compares the occurrence and behavior of traditional and emerging PFAS in full-depth seawater and surface sediments across the coastal East China Sea (ECS) during summer and winter. Waterborne PFAS consistently exhibited nearshore-to-offshore decreasing gradients and surface enrichment in both seasons, highlighting persistent terrestrial inputs. Notably, summer concentrations were generally lower, with weaker negative correlations with salinity, likely due to enhanced freshwater discharge during the wet season, which diluted and dispersed PFAS more effectively. Seasonal reversal of coastal currents driven by the monsoon further modulated the contaminant transport pathways. In contrast, sediment PFAS concentrations were generally higher in the summer, which can be attributed to stronger vertical mixing in the winter that facilitates the remobilization of contaminants. Enhanced sediment resuspension during the winter also promoted greater partitioning of PFAS, especially hydrophilic short-chain compounds, into the aqueous phase. These findings offer valuable insights into the seasonal variability and environmental behavior of PFAS in coastal marine systems."

Proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-TOF-MS) was used to monitor COFs, focusing on six typical pollutants: benzene, toluene, butadiene, acrolein, acetaldehyde, and formic acid, measured at six spatially distributed points. Near the stove, thermally driven convection led to vertical stratification: volatile aromatics accumulated in the upper zone, while heavier alcohols and carbonyls settled lower. Partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) confirmed distinct COF compositions at ceiling level, while lower zones across the kitchen and living area shared similarities due to horizontal advection. All six compounds showed substantial concentration losses during migration, indicating nonuniform exposure risk from kitchen to living room. Formic acid exhibited slow secondary formation, leading to its delayed presence in the living area. Cross-correlation analysis identified toluene and butadiene as likely precursors of formic acid via gas-phase oxidation through secondary transformation (peak lag = −1; r = 0.593 and 0.578). Natural ventilation significantly reduced near-source acrolein by up to 95%, highlighting the role of window opening as an effective mitigation strategy."

These peroxide species decompose to form radicals upon aqueous dissolution. While the mechanism responsible for producing these radicals has yet to be fully elucidated, one prevailing hypothesis to support this phenomenon is Fenton-like reactions between redox-active metals and peroxides. Vaping emits various redox-active metals, which may play an important role in mediating these types of aqueous reactions. Here, we observed that the production of radicals resulting from the aqueous decomposition of aged e-cigarette aerosols was found to be highly dependent on the presence of redox-active metals, indicating the reliance of Fenton-like reactions on mediating the formation of radicals. Additionally, we observed that peroxides and metals are enriched within the ultrafine particles (UFPs) of aged vaping emissions, which leads to a drastic enhancement of their ability to generate radicals. This work provides a mechanistic perspective regarding the oxidative ability of aged e-cigarette aerosols, as well as potential negative implications associated with their inhalation and subsequent deposition in aqueous regions of the lungs."

Here, we conducted a comprehensive field assessment at a representative Porphyra (nori) mariculture farm in coastal China, where we monitored multisphere carbon pools across the water-column, sediments, atmosphere, and biomass. Multivariate statistical analysis and machine-learning models were used to identify stage-specific drivers and project carbon-pool responses under multiple warming scenarios. Our results demonstrate that Porphyra cultivation delivers substantial carbon-sequestration benefits, as it significantly enhances atmospheric CO2 sequestration and sedimentary carbon burial. Concurrently, the system consistently releases dissolved organic carbon (DOC), of which 48–54% was transformed into long-lived refractory DOC. High-temporal-resolution monitoring reveals highly dynamic carbon pools across cultivation stages, with dominant controls on net sequestration shifting from inorganic-carbon uptake and hydrodynamics during early growth to biologically mediated processes at peak biomass. Simulations across climate-change scenarios indicate that although inorganic pools were more temperature-sensitive than organic pools, changes across all major pools under projected warming over the coming decades remain within 5%, underscoring strong resilience to warming. Together, these process-based insights support the integration of macroalgal mariculture into blue-carbon action plans and carbon-offset initiatives."

Townsend,A Componential Evaluation of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Streams,"Understanding the sources and mobility of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in municipal solid waste (MSW) is critical for evaluating their environmental release. This study analyzed 22 MSW subcomponents sorted from 1000 kg of waste for 67 PFAS compounds using standardized leaching tests (L/S = 10). The highest levels were found in polycoated aseptic containers (36 ng/g), rubber, leather, and textiles (25 ng/g), and yard waste (11 ng/g). Other paper, plastic, electronics, and construction and demolition waste had moderate PFAS levels (0.6–8.9 ng/g), while glass had the lowest (0.13 ng/g). PFAS profiles varied across materials, with some dominated by terminal perfluoroalkyl acids and others dominated by precursors such as FTCAs. The weighted average PFAS concentration across the waste stream was 4.1 ng/g. To assess broader implications, measured concentrations were extrapolated to national MSW composition data. Based on an assumed 10% leachability factor from prior studies, the total PFAS mass in MSW may be closer to 16,000 kg/year, with about 1600 kg per year potentially leachable. Of the leachable portion, approximately 780 kg enters landfills, where much of it is likely mobilized into leachate. The remaining leachable mass was distributed across recycling (330 kg), composting (220 kg), and combustion (230 kg). Although rubber, leather, and textiles comprise only 9% of the national MSW by weight, they account for an estimated 38% of leachable PFAS mass. These materials represent priority targets for mitigation through product reformulation, source segregation, and improved end-of-life treatment to minimize environmental release."

This study assessed the dose-dependent impacts of PLA-MPs on black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) and uncovered underlying mechanisms using integrated whole-larva transcriptomic, antioxidant enzymatic, gut microbial, and metabolomic analyses. Low PLA-MP exposure (1% w/w) significantly promoted larval performance, increasing body weight by 33% and waste reduction index by 12%. These improvements were linked to activated nutrient-utilization pathways, enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities mitigating mild oxidative stress, and enrichment of beneficial gut microbes, supporting gut homeostasis. In contrast, high PLA-MP exposure (5% w/w) suppressed growth, reducing body weight by 15.3% and survival by 10.86%. These adverse outcomes were driven by excessive oxidative stress and disrupted energy metabolism, which induced detoxification responses. Consistently, the 5% group showed a transition from deterministic to stochastic gut microbial assembly and enrichment of opportunistic pathogens. Overall, this study clarifies the contrasting biological effects of PLA-MPs on BSFL and provides essential insight into evaluating biodegradable microplastics in organic waste treatment systems."

Seinfeld,Complex Effects of Reduced Mobile Source Emissions on Submicron Particulate Matter Concentrations in Los Angeles,"Despite considerable reductions in mobile source emissions, annual average aerosol concentrations measured in Los Angeles using Federal Reference Methods (FRM) have not appreciably declined over the past decade. Here, we use submicron aerosol measurements and zero-dimensional modeling to quantify the impacts of these emission reductions on aerosol formation in Pasadena, CA, during the late spring and summer of 2022. Reductions in secondary organic aerosol (SOA) concentrations expected from reduced mobile source emissions appear to have been largely offset by increases in hydroxyl radical concentrations, an indirect effect of reduced nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. As a result, while the predicted contribution of mobile sources to the SOA burden has declined from ∼50% in 2010 to only ∼25% in 2022, concentrations of locally formed SOA have remained relatively constant. In contrast, reductions in mobile source NOx emissions have likely reduced overnight production of nitric acid and ammonium nitrate (AN) aerosol. We provide indirect evidence that FRM measurements may have failed to capture the reduction in AN since 2010 due to the evaporation of semivolatile species from FRM filter samples. Our results suggest that given the effectiveness of historical regulatory efforts aimed at mobile sources, and on-road sources in particular, additional reductions in submicron aerosol concentrations in Los Angeles will likely require increased focus on abating emissions from nonroad and area sources."

Yet measurements of such a property are quite incomplete, and an accurate and efficient volatility parametrization remains challenging. Here, we utilized a Long Time-of-Flight Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer (LToF-CIMS) coupled with a Filter Inlet for Gases and Aerosols (FIGAERO) to measure molecular composition and saturation vapor pressure of organic compounds on particulate samples collected from Dianshan Lake and Tai Lake, China across different seasons with a wide temperature coverage. Two desorption procedures, i.e., a high-temperature range of 20–160 °C and a low-temperature range of 5–35 °C, were implemented. The obtained saturation vapor pressures of organic components were integrated with previous results (Yang et al., 2023) to compose our data set. By incorporating the concept of mole fraction (X) and addressing data imbalance across different volatility bins via Synthetic Minority Oversampling (SMOTE) and Random Under-sampling (RUS), a 4-parameter volatility parametrization of a commonly used volatility formula was developed, which outperforms previous ones for volatility prediction of both CHO and CHON compounds when validated against the NCI database, and potentially improves atmospheric models that use volatility as a key input."

This study integrates human epidemiological data with experimental models to elucidate these pathways and identify potential therapeutic targets. First, in a cross-sectional study of Mn-exposed workers, we observed elevated serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and dysregulated expression of mRNAs related to AA metabolism, both of which were identified as important mediators between Mn exposure and cognitive impairment. In mouse models, multilevel analyses combining behavioral assays, striatal transcriptomics, and oxidized lipid metabolomics demonstrated that Mn exposure triggers microglial activation, disrupts AA metabolic pathways, and drives neuroinflammation, culminating in cognitive impairment. A central finding was the downregulation of 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), an endogenous PPARγ ligand with strong anti-inflammatory properties, in both human serum and the mouse striatum following Mn exposure. Furthermore, bioinformatics and molecular docking nominated MMP9 (Matrix metalloproteinase-9) as a potential key target, which we functionally validated by showing that MMP9 knockdown in BV2 microglia attenuated Mn-induced inflammatory responses. Finally, we confirmed the therapeutic potential of 15d-PGJ2 by demonstrating its efficacy in suppressing these adverse outcomes in vitro. Our findings establish that 15d-PGJ2 deficiency and AA metabolic dysregulation are important mechanisms in Mn neurotoxicity, and we identify MMP9 as a contributor to this process, revealing potential targets for intervention."

While the accumulation and toxicity of MPs in organisms at low trophic levels have been documented, the analysis of the absolute cellular uptake of MPs at a single-cell level with high-throughput methods remains a challenge. In this study, we developed a flow cytometry-based approach integrating a particle balance method and biokinetic modeling to quantitatively assess the uptake and elimination dynamics of fluorescently labeled MPs in the freshwater ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila. The intracellular accumulation of MPs was calculated by subtracting the extracellular MPs from the total exposure amount, ensuring that the measurement was free from interference caused by fluorescence quenching or cellular background noise. Our results revealed that intracellular MPs continuously increased during the first hour, followed by a marked decline within 24 h. By applying a biokinetic model, we demonstrated that the effect of cell division on reducing MP burden is 3.6 to 5.8 times greater than that of elimination, depending on the exposure concentration. The calculated bioconcentration factors (BCFs) exceed 4800, indicating a significant potential for bioaccumulation of MPs in T. thermophila. These results enhance our understanding of the initial processes through which MPs enter the food chain and provide essential technical support for further research on the quantitative toxicity assessment of MP pollution."

However, if retrieval errors in the satellite‐derived AOD are not corrected or characterized, they can lead to false analysis increments and ultimately degrade the quality of data assimilation (DA). The issue also arises in the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI)‐II AOD product, which remains susceptible to cloud contamination. To address the issue, this study developed a cloud screening framework for GOCI‐II AOD that combines two processes: (a) cloud removal using cloud type information from Himawari‐8/9 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) and (b) a statistical cloud filtering based on AOD retrieval characteristics. Comparisons with Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD demonstrated that the cloud screening framework effectively mitigated overestimation of GOCI‐II AODs compared to AERONET AODs. Consequently, the cloud‐screened GOCI‐II AOD showed a better agreement with AERONET AOD, improving Pearson's correlation coefficient from 0.77 to 0.82 and decreasing root‐mean‐square error from 0.175 to 0.110. Despite these improvements, the normalized biases of the cloud‐screened GOCI‐II AOD against AERONET AOD still exhibited diurnal variations, with GOCI‐II AODs being overestimated in coastal regions and underestimated in inland sites, under low‐AOD conditions. Nonetheless, the enhanced consistency of the cloud‐screened GOCI‐II AOD with AERONET AOD and its more Gaussian‐like error distribution supports the utility of the cloud screening framework in improving the quality of GOCI‐II AOD for DA systems."

This study evaluated the Sigmoid Generalized Complementary (SGC) equation for estimating evaporation in a subtropical mangrove forest in the southern China, focusing on the effects of tidal inundation time fraction (TI) and salinity (SAL) on both evaporation and model parameters. Using a decade of eddy covariance and meteorological data, we found that the SGC equation accurately captured the diurnal and seasonal evaporation dynamics achieving high performance (R2 = 0.94, RMSE = 11.98 W m−2; daily) with the best‐fit parameters (α = 1.13, b = ∞). α is the atmospheric character parameter representing the atmospheric advection effect and b is the land surface parameter representing the surface moisture condition. Although TI had limited impact on the evaporation magnitude, it sufficiently affected parameter b which transitioned from land‐like to open‐water characteristics as inundation increased. Salinity did not significantly affect the SGC parameters but was negatively correlated with monthly evaporation, especially when exceeding about 15 PSU. Diurnally, evaporation was primarily controlled by net radiation rather than water level or salinity, and no water‐energy decoupling was observed at the seasonal scale. These findings demonstrate the robustness and applicability of the SGC framework in intertidal environments, offer a new perspective for modeling evaporation in intertidal zones, and provide new insights into the interactions between hydrological drivers, salinity stress, and evaporation in mangroves."

Despite their promise as a nature‐based climate solution that can enhance soil carbon storage, cover crops remain underutilized, in part due to farmer perceptions that benefits are not assured and management risk is high. This scoping review synthesizes research from multiple disciplines to identify persistent knowledge gaps that limit both the effectiveness and sustained adoption of cover cropping. We focus on Midwestern US agroecosystems, where scientists generally agree that cover cropping has the potential to increase soil organic carbon and contribute to long‐term carbon sequestration. Our synthesis reveals critical challenges across domains: carbon outcomes are highly variable across space and time; water and nutrient dynamics exhibit tradeoffs and context dependence; economic returns remain difficult to quantify; and adoption patterns are shaped by feedbacks between perceived risk, observed outcomes, system constraints, and social factors such as norms and identity. We use Ostrom's social‐ecological systems framework to structure our analysis across biophysical, economic, and social domains, linking scientific uncertainty to real‐world implementation barriers. The review culminates in a set of research priorities designed to advance transdisciplinary work on cover cropping, clarify its climate mitigation potential, improve the design of private and public interventions, and support adaptive management."

Marlier,Choice of Downscaled Climate Product Matters: Projections of Valley Fever Seasonality in a Warming Climate,"Downscaled climate projections provide valuable information needed to better understand the impacts of climate change on health outcomes and to inform adaptation and mitigation strategies at local to regional scales. Because downscaled climate products vary in their representations of fine‐scale spatiotemporal patterns, due to of multiple interacting factors, epidemiologic analyses need to consider how differences across downscaling approaches impact projections of health impacts into the future. We evaluate the projected seasonality of coccidioidomycosis in response to projected temperature and precipitation estimated using global climate models from CMIP6 included in California's Fifth Climate Change Assessment, downscaled using two approaches: (a) dynamical downscaling using the Weather Research and Forecasting model; and (b) hybrid statistical downscaling using the Localized Constructed Analogs approach. Our results indicate that by end of century, coccidioidomycosis transmission is projected to start earlier, end later, and last longer across the California endemic region; however, the magnitude of these changes varies by downscaling method. Specifically, LOCA2‐hybrid projected a season onset that is 4.2 weeks earlier and an end that is 4.1 weeks later than historical conditions, while the dynamical approach projected a 4 week earlier onset and a 3.8 week later end compared to the historical period. Overall, the LOCA2‐hybrid product estimates that the transmission season will last about 0.3 weeks longer than what is projected using dynamical downscaling by end of century. This analysis highlights the sensitivity of coccidioidomycosis seasonality projections to choice of downscaling product, underscoring the need to account for these differences in mitigation and adaptation planning."

 Multifold topological semimetals host fermions with opposite chiralities at topological band crossings1–3. Chiral fermionic transport in topological systems often relies on high magnetic fields or magnetic dopants to suppress trivial transport and create an imbalance in occupancy of opposite Chern-number states4,5. Here we use the quantum geometry6,7 of topological bands to filter fermions by chirality into distinct Chern-number-polarized states. This allows for the real-space separation of currents with opposite fermionic chiralities, which we have demonstrated by observing their quantum interference in the absence of any magnetic field. Devices fabricated from single-crystal PdGa in a three-arm geometry exhibit quantum-geometry-induced anomalous velocities8,9 of chiral fermions, thereby exhibiting a nonlinear Hall effect. The resultant transverse chiral currents with opposite anomalous velocities are thereby spatially separated into the outer arms of the device. These chiral currents in opposing Chern number states also carry orbital magnetizations with opposite signs. The mesoscopic phase coherence of these chiral currents facilitated their quantum interference10 in a Mach–Zehnder interferometer. Our findings establish a chiral fermionic valve that exhibits three key properties: spatially separates chiral fermions into Chern-number polarized states by using their quantum geometry, enables tuneable current-induced magnetization and provides a platform for controllable quantum interference of chiral quasiparticles using an electric current and magnetic field.

 Despite successes in replicating the primary–secondary–tertiary structure hierarchy of protein, it remains elusive to synthetically materialize protein functions that are deeply rooted in their chemical, structural and dynamic heterogeneities1–12. We propose that for polymers with backbone chemistries different from that of proteins, programming spatial and temporal projections of sidechains at the segmental level can be effective in replicating protein behaviours13,14; and leveraging the rotational freedom of polymer can mitigate deficiencies in monomeric sequence specificity and achieve behaviour uniformity at the ensemble level2,3,15–20. Here, guided by the active site analysis of about 1,300 metalloproteins, we design random heteropolymers (RHPs) as enzyme mimics based on one-pot synthesis. We introduce key monomers as the equivalents of the functional residues of protein and statistically modulate the chemical characteristics of key monomer-containing segments, such as segmental hydrophobicity21. The resultant RHPs form pseudo-active sites that provide key monomers with protein-like microenvironments, co-localize substrates with catalytic or cofactor-binding sidechains and catalyse reactions such as oxidation and cyclization of citronellal with isopulegol/menthoglycol selectivity. This RHP design led to enzyme-like materials that can retain catalytic activity under non-biological conditions, are compatible with scalable processing and have expanded substrate scope, including environmentally long-lasting antibiotic tetracycline22.

 Wearable healthcare electronics are rapidly emerging as a distinct electronics sector in the digital era1–6, offering substantial economic opportunities and crucial medical benefits. However, their interactions with environmental and social systems remain poorly understood7–9, leaving critical sustainability challenges unaddressed. Although current efforts have focused on material-level improvements, broader system-level dynamics remain unexplored. Here we present an integrated systems engineering framework based on de novo life-cycle inventories and diffusion-linked scaling to quantify global eco-footprint hotspots and identify effective mitigation strategies. Cradle-to-grave analysis of representative wearable healthcare electronics (glucose, cardiac and blood pressure monitors and diagnostic imagers) generates full-spectrum environmental impact metrics, identifying warming impacts of 1.1–6.1 kgCO2-equivalent per device. The global device consumption is projected to increase 42-fold by 2050, approaching 2 billion units annually and generating 3.4 MtCO2-equivalent emissions alongside ecotoxicity and e-waste issues. Contrary to the conventional sustainability emphasis on plastics, this work demonstrates that recyclable or biodegradable plastics offer only marginal benefits, whereas substituting critical-metal conductors and optimizing circuit architectures can significantly reduce impacts without compromising performance. This systems engineering-based life-cycle assessment framework holds promise for establishing ecologically responsible innovation in next-generation wearable electronics.

 For the MHC, MR1 and CD1 systems, antigen recognition involves contact of the membrane distal surfaces of both the αβ T cell receptor (TCR) and the antigen-presenting molecule. Whether other antigen display mechanisms by antigen-presenting molecules operate remains unknown. Here, we report mass spectrometry analyses of endogenous lipids captured by CD1c when bound to an autoreactive αβ TCR. CD1c binds twenty-six lipid species with bulky headgroups that cannot fit within the tight TCR-CD1c interface. We determined the crystal structures of CD1c presenting several gangliosides, revealing a general mechanism whereby two lipids, rather than one, are bound in the CD1c cleft. Bulky lipids are oriented sideways so that their polar headgroups protrude laterally through a side portal of the CD1c molecule - an evolutionarily conserved structural feature. The sideways-presented ganglioside headgroups do not hinder TCR binding and so represent a mechanism that allows autoreactive TCR recognition of CD1c. In addition, ex vivo studies showed that the sideways-presented gangliosides can also represent TCR recognition determinants. These findings reveal that CD1c simultaneously presents two lipid antigens from the top and side of its cleft, a general mechanism that differs markedly from other antigen-presenting molecules.

 Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infections are a leading cause of diarrheal illness, responsible for an estimated 100,000 deaths annually. ETEC pathogenesis is driven by various virulence factors, including toxins, adhesins, and noncanonical factors such as the protease EatA. The first line of host defense against intestinal pathogenic bacterial infections is the protective intestinal mucus layer. Here, we demonstrate the mechanism by which EatA degrades the core mucus component MUC2, thereby facilitating access to the epithelial cell surface and promoting infection. We identify the specific cleavage site region localized at the C-terminal of MUC2. EatA’s protease activity depends on the interaction between two distinct, uniquely spaced domains in human MUC2, which defines species specificity. We confirm this using a novel transgenic mouse model exclusively expressing human MUC2, which allows us to study the role of the mucus layer in the infection by human intestinal pathogens. These findings highlight how ETEC is adapted to specifically degrade the mucus layer of its human host.

 Li-ion batteries, widely used in electronic devices, electric vehicles, and aviation, demand high energy density, fast charging capabilities, and broad operating temperature ranges. Computations combined with experiments have gained increasing attention for electrolyte development. However, the inherent complexity of electrolytes poses a significant challenge. Classical molecular dynamics often fails due to inaccuracies in force field parameters, while ab initio calculations are limited by high computational costs. Recently, machine learning molecular dynamics has emerged as an efficient and accurate alternative. However, its application is hindered by limited transferability of machine learning potentials. In this work, we developed a universal machine learning potential for electrolytes using an iterative training approach on randomly composed datasets, enabling the accurate computation of key properties for a broad range of electrolytes via molecular dynamics. Furthermore, coordination dynamics analysis of Li ion, by quantifying the coordination lifetime, provides a direct, quantitative measure of solvation strength. The universal machine learning potential for electrolytes facilitates the prediction and optimization of electrolyte properties, offering a powerful tool for electrolyte design.

By directly binding phosphatidylcholine and specific translocon components, SigmaR1 maintains protein and lipid homeostasis; its loss triggers lipid droplet accumulation in hepatic cells. 
 Sigma Non-Opioid Intracellular Receptor 1 (SigmaR1) is a member of the sigma family of receptors that interacts with a variety of psychotomimetic drugs and is involved in a wide range of cellular and physiological functions. Despite its increasing importance in human physiology and disease, the subcellular localization of SigmaR1 and its molecular function remain poorly defined. Using endogenous tagging and cell fractionation, we show that SigmaR1 is a type II integral ER membrane protein that is specifically enriched at ER sheets. A short region at the N-terminus of SigmaR1 promotes its ER-sheet localization. Importantly, our biochemical studies demonstrate that SigmaR1 directly interacts with components of the translocon complex including TRAPα and Nicalin. In addition, we found that a β-barrel at the C-terminal of SigmaR1 binds phosphatidylcholine (PC), and the binding of PC strengthens the association of SigmaR1 with the translocon complex. SigmaR1 knockout systematically impaired cellular protein and lipid homeostasis, resulting in accumulation of lipid droplets in hepatocytes. Collectively, we propose that SigmaR1 is an auxiliary translocon factor that binds lipids to regulate protein and lipid droplet homeostasis, which may underlie the broad and vital roles of SigmaR1 in physiology and disease.

 Quartz optical fibers are brittle, difficult to repair, and lack reconfigurability, limiting their adaptability in underwater communication. To overcome these impediments, here we show reconfigurable all-liquid optical fibers (RAOFs) produced by structured liquid, tuned by the interfacial assembly and jamming of nanoparticle surfactants at the water-oil interface (interfacial tension <10 mN m-1, refractive index contrast of 0.083). These RAOFs combine the structural stability of the interfacial assemblies with the inherent flexibility of liquids. They support real-time communication on an Ethernet platform (up to 1 Gbps), providing a practical alternative to conventional optical fibers for optical interconnects. Their liquid nature enables broken fibers to be repaired rapidly by a coalescence process. Their softness affords on-demand reconfigurability that enables in-situ fabrication of reconfigurable optical fibers and dynamic manipulation of signal transmission. RAOFs provide a versatile, self-healing, and resilient solution for optical communication systems in dynamic environments.

We experiment on two publicly available multimodal datasets, The Cancer Genomic Atlas and the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium, spanning four independent cohorts: glioma-glioblastoma, renal, uterine, and breast, and observe significant performance gains in gradation and risk estimation (p-value  < 0.05) when incorporating synthesized transcriptomic data with WSIs. Also, predictions using synthesized features were statistically close to those obtained with real transcriptomic data (p-value  > 0.05), consistently across cohorts. Here we show that with our diffusion based crossmodal generative AI model, PathGen, gene expressions synthesized from digital histopathology jointly predict cancer grading and patient survival risk with high accuracy (state-of-the-art performance), certainty (through conformal coverage guarantee) and interpretability (through distributed co-attention maps). PathGen code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/Samiran-Dey/PathGen for open use. Multimodal fusion of digital pathology and transcriptomics can improve cancer diagnosis, but remains impractical in clinical settings. Here, the authors develop a crossmodal generative model, PathGen, to synthesise transcriptomic data from histopathology slides, and show how the combination of these multimodal data improves cancer diagnosis and prognosis prediction."

The findings pave the way for microbiome-aware dietary strategies for autism. 
 Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is linked to both altered gut microbiota and unhealthy diets; however, the mechanistic connections remain elusive. In this study, we conducted a systematic analysis of fecal microbiome metagenomic data, paired with granular dietary assessments and phenotypic profiles, across a cohort of 818 children (462 with ASD, 356 without ASD; mean age = 8.4 years; 27.3% female). By integrating dietary indices, nutrient intake, and food additive exposures, we uncovered ASD-specific linkages to the microbiome. Poor dietary quality correlated with aggregated core autistic symptoms, gastrointestinal complications, and atypical eating behaviors. Notably, children with ASD exhibited a more pronounced diet-microbiome interaction network compared to neurotypical peers, suggesting heightened microbial sensitivity to nutritional inputs. Furthermore, synthetic emulsifiers—specifically polysorbate-80 and carrageenan—were associated with disrupted microbial connectivity in ASD, a phenomenon attenuated in neurotypical children. Our findings elucidate the mechanistic links between dietary factors—particularly synthetic food additives—and microbiome dysregulation in ASD, urging a re-evaluation of dietary guidelines for ASD populations and laying the groundwork for personalized nutritional strategies. Here, the authors identify distinct, autism-specific diet microbiome interactions, showing how unhealthy diets and synthetic emulsifiers drive dysbiosis.

 Coral reef ecosystems are being altered by rising ocean temperatures and increasing nutrient inputs, yet their combined influence on food-web structure is not well understood. Here we analyzed 130 coral reef food webs across the South China Sea, constructed from environmental DNA surveys integrated with trophic interactions. We grouped the food webs into surface-water, bottom-water and sediment habitats. Our analyses reveal pronounced structural differences among habitats: surface- and bottom-water webs exhibit significantly higher connectance and nestedness, whereas sediment webs are more compartmentalized. Using linear mixed-effects models, we find that temperature and productivity interact in nonlinear ways to shape food-web properties. In surface waters, higher temperature together with higher productivity tends to increase connectance, whereas in deeper waters the same conditions tend to lengthen trophic pathways and reduce stability. These results suggest that future environmental change may influence pelagic and benthic reef food webs in contrasting ways.

 The digital transformation of supply chains presents a promising option to reduce urban pollutants and carbon dioxide emissions. Here, we utilize China’s Supply Chain Innovation and Application Pilot Policy as a quasi-natural experiment. We assess its impact on urban pollutants and carbon dioxide emissions. We compile a city-year panel dataset by merging high-resolution emissions inventories with socioeconomic data across 279 prefecture-level cities from 2005 to 2021. We found that supply chain digitalization reduces urban pollutants and carbon dioxide emissions by 7.1%-9.9% locally; however, these emissions increase by 4.4% in neighboring jurisdictions. Medium-small-sized and non-industrial cities benefit the most from supply chain digitalization, while megacities and entrenched industrial hubs see modest benefits. Our findings show that while digital supply chain innovations can advance urban sustainability, integrated regional instruments, such as linked city-level emissions trading schemes and shared digital monitoring, reporting, and verification infrastructure, are needed to reduce emissions spillover.

 Submarine explosive volcanism shapes seafloor morphology, impacts marine ecosystems, and poses risks to maritime infrastructure and coastal communities. However, its occurrences and drivers remain poorly constrained, especially for basaltic systems. Here we present evidence for widespread phreatomagmatic volcanism at the Reykjanes Ridge north of ~63.2°N, derived from high-resolution seismic reflection profiles, multibeam bathymetry, and seafloor imagery. Our data indicate a first-order depth control on eruption style: effusive volcanism dominates below ~300 m, producing hummocky edifices with strong seismic attenuation, whereas shallower depths favour Surtseyan eruptions, forming smooth volcanic cones with flanks comprising stratified, outward-dipping seismic reflections. When eruptions occur close to the water–air interface, flat-topped volcanoes form, some emerging as ephemeral islands before being submerged by storm wave base erosion. Our results show that Surtseyan eruptions have been a dominant and recurrent process along the Reykjanes Ridge north of ~63.2°N since the Last Glacial Maximum.

 Advancements in close-range remote sensing offer promises in automated forest inventory, facilitating sustainable forest management. Backpack LiDAR is a mobile mapping system that can be deployed for different applications, including forest inventory. However, under-canopy trajectories derived from backpacks equipped with GNSS units are often unreliable due to signal outages, resulting in degraded mapping results. To overcome this challenge, an Integrated Scan Simultaneous Trajectory Enhancement and Mapping (IS2-TEAM) framework is proposed for fine-resolution forest inventory. For multi-beam spinning LiDAR, a single scan refers to points from a full revolution of the laser beam assembly, while an integrated scan combines multiple successive single scans. The framework introduces feature extraction strategies for defining reliable semantic features (tree trunk and ground) from integrated scans to enhance trajectory and mapping results. If available, the framework can incorporate a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) extracted from existing geospatial data to enhance georeferencing accuracy of backpack LiDAR. Finally, extracted features together with enhanced point cloud undergo a machine-learning post-processing strategy to evaluate the IS2-TEAM's performance in tree detection and provide tree classification results based on maturity. The proposed approach has been thoroughly evaluated across multiple study sites with different forest types and terrain conditions. Through the experimental results, it has been shown that the IS2-TEAM extracts reliable ground and tree trunk features and generates point clouds with alignment quality range of 2–4 cm. Furthermore, DTM-assisted IS2-TEAM significantly improves the georeferencing accuracy of the derived point cloud in forests with varying terrain conditions, achieving an average vertical accuracy improvement of 1 m across all test datasets. Finally, the proposed self-evaluation strategy successfully identifies all mature trees and achieves over 90 % accuracy in tree classification."

 Comprehensive evaluation of satellite and model-based soil moisture (SM) products is essential for their further development and application. With the advent of Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensing (CRNS), which has an observation radius of 130–240 m, the spatial representativeness mismatch between these grid-based SM products and ground single-point observations during the evaluation process can be feasibly relieved. In this study, we systematically evaluated 23 gridded SM products, including single-sensor satellite, multi-sensor merged, and model-based products, using 68 CRNS measurement sites across the Europe. Our evaluation revealed that the SMAP-INRAE-BORDEAUX (SMAP-IB) SM retrievals showed the superior consistency with CRNS measurements among all analyzed products, demonstrating both high correlation (R = 0.80) and low unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE = 0.050 m3/m3). The CCI/C3S combined active-passive SM products ranked second in performance (R > 0.75, ubRMSE <0.060 m3/m3). In the bias analysis, 17 products had negative bias (−0.003 m3/m3 to −0.190 m3/m3) against CRNS measurements, while AMSR2-LPRM at C1 and C2 bands and CCI/C3S at active and passive products had positive bias (0.011 m3/m3 to 0.161 m3/m3). It was also found that the capabilities of all SM products retrievals degraded in terms of R and ubRMSE with increasing vegetation density, topographic complexity and soil wetness. Most products showed the lowest ubRMSE and highest R values in cropland compared to other land cover types. Our study emphasizes the substantial potential of cosmic field-scale SM observations for the validation of satellite- and model-based SM products, and our findings have the potential to advance algorithm refinement, product improvement, and hydrometeorological applications."

 Formaldehyde (HCHO) critically mediates atmospheric photochemistry, yet its source-specific impacts remain poorly quantified. Integrating Positive Matrix Factorization and Observation-Based Models, we reveal average HCHO concentrations of 5.6 ± 1.6 ppb during ozone (O3) episodes in Zhengzhou, China, with 43 % originating from RO· + O2-driven secondary formation. Anthropogenic emission contributes 49 % (e.g., vehicles: 19 %, industry: 16 %). Under Zero-HCHO simulations, concentrations of HO2·, OH·, and RO2· decreased by 27 %, 20 %, and 12 %, respectively, with a concomitant 19 % reduction in net O3 production. Source-specific HCHO reveals that secondary production dominated both ROx· (44–48 % contribution) and net O3 (52 % contribution) formation. Notably, biogenic HCHO emissions serve a critical function in daytime photochemical oxidant formation (14–18 %) despite its 7 % HCHO share. Diurnal analysis further identifies morning rush-hour emissions of HCHO from vehicles/industries that act as photochemical primers, boosting 22 % and 15 % O3 formation, respectively.

 Atmospheric aerosols significantly influence air quality, climate and human health, making detailed source attribution and transport characterization essential. This study integrates multiple advanced techniques-air mass cluster analysis, Concentration Weighted Trajectory (CWT) analysis and Conditional Bivariate Probability Function (CBPF) analysis; to investigate aerosol emission sources and transport pathways at three Central European measurement stations: Melpitz (MEL, Germany), Frýdlant (FRY, Czech Republic) and Košetice (NAOK, Czech Republic). Online measurements of non-refractory submicron aerosols (NR-PM1) using aerosol mass spectrometer, combined with equivalent black carbon (eBC) and brown carbon (BrC) data from aethalometers, enabled detailed characterization of aerosol composition and sources during winter (February–March 2021) and summer (July–August 2021) campaigns. In winter, the highest PM1 mass concentrations were recorded at NAOK (13.2 μg/m3), followed by FRY (6.4 μg/m3) and MEL (6.3 μg/m3), with organic aerosol (OA) and nitrate as major components. Diurnal trends revealed strong nighttime enhancements, especially at NAOK, indicating residential heating influence. Cluster analysis identified eastern continental air masses as dominant contributors to elevated PM levels at all sites. CWT analysis showed significant source regions for eBC, BrC and secondary inorganic aerosols in Poland and the Czech Republic, particularly for MEL and FRY. In contrast, CBPF analysis indicated local sources as the primary contributors to high OA, eBC, and BrC levels at NAOK, especially under low wind conditions (<2 m/s), suggesting biomass burning and residential heating as key sources. During summer, PM1 concentrations were more uniform across sites, with slightly higher values at MEL (8.6 μg/m3) compared to NAOK (7.3 μg/m3) and FRY (6.5 μg/m3). Enhanced biogenic emissions and photochemical activity led to increased organic fractions, with NAOK exhibiting the highest proportion (75 % of PM1 mass). This study demonstrates the advantages of integrating multiple analytical techniques to distinguish between local and long-range sources, assess seasonal variability, and characterize long-range transport patterns, providing key insights for air quality management in Central Europe."

 BackgroundWhile long-term exposure to air pollutants may increase the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the relative contributions of different air pollutants and the role of particulate matter (PMx) size remain elusive. We investigated independent and joint effects of long-term exposure to PM of different sizes (PM1, PM2.5, PM10, PM1-2.5, and PM2.5-10) and gaseous pollutants (NO2, SO2, and CO) on NAFLD incidence, as well as the impact of different PM2.5 components.MethodsThis prospective study included 31,105 participants from the Chinese Cohort of Working Adults (CCWA). Newly diagnosed cases of NAFLD were identified through ultrasound-based diagnosis of hepatic steatosis during physical examination. Logistic regression was employed to estimate associations of individual air pollutants and PM2.5 components with NAFLD. Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression assessed the joint effect of air pollutants and their relative contribution to the joint effect. Stratified analyses by demographic, behavioral, and health factors were also conducted.ResultsEach interquartile increase in the exposure to individual air pollutants and PM2.5 components was associated with a higher incidence of NAFLD. PM1-2.5 showed the strongest positive association (OR: 1.21, 95 % CI: 1.15–1.28). Among PM2.5 components, organic matter (OM) had the highest independent effect (OR: 1.19, 95 % CI: 1.12–1.26). Among all included pollutants, PM1-2.5 contributed most (71 %) to the joint effect on the NAFLD incidence at follow-up, followed by PM1 (16 %) and NO2 (13 %); of the PM2.5 components, OM contributed the most (56 %). Effects of air pollutants on the NAFLD incidence were more pronounced in men and smokers.ConclusionLong-term exposure to PM1-2.5 within the PM2.5 size range most importantly affects new-onset NAFLD, and within PM2.5 components OM appears to be the most relevant contributor. This study may provide valuable insights into implementing preventive strategies for NAFLD."

 This study provides a comprehensive climatology of summer subtropical anticyclones (SAs) over Southwest Asia using daily ERA-Interim geopotential height data (1990–2019) across six pressure levels (900–100 hPa). Anticyclones were identified on 2760 summer days using combined objective and subjective methods, enabling a multi-level assessment of their frequency, spatial organization, preferred locations, vertical structure, seasonal evolution, and long-term variability. SAs are found throughout the atmospheric column, with maximum frequencies in the mid-troposphere and minimum occurrences near the surface. Distinct spatial modes emerge at different levels—bimodal at 500 hPa, trimodal at 700 hPa, and quadrimodal at 100–200 hPa—revealing finer spatial complexity than earlier climatologies. A key finding is a pronounced vertical seesaw pattern in seasonal occurrence: lower-tropospheric anticyclones peak in June but decline sharply in July, while mid- and upper-tropospheric anticyclones intensify. This indicates a coordinated vertical redistribution of anticyclonic activity during summer. Interlevel relationships exhibit strong coherence in the upper troposphere, whereas weaker correlations between adjacent lower and mid-tropospheric levels suggest level-dependent formation mechanisms and vertical tilt. Regionally, the study refines the characteristics of the Turkmenistan, Zagros, and Arabian anticyclones, highlighting the vertical continuity of the Arabian anticyclone and its sensitivity to surface thermal forcing. Long-term analysis reveals no significant meridional shifts but shows a notable increase in anticyclone frequency at 700 hPa, likely linked to recent warming over the Arabian Peninsula. Overall, the findings demonstrate the dynamical complexity of SAs across Southwest Asia and provide an updated framework for understanding their variability and climate relevance."

Reason,Observations of a dryline interacting with a back-building mesoscale convective system in the Kalahari region of southern Africa,"•High resolution observations captured the formation environment of a rare MCS in the Kalahari region of southern Africa. •TThe MCS persisted ∼13 h causing heavy rainfall that contributed two thirds of the DJF rainfall in parts of the region. •Back-building storm cells were triggered along a dryline that was transected earlier in the day by an instrumented vehicle. 
 A unique set of observations allows the analysis of the environment in which a back-building mesoscale convective system (MCS) developed along a dryline in the semi-arid southern Kalahari region of southern Africa during 28 and 29 December 2023. This MCS resulted in widespread rainfall, roughly equivalent to the December–February average, causing localized flooding and power failures. MCS development occurred along a dryline in a highly unstable, but weakly sheared environment. Near surface moisture gradients exceeded 6 g kg−1 100 km−1 in places on the dryline during morning and evening of 28 December but were weaker that afternoon. CAPE values exceeded 1000 J.kg−1 shortly after sunrise within the first 100 km of the moist side of the dryline and MU-CAPE exceeded 3000 J kg−1 at 08:00 and 12:00 UTC. Convection started adjacent to the dryline and once individual storm cells merged to form a MCS, new cells continued to develop along the dryline before being steered downstream by mid-level northwesterly winds. Back-building and a strong northeasterly low-level inflow contributed to renewed development along the storm's axis during the night-time, extending its lifespan to at least 13 h. These findings provide new insights into the contribution of MCSs to seasonal rainfall for the southern Kalahari region and a valuable example of mesoscale interactions between a dryline and individual storm cells at night."
