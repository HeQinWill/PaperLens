This work reveals potential overestimation on 236U releases from the Sellafield (SF) nuclear reprocessing plant (RP) by earlier estimations using shells. We report a 40-year time series dataset of uranium isotopes in seaweed seasonally collected in the Kattegat, downstream of radioactive discharges from the European RPs, namely La Hague (LH) and SF. Comparison between our measured 236U concentrations in seaweed and model-simulated values derived from 236U releases of LH and SF suggests that the previously reconstructed SF discharges may have nearly 1 order of magnitude overestimation. Such overestimation would introduce large uncertainties when 236U is used as a point source in environmental tracer applications and ocean model validation. We foresee that this work will significantly improve the applications of radioisotope tracers in oceanic studies such as the spreading of marine pollutants, ocean mixing, and circulation, especially in the regions of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans."

Evidence on the relationship between sociodemographic characteristics and OG well proximity is mixed. To investigate this question in Colorado, we combined OG location data with data on birthing people’s race-ethnicity and Medicaid eligibility from the state’s birth registry. We applied two OG proximity definitions: (1) living within 2,000 ft of an active well and (2) OG well density (inverse distance-weighted sum of wells within 2 miles). Our analysis includes people who gave birth between 2007 and 2017 and resided in one of seven OG-producing counties across three different OG basins. In the Denver-Julesburg basin (DJB), which accounted for 93% of the study sample, White and Medicaid ineligible people are more proximate than Hispanic and Medicaid eligible people. In some DJB counties, People of Color (non-Hispanic) are more proximate than Hispanic people. In the Piceance basin, White non-Hispanic people have higher proximity than Hispanic people, while Medicaid eligibility is associated with higher proximity. In the San Juan basin, Hispanic and Medicaid-eligible people were more proximate than White and Medicaid-ineligible people. Further research should examine differential exposure/proximity across other sensitive groups, and policies should pursue equal protection from OG well exposures."

This study investigated the occurrence and potential risks of antibiotics and their TPs in water along the Chaobai River in Beijing. We used high-resolution mass spectrometry and an integrated target, suspect, and nontarget screening approach to identify 21 parent antibiotics and 78 TPs among 90 water samples, with the majority from macrolides and sulfonamides. Notably, target quantification and machine-learning-assisted semiquantification revealed that the cumulative concentrations of TPs were higher than the cumulative concentrations of parent compounds, with average contributions of TPs ranging between 50.7 and 63.7%. Most downstream water samples were largely influenced by domestic sewage, as indicated by the significantly higher concentrations and proportions of TPs, as well as the greater diversity in their composition profiles compared to upstream and reservoir samples. Moreover, of the 78 TPs, 26.9, 67.9, and 6.4% exhibited greater persistence, mobility, or toxicity than their parent antibiotics, respectively. Sixteen macrolide TPs presented both greater ecological risks to aquatic organisms and higher resistance selection risks than their parent antibiotics. TPs contributed substantially to the overall antibiotic-related risks by an average of between 31.2 and 54.1%. This study highlights the occurrence of antibiotic TPs in river water, underscoring the need to consider TPs in comprehensive risk assessments of antibiotics."

However, they are easily affected by SO2 and deactivated in actual industrial waste gas or motor vehicle exhaust. Therefore, this review systematically summarizes the representative studies of gaseous pollutant catalytic oxidation over precious metal catalysts with SO2 exposure. First, the sulfur influence mechanisms, including sulfur poisoning and sulfur promotion, as well as the influence of reaction conditions, were discussed to analyze the interaction between SO2 and catalysts and its impact on catalyst properties. Based on the sulfur poisoning process, we further summarized the design strategies of sulfur-resistant catalysts: suppressing the adsorption of SO2 and promoting its desorption, inhibiting the formation of sulfates and facilitating their decomposition, and constructing sacrificial sites, which can be achieved by corresponding design methods: constructing a core–shell/confined structure, dopant modification, and adjusting structural and textural properties. Furthermore, we analyzed feasible catalyst regeneration methods, including N2/O2 atmosphere regeneration, reducing atmosphere-assisted regeneration, and washing regeneration. Finally, the challenges and prospects of the research were proposed, hoping to provide new perspectives on understanding sulfur poisoning processes and guide the design and regeneration of sulfur-resistant catalysts."

To revisit the possibility of urine as an input, data were compiled from 45 studies on SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the urine of 1924 COVID-19 patients. In general, the reporting quality was extremely low. The estimated pooled prevalence of urinary SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding is 11.3% (95% CI: 8.4–14.3), which roughly agrees with previous reviews. However, the 2-fold prediction interval and wide range of observed prevalences warrant careful consideration of the variability between studies. Among the eight studies reporting sufficient methodological details to estimate the volume of urine being assayed in a single PCR reaction (i.e., the equivalent sample volume, ESV), the RNA urinary shedding prevalence was normally distributed (r2 = 1.00) as a function of the ESV. The explanatory power of the ESV suggests the rarity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine could be a methodological artifact. The findings demonstrate that clinical studies designed for clinically relevant hypotheses could produce data subject to important biases relevant to assessing the feasibility of wastewater surveillance."

New analytical techniques will be required to distinguish between PFAS of different origins and to trace their transport through natural systems. This study assesses the stable carbon (δ13C) and sulfur (δ34S) isotopic signatures of PFAS from different sources. Bulk elemental analyzer-isotope ratio mass spectrometry and compound-specific gas chromatograph-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-IRMS) analytical methods were used to measure the δ13C and δ34S values of multiple PFAS compounds from various vendors and production lot numbers. PFAS originating from different vendors with different lot numbers and different PFAS species showed distinct δ13C isotopic values over a wide range of δ13C values (−52.8‰ to −26.9‰). Results indicate that GC-IRMS techniques could be utilized to determine the δ13C composition of PFAS present at concentrations typical of environmental samples. Coupling stable isotopic data with co-contaminant or isomer data could help to further differentiate PFAS sources. The development of new environmental forensics tools such as these will be necessary to elucidate the PFAS source and transport in natural systems and may inform remediation and pollution prevention protocols for PFAS."

In this work, a novel strategy for modifying 4,4′-(3′,4′,5′,6′-tetrakis(4-(pyridin-4-yl)phenyl)-[1,1′:2′,1″-terpheny]-4,4″-diyl)dipyridine (TPD) with varied alkyl chains to realize bright monomer and excimer emissions simultaneously and fine-tune their emission properties was proposed. The excimer emission was thoroughly characterized via regulating the concentration of the luminophore and the length of the alkyl chain. It was found that the monomer emission and excimer emission could be optionally designed via regulating alkyl chains. Benefiting from the excellent dual-mode emission characteristics, the hypersensitive and ultraselective analysis of perchlorate (ClO4–) in real water samples was performed due to the strong electrostatic interaction between ClO4– and luminophore triggered excimer emission. The limit of detection was down to 21 ng·g–1, which was a magnitude below the limit in drinking water set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (60 ng·g–1). Practical application showed the concentrations of ClO4– in construction wastewater samples were four-folds higher than the local river water. As a result, it is necessary to take control measures for ClO4– in construction wastewater. This study presents a reliable and convenient method for creating fluorescent probes toward target applications."

While aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS) combined with traditional source apportionment tools can accurately identify various OA sources, they face efficiency challenges when processing large volumes of long-term data. This study proposes an ensemble machine learning approach to efficiently apportion OA sources from long-term AMS measurements. Using six-year observation of a simplified version of AMS (i.e., ACSM) in the Paris region along with OA factor data derived from positive matrix factorization analysis, we developed an ensemble machine learning source apportionment model. Compared to individual machine learning algorithms, the ensemble model substantially reduced the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and increased the correlation coefficient in predicting OA sources by approximately 30% and 5%, respectively. Sensitivity analysis with five years of baseline data revealed that model performance relatively stabilizes when the training data exceeds two years, with RMSE values for primary and secondary OA factors at 0.31–0.45 μg/m3 and 0.69–0.84 μg/m3, respectively. This ensemble model not only enhances the efficiency of long-term OA source apportionment but also holds potential for near-real-time online applications."

However, the isotopic signatures of NOx emissions from heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDVs) remain poorly characterized. In this study, we conducted on-site tests on 18 on-road HDDVs with different emission standards in Shanghai under the condition of China World Transient Vehicle Cycle for trucks (C-WTVC). The average δ15N value under C-WTVC (−5.71 ± 2.60‰) was significantly higher than that in idle mode (−13.85 ± 1.97‰), which is attributed to the lower temperatures in the combustion chamber due to the lower engine output in idle mode, favoring the breakage of the lighter 14N14N molecules. The δ15N-NOx values under C-WTVC were significantly lower than those in driving mode in the United States, suggesting that δ15N values may be localized in isotope-based NOx source analysis. NOx emissions were reduced considerably with the upgrade of emission standards while δ15N-NOx levels showed an opposite trend. The NH3-selective catalytic reduction (SCR) reduced automobile NOx emissions by more than 50% and significantly enriched 15N relative to diesel-generated NOx. Indicated by the correlations between NOx emissions, δ15N-NOx, and cumulative mileage, the SCR de-NOx efficiency decreased linearly with the increase of cumulative mileage. Our results suggest that the routine maintenance and mandatory inspection of aged SCR systems should be strengthened. The distribution of provincial δ15N-NOx values of diesel vehicle emissions was established based on a weighted average model. The contribution of vehicle NOx emissions in typical megacities in China has been revisited by upgrading the δ15N-NOx values of diesel vehicles, demonstrating that the application of regional δ15N-NOx values of diesel vehicles can narrow the gap between isotope-based analysis and emission inventory. This study will enrich the NOx isotopic fingerprint database in China and minimize the uncertainty in isotope-based NOx source apportionment, helping to formulate air pollution prevention and control strategies."

Although there is high certainty that the induced field measured at Europa is attributed to a global‐scale subsurface ocean, there is still uncertainty around the possibility that the induced field measured at Callisto is evidence of an ocean. This uncertainty is due to the presence of a conductive ionosphere, which will also produce an induction signal in response to Jupiter's strong time‐varying magnetic field. Therefore, it is not yet known whether the observed induced field is attributable to the ionosphere, an ocean, or a combination of both. In this work, we use previously published simulations of Callisto's plasma interaction in combination with both an inverse and an ensemble forward modeling method to highlight the plausible range of interior properties of Callisto. We further constrain the ocean thickness and conductivity, ice shell thickness, and ionospheric conductivity that are required to explain the Galileo magnetometer observations. This is the first study to jointly consider all flybys to constrain the driving field and three flybys (C03, C09, and C10) to assess the induction response. Our results suggest that Callisto's response more likely arises from the combination of a thick conductive ocean and an ionosphere rather than from an ionosphere alone."

How carbon is incorporated into silicate melts at such high pressures has not been experimentally probed, making the nature of carbon in dense melts elusive. Here, our nuclear magnetic resonance experiments reveal how carbon and pressure influence the structure of mantle melts. The pressure‐driven changes in the Si coordination environments and network connectivity in dense melts are accompanied by a dramatic increase in the fraction of structurally bound carbonates above 8 GPa up to 14 GPa, further polymerizing melt networks. The pressure‐driven melt polymerization and increase in diversity in carbon configurations reveal the mechanisms behind the pressure‐induced propensity to store carbon in silicate melts under compression.

Without tuning, best agreement is found for mature sea states, with an average modeled to measured W $W$ ratio of 0.87. This ratio approaches unity with the introduction of a dissipation rate threshold value and an explicit wave‐age dependence.

The particle‐trapping flux tubes carry stronger ECH waves in the high‐harmonic bands, whereas the other category is usually accompanied only by fundamental‐mode waves. This distinction is largely attributed to the higher content of energetic electrons within the particle‐trapping flux tubes. These results improve our understanding of the association between injection flux tubes and the high‐band ECH waves therein, suggesting a unique role of particle‐trapping flux tubes in Saturnian magnetospheric dynamics."

 Autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are a genetically engineered therapy that is highly effective against B cell malignancies and multiple myeloma1. However, the length and cost of personalized manufacturing limits access and leaves patients vulnerable to disease progression. Allogeneic cell therapies have the potential to increase patient access and improve treatment outcomes but are limited by immune rejection2,3. To devise a strategy to protect allogeneic CAR T cells from host immune cells, we turned to lymphotropic viruses that have evolved integrated mechanisms for immune escape of virus-infected lymphocytes4. We find that viral evasins that partially reduce HLA class I expression can shelter CAR T cells from mismatched CD8+ T cells without triggering ‘missing-self’ rejection by NK cells. However, this protection alone is insufficient to sustain effective allogeneic CAR T cell therapy. HIV-1 Nef uniquely also acts through the serine-threonine kinase Pak2 to abate activation-induced cell death and promote survival of CAR T cells in vivo. Thus, virus-like immune escape can harness multiple mechanisms that act in concert to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of allogeneic CAR T cells."

 Chemicals inducing chemotaxis have been characterised for over 60 years across hundreds of publications. Without any synthesis of these scattered results, our current understanding of the molecules affecting prokaryotic behaviours is fragmented. Here, we examined 341 publications to assemble a comprehensive database of prokaryotic chemoeffectors, compiling the effect (attractant, repellent or neutral) of 926 chemicals previously tested and the chemotactic behaviour of 394 strains. Our analysis reveals that (i) not all chemical classes trigger chemotaxis equally, in particular, amino acids and benzenoids are much stronger attractants than carbohydrates; (ii) over one-quarter of attractants tested are not used for growth but solely act as chemotactic signals; (iii) the prokaryote’s origin matters, as terrestrial strains respond to 50% more chemicals than those originating from human or marine biomes; (iv) repellents affect cell behaviour at concentrations 10-fold higher than attractants; (v) the effect of large molecules and the behaviour of bacteria other than Proteobacteria have been largely overlooked.

 Platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to radical cystectomy is the preferred treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer despite modest survival benefit and significant associated toxicities. Here, we profile the global proteome of muscle-invasive bladder cancers pre- and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment using archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. We identify four pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy proteomic clusters with distinct biology and response to therapy and integrate these with transcriptomic subtypes and immunohistochemistry. We observe proteomic plasticity post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy that is associated with increased extracellular matrix and reduced keratinisation compared to pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy clusters appear to be differentially enriched for druggable proteins. For example, MTOR and PARP are over-expressed at the protein level in tumours identified as neuronal-like. In addition, we determine that high intra-tumoural proteome heterogeneity in pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy tissue is associated with worse prognosis. Our work highlights aspects of muscle-invasive bladder cancer biology associated with clinical outcomes and suggests biomarkers and therapeutic targets based on proteomic clusters.

Here, the authors identify copy number amplification of the role of FAD synthase enzyme (FLAD1) in TNBC and mechanistically demonstrate that this amplification drives tumorigenesis by increasing lipid metabolism via a FLAD1/LSD1/SREBP1 axis. 
 Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is known for frequent copy number alterations (CNAs) and metabolic reprogramming. However, the mechanism by which CNAs of metabolic genes drive distinct metabolic reprogramming and affect disease progression remains unclear. Through an integrated analysis of our TNBC multiomic dataset (n = 465) and subsequent experimental validation, we identify copy number amplification of the metabolic gene flavin-adenine dinucleotide synthetase 1 (FLAD1) as a crucial genetic event that drives TNBC progression. Mechanistically, FLAD1, but not its enzymatically inactive mutant, upregulates the enzymatic activity of FAD-dependent lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). LSD1 subsequently promotes the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) by demethylating dimethyl histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2). The upregulation of SREBP1 enhances the expression of lipid biosynthesis genes, ultimately facilitating the progression of TNBC. Clinically, pharmacological inhibition of the FLAD1/LSD1/SREBP1 axis effectively suppresses FLAD1-induced tumor progression. Moreover, LSD1 inhibitor enhances the therapeutic effect of doxorubicin and sacituzumab govitecan (SG). In conclusion, our findings reveal the CNA-derived oncogenic signalling axis of FLAD1/LSD1/SREBP1 and present a promising treatment strategy for TNBC.

 Carrier transport and recombination at the buried interface of perovskite have seriously restricted the further development of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, an interfacial dipolar chemical bridge strategy to address this issue is presented. 2-(Diphenylphosphino) acetic acid (2DPAA) is selected as the linker to reconstruct the interfacial dipole, which effectively enlarges the interfacial dipole moment to 5.10 D and optimizes to a positive dipole orientation, thereby accelerating vertical hole transport, suppressing nonradiative recombination and promoting the perovskite crystallization. The champion inverted device yields a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.53% (certified 26.02%). Moreover, this strategy is extended to the wide-bandgap perovskite and large-area devices, which delivers high PCEs of 22.02% and 24.11%, respectively. The optimized devices without encapsulation also demonstrate great long-term shelf and operational stability.

 Artificial neural networks have advanced due to scaling dimensions, but conventional computing struggles with inefficiencies due to memory bottlenecks. In-memory computing architectures using memristor devices offer promise but face challenges due to hardware non-idealities. This work proposes layer ensemble averaging—a hardware-oriented fault tolerance scheme for improving inference performance of non-ideal memristive neural networks programmed with pre-trained solutions. Simulations on an image classification task and hardware experiments on a continual learning problem with a custom 20,000-device prototyping platform show significant performance gains, outperforming prior methods at similar redundancy levels and overheads. For the image classification task with 20% stuck-at faults, accuracy improves from 40% to 89.6% (within 5% of baseline), and for the continual learning problem, accuracy improves from 55% to 71% (within 1% of baseline). The proposed scheme is broadly applicable to accelerators based on a variety of different non-volatile device technologies.

 The variation of transcriptome size across cell types significantly impacts single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data normalization and bulk RNA-seq cellular deconvolution, yet this intrinsic feature is often overlooked. Here we introduce ReDeconv, a computational algorithm that incorporates transcriptome size into scRNA-seq normalization and bulk deconvolution. ReDeconv introduces a scRNA-seq normalization approach, Count based on Linearized Transcriptome Size (CLTS), which corrects differential expressed genes typically misidentified by standard count per 10 K normalization, as confirmed by orthogonal validations. By maintaining transcriptome size variation, CLTS-normalized scRNA-seq enhances the accuracy of bulk deconvolution. Additionally, ReDeconv mitigates gene length effects and models expression variances, thereby improving deconvolution outcomes, particularly for rare cell types. Evaluated with both synthetic and real datasets, ReDeconv surpasses existing methods in precision. ReDeconv alters the practice and provides a new standard for scRNA-seq analyses and bulk deconvolution. The software packages and a user-friendly web portal are available.

Here, the authors use full-length Mpro protein as substrate and demonstrate that L50F can promote the formation of enzyme-substrate complex and thus contribute to nirmatrelvir resistance. 
 SARS-CoV-2 main protease, Mpro, is responsible for processing the viral polyproteins into individual proteins, including the protease itself. Mpro is a key target of anti-COVID-19 therapeutics such as nirmatrelvir (the active component of Paxlovid). Resistance mutants identified clinically and in viral passage assays contain a combination of active site mutations (e.g., E166V, E166A, L167F), which reduce inhibitor binding and enzymatic activity, and non-active site mutations (e.g., P252L, T21I, L50F), which restore the fitness of viral replication. To probe the role of the non-active site mutations in fitness rescue, here we use an Mpro triple mutant (L50F/E166A/L167F) that confers nirmatrelvir drug resistance with a viral fitness level similar to the wild-type. By comparing peptide and full-length Mpro protein as substrates, we demonstrate that the binding of Mpro substrate involves more than residues in the active site. Particularly, L50F and other non-active site mutations can enhance the Mpro dimer-dimer interactions and help place the nsp5-6 substrate at the enzyme catalytic center. The structural and enzymatic activity data of Mpro L50F, L50F/E166A/L167F, and others underscore the importance of considering the whole substrate protein in studying Mpro and substrate interactions, and offers important insights into Mpro function, resistance development, and inhibitor design.

 There is a growing demand for low-power, autonomously learning artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can be applied at the edge and rapidly adapt to the specific situation at deployment site. However, current AI models struggle in such scenarios, often requiring extensive fine-tuning, computational resources, and data. In contrast, humans can effortlessly adjust to new tasks by transferring knowledge from related ones. The concept of learning-to-learn (L2L) mimics this process and enables AI models to rapidly adapt with only little computational effort and data. In-memory computing neuromorphic hardware (NMHW) is inspired by the brain’s operating principles and mimics its physical co-location of memory and compute. In this work, we pair L2L with in-memory computing NMHW based on phase-change memory devices to build efficient AI models that can rapidly adapt to new tasks. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach in two scenarios: a convolutional neural network performing image classification and a biologically-inspired spiking neural network generating motor commands for a real robotic arm. Both models rapidly learn with few parameter updates. Deployed on the NMHW, they perform on-par with their software equivalents. Moreover, meta-training of these models can be performed in software with high-precision, alleviating the need for accurate hardware models.

With rich scenarios of policy mixes, the authors demonstrate that in most cases these interactions will delay the achievement of carbon targets in China. 
 The achievement of China’s carbon neutrality is crucial for the 1.5 °C target of the Paris Agreement and must involve the implementation of various mitigation policies. However, these efforts are hindered by poor knowledge of the interactions between policies. Here we use a dynamic computable general equilibrium model of China (CEEGE model) and create a policy portfolio area of 1,295 scenarios covering four major mitigation strategies (carbon pricing, energy efficiency, renewable energy and electrification of end uses). When the interactions between mitigation policies are considered, the percentage of scenarios in which the carbon neutrality target is reached by 2060 decreases by 84%, with the years in which these scenarios are achieved being delayed by 5–6 years. Only the combinations with renewable energy and electrification of end uses generate synergetic effects on both economic and mitigation impacts. Our work can inform the formulation of more efficient mitigation policy portfolios by emphasizing policy interactions. Various policy instruments are proposed to meet mitigation targets, yet the synergistic and trade-off effects of interactions are less understood. With rich scenarios of policy mixes, the authors demonstrate that in most cases these interactions will delay the achievement of carbon targets in China."

 Wind erosion and resulting dust negatively impact the environment and society, but there has been no comprehensive assessment of costs to the United States since the 1990s. Climate and society have changed greatly since then, including changing dustiness, spiking Valley fever infections and increased renewable energy use. By adopting published estimates and calculating emerging costs, we estimate that wind erosion and dust in the United States cost $154.4 billion annually (2017 value). This estimate quadruples the previous assessment and is higher than most other US weather and climate disasters. We also discovered many costs associated with wind erosion that are not accounted for. Our estimate, while conservative, reveals that the economic burden of wind erosion is substantial and investment in dust mitigation could yield large economic benefits.

 Marine net primary production supports critical ecosystem services and the carbon cycle. However, the lack of consensus in the direction and magnitude of projected change in net primary production from models undermines efforts to assess climate impacts on marine ecosystems with confidence. Here we use contemporary remote sensing net primary production trends (1998–2023) from six remote sensing algorithms to discriminate amongst fifteen divergent model projections. A model ranking scheme, based on the similarity of linear responses of net primary production to changes in sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a and the mixed layer, finds that future declines in net primary production are more likely than presently predicted. Even the best ranking models still underestimate the sensitivity of declines in net primary production to ocean warming, suggesting shortcomings remain. Reproducing this greater temperature sensitivity may lead to even larger declines in future net primary production than presently considered for impact assessment. Earth system models underestimate the decline in net primary productivity associated with ocean warming, meaning future net primary productivity decline is more likely than currently estimated, according to a ranking of Earth system models using remote sensing data."

 One of the most challenging aspects of climate change mitigation today is not identifying solutions but reaching political leaders with climate scientists’ existing solutions. Although there is substantial research on climate change communication, research rarely focuses on one of the most impactful groups: policymakers. It is essential to test theoretically sound methods to increase lawmakers’ attention to research evidence. In a series of four rapid-cycle randomized controlled email trials (N = 6642–7620 per trial), we test three common and theoretically derived advocacy tactics to increase U.S. policymaker engagement with a climate change fact sheet sent via email (i.e., a norms manipulation, a number focused manipulation, and emotional language manipulation). In all four trials, the control message increased engagement more than messages using advocacy tactics, measured by fact sheet clicks. This demonstrates the importance of testing communication methods within the appropriate populations, especially a population with considerable influence over climate policy.

 The real-time detection and analysis of seismic signals is crucial in geophysics research, especially when it comes to monitoring catastrophic events. We present an evolutionary deep learning method that yields a model named MCU-Quake. This model encodes the discrimination process as a single numerical value, offering interpretability with only 2693 parameters. Trained on raw seismic waveforms from Utah, USA, MCU-Quake demonstrates its generalization capability across a global natural earthquake dataset. Notably, the model effectively identifies typical explosions during the Russia-Ukraine war in Europe. The knowledge to discriminate between ambient noise, explosions and natural earthquakes can be represented by values of −5.01 (std: 1.14), 1.96 (std: 0.36), 1.01 (std: 0.49), respectively. The model can be deployed on Internet of Things (IoT) devices, including most microcontrollers, which are constrained by limited computational resources (kilo-bytes of memory) and energy consumption (micro-Watts).

However, learning the simulated Hamiltonian, a prerequisite for any quantitative applications of a quantum simulator, remains an outstanding challenge due to the fast increasing time cost with the qubit number and the lack of high-fidelity universal gate operations in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. Here, we demonstrate the Hamiltonian learning of a two-dimensional ion trap quantum simulator with 300 qubits. We use global manipulations and single-qubit–resolved state detection to efficiently learn the all-to-all–coupled Ising model Hamiltonian, with the required quantum resources scaling at most linearly with the qubit number. We further demonstrate a physically guided learning scheme with the quantum sample complexity independent of system sizes by carefully fitting the anharmonic trap potential. Our work paves the way for wide applications of large-scale ion trap quantum simulators."

To form this link, we performed simultaneous electrophysiology and two-photon calcium imaging through transparent NeuroGrids and mapped touch-evoked traveling waves and underlying microcircuit dynamics. In awake mice, both passive and active whisker touch elicited traveling waves within and across barrels, with a fast early component followed by a late wave that lasted hundreds of milliseconds poststimulus. Notably, late waves were modulated by perceived value and predicted behavioral choice in a two-whisker discrimination task. We found that the late wave feature was (i) modulated by motor feedback, (ii) differentially engaged a sparse ensemble reactivation pattern across layer 2/3, which a balanced-state network model reconciled via feedback-induced inhibitory stabilization, and (iii) aligned to regenerative layer 5 apical dendritic Ca2+events.

In vitro recapitulation of islet biology and therapeutic islet transplantation both require adequate vascularization, which remains a challenge. Using human reprogrammed vascular ECs (R-VECs), human islets were functionally vascularized in vitro, demonstrating responsive, dynamic glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and Ca2+influx. Subcutaneous transplantation of islets with R-VECs reversed hyperglycemia in diabetic mice, with high levels of human insulin detected within recipient serum and relapses of hyperglycemia following graft removal. Examination of retrieved grafts demonstrated that engrafted human islets were mainly vascularized by the cotransplanted R-VECs, which had anastomosed with the host microcirculation. Notably, single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed that R-VECs, when cocultured with islets, acquired islet EC-specific characteristics. Together, R-VECs establish an adaptable vascular niche that supports islet homeostasis both in vitro and in vivo."

However, directly observing the energy release facilitated by fluctuating individual enzymes remains a challenge, leading to a contentious debate regarding the underlying reasons for this phenomenon. Here, we aim to overcome this challenge by developing an oscillating nanomotor powered by a single-molecule enzyme, which allows real-time tracking of energy transduction in enzymatic reactions. Through analysis of the shifts in free energy profiles within the nanomotors, our results unveil not only the heterogeneous energy release patterns of individual enzyme molecules but also the dynamic disorder of a particular enzyme in energy release over extended monitoring periods. By exploring six distinct types of single-molecule enzymatic reactions, we provide the direct evidence supporting the argument that the reaction enthalpy governs the enzymatic energy release. This approach has implications for understanding the mechanism of enzymatic catalysis and developing highly efficient nanomotors."

Here, we design a class of selectively fluorinated aromatic lithium salts (SFALS) as single conducting lithium salts to regulate the solvation structure and interfacial chemistry for all-solid-state lithium metal batteries. By tuning the anionic structure, the Li+-polyether coupling is weakened, and the Li+-anion coordination is enhanced. The hydrogen bonding between the SFALS and polymer matrix induces a special “triad”-type solvation structure, which improves the electrolyte homogeneity and mechanical strength, and promotes the formation of an ultrathin and robust Li2O-rich solid electrolyte interphase. Therefore, the stable cycling of more than 1650 cycles (Coulombic efficiency, 99.8%) for LiFePO4/Li half cells and 580 cycles (97.4% capacity retention) for full cells is achieved. This molecular engineering strategy could inspire further advancements of functional lithium salts for practical application of all-solid-state lithium metal batteries."

However, high sensitivity of crystallization on the substrate and the intrinsic brittleness usually trade off the performance of f-PSCs. Herein, we introduced an initiator-free cross-linkable monomer (2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yl) 5-(dithiolan-3-yl)pentanoate (FTA), which can chemically passivate defects and enable real-time fine regulation of crystallization. The resulting perovskite film exhibited higher crystallinity, enlarged grain size, and reduced dependence on the substrate. In addition, the cross-linked FTA [CL(FTA)] distributed along the grain boundaries effectively released the residual stress and securely bound the grains together. Consequently, the CL(FTA)-modified flexible PSCs achieved a record-breaking efficiency of 24.64% (certified 24.08%). Moreover, the scalable potential has been verified by the corresponding rigid and flexible modules, delivering impressive efficiencies of 19.53 and 17.13%, respectively.

Identifying long-term trends in rat numbers and how they are shaped by environmental changes is critical for understanding their ecology, and projecting future vulnerabilities and mitigation needs. Here, we use public complaint and inspection data from 16 cities around the world to estimate trends in rat populations. Eleven of 16 cities (69%) had significant increasing trends in rat numbers, including Washington D.C., New York, and Amsterdam. Just three cities experienced declines. Cities experiencing greater temperature increases over time saw larger increases in rats. Cities with more dense human populations and more urbanization also saw larger increases in rats. Warming temperatures and more people living in cities may be expanding the seasonal activity periods and food availability for urban rats.

Seeding of the urinary tract from this intestinal reservoir likely contributes to UTI recurrence (rUTI) rates. Thus, understanding the factors that promote UPEC intestinal colonization is of critical importance to designing therapeutics to reduce rUTI incidence. AlthoughE. coliis found in high abundance in large intestine mucus, little is known about how it is able to maintain residence in this continuously secreted hydrogel. We discovered that the FimH adhesin of type 1 pili (T1P) bound throughout the secreted mucus layers of the colon and to epithelial cells in mouse and human samples. Disruption of T1P led to reduced association with colon mucus. Notably, this mutant up-regulated flagellar production and infiltrated the protective inner mucus layer of the colon. This could explain how UPEC resists being washed off by the continuously secreted mucus layers of the colon."

The capacity to damage the phagosomal membrane has emerged as central to Mtb virulence. While Mtb factors driving membrane damage have been described, host factors that maintain phagosomal integrity or repair Mtb-induced damage to contain the pathogen remain largely unknown. We used a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify host factors required to repair Mtb-damaged phagosomal membranes. Vacuolar protein sorting–associated protein 18 (VPS18), a member of the HOPS and CORVET trafficking complexes, was among the top hits. VPS18 colocalized with Mtb in macrophages beginning shortly after infection, andVPS18-knockout macrophages demonstrated increased damage of Mtb-containing phagosomes without impaired autophagy. Mtb grew more robustly inVPS18-knockout cells, and the first-line antituberculosis antibiotic pyrazinamide was less effective. Our results identify VPS18 as required for phagosomal membrane integrity in Mtb-infected cells and suggest that modulating phagosome integrity may hold promise for improving the efficacy of antibiotic treatment for TB."

Hybrid density functional approximations, which average exact exchange admixtures empirically, have achieved success but fall short of high-level quantum chemistry accuracy due to delocalization errors. We propose adaptive hybrid functionals, generating optimal exact exchange admixture ratios on the fly using data-efficient quantum machine learning models with negligible overhead. The adaptive Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof hybrid density functional (aPBE0) improves energetics, electron densities, and HOMO-LUMO gaps in QM9, QM7b, and GMTKN55 benchmark datasets. A model uncertainty-based constraint reduces the method smoothly to PBE0 in extrapolative regimes, ensuring general applicability with limited training. By tuning exact exchange fractions for different spin states, aPBE0 effectively addresses the spin gap problem in open-shell systems such as carbenes. We also present a revised QM9 (revQM9) dataset with more accurate quantum properties, including stronger covalent binding, larger bandgaps, more localized electron densities, and larger dipole moments."
