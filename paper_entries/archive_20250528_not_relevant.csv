Erickson;Shun-Rong Zhang;David McGaw;Terrence Kovacs,Tracking traveling ionospheric disturbances through Doppler-shifted AM radio transmissions,"Traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) are manifestations of atmospheric waves that are significant for the transfer of energy and momentum between atmospheric layers and regions. This work demonstrates that velocities and directions of TIDs can be measured by monitoring the tiny shift in frequency of AM radio signals when they reflect from a moving ionosphere and that this method can be scaled to use large numbers of radio receivers and transmitters to monitor TIDs on a continental scale. 
 Six specialized radio receivers were developed to measure the Doppler shift of amplitude modulation (AM) broadcast radio carrier signals due to ionospheric effects. Five were deployed approximately in a circle at a one-hop distance from an 810 kHz clear-channel AM transmitter in Schenectady, New York, and the sixth was located close to the transmitter, providing a reference recording. Clear-channel AM signals from New York City and Connecticut were also received. The experiment confirmed detection of traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) and measurement of their horizontal phase velocities through monitoring variations in the Doppler shift of reflected AM signals imparted by vertical motions of the ionosphere. Comparison of 12 events with simultaneous global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based TID measurements showed generally good agreement between the two techniques slightly more than half the time and substantial differences slightly less than half the time, with differences attributable to differing sensitivities of the techniques to wave altitude and characteristics within a complex wave environment. Detected TIDs had mostly southward phase velocities, and in four cases they were associated with auroral disturbances that could plausibly be their sources. A purely automated software technique for event detection and phase velocity measurement was developed and applied to 1 year of data, revealing that AM Doppler sounding is much more effective when using transmitter signals in the upper part of the AM band (above 1 MHz) and demonstrating that the AM Doppler technique has promise to scale to large numbers of receivers covering continent-wide spatial scales."

Here, we describe multiple field datasets and a detailed habitat classification map for the Lena Delta. We present context and methods of these openly available datasets and show how they can improve our understanding of the rapidly changing Arctic tundra system. 
 The Lena Delta is the largest river delta in the Arctic (about 30 000 km2) and prone to rapid changes due to climate warming, associated cryosphere loss, and ecological shifts. The delta is characterized by ice-rich permafrost landscapes and consists of geologically and geomorphologically diverse terraces covered with tundra vegetation and of active floodplains, featuring approximately 6500 km of channels and over 30 000 lakes. Because of its broad landscape and habitat diversity, the delta is a biodiversity hotspot with high numbers of nesting and breeding migratory birds, fish, caribou, and other mammals and was designated a State Nature Reserve in 1995. Characterizing plant composition, aboveground biomass, and application of field spectroscopy was a major focus of a 2018 expedition to the delta. These field data collections were linked to Sentinel-2 satellite data to upscale local patterns in land cover and associated habitats to the entire delta. Here, we describe multiple field datasets collected in the Lena Delta during summer 2018 including foliage projective cover (Shevtsova et al., 2025, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.935875), aboveground biomass (Shevtsova et al., 2023, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.956067; Shevtsova et al., 2023, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.935923), and hyperspectral field measurements (Runge et al., 2022, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.945982). We further describe a detailed Sentinel-2 satellite image-based classification of habitats for the central Lena Delta (Landgraf et al., 2025a, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.945057; Landgraf et al., 2025b, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.945056; Landgraf et al., 2025c, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.945055; Landgraf et al., 2025d, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.945054), an upscaled classification for the entire Lena Delta (Lisovski et al., 2022, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.946407), and the test data set for accuracy assessment (Heim et al., 2025, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14731823) and a synthesis product for disturbance regimes (Heim and Lisovski, 2023, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7575691) in the delta that is based on the classification, the described datasets, and field expertise. We present context and detailed methods of these openly available datasets and show how their combined use can improve our understanding of the rapidly changing Arctic tundra system. The new Lena Delta habitat classification represents a first baseline against which future observations can be compared. The link between such detailed habitat classifications and disturbance regime may provide a better understanding of how Arctic lowland landscapes will respond to climate change and how this will impact land surface processes."

The average MAGT15 m of the QTP permafrost was −1.85 °C, with 90 % of the values ranging from −5.1 to −0.1 °C and 51.2 % exceeding −1.5 °C. The data can serve as a crucial boundary condition for deeper permafrost assessments and a reference for model simulations. 
 Ground temperature at a fixed depth is a crucial boundary condition for understanding the properties of deep permafrost. However, the commonly used mean annual ground temperature at the depth of the zero annual amplitude (MAGTDZAA) has certain limitations for extensive application due to large spatial heterogeneity at observed depths. In this study, we utilized 231 borehole records of mean annual ground temperature at a depth of 15 m (MAGT15 m) from 2010 to 2019 and employed a method of support vector regression (SVR) to predict the gridded MAGT15 m at a spatial resolution of nearly 1 km across the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau (QTP). The SVR model predictions demonstrated an R2 value of 0.48 with a negligible negative overestimation (−0.01 °C). The average MAGT15 m of the QTP permafrost was −1.85 ± 1.58 °C, with 90 % of the values ranging from −5.1 to −0.1 °C and 51.2 % greater than −1.5 °C. The ground surface freezing degree day (FDD) was the most significant predictor (p<0.001) of MAGT15 m, followed by the ground surface thawing degree day (TDD), mean annual precipitation (MAP), and soil bulk density (BD) (p<0.01). Overall, the MAGT15 m increased from northwest to southeast and decreased with rising elevation. Lower MAGT15 m values prevail in high mountainous areas with steep slopes. The MAGT15 m was lowest in the headwater areas of the Amu Darya, Indus, and Tarim river basins (−2.9 to −2.7 °C) and highest in the headwater areas of the Yangtze and Yellow river basins (−0.9 to −0.8 °C). The baseline dataset of the MAGT15 m for the QTP permafrost regions during 2010–2019 will facilitate simulations of deep permafrost characteristics and provide fundamental data for permafrost model validation and improvement.

We developed a 1995–2023 dataset that enhances satellite-based plant activity measurements by resolving data inconsistencies and improving resolution. Using advanced modeling, we harmonized signals from multiple satellites, cutting errors by 45 %. This offers clearer global photosynthesis trends, aiding climate research and vegetation monitoring. 
 Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a crucial proxy of photosynthetic processes in vegetation. In recent decades, advancements in remote sensing technology have facilitated long-term global SIF monitoring, significantly enhancing our understanding of vegetation dynamics on a global scale. Despite this progress, current SIF datasets face major challenges, including temporal inconsistencies among various satellite-derived products and a lack of long-term, high-resolution observations. In this study, we developed a “Long-term Harmonized SIF” (LHSIF) dataset spanning 1995 to 2023 with a fine spatial resolution of 0.05° by coordinating SIF satellite observations from GOME, SCIAMACHY, GOME-2, and OCO-2. Light use efficiency (LUE)-based spatial downscaling models were employed for each SIF product to generate fine-resolution global SIF maps. The long-term dataset was constructed using temporally corrected GOME-2A SIF (TCSIF) as a benchmark and was combined with a moment-matching normalization method for far-red SIF harmonization across satellite sensors from GOME, SCIAMACHY, and OCO-2. The resulting harmonization dataset exhibits a 45 % reduction in overall error and a stable interannual increase (0.42 ± 0.13 % yr⁻¹) compared with a fluctuating decline (−0.57 ± 0.27 % yr⁻¹) of the original observations. This result strongly aligns with the growth rate of gross primary production (GPP, 0.47 ± 0.03 % yr-1) and is consistent with ground-based SIF observations (R > 0.60). Therefore, the long-term harmonized SIF dataset with a fine 0.05° resolution is a valuable tool for estimating global photosynthesis over extended periods.

The dataset combines traditional microscopy-based phytoplankton counts with zooplankton data (abundances) obtained from digitized images using the ZooScan imaging system, along with surface and bottom temperature and salinity measurements. Sampling was conducted seasonally along two main transects and three coastal stations, capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics of plankton communities. Phytoplankton was identified at the species level by the same taxonomist during all the time-series (573 taxa in total). From their individual images, zooplankton was automatically sorted into 103 taxonomic and morphological groups, validated by an expert, and compiled into a data table allowing both community and individual approaches using abundances and biovolumes at both individual and community levels. Individual zooplankton images have also been made available for further morphometric analyses. This 14-year long, spatially and temporally resolved zooplankton imaging dataset is part of an ongoing effort to enhance the availability of zooplankton imaging data, locally and globally.

To help predict how wildfires will change in future, global fire models are being developed. We analyze and further develop one such model, SPITFIRE. Our work identifies and corrects sources of substantial bias in the model that are important to the global fire modelling field. With this analysis and these developments, we help to provide a basis for future improvements. 
 Since its development in 2010, the SPITFIRE global fire model has had a substantial impact on the field of fire modelling using dynamic global vegetation models. It includes process-based representations of fire dynamics, including ignitions, fire spread, and fire effects, resulting in a holistic representation of fire on a global scale. Previously, work had been undertaken to understand the strengths and weaknesses of SPITFIRE and similar models by comparing their outputs against remotely sensed data. We seek to augment this work with new validation methods and extend it by completing a thorough review of the theory underlying the SPITFIRE model to better identify and understand sources of modelling uncertainty. We find several points of improvement in the model, the most impactful being an incorrect implementation of the Rothermel fire spread model that results in large positive biases in fire rate of spread and a live grass moisture parametrization that results in unrealistically dry grasses. The combination of these issues leads to excessively large and intense fires, particularly on the dry modelled grasslands. Because of the tall flames present in these intense fires, which can cause substantial damage to tree crowns, these issues bias SPITFIRE toward high tree mortality. We resolve these issues by correcting the implementation of the Rothermel model and implementing a new live grass moisture parametrization, in addition to several other improvements, including a multi-day fire spread algorithm, and evaluate these changes in the European domain. Our model developments allow SPITFIRE to incorporate more realistic live grass moisture content and result in more accurate burnt area on grasslands and reduced tree mortality. This work provides a crucial improvement to the theoretical basis of the SPITFIRE model and a foundation upon which future model improvements may be built. In addition, this work further supports these model developments by  highlighting areas in the model where high amounts of uncertainty remain, based on new analysis and existing knowledge about the SPITFIRE model, and by identifying potential means of mitigating them to a greater extent."

In this work, we propose a statistical model to describe the most likely background level and the associated uncertainty in a network of dose rate detectors. We train, verify, and validate the model using real environmental data. Using the model, we show that we can correctly predict the background level in a subset of the detector network during a known anomalous event. 
 Detector networks that measure environmental radiation serve as radiological surveillance and early warning networks in many countries across Europe and beyond. Their goal is to detect anomalous radioactive signatures that indicate the release of radionuclides into the environment. Often, the background ambient dose equivalent rate H˙*(10) is predicted using meteorological information. However, in dense detector networks, the correlation between different detectors is expected to contain markedly more information. In this work, we investigate how the joint observations by neighbouring detectors can be leveraged to predict the background H˙*(10). Treating it as a stochastic vector, we show that its distribution can be approximated as multivariate normal. We reframe the question of background prediction as a Bayesian inference problem including priors and likelihood. Finally, we show that the conditional distribution can be used to make predictions. To perform the inferences we use PyMC. All inferences are performed using real data for the nuclear sites in Doel and Mol, Belgium. We validate our calibrated model on previously unseen data. Application of the model to a case with known anomalous behaviour – observations during the operation of Belgian Reactor 1 (BR1) in Mol – highlights the relevance of our method for anomaly detection and quantification."

Decline in density of symbionts caused mortality events in symbiotic organisms; however, giant clams appear to exhibit prior survival capacity against these detrimental effects. It remains unclear whether giant clams can mitigate the adverse impacts of bleaching. Herein, we found that bleaching events after chronic heat stress induce remarkable changes and remodeling in symbiotic tissue of the giant clam Tridacna crocea. The density and structure of unique muscle fibers with high collagen content, observed in siphonal mantle of these animals, were negatively altered after heat stress. These changes were associated with a metabolic shift from carbohydrates and fatty acids to amino acids as the breakdown of collagen-rich muscle fibers can partially compensate for energy loss during bleaching. Such a shift was proposed to be regulated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling and FoxO-atrogin pathways. Overall, our study highlights a pro-survival mechanism in giant clams through plastic regulation, which likely contributes to their relatively high environmental resilience during bleaching."

A previously overlooked pathway for BP degradation and HO• formation was newly identified.

In contrast, excessive oxidative stress (600 ppm of NaClO) reduced bacteria and phage diversity, disrupted antioxidant responses, and increased microbial sensitivity. Hydraulic stress predominantly influenced viral diversity and co-occurrence network topology, favoring the expansion of broad host-range phages and lysogenic lifestyles under combined stresses. Phage–bacterium interaction analyses highlighted phages’ adaptive preferences for hosts with high network centrality and broad ecological niches, which enhanced microbial interactions and resilience. Transcriptomic profiling demonstrated the early enrichment of genes associated with energy metabolism, ROS detoxification, and biofilm formation, followed by stabilization as biofilms matured. Phage-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes were involved in DNA repair, QS, and EPS biosynthesis, contributing to microbial adaptation through oxidative stress resistance and biofilm stabilization. Overall, these findings provide mechanistic insights into biofouling dynamics and highlight the need to optimize chlorine dosing to prevent suboptimal levels of microbial adaptation and biofouling."

Germicidal UV-C irradiation effectively inactivates spores suspended in water, yet information on surface spore mitigation is surprisingly absent. We show the effectiveness of 265–275 nm UV-C light to mitigateAspergillus nigeron nutrient-rich surfaces. UV-C mitigation of surface molds differs from inactivating spores suspended in water due to the unique characteristics of mycelial structures. Complete preinactivation of all viable cells during UV-C exposure is crucial to prevent mycelia formation; otherwise, even a single spore can gradually spread, covering surfaces by producing a progressive mycelial structure. A UV-C dose of 144 mJ/cm2 from 265 nm LEDs achieved complete preinactivation at lower concentrations (100–1000 CFU/plate), while higher concentrations required increased UV-C doses. Intermittent duty cycling of light delivery (10 min ON then 50 min OFF) at 275 nm delivered from side-emitting optical fibers achieved comparable mitigation to continuous irradiation. Insufficient UV-C exposure induced more resistant mycelial structures that shielded live spores beneath. This study highlights complete preinactivation of viable molds, or sustained inhibition by UV-C light, is more effective than UV-C posttreatment. Mycelial alteration triggered by sublethal stress helps spores to persist in unfavorable environments, where microbial control is the goal."

We analyzed the lung tissues for the first time and the intestinal contents of 11 dead finless porpoises (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis) to assess the intake of microplastics from prey and atmospheric sources. The lung tissues and intestinal contents contained average concentrations of 0.14 ± 0.11 MPs/g and 0.35 ± 0.36 MPs/g, respectively. Microplastics found in the lung tissues and intestinal contents were similar in physical characteristics (e.g., fragment shape, transparent to white color, and size <100 μm). On the other hand, they differed in the polymer types, with a higher proportion of epoxy-type microplastics in the lungs. Epoxy is a highly hazardous polymer according to the polymer hazard index, and in the present study, the lung tissues had a higher plastic hazard index than the intestinal contents. Hence, the respiratory system is more vulnerable to microplastic pollution from atmospheric sources than the digestive system is from water and food intake.

The results further point to food contact material and industrial processing as possible contamination sources. Compared with previous studies of ABFs, NPBFs generally showed higher contamination levels, leading to a higher dietary exposure in a vegan diet scenario. While the adult population is not at immediate risk following NPBF consumption, based on these results, a direct replacement of all ABFs with NPBFs is not recommended.

As filter-feeding organisms, marine mussels are particularly vulnerable to microplastics. Moreover, phthalic acid esters (PAEs) are known to leach from microplastics under various environmental conditions. Among PAEs, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a common endocrine disruptor. We investigated the effects of microplastics and plasticizers on the reproductive function of the female mussel Mytilus coruscus. The results revealed that environmental exposure to DEHP and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) triggered molecular changes by allowing DEHP to act as an antiestrogen by binding with estrogen receptors (ER), thereby constituting the molecular initiating event. Key events were the suppression of ER, cytochrome P450–3 (CYP3), and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD) gene expressions, which reduced estradiol and progesterone levels in ovarian tissues. Ultimately adverse outcomes occurred: antioxidant capacity in ovarian tissue was impaired, hindering ovarian development and reducing reproductive function. This study introduces a novel adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework focusing on reproductive impairment in shellfish. By integrating experimental findings with the AOP concept, the research provides essential data for understanding the toxicological effects of microplastic pollutants on mussels.

MCCP exposure induced chromatin condensation in the nucleus and mitochondria vacuolization of ovarian granulosa cells in rats and significantly increased the levels of serum gonadotropins and sex hormones, while reducing gonadotropin-releasing hormone levels. Transcriptomics analysis of ovaries revealed a predominant effect of MCCPs on the cell cycle, oocyte meiosis, and DNA damage repair pathways. Moreover, dual-omics integrative analysis indicated significant disturbance of steroid hormone biosynthesis caused by MCCPs, as well as amino acid metabolism related to TCA cycle. Furthermore, in vitro assays demonstrated that MCCP exposure disrupts intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and generates reactive oxygen species, ultimately leading to DNA damage.

In spite of extensive research on homogeneous Hg0 oxidation, universal accurate prediction models and unified explanations are lacking. In this study, for the first time, quantitative prediction models were developed for the Hg0 oxidation percentage with machine learning (ML) using flue gas compositions and operating conditions as inputs. Gradient boosting regression models showed optimal performance (test R2 ≥ 0.85). ML-aided feature analysis results exhibited that Cl2, HCl, Hg0, temperature, and HBr were the top five critical factors affecting mercury homogeneous oxidation. Halogen gas promoted Hg0 oxidation at temperatures around 250 °C, while Hg0, SO2, and quench rates were not conducive to Hg0 oxidation.

In particular, we observe that the majority of indoor VOCs originate from unoccupied spaces, demonstrating temperature-dependent release from indoor surface reservoirs. The total indoor-to-outdoor VOC emission rates varied from 53 to 2300 mg day–1 (median 230 mg day–1) during unoccupied periods, influenced by both the air exchange rate and indoor temperature. Reanalysis of literature data from various building studies worldwide corroborates our findings and reveals that indoor-to-outdoor emissions scale with room volume, with an average emission rate of 0.33 ± 0.03 mg h–1 m–3. Our study implies that indoor-to-outdoor emissions significantly contribute to urban VOC levels, rivaling traditional urban sources, e.g., power generation and biomass burning.

We found that the land occupation of renewable energy infrastructure resulted in global biodiversity loss equivalent amounting to 19 × 10–4 global pdf in 2015. Severe biodiversity loss was concentrated primarily in densely populated and economically advanced countries, such as China, the United States, Brazil, India, Australia, Russia, and countries across Western Europe.

Through nontargeted screening, over 5000 features (ESI+) were initially detected, but our workflow’s prioritization based on androgenic activity prediction reduced the number of features requiring further analysis by over 95%, significantly streamlining the workload. In addition, the semiquantitative nontarget analysis allowed for the calculation of the contribution of an identified compound to the total activity of the sample without the need for reference standards. While this contribution was low (∼4.3%) and applicable to only one compound (1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dione), it presents the first approach for calculating such contributions without relying on standards.

However, as a crucial component in high-performance PSCs, highly toxic lead may leak from discarded PSCs and cause environmental and health risks. Implementing the effective recovery of lead from discarded PSCs is crucial for the sustainable development of the PSC industry. Existing lead recovery methods commonly use toxic organic solvents as leaching reagents, i.e., dimethyl formamide and dimethyl sulfoxide, impeding the potential application of recycling technologies. This study proposes a facile ultrasonic water leaching technique for effectively recovering lead from the glass substrate of discarded PSCs. During the ultrasonic water leaching process, the perovskite layer undergoes rapid degradation, generating PbI2. Most of the PbI2 dissolves in the water, yielding a leaching solution containing a low lead concentration, while a minor fraction is converted into insoluble Pb(OH)I particles. The cumulative Pb removal ratio from the first two cycles of ultrasonic water leaching processes can reach 99.84%.

The ovary is the major female reproductive organ and is considered a potential target organ for pesticide toxicity. This comprehensive Review examines the adverse effects of pesticide exposure on the ovary based on evidence from human biomonitoring, epidemiological studies, and toxicological studies. Epidemiological studies have shown that pesticide exposures are associated with early/delayed menarche, menstrual cycle disorders, early menopause, long time to pregnancy, polycystic ovary syndrome, primary ovarian insufficiency, infertility, and implantation failure in women. Both in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that exposure to pesticides disrupts the estrous cycle, reduces the follicle pool, alters hormone levels, and impairs oocyte maturation. Mechanisms of action of pesticides on ovarian function include effects on steroid receptors, hormone synthesis, oxidative stress, inflammation, epigenetic modifications, and signaling pathways. Gaps in knowledge and further research needs include prospective cohort studies with adequate sample sizes to elucidate the effects of different classes of pesticides (especially emerging insecticides, herbicides and fungicides) and mixture exposures on ovarian health, the development of effective toxicological models that can approximate or simulate realistic human exposure scenarios, and the translation of toxicological findings into measurable indicators that can be used in human health risk assessment. In summary, this Review aims to improve the understanding of the risk to women’s reproductive health from exposures to pesticides and to provide insights into strategies for preventing and managing reproductive health risks."

In this study, domestic chicken and environmental samples collected near a BFR manufacturing zone were analyzed to determine the bioaccumulation and transfer of HBCDs and TBBPA. The mean concentrations of ∑3HBCDs, TBBPA, ∑4TBBPA-related derivatives, ∑9TBBPA-related byproducts, and ∑16TBBPA-related transformation products in chicken tissues were 1207, 0.20, 15087, 0.96, and 6384 ng/g lipid weight, respectively. Exposure to sources of BFR contamination (soil, feed, and water) could be the main cause of high BFR levels in chickens. α-HBCD and bis-substituted TBBPA analogues have higher bioaccumulation factor levels than TBBPA and other compounds, indicating greater bioconcentration potential for substances with higher logKow. HBCDs, TBBPA, and TBBPA analogues tend to be enriched in the chicken comb and spleen and can cross the blood–brain barrier into the brain. However, while these compounds accumulate in the mother, they are also subject to metabolic processes that lead to their eventual excretion. Low-persistence BFRs were more favorable to maternal transfer, while compounds with high persistence tended to be retained in the mother. Although dietary intake of BFRs through chicken consumption poses a low risk to the general population, concerns remain regarding the synergistic risk of BFRs."

This study examined the impact of residential greenness on GWG and fetal intrauterine growth and assessed the mediating role of GWG. The research included 29406 births in Shanghai, utilizing the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to measure greenness within a 500 m radius (NDVI-500). The analysis employed a generalized linear model to assess the impacts of residental greenness on GWG, fetal growth and birthweight, and a mediation analysis to explore GWG’s role between greenness and fetal development. Results indicated that significant benefits were observed with increased greenness, where each 0.1 unit increase in NDVI-500 was associated with reductions of 9.4% (95% CI: 5.5%–13.2%) in the risk of head circumference undergrowth and 8.5% (95% CI: 4.8%–12.2%) in estimated fetal weight undergrowth. Additionally, each 0.1 unit increase in NDVI-500 was associated with reductions of 9.4% (95% CI: 5.1%–13.5%) and 9.2% (95% CI: 6.2%–12.0%) in the risk  of inadequate and excessive GWG, respectively. Notably, total GWG mediated 17.5% of the relationship between NDVI-500 and the birth weight. These findings suggest that enhancing residential greenness could be an effective public health strategy to improve pregnancy outcomes by promoting fetal growth and managing GWG, with the GWG partially mediating these benefits."

We investigated concentrations of the EPA’s 16 high-priority PAHs on microplastics, particulate organic matter, and surface sediments. Additionally, the gastrointestinal tracts of three economically important fishes within the bay [Paralichthys lethostigma (n = 46), Sciaenops ocellatus (n = 47), and Cynoscion nebulosus (n = 85)] were examined for microplastics, while their liver and muscle tissue were analyzed for PAHs. In all  three matrices, the average concentration of ∑16PAHs ranged from 890.2 to 28,574.0 ng·g–1. The average individual PAH concentration in fish species ranged from 75.1 to 145.4 ng·g–1. Fish species in all of the sampling sites were classified between minimally and moderately polluted, with potential PAH bioaccumulation observed only in the southern flounder. About 67% of all of the analyzed sediment samples from Lavaca-Matagorda Bay indicate possible adverse or moderate adverse biological effects. This demonstrates the need for greater remediation of the existing pollution and continued monitoring of industrial discharges within Lavaca-Matagorda Bay to reduce harm to the ecosystem and the local economy."

Psychiatric disorders are associated with an increased risk of subsequent dementia. However, the associations among floods, psychiatric disorders, and dementia are still unclear. Using a population cohort from the UK Biobank, we aimed to investigate the mediating role of psychiatric disorders on the associations between floods and dementia. In this study, cumulative exposure to floods over an eight-year period preceding the study baseline was assessed for each participant at residential addresses. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to study the associations of flooding exposure with psychiatric disorders and dementia. Stratified analyses and mediation analyses were conducted to examine whether psychiatric disorders mediate the relationship between floods and dementia. During a median follow-up of 12.3 years (interquartile range: 11.6–13.0), 0.9% (2,028) of participants developed dementia and 9.5% (21,629) were diagnosed with psychiatric disorders. The flooding exposure was associated with an 8.0% increased risk of incident dementia (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 1.080, 95% CI: 1.023–1.141). The flood–dementia association was observed to be partially mediated by several subtypes of psychiatric disorders (overall proportion of mediation: 75.7%), with psychotic disorder accounting for 49.7% (indirect effect HR: 1.039, 95% confidence interval: 1.015–1.064) of flood-related dementia, followed by stress-related disorder (proportion of mediation: 18.1%), and depression (proportion of mediation: 3.9%). This study provides evidence of an increased risk of dementia associated with exposure to floods, with psychiatric disorders playing a crucial mediating role in the flood-related dementia pathway. These findings suggest that flooding exposure is a critical risk factor for dementia, and targeted interventions addressing postdisaster mental health may be crucial for dementia prevention in affected populations."

However, the effect of BFRs on the development of atherosclerosis is currently unknown. Here we aimed to investigate the effects of three typical BFRs (BDE-47, BDE-209, and DBDPE) on the development of atherosclerosis and explored the underlying mechanisms using an in vitro cell model and ApoE–/– mice. Our data showed that BFRs significantly inhibited the viability of human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) and induced the generation of ROS. BFRs significantly enhanced the content of Ox-LDL in THP-1 macrophages, which promoted the formation of foam cells. In an in vivo study, BFRs exposure significantly increased the plaque area and lipid content in the aortic root of mice. BFRs significantly increased the ROS level in plaques and promoted the expression level of adhesion molecule ICAM-1, which enhanced the recruitment of macrophages. Transcriptome analysis showed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in signaling pathways related to oxidative stress and lipid metabolism. In summary, these results indicate that BFRs exposure can promote the development of atherosclerosis by increasing macrophage recruitment and foam cell formation, which elucidates the impact of BFRs on atherosclerosis for the first time, and provide scientific clues for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis."

Results showed a clear, dose-dependent reduction in viral genome copies with UVC exposure, where a dose of 129.9 mJ/cm2 reduced over 99% of the viral genome copies. Although less efficient, UVA still contributed to virus inactivation, reducing detectable phages to 20% at 513.30 J/cm2. Mucin provided a protective effect, making virus removal more challenging. Hydrogen peroxide enhanced disinfection, with 1.6 ppm reducing viral genome copies by 78%, and higher concentrations (up to 16 ppm) achieving over 99% reduction in the dark condition. The combination of UVA/UVC with H2O2 further enhanced disinfection, eliminating detectable virus genome copies entirely.

Secondary electrospray ionization high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (SESI-HRMS/MS) offers the highest coverage for detecting breath metabolites among current real-time breath analysis techniques. Although it has been generally recognized that metabolites in breath originate from the blood, a molecular-level understanding of the characteristics of metabolites in both breath and blood remains insufficient. In this study, nontargeted analyses of breath and blood samples from 11 healthy volunteers were performed using SESI-HRMS/MS and ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-HRMS/MS), respectively. Tandem mass spectrometry was employed for metabolite annotation. Twenty-six breath-unique metabolites and 73 blood-unique metabolites were identified. Besides, seven metabolites were found in both breath and blood, including 7-oxabicyclo [2.2.1] heptane, levulinic acid, indole, pyroglutamic acid, malic acid, glutamic acid, and histidine. Intriguingly, the correlation of these metabolites between breath and blood was low (r < 0.4 or p > 0.05). Among all the confirmed metabolites, breath metabolites exhibit higher volatility according to their water–gas partition coefficient (log Pw/g) compared to blood metabolites. In addition, gender-derived differences in breath were significantly smaller than blood. In summary, this study indicates that breath metabolites are likely to offer complementary information on blood metabolites.

In this study, carbazoles (CZs) and eight polyhalogenated carbazoles (PHCZs) were investigated in the groundwater–surface soil system along the coast of Laizhou Bay, around the main halogen producing areas, covering chemical enterprises, agriculture, aquaculture, and salt fields. The concentrations of PHCZs in surface soil and groundwater samples range from 0.15 to 1327.94 ng/g dry weight (dw) (mean: 80.06 ng/g dw) and 0.12–10710.56 ng/L (mean: 365.14 ng/L), respectively, much higher than those detected in other areas in China and abroad.

The characteristics of the dominant position of 1,3,6,8-BCZ in the environment are different from those of other results from China, and its groundwater concentration is thousands of times higher than that of other water samples, indicating that highly halogenated environmental conditions also largely promote the generation of highly halogenated PHCZs, e.g., 1,3,6,8-BCZ. This may be the same reason for the identification of some PHCZ derivatives and mixed-substituted carbazoles in the studied area through suspected targeted screening. More than half of the soil and groundwater samples are considered to have moderate or high carcinogenic risk (CRT > 10–4), and 11 of the 95 groundwater samples are considered to have high health risk (HQT ≥ 1). The mobility of groundwater improves the migration possibility of PHCZs from enterprises to residential areas to induce direct toxic effects, and the high concentration and risk levels of PHCZs in agricultural and aquaculture areas at present may induce bioaccumulation in agricultural and sideline products; therefore, the occurrence of PHCZs in the environment deserves urgent concern."

Deaths Attributable to Unsafe Sanitation in Rural areas (DAUSRs) are influenced by demographic factors, disease mortality rates, and environmental sanitation conditions. However, most studies have been limited in scope and scale and lack a comprehensive evaluation framework for global DAUSRs. Therefore, this study estimated the global DAUSRs from 2000 to 2030, using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) and the World Health Organization (WHO). We employed methods such as comparable risk assessment, Bayesian age (period) models, and AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. Changes in the DAUSRs and their influencing factors were evaluated by applying a decomposition method to assess the impact of population dynamics, sanitation conditions, age structure, and disease mortality rates. The results indicated that despite improvements in rural sanitation, 12.2% of rural populations will still lack access to sanitary toilets in 2030, with an estimated 243,000 deaths (CI: 147,000–441,000) due to unsafe rural sanitation environments. This outcome highlights the need for better rural sanitation governance to provide for demographic shifts, such as aging and declining fertility rates, which are key drivers of DAUSRs. Regions such as Africa and Southeast Asia are at a higher risk with higher diarrhea-related mortality rates in rural areas. We suggest comprehensive measures, including enhancing rural medical facilities, improving sanitation infrastructure, and focusing on vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and children.

Examination of juvenile zebrafish exposed to PFBA at environmental concentrations by histopathology, sex hormone, and gene expression revealed accelerated development of zebrafish toward males, while exposure to PFNA during sex differentiation resulted in feminization. In accordance with the in vivo results, PFBA activated the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway, but PFNA inhibited it in both prostate cancer cell proliferation and luciferase reporter gene assays. Similarly, the differential binding mode of the two chemicals to AR was shown in the molecular docking analysis, with PFBA exhibiting higher potency for the agonist conformation and PFNA favoring the antagonistic conformation. Together, these results suggest that, while PFNA exhibited similar effects on sex differentiation and AR activity as PFOA, PFBA showed distinctive effects and deserves particular attention and further investigation."

Here, 51.20% of MPs were extracted from the original DF (samples denoted DF-O). After the subtracting procedure, MPs and their residual (DF-S samples) were divided into two parts. Our results indicated that the DF-O and MPs samples exhibited higher cytotoxicity, inflammatory, and oxidative stress levels than the DF-S samples did. The DF-O and MPs samples suppressed autophagy by decreasing expression levels of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3B), p-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p-PI3K), phosphorylated AKT protein (p-Akt), and p-mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR) while increasing the level of p62. Meanwhile, DF-O and MPs samples induced apoptosis through increasing levels of Bax/Bcl-2 and Cleaved Caspase-3/Caspase-3 in Raw264.7 cells. These trends could be reversed through removing half of the MPs in DF-O. Therefore, dust fall microplastics inhibited autophagy and induced apoptosis via activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, increasing the Bax/Bcl-2 and Cleaved Caspase-3/Caspase-3 ratios.

Here, we show that poly(lactic acid)/poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PLA/PBAT) films undergo ultraviolet photoaging, resulting in increased surface roughness and a higher quantity of MNPs on the surface. This aging process involves the generation of carbon- and oxygen-centered free radicals, chain scission, and the formation of oxidation products with hydroxyl and carbonyl groups. These MNPs can be released under water shear force, significantly increasing the normalized mass loss of aged films to approximately 0.128 mg/cm2 (18 times higher than that of unaged films in water). In the gastrointestinal environment, the normalized mass loss further increases to about 0.196 mg/cm2 (28 times higher), likely due to potential enzymatic digestion and ion-swelling effects. These MNPs, primarily composed of PLA, are smaller and carry more negative charges under gastrointestinal conditions. In the THP-1 cell model, these MNPs affect cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. MNPs obtained through ultrafiltration, compared to those collected via centrifugation, display a broader size distribution and induce more pronounced toxicity in THP-1 cells, with an EC50 of 243 mg/L. Preliminary comparative analysis indicates that PLA/PBAT-derived MNPs present toxicity risks comparable to, or greater than, those of conventional plastic MNPs.

Pluvials show a strong association with tropical Pacific (warm) sea surface temperatures (SSTs) during the 20th century and over the prior millennium, though the role of the tropical Atlantic is much more uncertain and ambiguous. Using a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach trained on the pre‐industrial period (800–1849 CE), we find that the record setting late 20th‐century megapluvial likely occurred as a consequence of anomalously strong Pacific sea surface temperature forcing. This work establishes pluvial and megapluvial events as intrinsic components of Common Era hydroclimate variability in SWNA, comparable in importance to droughts and megadroughts."

The size of volcanoes along the Hawai‘i–Emperor chain, and thus the magma flux of the Hawaiian plume, has varied over the past 85 million years. Fifteen and two million years ago, rapid bursts in magmatic production led to the emergence of large islands such as Pūhāhonu, Maui Nui and Hawai‘i, but the underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic. Here, we use new radiogenic Ce–Sr–Nd–Hf isotope data of Hawaiian shield lavas to quantify the composition and proportion of the different constituents of the Hawaiian plume over time. We find that most of the Hawaiian mantle source is peridotite that has experienced variable degrees of melt depletion before being incorporated into the plume. We show that the most isotopically enriched LOA‐type compositions arise from the aggregation of melts from more depleted, trace element‐starved peridotite, causing the over‐visibility of melts from recycled crust in the mixture. Our results also show that upwelling of chemically more depleted, and thus less dense, more buoyant mantle peridotite occurred synchronously to an observed burst of magma production. Buoyancy variations induced by variably depleted peridotite may not only control the temporal patterns of volcanic productivity in Hawai‘i, but also those of other plumes world‐wide. The excess buoyancy of depleted peridotite may therefore be an underrated driving force for convective mantle flow, trigger and sustain active upwelling of relatively cool plumes, and control the geometry of mantle upwellings from variable depths."

Using land surface models and water budget simulations, we examined the extent to which increased flow was driven by natural climate variability, anthropogenic climate trends, land‐use and land‐cover change (LULCC), and ecological effects of elevated atmospheric CO2. Natural climate variability (arising largely from coupled ocean‐atmosphere circulation systems in both the Pacific and North Atlantic) accounted for ∼765 m3 s−1 of the ∼900 m3 s−1 increase in flow since mid‐century, while anthropogenic climate trends negatively forced flow by increasing evapotranspiration more than precipitation. LULCC and elevated CO2 further increased simulated mean streamflow by ∼550 and ∼70 m3 s−1, respectively, relative to pre‐Industrial conditions and ∼100 and ∼65 m3 s−1 relative to mid‐20th century conditions. The LULCC effect was especially large in wet years, implying that current land cover is ill‐suited for buffering against extreme precipitation, likely in large part due to replacement of forest by cropland in the lower basin. Because increases in Missouri River flow over the past century were driven mostly by a recent (and likely transient) pluvial, our results suggest that flow in the basin could revert to a drier mean state when that pluvial ends, likely made worse by increased evaporative demand from anthropogenic warming."

Brittle tremor patches embedded in the ductile matrix deforming aseismically is the most common concept for the fault structure, but whether tremors and their patches impact the SSE initiation is under debate. This study focuses on 13 initiations of major Cascadia ETS. Limited observational constraints exist on the details of ETS initiation because spatiotemporal SSE inversions usually over‐smooth their temporal evolution. Scrutinizing tremors and SSE at the beginning of major ETS events gives us insights into their mechanical relationship. We directly retrieve the temporal evolution of the SSE moment by stacking sub‐daily Global Positioning System (GPS) time series at multiple sites, without slip inversions. Comparison of the GPS stack with tremor count demonstrates that SSE moment release accelerates drastically ∼ ${\sim} $1 day after the onset of vigorous tremor activity. On the other hand, once the SSE moment release accelerates, the tremor area expands more rapidly, suggesting that the growth of the ETS occurs through a feedback mechanism between slip and tremor once the SSE is well developed. By combining these and previous observations, we propose a conceptual model of ETS initiation: heterogeneous interface strength limits the growth of SSE with unruptured tremor patches acting as relatively high‐strength pins contributing to this heterogeneity. In other words, major ETS emerges probably only when collective tremor patches are critically stressed."

Reasons for differences in fire patterns can be difficult to determine due to variable vegetation types, land use patterns, fuel conditions, and human influences on fire ignition and suppression. This study compares burned areas to climate and fuel conditions in three temperate regions: the desert, shrub, and forest ecoregions of western North America, west‐central Europe, and southwestern South America. In each region the mean annual aridity index (AI, precipitation over potential evapotranspiration) spans arid to humid climates. We examined how the fraction of area burned from 2001 to 2021 varied with mean annual AI, mean aboveground biomass, and land cover type distributions. All three regions had low fractions of area burned for the driest climate zones (AI < 0.5), a sign of fuel limitation to burned area. Fraction of area burned increased with mean aboveground biomass for these dry zones. Fraction of area burned peaked at intermediate AI (0.7–1.5) for all regions and declined again in the wettest climate zones (AI > 1.5), a sign of climate limitation to burned area. Of the three regions, western North America had the highest burned area, fraction of area burned, and fire sizes. Fragmentation of vegetation patches by the high Andes Mountains in southwestern South America and by intensive land use changes in west‐central Europe likely limited fire sizes.

Observational analysis shows that the extremely large accumulation of precipitation and long duration of this event are closely related to a slowly moving landfall typhoon “Dusuari” over North China due to the blocking effect of an anomalous high over the mid‐high latitude Asia. The anomalous southeasterly flow induced by the typhoon “Dusuari” and another typhoon “Khanun” over the East China Sea jointly built a highly efficient channel of water vapor supply from southern oceans toward North China. A water vapor budget analysis indicates that precipitation of this event is mainly caused by the dynamic process involving strong ascending motion. Accompanying strong water vapor transportation and convergence over North China, large amount of latent heat is released in the middle and the lower troposphere. The physical mechanisms of heavy rainfall‐induced diabatic heating in maintaining the precipitation over North China is further investigated using statistical analysis and numerical experiments. On one hand, the latent heating released by heavy rainfall induces significant uplifting flows which causes more precipitation. On the other hand, the heavy rainfall‐induced diabatic heating contributes to the enhancement of the westward extension of high‐pressure dam over mid‐high latitude through a regional meridional circulation. This strengthened high‐pressure dam sustained the cyclonic circulation of “Dusuari” over North China, leading to continuous heavy rainfall there."

Compared to traditional optimization algorithms, the deep learning‐based optimization framework, namely differentiable parameter learning (dPL), reduces computational costs and achieves greater spatial generalizability. However, the effectiveness of the parameter values derived from dPL in enhancing land surface modeling needs further verification. This study introduced a deep learning‐based adaptive parameter learning (APL) framework for efficiently optimizing key parameters in the Common Land Model (CoLM) to simulate high‐resolution soil moisture (SM) across Northeast China. We began by constructing a surrogate model using long short‐term memory networks to capture the relationships between CoLM parameters, meteorological forcing data, and simulated SM. Initial parameter optimization using the dPL framework improved SM simulations but revealed discrepancies between the performances of surrogate and process‐based models. The APL framework builds upon dPL by iteratively refining surrogate models with expanded training data sets enhancing their ability to approximate the behavior of process‐based models. Evaluations using four metrics—bias, root mean square error, correlation, and Kling–Gupta efficiency—demonstrated that APL outperformed dPL with both frameworks providing robust parameter estimates. This study underscored the potential of deep learning‐based parameter optimization frameworks to overcome traditional calibration challenges in LSMs by improving computational efficiency, enhancing spatial consistency and increasing resilience to uncertainties in forcing and reference data. Finally, we recommended that improving physical coherence in LSMs should not rely solely on adjusting a few parameters but requires a comprehensive approach, including identifying key parameters, employing multiobjective parameter optimization, and, critically, utilizing high‐precision land surface benchmarking data sets."

Various sensibility tests are conducted, including the replacement of soil property, surface drag coefficient scheme, canopy stomatal resistance scheme, soil surface resistance scheme, and their different combinations. The results indicate that different schemes can improve certain aspects of model simulations. Specifically, the modified surface drag coefficient scheme reduces the overestimation in sensible heat flux by adjusting the surface heat exchange coefficient, while the improved stomatal and soil resistance schemes enhance latent heat flux and soil moisture simulations. The optimal combination significantly reduces average bias by 61.3% for the Bowen ratio, 9.6% for soil temperature, and 50.0% for soil moisture. Regional simulations demonstrate that sensible heat flux constitutes the primary constituent within the energy partitioning, characterized by a mean Bowen ratio of 1.84.

To fill this gap, this study aims to investigate how extreme precipitation of varying durations responds to urbanization, accounting for natural climate variations. We classified the urban agglomeration of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) in East China into nine distinct groups based on seasonal extreme precipitation patterns, utilizing structural self‐organizing maps (SOM), and explored the relationship between urbanization and extreme precipitation with Geographical Detector Model. The results revealed substantial seasonal precipitation fluctuations within the YRD, showing significant spatial variability and underscoring the importance of considering natural climate variations in urban extreme precipitation studies. After accounting for natural climate variations, our findings unveiled a notable urbanization‐induced precipitation effect, particularly prominent during summer and autumn. Additionally, urbanization's influence on extreme precipitation demonstrated a significant time‐scaling effect, with shorter‐duration events exhibiting a stronger correlation with urbanization. Furthermore, the interaction between urbanization and elevation surpassed the impact of individual factors, intensifying as event duration decreased, especially for durations less than 3 days, indicating a more complex mechanism for their influence on extreme precipitation.

To partially solve this issue, this study adopts an improved SCF scheme that adequately consider the impact of sub‐grid terrain relief on snow cover into the Regional Climate Model version 4.7 (RegCM4.7) coupled with the CLM4.5 land surface model to enhance the model skill. Results show that adopting the improved SCF scheme in RegCM4.7 model can significantly reduce the SCF overestimation on the TP produced by the original model, leading to obvious improvements in the surface albedo, soil and surface air temperature simulations in cold seasons. Mechanism analysis indicates that the sub‐grid terrain relief suppresses the rapid increase of SCF with snowfall and makes the ground more difficult to be fully covered by snow, resulting in the overestimation of SCF obviously reduced and thereafter the surface albedo decreased. It further causes the ground surface to absorb more solar radiation and then more heat released to the overlying atmosphere and deep soils. Thereafter, the cold biases in the soil and surface air temperature simulations on the TP in cold seasons can be clearly reduced. This study highlights that considering the impact of the sub‐grid topography relief on snow cover in numerical models is one of the effective ways for reducing the cold biases on the TP."

 Indian summer monsoon (ISM) hydrology fuels biogeochemical cycling across South Asia and the Indian Ocean, exerting a first-order control on food security in Earth’s most densely populated areas. Although the ISM is projected to intensify under continued greenhouse forcing, substantial uncertainty surrounds anticipating its impacts on future Indian Ocean stratification and primary production—processes key to the health of already-declining fisheries in the region. Here we present century-scale records of ISM runoff variability and marine biogeochemical impacts in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) since the Last Glacial Maximum (∼21 thousand years ago (ka)). These records reveal extreme monsoon states relative to modern strength, with weakest ISM intensity during Heinrich Stadial 1 (∼17.5–15.5 ka) and strongest during the early Holocene (∼10.5–9.5 ka). Counterintuitively, we find that BoB productivity collapsed during both extreme states of peak monsoon excess and deficits—both due to upper-ocean stratification.

 Bedrock composition, in particular the proportion of carbonate, can influence the dissolved inorganic carbon concentration and also the carbonate chemistry of rivers, but its effects on the nitrogen cycle in rivers are usually overlooked. Here we present geochemical composition measurements of rivers across the Pearl River Basin in China that show that dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) is positively correlated with dissolved inorganic nitrogen and follows the variation in solar radiation in the carbonate-dominated region during the wet season, but not in the non-carbonate-dominated region. In situ incubations show that organic nitrogen production is strengthened in the regions with high dissolved inorganic carbon and high temperature and solar radiation. DON zonation in the dry season is not obvious owing to the limitation of low temperature on nitrogen assimilation. We also report a similar DON contrast in carbonate-dominated and non-carbonate-dominated regions in Malang in Indonesia. Furthermore, from an analysis of global published data, we find that a modified Michaelis–Menten model incorporating carbon limitation provides a much better fit to the global latitudinal distribution of DON globally. Hence, we propose that carbonate weathering enhancement of organic nitrogen production occurs ubiquitously.

Here we apply an X-ray micro-computed tomography method combined with computational fluid dynamics simulations to analyse aggregate morphology at high spatial resolution and determine the relationship with drag. Instead of aggregate size or gross shape being the primary controls on drag, we find that microbial colonization alters the fine-scale aggregate morphology and increases drag by factors of 1–3 compared with smooth surfaces. We propose a morphology-corrected drag law that accounts for this complexity, reconciling the differences in drag across diverse aggregates. Our findings suggest that a shift from focusing on gross scale variabilities (size or gross shape) to fine-scale morphologies could enable greater accuracy in transport predictions, and improve understanding of microbially colonized aggregates in fluvial, coastal and oceanic systems. The morphological complexity that develops on suspended sediment surfaces due to microbial colonization substantially increases drag, according to high-resolution microscopic imaging and fluid dynamics simulations."

Here, the authors propose an efficient coding principle for reinforcement learning, whereby agents use compact representations, enabling human-like generalization. 
 Reinforcement learning theory explains human behavior as driven by the goal of maximizing reward. Conventional approaches, however, offer limited insights into how people generalize from past experiences to new situations. Here, we propose refining the classical reinforcement learning framework by incorporating an efficient coding principle, which emphasizes maximizing reward using the simplest necessary representations. This refined framework predicts that intelligent agents, constrained by simpler representations, will inevitably: 1) distill environmental stimuli into fewer, abstract internal states, and 2) detect and utilize rewarding environmental features. Consequently, complex stimuli are mapped to compact representations, forming the foundation for generalization. We tested this idea in two experiments that examined human generalization. Our findings reveal that while conventional models fall short in generalization, models incorporating efficient coding achieve human-level performance. We argue that the classical RL objective, augmented with efficient coding, represents a more comprehensive computational framework for understanding human behavior in both learning and generalization. Reinforcement learning models of human behavior are limited in explaining the capacity for generalization.

Here, the authors show that through femtosecond ultraviolet excitation they can active a parity-forbidden dark exciton. 
 As conventional electronic materials approach their physical limits, the application of ultrafast optical fields to access transient states of matter captures imagination. The inversion symmetry governs the optical parity selection rule, differentiating between accessible and inaccessible states of matter. To circumvent parity-forbidden transitions, the common practice is to break the inversion symmetry by material design or external fields. Here we report how the application of femtosecond ultraviolet pulses can energize a parity-forbidden dark exciton state in black phosphorus while maintaining its intrinsic material symmetry. Unlike its conventional bandgap absorption in visible-to-infrared, femtosecond ultraviolet excitation turns on efficient Coulomb scattering, promoting carrier multiplication and electronic heating to ~3000 K, and consequently populating its parity-forbidden states. Interferometric time- and angle-resolved two-photon photoemission spectroscopy reveals dark exciton dynamics of black phosphorus on ~100 fs time scale and its anisotropic wavefunctions in energy-momentum space, illuminating its potential applications in optoelectronics and photochemistry under ultraviolet optical excitation.

Here, authors map early developmental stages of fetal Leydig cells in mice, revealing critical genetic factors that guide their maturation and function. 
 Testicular fetal Leydig cells produce androgens essential for male reproductive development. Impaired fetal Leydig cell differentiation leads to differences of sex development including hypospadias, cryptorchidism, and infertility. Despite fetal Leydig cells are thought to originate from proliferating progenitor cells in the testis interstitium, the precise mechanisms governing the interstitial cells to fetal Leydig cell transition remain elusive. Using mouse models and single-nucleus multiomics, we find that fetal Leydig cells arise from a Nr2f2-positive interstitial population. Embryonic deletion of Nr2f2 in mouse testes results in differences of sex development, including dysgenic testes, Leydig cell hypoplasia, cryptorchidism, and hypospadias. By combining single-nucleus multiomics and NR2F2 ChIP-seq we find that NR2F2 promotes the progenitor fate while suppresses Leydig cell differentiation by modulating key transcription factors and downstream genes. Our findings establish Nr2f2 as a crucial regulator of fetal Leydig cell differentiation and provide molecular insights into differences of sex development linked to Nr2f2 mutations.

Here, the authors proposed elastic-wave circulator that could achieve this without breaking reciprocity, enabling mode transition and wave trapping concurrently. 
 Nonreciprocal transmission of waves is highly desirable for the transport and redistribution of energy. However, building an asymmetric system to break time-reversal symmetry is relatively difficult because it tends to work under stringent guidelines, narrow bandwidth, or external impetus, particularly in a three-port system. Without breaking reciprocity, realizing “one-way” transmission of elastic waves by a linear and passive structure in a higher-dimensional asymmetric system, such as a three-port circulator, poses quite a challenge. Here, based on the wave-vector modulation mechanism, we propose an elastic-wave circulator that achieves this without breaking reciprocity, enabling perfect mode transition and wave trapping simultaneously. Requiring neither activated media nor relying on the nonlinearity of nonreciprocal devices, the circulator routes elastic waves purely in a clockwise direction, offering superior performance in broad bandwidth, robust behavior, and simple configuration. Our study provides a feasible platform for asymmetric wave transport in a three-port system, which can be useful in the routing, isolation, and harvesting of energy and can also be extended to other fields, such as electromagnetic and acoustic waves.

 Chilling stress is one of the major environmental stresses that restrains plant development and growth. Our previous study showed that a potential iron sensor BTS (BRUTUS) was involved in temperature response in Arabidopsis plants. However, whether plant iron homeostasis is involved in plant response to temperature fluctuation is not known. In this study, we discover that BTS mutant bts-2 is sensitive to chilling stress, and the sensitivity is attributed to the accumulation of iron. The suppressor screening of bts-2 led to the discovery of RH24, a DEAD-box RNA helicase, that fully suppresses bts-2 chilling sensitivity. RH24 is accumulated under low temperatures, where it unwinds the iron regulator ILR3 (IAA-leucine resistant 3) mRNA and increases the ILR3 protein levels. Intriguingly, RH24 sequesters ILR3 in phase-separated condensates to reduce ILR3-mediated iron overload, and BTS or cold treatments further facilitated the condensate formation. Therefore, RH24 and BTS coordinately control ILR3 to reduce iron uptake under chilling stress. Our findings reveal that the RNA helicase RH24 and BTS finetunes ILR3 to maintain plant iron homeostasis in response to temperature fluctuations.

 The preservation of fossils in the rock record depends on complex redox processes. Redox conditions around different decaying organisms have rarely been monitored in the context of experimental taphonomy. Here, microsensors were used to measure redox changes around decomposing carcasses of various taxa, including shrimp, snail, starfish, and planarian. Our results show that different decaying taxa lead to various post-mortem environmental redox conditions. Large carcasses tend to reach reducing conditions more rapidly than smaller ones. However, size does not explain all observed patterns, as environmental redox conditions are also influenced by the nature of the organic material. For instance, taxa with higher proteins-to-lipids and (proteins + carbohydrates)-to-lipids ratios tend to achieve reducing conditions more rapidly than others. The generation of distinct redox environments around different taxa originally put under the same original environmental conditions suggests that various fossilisation patterns of macrofossils and molecules can co-occur within a single sedimentary layer.

 Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have become a worldwide environmental and human health problem, stressing the urgent need for a reliable forecasting tool. Dynamic interactions between algae, including harmful algae, and bacteria play a large role regulating water chemistry. Free-living bacteria quickly respond to small physical and/or chemical environmental changes by adjusting their proteome.

To characterize the microbiome’s physiological changes preceding bloom onset, we collected and analyzed a high-resolution metaproteomic time series of a free-living microbiome in a coastal ecosystem. We confirm that twelve candidate HAB biomarkers are detectable, quantifiable, and correlated across two pre-bloom periods. This study identifies proteomic shifts in bacterial peptides which may be used as predictive biomarkers for forecasting harmful algal bloom initiation, potentially mitigating detrimental algal bloom outcomes in the future.

Overall, the ESTIMET estimates captured the daily seasonal variations of the EC data, especially in the Caatinga, Pantanal, and Cerrado biomes, with concordance correlation coefficients (ρc) ranging from 0.45 to 0.80 at eight sites located in these three biomes.

 Accurate tree species distribution is essential for biodiversity assessment, sustainable forest management, and environmental policy. However, mapping species over large areas with satellite data is challenging due to spectral mixing and complex spatial distribution. To address this, we developed a novel deep learning model, ForestFormer, using Sentinel-2 time series data to map eight dominant tree species in Germany. ForestFormer’s dual-branch network with spectral and spatial attention modules improves classification by highlighting species-specific characteristics. Cross-validation in 2,364 National Forest Inventory plots shows that ForestFormer achieves species classification accuracy ranging from 69% to 92%, with an average accuracy of 84%, outperforming existing baseline methods. The developed ForestFormer model can help generate a large-scale and reliable tree species map for Germany, which in turn provides crucial insights into the diverse characteristics of tree species to support forest management. Our analysis of results shows that Pine is the species most resistant to disturbances, while Douglas fir is the least. Northeastern regions of Germany exhibit particularly low levels of forest biodiversity, especially in the states of Brandenburg and Berlin, followed by neighboring states such as Sachsen–Anhalt, Mecklenburg–Vorpommern, Sachsen, and Niedersachsen.

 Mapping crop types with remote sensing imagery is crucial for timely acquisition of crop planting information. However, large-scale crop type mapping is often hindered by the absence of ground truth data and spatiotemporal heterogeneity of available cloud-free optical images. In this study, the conception of daily crop-wise indicative features (DCIF) was proposed for automatic crop mapping to address this issue. Crop-wise indicative feature (CIF) was defined as a comprehensive feature that can distinctly differentiates the target crop and all other classes, with the CIF value showing a polarization trend with target crop close to 1 and others close to 0. Logistic Regression (LR) model was utilized to learn CIF of target crop on each single date, referred to as CIF extractor. The time series analysis method (i.e., seasonal trend decomposition) and imputation method was then utilized for the discrete time series of CIF extractors, which were separately trained based on training samples on each day. This process yielded the DCIF extractor that can capture the unique feature pattern on any given day during the entire growing period. The comprehensive features produced by DCIF extractor later served as the input of Otsu algorithm to automatic distinguish target crop from other crops. Our results in Heilongjiang, China, Iowa, USA, and Bas-Rhin, France show that the DCIF extractor effectively overcomes abovementioned challenges in crop mapping by applying time series analysis method at model-level.

 Dust is one of the key factors influencing photovoltaic (PV) power generation. The ability to accurately capture PV dust information is essential for PV operation and sustainable utilization. This study employs uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral imaging to monitor PV dust deposition. To address the problems of information redundancy in hyperspectral data and the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) easily falling into local optimum, a high-precision UAV hyperspectral PV dust estimation method is proposed. The fractional order derivative (FOD) is applied to the spectral reflectance of PV dust accumulation, and a PV dust estimation model with sine map tuna swarm optimized backpropagation neural network (STSO-BPNN) is established, which is validated using UAV hyperspectral images and ground measured dust data. The results show that FOD improves the spectral signal-to-noise ratio, and the 0.2 order STSO-BPNN model achieves higher accuracy (R2 = 0.95, RMSE = 0.79 g/m2, RPIQ = 7.98). These findings provide a scientific basis for the rapid and accurate estimation and mapping of PV dust accumulation while proposing a novel strategy for efficient PV implementation and management."

 High-quality, full-coverage topographic bathymetric data is crucial for marine economic development and ecological environment protection. Due to the complex environment of land-sea transition zone, it is challenging to acquire comprehensive bathymetric topography using a single sensor. Multiplatform topographic bathymetric technology, such as airborne LiDAR bathymetry (ALB) and multibeam echo sounding (MBES), whose point clouds can be integrated to construct a complete model of land-sea transition zone. However, point cloud data from different sources may have certain differences in the digital description of the same target. Meanwhile, affected by factors such as registration error and sensor system error, there are data gaps in the registered point cloud, which hinders the subsequent reconstruction. To overcome these problems, a fusion method combining a pseudo-grid model is proposed to construct a high-quality, seamless topographic-bathymetric map. This paper’s contribution identifies non-overlapping ALB regions and generates anti-noise MBES simulated points (SPs) by constructing a pseudo-grid. Moreover, this paper focuses on establishing a point-to-SP model to eliminate the gaps and reduce the impact of registration errors on the fusion accuracy. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, four typical samples along with six reference samples exhibiting diverse features collected from Ganquan Island in the South China Sea are utilized in the experiment. The results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve ideal results in terms of the average root mean square error (RMSE) of the six reference samples, which is reduced from 0.41 m to 0.19 m. It is indicated that the true topography can be restored and the proposed method has advantages in accuracy and robustness."

 Water depth (H), bottom reflectance (Rbλ), chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl) and seawater transparency (SDD) are key parameters in assessing shallow benthic habitats. However, due to limited in-situ data, restricted hyperspectral imagery or dynamic water quality, it is challenging to develop a generalized remote sensing model for decoupling water column and benthic signals across diverse regions and time periods. In this study, a Modified Log rotation Ratio and Semi-analytical (MLR-S) model is proposed for diffuse attenuation coefficient Kdλ retrieval by adjusting inherent optical properties (P, G, X), from widely used four-band multispectral images without relying on truth data. A new Binary Quadratic Polynomial Relationship (BQPR) between P and the logarithmic values of blue-green bands was developed upon a sparse set of self-inferred points (SIPs). Then, large-scale and optimal Kdλ was determined. Finally, using the monthly mean water column reflectance dataset MMCRwλ constructed from 23-year MODIS data, Rbλ, Chl and SDD can be efficiently derived. Synchronous validation at Dazhou Island confirmed the effectiveness of the MLR-S model, with mean relative errors of 23.77%, 15.26% and 9.91% for blue, green and red Rb, respectively, and 36.69% for Chl. Further validation of Rbλ in Heron Reef, Aitutaki Island and Buck Island demonstrated the model’s robustness across diverse habitats. Compared to the ICESat-2 Along Track Benthic Reflectance (ATBR) model, the MLR-S model yielded more reasonable and reliable Rbλ in deeper waters. Additionally, it outperformed the traditional semi-analytical model, achieving greater accuracy while being over 100 times more computationally efficient. This model offers promising potential for large-scale, high-resolution monitoring of benthic habitats using four-band multispectral data, supporting improved understanding of reef health and informed decision-making."

 Mapping environmental variables is crucial for natural resource management. Researchers and scholars have continually advanced this field with modern techniques such as Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA), Deep Learning (DL), and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) models. While effective, these models often present a significant challenge due to their black nature, which obscures the process of generating final maps from raw data. Recent theoretical breakthroughs have shown that white/grey-box models can achieve the same level of accuracy as these advanced techniques, debunking the belief that complex models are necessarily the most accurate. Based on these findings, we have developed a methodology that employs a series of statistical tests and data analytics to identify essential features hidden in spatial data in order to assess the predictive model (of white/grey kind) that best approximates underlying spatial processes. This methodology profiles the model that better adapts to the data, aiding in the selection of the simplest model that achieves the desired accuracy, functioning similarly to a recommender system for model selection. Furthermore, the set of permissible models includes only regressive-like ones to clarify the data’s contribution to map construction and can be applied to a wide range of datasets. By reducing complexity, this approach enhances the transparency of the model’s results. Real-world dataset demonstrates this methodology’s remarkable ability to produce highly accurate results."

 Mapping forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for monitoring forest ecosystems and assessing the success of conservation initiatives such as the REDD + carbon projects. Traditional field-based approaches to measuring AGB, however, face significant challenges, due to high financial costs and logistical constraints. Remote sensing, including both active and passive sensors, presents a promising and cost-effective alternative, yet its practical utility and accuracy for capturing forest AGB in diverse and complex ecosystems remains largely unexplored. This research used an extensive national forest inventory (NFI) dataset to evaluate the ability to map the AGB of the Miombo woodlands in Zambia across four agro-ecological zones using both multi-seasonal SAR (Sentinel-1A) and optical (Landsat-8 OLI) imagery. A multi-level experiment was designed to (i) compare the accuracy of AGB estimation using SAR and optical data when used independently, and in combination, using a Random Forest regression model, (ii) assess the effect of seasonality on the accuracy of AGB estimation when using SAR and optical datasets, and (iii) evaluate the effect of variation in climatic and environmental conditions on AGB estimation. Experimental results show that multi-seasonal images (across the rainy, hot and dry seasons) outperformed single-season and annual images. Combining SAR backscatter in the hot season, optical bands in the dry season, and vegetation indices in the hot season produced the most accurate AGB model (R = 0.69, MAE = 14.01 Mg ha−1 and RMSE = 18.23 Mg ha−1). The models performed distinctly across different agro-ecological zones (R = 0.44 – 0.79), suggesting that fitting local models could be beneficial. These results based on the extensive NFI of Zambia demonstrate that seasonal effects and fitting local models can lead to more accurate AGB estimation within the Miombo woodlands, which is of significance for ongoing REDD + carbon projects in Zambia and other African countries."

 Validating forest cover maps is essential for evidence-based conservation and sustaining ecosystem services. However, complex spatial patterns in fragmented tropical forest landscapes—often comprising non-contiguous forest patches, interspersed with agricultural lands and other land cover types—pose considerable difficulties for accuracy assessment using conventional techniques. To address this, we developed an integrated object-based sampling (IOBS) method that combines stratified random sampling, proportional allocation, and sample distance optimization. The IOBS method was applied to assess the accuracy of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) global 25 m PALSAR-2/PALSAR forest/non-forest (FNF) 2020 map across 14 ecoregions in Nigeria. Its performance was compared to simple random, systematic, and stratified random sampling using the coefficient of variation (CV), heterogeneity index (HI), and true accuracy metrics. IOBS demonstrated substantially higher spatial variability (CV = 109.37) and heterogeneity (HI = 0.21) compared to other methods (CV = 28.84–53.93, HI = 0.05–0.11). The IOBS estimated an accuracy of 81.1 %, closely aligning with the true accuracy of 82.4 % and outperforming other methods (75.3 %–79.7 %). The higher performance of IOBS stems from its ability to capture a broad range of forest conditions—from extensive contiguous cover to small, fragmented patches—while minimizing spatial autocorrelation through distance optimization. By better representing local heterogeneity, IOBS offers a robust and precise framework for validating categorical forest cover maps in complex tropical landscapes, advancing accuracy assessment practices for remote sensing applications."

 Remote sensing scene captioning is crucial for the deep understanding and intelligent analysis of Earth observation data. Many existing methods and datasets lack a fine-grained description of key geographical elements, fail to capture the full diversity of spatial relations, and are limited in their applicability to real-world geospatial scenarios. To address these shortcomings, we propose HI4HC (hybrid intelligence for remote sensing scene hierarchical captioning), a novel method that combines deep learning algorithms with expert knowledge to generate hierarchical captions for remote sensing scenes. This approach comprehensively describes scenes across three dimensions: geographical elements, spatial relations, and scene concepts, resulting in more accurate, detailed, and comprehensive captions. Leveraging HI4HC, we have constructed and made public a high-quality hierarchical caption dataset named AAAAD (adopt-amend-annihilate-add dataset). Extensive experiments show that AAAAD outperforms traditional single-level caption datasets in terms of the richness of geographical elements, the precision of spatial relations, and overall caption diversity, with improvements observed across 11 out of 13 evaluation metrics. Moreover, the hierarchical captions generated by HI4HC offer users the flexibility to organize information according to specific application needs such as imagery classification, change detection, multimodal understanding and cross-modal retrieval. This adaptability not only alleviates the semantic gap in imagery understanding but also plays an important role in advancing intelligent analysis of remote sensing imagery.

 The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a vital metric for assessing vegetation growth, yet accurate prediction remains challenging, particularly in regions with complex geographic and climatic conditions. Machine learning methods offer promise but are often hindered by sensitivity to model structure, input parameters, and training samples. To address these limitations, this study developed an NDVI time-series prediction optimization model, LSKRX, which integrates multiple machine learning algorithms with local geographic and climatic data. Using the Southwest Basin of China as a case study, dominant climatic factors were identified through sub-basin analysis, and machine learning models were constructed to link NDVI with these factors. The LSKRX model demonstrated significant improvements in prediction accuracy compared to single-model approaches, with the most notable enhancement in BIAS. Spatially, the model’s predictions aligned closely with observed values, particularly in the middle and lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River. The model performed exceptionally well in winter (CC: 0.964) and summer (CC: 0.918) and achieved optimal accuracy in alpine regions at altitudes of 4000–5000 m (CC: 0.900).

In addition, these products are often aggregated to regional, national, or global scales relevant to climate policy, natural resource inventory, and measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) frameworks. Quantifying uncertainty in aggregated products is crucial as it is necessary to assess their value and evaluate whether changes and trends in aggregated estimates are statistically significant.

 Forest disturbance regimes are changing across the globe under the influence of climate change and other global change factors, with potentially substantial consequences for tree mortality rates. Tree mortality has been assessed using field and aerial surveys and, more recently, frequently using satellite remote sensing-based techniques. Rapid detection of tree mortality is often important in decision-making around wood salvage and other potential responses.

 Interactive segmentation of remote sensing images enables the rapid generation of annotated samples, providing training samples for deep learning algorithms and facilitating high-quality extraction and classification for remote sensing objects. However, existing interactive segmentation methods, such as SAM, are primarily designed for natural images and show inefficiencies when applied to remote sensing images. These methods often require multiple interactions to achieve satisfactory labeling results and frequently struggle to obtain precise target boundaries. To address these limitations, we propose a high-quality one-shot interactive segmentation method (OSISeg) based on the fine-tuning of foundation models, tailored for the efficient annotation of typical objects in remote sensing imagery. OSISeg utilizes robust visual priors from foundation models and implements a hybrid adapter-based strategy for fine-tuning these models. Specifically, It employs a parallel structure with hybrid adapter designs to adjust multi-head self-attention and feed-forward neural networks within foundation models, effectively aligning remote sensing image features for interactive segmentation tasks. Furthermore, the proposed OSISeg integrates point, box, and scribble prompts, facilitating high-quality segmentation only using one prompt through a lightweight decoder. Experimental results on multiple datasets—including buildings, water bodies, and woodlands—demonstrate that our method outperforms existing fine-tuning methods and significantly enhances the quality of one-shot interactive segmentation for typical remote sensing objects.

 Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has emerged as a powerful technique for addressing the distribution shift across various Remote Sensing (RS) applications. However, most UDA approaches require access to source data, which may be infeasible due to data privacy or transmission constraints. Source-free Domain Adaptation addresses the absence of source data but usually demands a large amount of target domain data beforehand, hindering rapid adaptation and restricting their applicability in broader scenarios. In practical cross-domain RS image classification, achieving a balance between adaptation speed and accuracy is crucial. Therefore, we propose Low Saturation Confidence Distribution Test-Time Adaptation (LSCD-TTA), marketing the first attempt to explore Test-Time Adaptation for cross-domain RS image classification without requiring source or target training data. LSCD-TTA adapts a source-trained model on the fly using only the target test data encountered during inference, enabling immediate and efficient adaptation while maintaining high accuracy. Specifically, LSCD-TTA incorporates three optimization strategies tailored to the distribution characteristics of RS images. Firstly, weak-confidence softmax-entropy loss emphasizes categories that are more difficult to classify to address unbalanced class distribution. Secondly, balanced-categories softmax-entropy loss softens and balances the predicted probabilities to tackle the category diversity. Finally, low saturation distribution loss utilizes soft log-likelihood ratios to reduce the impact of low-confidence samples in the later stages of adaptation.

 Recent advances in deep learning have enhanced crop classification, yet current research still underutilizes the hierarchical information of crop types, limiting classification accuracy. As categories are subdivided, the sample imbalance intensifies, posing a challenge to fine classification of crops. To address this, we propose the Class Semantic Guided Hierarchical Segmentation Framework (SemHi framework) for satellite image time series (SITS) crop classification. This framework effectively leverages the hierarchical information in the class system and outputs classification results at each level in an end-to-end manner. The SemHi framework comprises four modules: (1) The backbone that learns the spatio-temporal features; (2) The label embedding module, a core component that guides the feature learning through the fusion of hierarchical structure and textual representations; (3) The prototype distance measurement module to enhance class separation and reduce within-class variation; (4) The hierarchical logic regularization module, which enables multi-granularity crop predictions and strengthens the hierarchical logic between them. The validation results on the public crop classification dataset show that the SemHi framework with multi-dimensional fusion of spatio-temporal-text information significantly improves the performance of all state-of-the-art (SOTA) networks on fine-grained classes, with an overall accuracy improvement of 0.48% to 13.86%. Furthermore, experiments on a remote sensing classification dataset demonstrate the framework’s generality and potential for broader applications in remote sensing tasks."

 Wildfires significantly reshape the landscape of the Mediterranean basin, altering forest composition, structure, and diversity. Consequently, detailed fuel mapping is crucial for improving fire risk assessment and enhancing fire behavior modeling, as wildfires typically ignite from surface fuels and may spread vertically to canopy fuels due to canopy fuel continuity. This study generates a fuel type map of the overstory and understory based on the FirEUrisk hierarchical fuel classification system (FHFCS) in three steps, including overstory mapping using multispectral and radar data (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2), and topographic variables; shrubland and grassland height estimation using biophysical models based on precipitation and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); and understory mapping using spaceborne LiDAR data from the Global Ecosystem Dynamic Investigation (GEDI) and decision rules. An Overall Accuracy (OA) of 84.53% was achieved for overstory mapping for the composition of Vegetation Indices (VIs), Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) textures, vertical transmit–horizontal receive (VH) of Sentinel-1, and elevation, integrated with biophysical models. Cropland, urban, non-fuel, and various forest classes, particularly evergreen needle-leaved forests, demonstrated outstanding performance, achieving F1 scores ranging from 83% to 100%. Finally, a rule-based model was established using Relative Height (RH) metrics from GEDI L2A data to estimate the height and type of understory defined in FHFCS with an OA of 69.2%. The RH metrics and decision rules proved a significantly effective and easy-to-interpret approach for estimating understory type and height in the absence of airborne LiDAR data. This three-step methodology provides a simple and efficient approach to large-scale overstory and understory mapping using multispectral, radar, and LiDAR data, which may facilitate both surface and crown fire simulation."

 High-accuracy digital elevation models (DEMs) are essential for remote sensing and geospatial analysis, yet integrating multi-source data over large and complex terrains remains challenging. To address these challenges, this study presents the Multi-source Data Joint Processing (MDJP) framework. This framework establishes a systematic way for correcting DEM errors of varying quality and integrating multi-source data, leveraging deep learning-based calibration and spatially adaptive fusion techniques to enhance DEM accuracy and consistency in large and complex regions. For calibration, our proposed DEM calibration model (DemFormer) combines a lightweight Transformer module with a bagging decision-tree network in a stacking framework, specifically designed to enhance the stability and accuracy of DEM elevation error predictions. For fusion, our DEM fusion model (DemFusion) employs spatial autocorrelation analysis and KD-Tree clustering to compute optimal fusion weights, effectively integrating complementary elevation information from multiple DEM sources. We evaluate the MDJP framework using four widely used global DEMs—Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM), TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurements (TanDEM-X), Advanced Land Observing Satellite World 3D-30 m (AW3D30)—each at 1-arc second (∼30 m) resolution. The Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) elevation data serves as the independent reference dataset for assessment. Our experiments, conducted in Guangdong Province, China, and the Northern Territory of Australia, demonstrate that the DemFormer model reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) by 18.38 %, 17.28 %, 54.53 %, and 65.24 % for TanDEM-X, AW3D30, SRTM, and ASTER, respectively. Furthermore, the DemFusion model further refines the results, and the fused DEM had better accuracy than other DEMs in Guangdong and the Northern Territory. These findings underscore the robustness of our approach and establish a new benchmark for DEM calibration and fusion, with significant implications for geospatial analysis and environmental monitoring."

 The imaging features of oil spills in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images have significant differences due to factors such as marine environment, SAR sensors, oil film thickness and types, which makes it difficult to obtain a generalized model, and the limited number of SAR images obtained from new oil spill events hampers the effective training of deep learning networks. To solve these issues, an enhanced unsupervised domain adaptation with iterative pseudo-label refinement (EUDA-PLR) approach is proposed for inter-event oil spill SAR image segmentation. Specifically, the freely downloaded and collected Sentinel-1 and ERS-1/2 oil spill historical data are used as source domains, respectively, which are migrated to each new oil spill event with limited training samples based on adversarial training to improve the timeliness and accuracy of processing new oil spill events. Subsequently, the target domain is divided more rationally by combining the knowledge of the resolution and polarization mode of the satellite images, the wind speed information of the marine environment, and the computable oil-seawater power ratio. Finally, high-probability oil spill features are stored and updated based on top-K marginal probabilities to improve the completeness of oil spill features in the pseudo-labeling of strong samples in the target domain, and adversarial training is utilized to enhance the ability to extract oil spill features from weak samples in the target domain. EUDA-PLR is applicable to a variety of current mainstream SAR satellites. In the experiments, the source domain data contains the Sentinel-1 dataset from 2014 to 2021 and the ERS-1/2 dataset from 1991 to 2002, and the target domain data contains the GF-3 dataset of an oil spill event in the Bohai Bay region in 2018, the GF-3 and COSMO-SkyMed dataset of an oil spill event in the South China Sea region in 2019, the GF-3 dataset for an oil spill event in the East China Sea region in 2020, and the Radarsat-2 dataset for an oil spill event in the Bohai Bay region in 2021.

 The automated extraction of building facade footprints (BFFs) is a critical task in surveying and remote sensing. Existing methods primarily use mobile laser scanning point cloud as the data source, with limited methods utilizing airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. This is mainly because current methods require explicit building extraction and wall detection, and the facade points in ALS point clouds are naturally sparse and prone to incompleteness, leading to insufficient robustness in rule-based wall extraction. To address this challenge, this paper presents an end-to-end method named deep projective prediction (DPP), which directly predicts BFF masks from ALS point clouds, avoiding explicit extraction of buildings and facades, thereby simplifying the BFF extraction process. Meanwhile, we introduce a back-projective attention (BPAtt) module that guides the decoding process while performing differentiable projections, enhancing the model’s sensitivity to projected feature locations. Additionally, a sparse feature completion (SFC) strategy is proposed to alleviate the impact of point cloud sparsity on footprint mask prediction. To validate the effectiveness of the DPP and facilitate relevant future research, an ALS-based BFF dataset is established, which provides more than 3k BFF annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DPP achieves promising results on the BFF extraction task.

 Under anthropogenic disturbances and global warming, coral reef ecosystems are degrading, and there is growing concern about the changes in benthic habitats in shallow coral reef waters. As an essential parameter, bottom reflectance can be used to indicate the health of benthic habitats in coral reefs. However, accurately determining bottom reflectance from satellite data remains challenging. This study presents an equation-based analytical method to estimate the bottom reflectance from high-spatial-resolution multispectral images in shallow coral reef waters by establishing two equations independent of bottom type and water depth. With the required parameters estimated from the sampling pixels of the multi-spectral image, the bottom reflectance data for the blue and green bands were derived by solving the two equations without a prior knowledge of bottom types, water properties, and water depths. To evaluate the method, simulated remote-sensing reflectance datasets from various combinations of the water properties, depths, and bottom types were used to derive the bottom reflectance. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the derived bottom reflectance in the blue band were generally <0.02 for most cases, except when the colored dissolved organic matter spectral absorption coefficient at the 440 nm wavelength [aCDOM (440)] was 0.1 m−1 and concentration of chlorophyll (CCHL) was ≥0.5 μg/L. Comparatively, the lower RMSEs in the green band were observed only when aCDOM(440) < 0.05 m−1, concentration of non-algal particles (CNAP) < 0.25 mg/L, and CCHL < 0.5 μg/L. Furthermore, the proposed method was applied to the two real satellite multispectral images to derive the bottom reflectance. By visually comparing to the subsurface reflectance images and validating with the field-measured reflectance data, we demonstrated that the satellite derived bottom reflectance in the blue and green bands was accurate in both magnitude and shape by the proposed method. Finally, the impacts of the spatial inhomogeneity of the water properties, purity of sampling pixels for estimating the band ratio of the total diffused attenuation coefficients, and errors in the radiometric correction on the bottom reflectance retrieval were discussed and analyzed."

 Considering the importance of greenspace for the health and life of urban citizens, different levels of greenspace exposure (GE) have received increasing attention. However, the understanding of human travel-related greenspace exposure is still limited, especially the lack of quantitative description of the fine-grained dynamics of greenspace exposure for active travel. Therefore, this study aims to quantify and analyse the spatio-temporal dynamics and equality of greenspace exposure during daily travel using dockless bike-sharing data in Beijing. Firstly, this study analysed the spatio-temporal patterns and community structure of bike-sharing travel using graph networks. Second, the daily travel-related greenspace exposure dynamics were estimated using a population-weighted exposure model. Finally, the spatial heterogeneity and equality of greenspace exposure during daily travel were assessed. The results show that greenspace exposure is shaped by both human mobility and greenspace distribution. Greenspace exposure is higher during the daytime than the early morning, and there are no significant changes of the average greenspace exposure across weekdays and weekends. In addition, there is an imbalance between greenspace coverage and exposure, with high greenspace coverage not implying high greenspace exposure and vice versa. Areas with lower greenspace coverage (less than 30 %) occurred for more than 80 % of the travels. We also found significant inequality of greenspace exposure during daily travel, with an average Gini index above 0.50. Driven by human mobility, inequality varied over time, with the highest inequality occurring between midnight and early morning, when the Gini index is higher than 0.65. This study provides a detailed understanding of greenspace exposure in active travel modes and may offer valuable insights for urban greenspace planning and health-oriented mobility strategies."

 Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a critical parameter for climate studies and land surface process models as it indicates ground surface temperature variations across landscapes and timescales. However, satellite-based LST products derived from infrared sensors suffer from substantial missing values due to extensive cloud covers on the Earth’s surface. Traditional methods rely heavily on numerical LST simulations for gap-filling, but the latency significantly limits the timeliness of gapless LST products. In this study, a novel deep learning method called the Spatio-Temporal Attention Network (STAN) was proposed, which was based on a U-Net architecture but enhanced with two unique feature extraction modules for capturing spatially and temporally dependent LST variations. Unlike many previous methods depending highly on numerical simulations, STAN reconstructs LST relying on spatiotemporal context information learned from historical memories, enabling more efficient LST reconstruction in a more timely manner. Ground validation results demonstrate better performance of STAN over other companion methods, with root-mean-square errors of 1.99 K and 2.89 K under clear and cloudy sky respectively, when reconstructing LST data collected from the Chinese Fengyun-4A geostationary satellite in the Yangtze River Delta. Intercomparison studies and error analysis also confirm the superiority of STAN, showing high LST reconstruction accuracy across different land covers and seasons. Overall, the proposed STAN method offers a much more efficient solution to facilitate timely LST reconstruction, and the method can also be easily transferred to other parameters with significant spatio-temporal variation context."

 Scholars have documented that perceived safety of the visual built environment (VBE) can influence human behaviors. The dual developments of street view imagery (SVI) and deep learning techniques offer a cost-effective approach to measure perceived safety. However, current SVI-based perception models often lack specific definitions of perceived safety and demographic information when collecting data for model training. Furthermore, these models are rarely validated by onsite perception evaluations, which undermines their credibility.Given these gaps, this study builds a localized crowdsourcing survey to train crime-related and barrier-related perceived safety of the VBE captured by SVIs, and compares model-predicted perceptions with onsite perceptions. This study specifically focuses on their ability to represent onsite perceptions and examines gender differences as a test case in safety perception. This study recruits over 1,800 participants living in the Greater Toronto Area to rate SVIs in terms of crime-related and barrier-related perceived safety.Pearson correlation coefficients reveal a positive but weak correlation between female and male safety perceptions, indicating some consistency while highlighting potential gender differences in safety perceptions. Machine-learning perception models are then trained using this localized SVI survey. Model-predicted perceptions are further validated to assess their alignments with onsite perceptions at sampling locations. The results show that model-predicted perceptions do not exactly match onsite perceptions but align better when less stringent criteria are applied (within ± 1 scale point).In short, this study underscores the necessity of gender inclusivity and a clear definition of safety terms when using SVIs to model perceptions. While SVI-based perception models are cost-effective, the predicted perceptions cannot yet fully substitute onsite perceptions, necessitating broader research to refine the effectiveness."

It combines spatial pattern analysis with temporal trend detection to comprehensively evaluate UGSs-LST relationships in Algiers from 2004 to 2022, addressing a common limitation in the literature where these approaches are often treated separately.

Findings reveal a 38% decrease in green spaces and a 10% reduction in agricultural land, accompanied by increased urbanization. Strong negative correlations between some LMs and LST were observed, with PLAND (Percentage of Landscape) explaining 61% of LST variability at an optimal 600-meter scale. This medium-sized scale differs from previous findings in other regions, highlighting the importance of context-specific analysis.

 China, despite being a leading producer of potatoes, has a potato yield below the global average, primarily due to inefficient nutrient management practices. Remote sensing provides a non-invasive and large-scale approach to monitor crop nutrient status, offering an efficient alternative to traditional plant tissue analysis. However, the generalization of foliar nutrient models is often constrained by factors such as growth stages and planting cultivars. Transfer learning offers a powerful solution by utilizing knowledge acquired from one task to enhance performance in related one, addressing challenges in model generalizability. Here, we investigated the potential of integrating various transfer learning techniques with partial least squares regression (PLSR) for retrieving three key potato foliar nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) across five growth stages (emergence, tuber initiation, early tuber bulking, mid-tuber bulking and tuber maturation).

Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in code generation tasks, they often encounter issues such as refusal to code or hallucination in geospatial code generation due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge and code corpora. To address these challenges, this paper presents and open-sources the GeoCode-PT and GeoCode-SFT corpora, along with the GeoCode-Eval evaluation dataset. Additionally, by leveraging QLoRA and LoRA for pretraining and fine-tuning, we introduce GeoCode-GPT-7B, the first LLM focused on geospatial code generation, fine-tuned from Code Llama-7B. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive geospatial code evaluation framework, incorporating option matching, expert validation, and prompt engineering scoring for LLMs, and systematically evaluate GeoCode-GPT-7B using the GeoCode-Eval dataset. Experimental results reveal that GeoCode-GPT significantly outperforms existing models across multiple tasks. For multiple-choice tasks, its accuracy improves by 9.1% to 32.1%. In code summarization, it achieves superior scores in completeness, accuracy, and readability, with gains ranging from 1.7 to 25.4 points. For code generation, its performance in accuracy, readability, and executability surpasses benchmarks by 1.2 to 25.1 points. Grounded in the fine-tuning paradigm, this study introduces and validates an approach to enhance LLMs in geospatial code generation and associated tasks. These findings extend the application boundaries of such models in geospatial domains and offer a robust foundation for exploring their latent potential."

This paper proposes the conceptualization and development of FAIR-oriented GIScience WfMS, aiming to incorporate the FAIR principles into the entire lifecycle of geospatial data processing and analysis. To enhance the findability and accessibility of workflows, the WfMS utilizes Harvard Dataverse to share all workflow-related digital resources, organized into workflow datasets, nodes, and case studies.

More importantly, the WfMS complies with the Common Workflow Language (CWL) standard to guarantee interoperability and reproducibility of workflows. It also enables the integration of diverse tools and software, supporting complex analyses that require multiple processing steps. This paper demonstrates the prototype of the GIScience WfMS and illustrates two geospatial science case studies, reflecting its flexibility in selecting appropriate techniques for various datasets and research goals.

 Soil texture is an essential attribute of soil structure, which plays an important role in evaluating soil fertility and carrying out agricultural production. This study developed a novel soil texture estimation model using ZiYuan-1-02D (ZY1-02D) satellite Advanced Hyperspectral Imager (AHSI), based on the mechanism of soil spectral mixing, that enables simultaneous estimation of the three soil texture attributes (clay, silt, and sand). Study area is located in the north-eastern region of China covering 1683.31 km2. To reduce data redundancy, we used correlation analysis and Competitive Adaptive Reweighted Sampling (CARS) algorithms to select sensitive spectral features of soil texture, and excluded spectral bands that are strongly influenced by other soil physicochemical properties. Finally, the spatial distribution map and classification map of soil texture have been generated for the study area. We also used AHSI/GaoFen-5 (GF-5) satellite images to further validate the generalizability of the model. The results suggest that the model can be used in the estimation of soil texture, and the developed novel model can effectively reflect the spatial distribution characteristics of surface soil texture attributes. The R2 values of all outcomes for inverting three texture attributes were larger than 0.5, with silt exhibiting the best estimation effect (R2 = 0.79, RMSE = 6.46 %, RPD = 2.19).

 The integration of Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) data with Optical Photogrammetric Satellite Stereo Imagery (OPSSI) for Block Adjustment (BA) has emerged as a novel approach for generating large-area, high-accuracy Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). However, owing to the discrepancies between these two data platforms and the systematic errors of their sensors, errors arise in the BA fusion outcomes during the matching process of the two datasets. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a method aimed at enhancing the accuracy of the BA process. Initially, the multi-characteristic constraint is used to filter the ICESat-2 ATL08 product to obtain control points and check points. Subsequently, the Terrain Matching Correction is applied to control points, and then integrated with the GF-7 OPSSI for BA to generate DEM. Ultimately, the check points are employed to assess the accuracy of the established DEM. Experiments in a 2,000 km2 test area in the Wuding River Basin show that: (1) The inclusion of ICESat-2 data has remarkably enhanced the accuracy of DEM modeling utilizing GF-7 OPSSI, and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) has been reduced from the range of 5–10 m to 2–6 m. (2) Multi-characteristic constraint filtering is crucial for the identification of high quality ICESat-2 control points in flat and low relief areas. When implementing this filtering method, the established criteria should comprehensively consider both the quantity and the spatial distribution of control points to ensure optimal results. (3) Terrain Matching Correction on ICESat-2 data has effectively elevated the vertical accuracy of DEM modeling, particularly in regions with flat terrain. The RMSE of the vertical accuracy in such areas can be decreased by 1–3 m. In summary, the integration of spaceborne laser altimeter data with OPSSI holds immense significance for the production of large-scale and high-accuracy DEMs, offering a promising solution for terrain modeling and analysis on regional scales."

 High-resolution (≤10 m) digital elevation models (DEMs) are essential for obtaining accurate terrain information and are integral to geographic analysis. However, a majority of currently available DEMs datasets possess a relatively coarse spatial resolution (≥30 m), which limits the terrain features and details that can be accurately represented. Furthermore, due to the substantial production costs associated with high-resolution DEMs, these products are often unavailable or difficult to obtain in numerous countries and regions, particularly in less developed areas. Here, we introduced a novel method named the Spatial interpolation knowledge-constrained Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (SikCGAN). This method can generate high-resolution DEMs from publicly available data sources, specifically the photons collected by the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) carried by the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2). SikCGAN takes ICESat-2/ATLAS photons as the single data source and incorporates spatial interpolation knowledge constraints into a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) to generate DEMs at a 10-m spatial resolution. A case study conducted in boreal mountainous regions demonstrates SikCGAN’s remarkable ability to produce high-resolution and highly accurate DEMs, with an MAE of 22.09 m and RMSE of 29.25 m, which reduced error by 37 %–46 % compared to benchmark methods. Additionally, the results reveal that SikCGAN has remarkable resiliece to interference, including variations in spatial distance, terrain slope, and ATL03 photon count, this further elucidates and substantiates the effectiveness of SikCGAN. These findings demonstrate that SikCGAN provides innovative solutions for generating new high-resolution DEMs products and potentially supplementing existing ones to overcome their limitations."

 Tidal flats and their associated sandbanks are dynamic environments crucial for ecological balance and biodiversity. Monitoring their evolutionary history and topographic changes is important to better understand their dynamic mechanisms and predict their future status.

 Accurate measurement of high-resolution snow depth (SD) is crucial for regional ecohydrology and climate studies. Passive microwave remote sensing is an effective technique for SD retrieval on global or regional scales. However, its low spatial resolution limits its application in various fields. Additionally, the complex effects of multiple factors in the microwave radiation process pose a significant challenge for accurate SD retrieval as SD increases.

 An in-depth comparative analysis of hailfall and nonhailfall clouds during a severe storm in Laixi city, Shandong Province, China, is conducted in this study. By integrating radar observations and mesoscale numerical simulations, key distinguishing features between the two cloud types are identified. The results indicate that the strong-echo top height and cloud top height of hailfall clouds are lower than those of nonhailfall clouds, which contradicts the traditional concept that the cloud top height and the strong-echo top height are proportional to the hailfall potential. This study emphasizes the importance of the vertical structure of clouds and environmental conditions in identifying hail storms. Low differential reflectivity (ZDR) (≤0) and low correlation coefficient (ρHV) (<0.9) values are observed near the strong-echo core of hailfall clouds, whereas the strong-echo core of nonhailfall clouds is characterized by high ZDR (>3 dB) and high ρHV (>0.95) values. There is also a clear difference between the evolution characteristics of ZDR and ZH at the early development stage: ZDR initially increases and then decreases, with a decrease in ZDR accompanied by an increase in ZH, indicating the transformation of liquid water into hail. In contrast, ZDR of nonhailfall clouds continues to increase after ZH increases from high altitudes to the surface, suggesting the dominance of large raindrops. Further analysis reveals that supercooled water in hailfall clouds is concentrated at the forefront of the hail zone, which is critical for hail formation, whereas nonhailfall clouds lack this feature. This study provides new insights into the early identification and warning of hailfall clouds, contributes to an increased accuracy in hail disaster warnings and provides a solid foundation for artificial hail suppression."

By expanding the scope beyond CDR specific assessment frameworks, we identify and derive valuable insights and approaches that can inform their refinement. Following a three-step approach, we first conducted a preceding scoping review to determine key requirements for holistic assessments. Second, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify a broad range of assessment frameworks for climate responses. Third, based on a qualitative content analysis, we examined how these frameworks address the previously identified key requirements. The results reveal that existing assessment frameworks often lack a consistent and transparent conceptual and operational structure. This can lead to misinterpretations and misunderstandings. Policy-relevant aspects such as the integration of temporal dynamics and portfolio assessments, including the investigation of synergies and trade-offs, are rarely addressed, although promising approaches are emerging. Following the current discussion to adjust assessment frameworks for CDR, future research should incorporate both short- and long-term temporal dynamics and strengthen the inclusion of ethical and social science perspectives. By synthesizing existing approaches and identifying critical gaps, this review provides guidance towards more robust and transparent assessment frameworks, supporting well-informed decision-making in the context of CDR."

Currently, its deployment is largely driven by voluntary actions from private organizations rather than by policy mandates. In this formative phase of the CDR sector, the important role these organizations play is acknowledged, yet there are scarce empirical insights into their perspectives. This study explores the role of private companies in shaping the early CDR innovation ecosystem by conducting 79 interviews with senior practitioners (suppliers, purchasers/marketplaces, investors) actively involved in CDR markets. Examining their motivations, I find themes that range from personal upbringing and caring for the following generations to being catalytic in the creation of a new industry. All motivations are grounded in the recognition of CDR as an important component of global climate change mitigation. Identified challenges stretch across the categories of technology, organizations, policy and regulation, ecosystem, finances, and the public eye. This presents a complex picture, as all actors seek to solve a multi-faceted, concurrent coordination and scaling problem while dealing with a challenging set of uncertainties. For suppliers, the main challenge is to coordinate with other actors while proving their technology and not losing track of their long-term strategies. Investors and purchasers currently struggle to formulate a case that is suitable for their organizations in the absence of regulation. The analysis underscores the underexplored yet significant role of private organizations in CDR governance and market development, thus addressing a gap in the existing literature. In conclusion, I offer directions for measures that support a timely, efficient, and responsible scale-up of CDR."

A review of futures-thinking applied in the quest for navigating sustainability transformations,"There is a growing call for transformations to remain within safe and just Earth system boundaries. Coherent visions of desired futures can help motivate and orient such transformations towards Sustainability, but the nature of these transformed futures is not well understood. This gap has inspired a growing body of research on ‘preferable’ or ‘desirable’ futures, which can help to unpack what endpoints such transformations to sustainability could entail and what is needed to get there. In this paper, we adopt a mixed methods approach to review the research literature focused on transformative futures so as to gain a general overview of the field and then undertake two qualitative analyses: (i) unpacking the methods, terms and types of outputs produced; and (ii) capturing emergent themes, commonalities and divergences in what is deemed to be a sustainable transformation in the future based on normative visions from either North, South or Global perspectives. Our findings show that the literature landscape on explorative scenarios has significantly increased in the past ten years with most publications led by authors in the Global North. From the fraction of studies that describe desirable futures, visions highlight social, environmental and equity dimensions, but nuances were found between North and South. The visions that suggest the most transformative potential seek a more harmonious human-nature relationship and consider outcomes holistically, but only a fraction offer actual ‘alternatives’ to the status quo. We find that several gaps remain at the interface of biodiversity/ecosystems and justice, or the integration and impact of diverse knowledges and cultures. Addressing these in participatory, just and creative ways seems of utmost urgency. We hope this review can offer a glimpse of how futures-thinking can contribute to research and action on sustainability transformations, and the insights can inform and inspire future research."

The concept relies on artificially generated sea spray aerosols (SSA) at the ocean surface and their transport in sufficient quantities to low-level maritime clouds. A portion of the SSA that reaches cloud height can act as additional cloud condensation nuclei and modify cloud microphysical properties, potentially reducing the amount of solar radiation reaching the sea surface. Although modelling data supports the MCB concept, field experiments demonstrating the dispersion of artificially produced SSA to clouds have not been previously reported. Here, we show that within a field of low-level trade wind cumulus-type clouds, an aerosol plume generated at the sea surface on board a research vessel was rapidly advected to cloud base height. Aircraft measurements conducted during two different sampling strategies, detected the aerosol plume from the vessel’s sea water atomisation system just below cloud bases at 700–900 m altitudes. For an estimated surface level aerosol production rate of 4 × 1014 s−1, aerosol concentrations at cloud base were detected with peak number concentrations of up to ∼1 × 103 cm−3. Although such production rates of aerosol particles are orders of magnitude less than what is envisioned for any practical implementation of MCB, our results indicate that cloud perturbation experiments should now be possible using surface-produced SSA."

Often, only a few technology options are used, principally bioenergy, carbon capture and sequestration, as well as afforestation and reforestation. If climate change mitigation is based on energy crops, the impact of CDR on area demand may be significant. The CDR-specific area demand is usually not presented. This study compares a CDR technology portfolio prioritising biomass-based solutions to portfolios prioritising low cost, low energy demand, high security, low area demand, and high technology readiness in terms of area demand. The CDR portfolio model is linked with an energy system model to include the area required for solar photovoltaics and wind power for the energy supply of the whole energy–industry–CDR system. A quantitative and qualitative comparison is made using the definitions of gross and net area demand, and the differentiation of CDR routes into biogenic, bio-technical, and technical options. Gross and net area demand differentiate the total area, including spacing or gathering areas (gross) and built-up areas (or areas unsuitable for biodiversity) (net). We consider total CDR demands of 500 GtCO2 for a 1.5°C climate target and 1750 GtCO2 for a 1.0°C climate target by 2100. The results indicate the advantage of technical CDR options regarding area demand compared to biomass-based CDR from energy crops. Including the energy supply for the whole energy–industry–CDR system does not lead to significant area demand. The net area demand can be kept at ca. 1.0% (1.5°C) and below 1.4% (1.0°C) of the total land area, except for the biomass-prioritising portfolio, which has a 3% net land area demand for both climate targets. Biogenic and biotechnical CDR options are estimated to require up to 9.7% of today’s global cropland by the end of the century (net area). The additional net area demand for the 1.0°C target versus the 1.5°C target is comparably small."

 Land surface energy, water and carbon fluxes are key for understanding Earth’s climate system, yet global continuous high resolution fluxes datasets remain scarce. In this study, we present a global long-term (2000–2020) hourly dataset of terrestrial water-energy-carbon fluxes, generated by integrating model simulations, in-situ measurements, and machine learning with remote sensing and meteorological data. First the integrated STEMMUS-SCOPE model was deployed to simulate land surface fluxes over 170 sites with in-situ measurements. The modeled variables include net radiation (Rn), latent heat flux (LE), sensible heat flux (H), soil heat flux (G), gross primary productivity (GPP), solar-induced fluorescence in 685 nm and 740 nm (SIF685, SIF740). Next optimal interpolation was applied to merge Rn, LE, and H from STEMMUS-SCOPE simulations with eddy covariance observations. The optimal interpolated Rn, LE, H alongside STEMMUS-SCOPE simulated G, GPP, SIF685, SIF740 were then used as training data-pairs to develop the emulator using a multivariate Random Forest (RF) regression algorithm, referred to as Random Forest with Optimal Interpolation (RF_OI) to predict fluxes with global gridded remote sensing and meteorological data. The results demonstrate that RF_OI can estimate land surface fluxes with Pearson Correlation Coefficient score (r-score) values higher than 0.88 except for GPP (Rn 0.99, LE 0.88, H 0.92, G 0.92, GPP 0.8, SIF685 0.99, SIF740 0.99). The testing results on independent stations (which were not included for developing emulators) show r-score values higher than 0.8. The feature importance indicates that incoming shortwave radiation, surface soil moisture, and leaf area index are top predictor variables that determine the prediction performance.

Partial nitrification (PN) is a key approach to provide nitrite for anammox or denitritation during sBNR, and its stability is the precondition for achieving robust nitrogen removal performance. However, maintaining a stable mainstream PN process has been a long-standing challenge. This review analyzes the mainstream PN process from a microbial ecology perspective, focusing on the niche differentiation among nitrifiers. First, we propose that mainstream PN systems are ecologically unstable, and the failure of the mainstream PN process due to the reactivation of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) can be regarded as a behavior to restore system stabilization. Thus, maintaining mainstream PN systems primarily relies on enhancing the niche differentiation between ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and NOB. We then summarize the realized niches of indigenous nitrifiers within nitrification systems and discuss their ecophysiological characteristics (e.g., cell structure and substrate affinity) that define their specific ecological niches. By comparing the niche breadths of AOB and NOB on various niche axes, we further discuss their niche differentiation and identify the different responses of AOB (resistance) and NOB (resilience) to exogenous perturbations. Finally, we propose outlook for achieving a stable mainstream PN process through an ecological lens. This review provides ecological insights into the instability of the mainstream PN process, which is intended to guide the derivation of optimized strategies from a single-factor approach to integrated solutions."

This study presents a detailed investigation of a passivation effect unique to low-water conditions during the carbonation of forsterite (Mg2SiO4) and highlights the importance of hygroscopicity in influencing metal silicate carbonation. Integrated in situ and ex situ experimental results showed that the decrease in the carbonation rate of forsterite observed after ∼10 h in humid supercritical CO2 (50 °C, 90 bar) correlates with a reduction in water film thickness, and in particular, weakly hydrogen bonded adsorbed water that facilitates ion transport. We attribute the decrease in thickness to a drop in the concentrations of hygroscopic Mg2+, MgHCO3+, and HCO3– ions within the film as the predominate forsterite carbonation product evolves from amorphous magnesium carbonate (AMC) to magnesite (MgCO3). When more soluble AMC is present, hygroscopic ion concentrations are higher, drawing more water from the supercritical phase to the forsterite surface.

Herein, we performed a comparative analysis of medical face masks (MFMs) with calcium carbonate (CaCO3) additives against those devoid of CaCO3 to understand their roles in microplastic release. Briefly, our investigation employed surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to examine micro- and nanoplastic release, while the stereoscopic characterization of mixing states of additives in microplastic was accomplished through a simulated Raman scattering (SRS). We also pioneered a three-dimensional imaging (3D imaging) method for investigating the internal aging of plastic using SRS, which clearly revealed the link between inorganic additives inside polymers and photoaging. We found that inorganic additives substantially accelerate the photoaging of the plastic materials through multiple pathways and induce more small-sized microplastics. Follow-up radical quenching experiments confirmed carbonate radicals as the main cause of this phenomenon. Our research exposes the hazardous potential of inorganic additives in masks to amplify the emission of microplastics."

This study investigates the uptake of 61 PM chemicals by and distribution in rocket (Eruca sativa) in pot experiments from spiked water and treated municipal wastewater. The relative uptake (RU; share of theoretical maximum uptake) into rocket exceeded 10% for 18 PM chemicals, among others, perfluoropropionic acid (72% RU), trifluoroacetic acid (67%), and tetrafluoroborate (40%). The median plant uptake (p ≤ 0.05) and translocation factor (p < 0.0001) were significantly higher for PM chemicals than reported for less polar chemicals into leafy greens from literature. Irrigation of rocket with reclaimed municipal wastewater resulted in the accumulation of 23 analytes. However, a toxicological threshold of concern approach showed that no critical exposure is reached for these compounds at normal consumption levels. Comparing wastewater treatment plant effluent concentrations with plant uptake data led to a prioritization of PM chemicals, which might be especially relevant for agricultural wastewater reuse and should be considered in risk assessment."

Here, we examine uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS) with portable, active air samplers as a novel means of capturing aerosolized Coccidioides and characterizing emissions and exposure risk. We sampled in September 2023 in eastern San Luis Obispo County, California, in an area with confirmed Coccidioides immitis in soils. We completed 41 20 min flights across 14 sites using UAS equipped with an 8 L/min bioaerosol sampler and a low-cost particulate matter sensor. We sampled source soils and air under ambient conditions using one UAS at 1–10 m above ground level, and under a simulated high-dust event using two UAS, one at <2 m height and one at 5–12 m. We detected Coccidioides DNA in 2 of 41 air samples (4.9%), both under ambient conditions at 8 m above ground level, representing the highest known height of airborne Coccidioides detection.

In this study, we systematically examine the key factors─supporting electrolyte composition, charging voltage, and discharging voltage─that impact boron removal performance in both setups, with the insights provided aiding both process optimization and full-scale application. Our results indicate that, while the BPM-assisted system operates at a relatively lower cell voltage and consumes approximately 67% the amount of the energy used by the AEM-assisted system, the requirement for additional salt for sufficient conductivity and water dissociation is impractical for removal of boron from the RO permeate. Furthermore, due to the high cost of BPMs, the overall operational cost of the BPM-assisted system is ∼5-fold higher than that of the AEM-assisted system. Our results further show that applying a reverse potential (−1 V) during discharge desorbs only ∼60–65% of the boron, suggesting that electrode/membrane replacement is needed to maintain activity. Overall, while membrane-assisted electrosorption shows promise for boron removal from RO permeate, significant advancements are needed for both configurations to improve boron removal rates, reduce electrode and membrane costs, and decrease energy demands."

The concentrations of circulating omega-3 PUFA (including total omega-3 and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) were measured by using a targeted high-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics platform. Land-use regression models were used to estimate concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) for each individual. Additionally, systemic inflammation levels were assessed using the low-grade inflammation score (INFLA-score) to elucidate the potential mechanism. We noted that the observed effects could be modified by circulating omega-3 PUFA levels (P-interaction < 0.05). Specifically, the significant pollutants-COPD associations were mainly observed in the lower circulating omega-3 PUFA groups. In contrast, there was no statistical evidence for increased COPD risk associated with air pollutants in subjects with higher circulating omega-3 PUFA. Mediation analysis further indicated that circulating omega-3 PUFA modified the air pollution-associated COPD risk might partly by reducing systemic inflammation.

Here, we utilize seismic and geodetic observations to enhance model resolution, estimate the finite slip of the mainshock, and test a multi‐segment, geologically realistic fault geometry. Our refined model finds a lower rupture velocity and longer rise times than typical for an event of this magnitude.

Here, the authors show that elevated PDGFRα signaling causes joint fusion in mice, as joint progenitors form fibrocartilage instead of synovial joint tissues. 
 Synovial joints develop from mesenchymal structures called interzones, with progenitor cells differentiating into specialized cartilaginous and fibrous tissues of the joint. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRα) is a tyrosine kinase expressed by cells of the limb bud, but its role in limb development is unknown. To investigate PDGFRα function, we generated mice expressing mutant PDGFRα with a point mutation (D842V) that increases receptor signaling. Mutant hindlimbs are immobile with knee joints fused by cartilage and lacking ligaments and menisci. The interzone marker Gdf5 is initially expressed at E12.5 but is downregulated thereafter, suggesting a defect in interzone maintenance. Omics analysis of the joint tissues identifies ectopic cartilage matrix expressing genes for cartilage and fibrotic tissue. Thus, elevated PDGFRα signaling corrupts joint development by downregulating Gdf5 and redirecting interzone progenitors into a fibrocartilage fate. This suggests that tight regulation of tyrosine kinase activity is necessary for the development of the mouse knee joint.

 Swine Influenza A Virus (IAV-S) poses a significant burden to both the pork industry and public health. Current vaccines against IAV-S are infrequently updated and induce strain-specific immunity. Computational platforms have recently emerged as a promising strategy to develop new-age vaccines. Here, we describe the Epigraph, a computationally derived and epitope optimized set of vaccine immunogens. When compared to wildtype immunogens (WT) and a commercial comparator (FluSure XP®), pigs immunized with Epigraph demonstrate significantly improved breadth and magnitude of antibody responses. Further, pigs immunized with Epigraph show more robust and a wider breadth of cross-reactive cell-mediated immune responses than pigs immunized with WT immunogens. In an experimental infection model, Epigraph immunized pigs demonstrate a significant reduction of clinical disease, lower shedding of infectious virus, reduction of lung lesions, and lower microscopic immunopathology compared to the other immunization groups. These data support the continued investigation of computationally designed and epitope optimized vaccine immunogens against influenza A virus.

This study shows that these phases arise from species’ spatial distributions, providing a unified framework to predict phase transitions across ecosystems. 
 The nested species-area relationship, obtained by counting species in increasingly larger areas in a nested fashion, exhibits robust and recurring qualitative and quantitative patterns. When plotted in double logarithmic scales it shows three phases: rapid species increase at small areas, slower growth at intermediate scales, and faster rise at large scales. Despite its significance, the theoretical foundations of this pattern remain incompletely understood. Here, we develop a theory for the species-area relationship using extreme value theory, and show that the species-area relationship is a mixture of the distributions of minimum distances to a starting sampling focal point for each individual species. A key insight of our study is that each phase is determined by the geographical distributions of the species, i.e., their ranges, relative to the focal point, enabling us to develop a formula for estimating the number of species at phase transitions. We test our approach by comparing empirical species-area relationships for different continents and taxa with our predictions using Global Biodiversity Information Facility data. Although a SAR reflects the underlying biological attributes of the constituent species, our interpretations and use of the extreme value theory are general and can be widely applicable to systems with similar spatial features.

Here, the authors explore large-scale pattern of plant nutrient resorption and its relationship with soil nutrient supply across Tibetan alpine permafrost region. 
 Nutrient resorption is an important strategy for nutrient conservation, especially in permafrost ecosystems where plant growth is limited by nutrients. Based on the measurements mainly derived from tropical, subtropical and temperate regions, current projections suggest that resorption efficiency is higher for leaf nitrogen (N) than for phosphorus (P) in cold regions. However, these projections have not been fully validated due to the lack of observations in permafrost ecosystems. Here, we carry out a large-scale sampling campaign along a permafrost transect on the Tibetan Plateau. Our results show that, in contrast with the prevailing view, resorption efficiency is higher for leaf P than N in permafrost ecosystems (75.1 ± 1.8% vs. 58.7 ± 1.5%; mean ± standard error). Our results also reveal that leaf P resorption efficiency is higher in permafrost ecosystems than in global herbaceous plants, while there is no difference for leaf N resorption efficiency. Interestingly, there is a trade-off between leaf N resorption efficiency and soil N mineralization rate, but no such pattern exists for P. These results illustrate the unique characteristics of plant nutrient resorption in permafrost ecosystems and advance our understanding of nutrient conservation strategies in little-studied permafrost regions.

 The spin-boson model, involving spins interacting with a bath of quantum harmonic oscillators, is a widely used representation of open quantum systems that describe many dissipative processes in physical, chemical and biological systems. Trapped ions present an ideal platform for simulating the quantum dynamics of such models, by accessing both the high-quality internal qubit states and the motional modes of the ions for spins and bosons, respectively. We demonstrate a fully programmable method to simulate dissipative dynamics of spin-boson models using a chain of trapped ions, where the initial temperature and the spectral densities of the boson bath are engineered by controlling the state of the motional modes and their coupling with qubit states. Our method provides a versatile and precise experimental tool for studying open quantum systems.

Here, the authors develop a network-based clustering method to predict subgroups of malignancies across disease subtypes. 
 Myeloid malignancies exhibit considerable heterogeneity with overlapping clinical and genetic features among subtypes. We present a data-driven approach that integrates mutational features and clinical covariates at diagnosis within networks of their probabilistic relationships, enabling the discovery of patient subgroups. A key strength is its ability to include presumed causal directions in the edges linking clinical and mutational features, and account for them aptly in the clustering. In a cohort of 1323 patients, we identify subgroups that outperform established risk classifications in prognostic accuracy. Our approach generalises well to unseen cohorts with classification based on our subgroups similarly offering advantages in predicting prognosis. Our findings suggest that mutational patterns are often shared across myeloid malignancies, with distinct subtypes potentially representing evolutionary stages en route to leukemia. With pancancer TCGA data, we observe that our modelling framework extends naturally to other cancer types while still offering improvements in subgroup discovery.

 There is concern that climate change might lead to abrupt and irreversible changes in parts of the Earth system at so-called tipping points. Theoretical considerations suggest that statistical measures can be used to detect early warning signals (EWSs) for reduced resilience, which could be interpreted as an increased proximity to climate tipping points. Here we discuss limitations of commonly used EWSs and their detection and discuss how alternative explanations can lead to resilience loss in the absence of tipping points. We argue for better testing of the existence of tipping points, beyond the application of EWSs, and propose a method to better quantify the probability of approaching tipping points using EWSs.

 In subduction zones, carbon-bearing fluids play a pivotal role in deep carbon cycling and global climate change. Given that Earth’s interior is dominated by silicates, the existence of aqueous carbon-silicon (C-Si) species is crucial for assessing the magnitude of return flux of carbon from subducting slabs to mantle wedges and ultimately Earth’s surface, yet it remains controversial. To resolve this controversy, we undertake a comprehensive in situ investigation of high pressure–temperature fluids employing optical cells and Raman spectroscopy under conditions comparable to those of previous studies. Under oxidizing conditions near the C-CO2 buffer, our findings show no evidence for C-Si species. Notably, under reducing conditions, a shoulder peak near the dominant CH4 peak, previously interpreted as evidence for C-Si speciation, emerges in high-temperature CH4-bearing fluids without silicates and even in pure CH4, suggesting it simply comes from CH4 hot bands. Therefore, C-Si species are unlikely in subduction-zone fluids.

 As the demand for single-use plastics rises, sustainable plastic management has become a pressing concern. Transforming plastic waste into value-added fuels is a promising waste-to-energy strategy that benefits environmental and energy security. In recent years, biochar-based catalysts (BBCs) have attracted increasing attention for their cost-effectiveness, well-developed pore structure, and effective surface functional groups in catalytic conversions of plastic waste into fuels. Many researchers have documented the successful utilization of biochar catalysts for efficient plastic waste valorization. However, a systematic review of biochar-based catalytic valorization of plastic waste into useful fuels is still missing. We assessed practical applications of biochar-based catalytic pyrolysis and advanced oxidation technologies, evaluating their performance from life-cycle and techno-economic perspectives. Machine learning was also introduced to design high-performance BBCs and optimize the plastic upcycling system.

 Given the global offshore wind farm (OWF) proliferation, we investigated the impact of OWFs on the marine food web. Using linear inverse modelling (LIM), we compared the OWF food web with two soft-sediment food webs nearby. Novel in situ data on species biomass and their isotopic composition were combined with literature data to construct food webs. Our findings highlight the prominent role of hard-substrate species on turbine foundations as organic material inputs for the food web. Hard substrate species account for approximately 26% of food source uptake from the water column and increase carbon deposition on the surrounding seafloor by ~10%. OWFs facilitate a novel food web with a higher productivity than expected based on standing biomass alone, as a result of numerous interactions between a diverse species community. Our study underscores profound effects of OWFs on marine ecosystems, suggesting the need for further research into their ecological impacts.

 Accurate and timely forest disturbance mapping at large-scale is crucial for ecosystem protection and management. Sentinel-1 SAR data, with its all-weather capability and fine spatial-temporal resolutions, offers unique advantages for timely mapping of forest disturbance. Although deep learning models have been used for this purpose, they still struggle to fully exploit Sentinel-1 data's potential due to challenges in extracting multi-scale features and capturing context in complex landscape patterns. The advent of vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offer new possibilities to improve large-scale forest disturbance mapping with Sentinel-1 data. However, trained with natural images, SAM had difficulty processing speckle noises in SAR and recognizing intricate forest disturbance patterns; additionally, challenges remained in developing model transfer strategies and improving model efficiency for large-scale applications. To address these issues, we propose SAMSR, a SAM-based framework adapted for forest disturbance mapping using time series Sentinel-1 data by adding CNN branches and cross-branch attention modules to enhance fine spatial details. Firstly, we evaluated SAMSR's performances against SAM, U-Net and DeepLabv3+ at four global disturbance hotspots with large variations in environmental conditions (Rondônia in Brazil, Guangxi in China, California in USA, and Hainan in China). Then, we test the model's transferability using fine-tuned transfer learning to identify the best transfer strategy and explore the potential of active learning to further enhance model efficiency. The results indicated that the SAMSR (IoU 0.50–0.78; F1 0.67–0.88) outperformed SAM, U-Net and DeepLabv3+ for about 23.08 %, 3.23 % and 1.59 % in IoU, respectively, while the multi-region model achieved optimal transfer performance (IoU 0.60–0.77; F1 0.75–0.87). Moreover, applying active learning can meet the saturation accuracy of traditional method with about 20 %–70 % less training samples, significantly reducing costs for fine-tuning the foundational model. This study thus provides a novel and efficient framework for large-scale forest disturbance monitoring at fine spatial-temporal resolutions, which could be critical for forest protection and ecological studies."

 Semantic segmentation models present significant work in land-use/land-cover (LULC) mapping. Even though vision transformers (ViT) with long-sequence interactions have recently emerged as popular solutions alongside convolutional neural networks (CNN), they remain less effective for high-resolution remote sensing data characterized by small volumes and rich heterogeneities. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN and ViT collaborated segmentation framework (CTSeg) to address these weaknesses. Following the encoder-decoder architecture, we first introduce an encoding backbone with multifarious attention mechanisms to respectively capture global and local contexts. It is designed with parallel dual branches where the position-relation aggregation (PRA) blocks and others with channel relations (CRA) form the CNN-based encoding module, whereas the ViT-based one comprises multi-stage window-shifted transformer (WST) blocks with cross-window interactions. We further explore the online knowledge distillation presented with pixel-wise and channel-wise feature distillation modules to facilitate bidirectional learning between the CNN and ViT backbones, supported by a well-designed loss decay strategy. In addition, we develop a multiscale feature decoding module to produce more high-quality segmentation predictions where the leveraged correlation-weighted fusions emphasize the heterogeneous feature representations. Extensive comparison and ablation studies on two benchmark datasets demonstrate its competitive performance in efficient LULC mapping."

 Accurately mapping crop types in smallholder farming regions is crucial for monitoring crop dynamics and estimating production but remains challenging, especially over large extents. Remote sensing based crop mapping studies in smallholder farming regions often focus on major crops and the challenge of mapping small fields. However, minor but possibly emerging crops are often overlooked, nor is the impact of environmental factors, such as water stress, on mapping accuracy considered. This study addresses these gaps by categorizing crop fields into different types and assessing mapping accuracy for both major and minor crops within each field type. We first categorized crop fields into four field types (big/small fields with/without water stress) based on field size and the shortwave infrared water stress index (SIWSI) derived from Sentinel-2 (S2). Crop mapping accuracies for different field types and crops (maize as a major crop and soybean as a minor crop) were compared at pixel-based (PB) and object-based (OB) levels using random forest classification applied to S2 and two additional publicly accessible multispectral datasets (PlanetScope with four bands (PS4) and eight bands (PS8)). The season-averaged SIWSI (SIWSImean) provided a useful categorization of field types, as it is sensitive to mapping accuracy and is independent from field size. Based on S2 data, big fields without water stress can be most accurately mapped (F1-score = 0.89 for maize and 0.85 for soybean), followed by small fields without water stress (0.85 and 0.68) and big fields with water stress (0.82 and 0.59), while small fields with water stress are the most challenging type (0.77 and 0.37). Despite that the use of PS8 data with higher spatial resolution and OB classification improved mapping accuracy for small soybean fields with water stress, limitations to map such fields remain (F1-score < 0.50). This study provides a new perspective on crop type mapping in smallholder farming regions by using a simple and relevant categorization of field types and offers valuable insights on potentials and limitations for large-scale crop type mapping using machine learning algorithms."

 Vegetation indices (VIs), with the advantages of being easy to understand, simple form, and robust, have emerged as a pivotal and widespread tool for monitoring and assessing vegetation health and dynamics. Decades of research have produced numerous VIs, broadening their use and impact across various fields, but possibly overwhelming users with too many options. This study conducted a bibliometric review of VI-related literature in the web of science (WOS) database since 1986, examining current trends and issues in data sources, geographic areas, eco-functional areas, applications, and technical methods. It also analyzed the correlation among 86 VIs from global satellite data and assessed the sensitivity of 16 VIs to different parameters using radiative transfer model simulations at leaf and canopy scales. This review revealed that (1) VI research accelerated since 1986, particularly after 2012, largely due to the availability of earth-observing satellite data and new VIs. (2) The central concern of VI is its sensitivity to vegetation parameters, with recent interest in complex terrain effects. (3) VI is difficult to distinguish structural and spectral information. Optimization of soil-adjusted vegetation indices (OSAVI) has the highest sensitivity to leaf area index (LAI), and Sentinel-2 red edge position (S2REP) has the highest sensitivity to chlorophyll among the 16 selected VIs. Overall, VI performance depends on band selection and formula, with an ideal VI balancing sensitivity to vegetation and interference resistance. VI Selection should be tailored to user needs, focusing on relevant vegetation parameters and the study area’s conditions."

We term this novel method Seasonally Inundated Distributed Scatterer InSAR (SIDS-InSAR).

 Land surface temperature (LST) is an indispensable factor for comprehending of surface equilibrium state on the Earth. In particular, satellites can continuously provide LST data and support the large-scale monitoring of LST with a high temporal resolution; however, satellite data may be easily contaminated by clouds. Previous satellite-based all-sky LST reconstruction approaches have inherent limitations, such as low temporal resolution and insufficient consideration of cloud effects. Therefore, this study aims to propose a novel methodology for all-sky 2-km hourly LST reconstruction from GEO-KOMPSAT-2A (GK2A) using machine learning and timely weighted accumulated radiation to reflect the temporal variation of cloud effects. The light gradient boosting machine approach used the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis-Land variables (i.e., LST, 2 m air temperature, evaporation, and wind), GK2A products (i.e., short and longwave radiation, and binary cloud cover), and auxiliary variables including geographic variables as independent variables. The GK2A LST and in situ measurements were used as dependent variables. The proposed model showed robust spatial agreement with GK2A LST under clear-sky conditions when conducting five-fold spatial cross-validation, with coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.97–0.99. In the leave one station-out cross-validation using 36 in situ data under all-sky conditions, the proposed model showed high performance with R2 values of 0.86–0.97, root mean square error values of 1.42–2.60 °C, and bias values of −0.49–0.23 °C. In a comparison of the proposed model with two scenarios and previous research investigating the effect of accumulated radiation, we demonstrated that the use of accumulated radiation was effective in reconstructing cloudy-sky LST, particularly during the daytime, as evident from the variable analysis conducted through Shapley additive explanations. Using the proposed model, we successfully reconstructed a spatiotemporally seamless LST, which can serve as a fundamental dataset for hourly heat-related research, such as hourly heat flow estimation and urban heat island analysis."

 Information regarding the spatial arrangement and extent of past habitats is important for understanding present biodiversity, restoration potential, and fighting extinction-debt effects. European landscapes have changed profoundly over recent decades, with the trend accelerating following World War 2. We develop a proof of concept for mapping historic habitat distribution for Switzerland from black and white aerial imagery compatible with the present-day habitat map. Recently available orthorectified 1946 aerial imagery (1 m resolution) was segmented based on spectral and shape characteristics for training areas (320–508 km2) representing the main biogeographical regions of Switzerland. Initial training data was derived by manual aerial orthoimage interpretation differentiating 15 habitat classes. A random forest model was trained to classify the segments using variables describing spectral information, image texture, segment shape, topography, climate, and anthropogenic influence. Classification accuracy was improved with additional training samples derived in a stepwise approach, applying three different sampling techniques. Highest class accuracies (producer’s and user’s accuracies ≥ 0.75) were achieved for the habitats ‘Standing water’, ‘Flowing water’, ‘Glaciers, permanent ice and snow’, and ‘Forests and other wooded land’. Particularly low user’s accuracies were found for ‘Wetlands’, ‘Hedges and tree rows’ and ‘Buildings’. The comparison to independent data further revealed minor differences in overall accuracy for the three different sampling strategies. Yet, map predictions sometimes varied substantially, indicating that the sampling strategies address different classification issues. Hence, we conclude that combining different sampling strategies for training data collection has the potential to improve the mapping, particularly in the case of multi-class classifications."

 Existing scene classification methods allocate the same computational resources, i.e., all model parameters in the neural network, to each remote sensing image whenever from any geographic scene. However, this might be redundant for images of certain scenes that are easy to discriminate, e.g., homogeneous scenes. This observation motivates us to propose an efficient method for on-orbit scene classification, namely, the Scale Boosting Model (SBM). Specifically, during the training process, the SBM is built as a set of different scale learners in a scale-increasing manner, each of which is used to learn and classify image features at a specific scale. During inference, the scale learners in the SBM will be selectively run in a scale-increasing manner and automatically decide when to exit early or expand the computation according to the scene complexity. In addition, by replacing the backbone of the scale learner, the SBM could provide a deployment possibility for computationally limited models for on-orbit processing, thereby reducing their computational requirements. Extensive experiments on UC Merced Land Use, NWPU-RESISC45 and RSD46-WHU datasets show that the SBM achieved a more effective classification performance more efficiently."

 Vehicular traffic is a major source of urban air pollution in Southeast Asia (SEA), posing significant health risks to pedestrians due to exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), and ultrafine particles (UFPs). Despite this issue of health concern, limited data exists linking the spatial and temporal variations of these pollutants and related pedestrian exposure in the region. Due to the unique urban topography, road infrastructure, and meteorological conditions in SEA, high-resolution air quality monitoring studies are essential to better understand pedestrian exposure patterns. This study addresses this knowledge gap by conducting a comprehensive real-time mobile measurement campaign in Singapore as a case study, using portable instruments to assess pedestrian exposure to the traffic-derived air pollutants across diverse urban road categories. We developed three land-use regression (LUR) models to identify the determinants and spatial distributions of PM2.5, BC, and UFP concentrations along the pedestrian pathways. Unlike previous stationary or vehicular-based LUR studies, our walking-based approach represents an effective assessment of pedestrian exposure. The results showed mean levels of PM2.5, BC and UFPs ranged from 16.4 to 20.0 μg m−3, 2.2–5.8 μg m−3 and 11.3 × 103 to 31.7 × 103 # cm-3, respectively, with BC and UFPs more strongly correlated with vehicular traffic emissions than PM2.5, particularly near highways and major arterial roads. Urban greenery, including tree density and park areas, was found to significantly reduce pedestrian exposure. These findings provide insights into the relationship between urban design, traffic patterns, and pedestrian health, offering strategies to mitigate traffic-related air pollution and promote healthier cities in SEA."

 The formation of winter precipitation is driven by ice-phase and liquid-phase processes, with the energy required for melting and freezing affecting both temperature and precipitation type. A major freezing rainstorm occurred in early April 2023 over Eastern Canada, causing damage to infrastructure and impacting the economy. The goal of this study is to investigate the impact of the latent heat release associated with freezing rain on the 2-m air temperature and the type of precipitation that reaches the surface. To illustrate the impacts of latent heat, the April storm was simulated using the Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) model with the modified Predicted Particle Properties (P3) scheme. It was observed that the release of latent heat from freezing rain led to a rise in the 2-m air temperature, with rain recorded when temperatures exceeded 0 °C. The median cumulative freezing rain showed a 34.4 % decrease, while time for the median temperature to reach 0 °C decreased by 2.5 h. The results from the model suggest that temperature advection played a role in balancing the precipitation phase change. This study contributes to our knowledge of processes associated with maintaining or stopping freezing rain and improves our ability to mitigate its hazards."

 The Metropolitan Area of São Paulo (MASP) in Brazil has reduced its vehicular emissions in the last decades. However, it is still affected by air pollution events, mainly in the winter, characterized as a dry season. The chemical composition of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was studied in the MASP during a 100 d dry period in 2019. PM2.5 samples underwent an extensive chemical characterization (including inorganic and organic species), ecotoxicity was assessed using a bioluminescence-based assay, and submicrometer particle number size distributions were simultaneously monitored. PM2.5 concentrations exceeded the new World Health Organization's daily guidelines on 75 % of sampling days, emphasizing the need for strengthening local regulations. Source apportionment (positive matrix factorization, PMF5.0) was performed, and the sources related to vehicular emissions remain relevant (over 40 % of PM2.5). A high contribution of biomass burning was observed, reaching 25 % of PM2.5 mass and correlated with sample ecotoxicity. This input was associated with north and northwest winds, suggesting other emerging sources besides sugarcane burning (forest fires and sugarcane bagasse power plants). A mixed factor of vehicular emissions and road dust resuspension increased throughout the campaign was related to stronger winds, suggesting a significant resuspension. The sulfate secondary formation was related to humid conditions.

 This paper presents newly developed Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) products for the Southern Ocean (SO), derived from SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) measurements by the Barcelona Expert Center (BEC). The primary challenges in retrieving SSS from L-band brightness temperature (TB) measurements in the Southern Ocean include degraded sensitivity in cold waters, radiometric signal contamination near sea ice edges and low variability in SSS across the region. To address these challenges, significant improvements were made to the retrieval algorithms. The BEC SO SSS product v1.0 delivers 9-day SSS maps on a 25 km EASE-SL grid, generated daily.

Seasonally, this scheme demonstrates a more prominent advantage in mid-autumn and show great potential for accurately reproducing the Arctic changes. 
 Parameters in sea ice-ocean coupled models greatly affect the simulated ocean and sea ice evolution, and are normally tunned to bring the model state close to the observations. Using an adjoint method, spatiotemporally varying parameters of Arctic sea ice-ocean coupled model are optimized simultaneously with the initial condition and the atmospheric forcing by assimilating satellite and in-situ observations. The assimilation results show that the joint state and parameter estimation (SPE) substantially improves the sea ice concentration simulation. Particularly in October when the ocean surface starts to refreeze, SPE reduces the lead closing parameter Ho, which determines the minimum ice thickness formed in the open water, to increase the lateral sea ice growth and facilitate the seasonal rapid sea ice recovery in the Pacific sector. Comparisons with sea ice thickness observations from the moored upward looking sonars and Ice Mass Balance buoys demonstrate that the inclusion of model parameters in the optimization also leads to better sea ice thickness estimation. Overall, the adjoint-based SPE scheme has the potential to better reproduce the Arctic ocean and sea ice state and will be applied to reproduce a new Arctic sea ice-ocean reanalysis."

Here, C57BL/6J male mice were exposed to TPHP or DPHP for 12 weeks at estimated daily intake doses of 0.1 and 7 μg/kg bw/day. TPHP intake affected the levels of short-chain fatty acids and bile acids in the gut, enhancing the production of 29 medium- and long-chain fatty acids in the liver by 3.72-fold and significantly increasing hepatic lipid and cholesterol levels. Metabolomic and molecular analysis confirmed that elevated liver cholesterol levels persisted after an 8 week recovery period.

Statistical analysis highlighted the direct impact of algal dynamics and the indirect effect of temperature and nutrients on d-CH4.

Protein-based iron storage compartments, such as ferritins, play a key role in maintaining iron homeostasis when the iron level surpasses microbial requirements. However, the energy-intensive nature of iron storage raises questions about how microbes balance this bioprocess between growth and metabolism. Here, using nitrate-dependent methanotrophic bacteria with the simplified metabolic system as a model, we propose a novel metabolic reprogramming pathway regulated by iron storage that controls the balance between growth and activity. Isotopic labeling and meta-omics analyses revealed a striking contrast between bacterial abundance and methane-dependent denitrification activity in “Ca. M. sinica”. Using microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy, we identified iron-rich nanoparticles within cells exposed to 40 μM Fe2+, alongside increased expression of genes involved in iron metabolism and methane oxidation coupled with denitrification. Additionally, we observed a shift from the energy-demanding Calvin cycle to the more energy-efficient serine pathway for carbon fixation, promoting the synthesis of glycine and succinyl-CoA, which serve as key precursors for iron storage proteins. These metabolic adjustments highlight a strategy for coordinating both substance and energy metabolism in nitrate-dependent methanotrophic bacteria, thereby enhancing their capacity for simultaneous nitrogen and carbon removal. Our findings reveal that iron may act as a metabolic “switch” in microorganisms, offering new insights into the targeted manipulation of microbial metabolism to maximize their beneficial functions in both engineered and natural environments."

This study addresses this critical gap by investigating the impact of PFCs on endothelial cell function, a key determinant of cardiovascular health. Through a machine learning-based quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) model, we analyzed 16 structural descriptors for 23 environmentally prevalent PFCs with respect to their binding affinities to endothelial cell receptors.

Traditionally, quantitative climatic measures of storm activity have been mostly based on Eulerian measures, taking into account the mean state of the atmosphere and how those affect Eulerian eddy activity, but they do not consider the Lagrangian growth of the storms themselves. Here, using ERA‐5 reanalysis data and tracking all extratropical storms (cyclones and anticyclones) from 83 years of data, we examine the actual growth of the storms and compare it to the Eulerian characteristics of the background state as the storms develop. In the limit of weak baroclinicity, we find that baroclinicity provides a good measure for storm maximum intensity. However, this monotonic relationship breaks for high baroclinicity levels. We show that although the actual growth rate of individual storms monotonically increases with baroclinicity, the reduction in maximum intensity at high baroclinicity is caused by a decrease in storm growth time. Based on the Lagrangian analysis, we suggest a nonlinear correction to the traditional linear connection between baroclinicity and storms' activity. Then, we show that a simplified model of storm growth, incorporating the baroclinicity effect on the vertical tilt of anomalies, reproduces the observed nonlinear relationship. Expanding the analysis to include the mean flow's barotropic properties highlights their marginal effect on storm growth rate, but the crucial impact on growth time.

At lunar distances, the magnetotail provides a unique opportunity for in situ investigation of this population due to the high fraction of hot demagnetized ions. Using observations of thin current sheets by the Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moon's Interaction with the Sun mission, we show that the relative drift between demagnetized hot ions and magnetized cold ions, likely driven by a strong polarization electric field, reduces the ion current density to nearly zero in the spacecraft rest frame.

Based on multi‐case simulations, this study revealed how the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau (YGP) affect the precipitation over SCB under different dominant weather patterns of RHEPEs in summer through sensitivity experiments. Results show that under the weather pattern featured by a low‐level vortex (LLV) over western SCB with water vapor transport by southerly winds, the YGP and TP can increase the precipitation in western SCB by 86% and 46%, respectively. The large‐scale terrains of TP and YGP tend to enhance the thermal gradient between the plateau and basin and shape the windward slope over western SCB, accounting for increased precipitation there. Under the weather pattern featured by a LLV over central and eastern SCB with southwesterly winds, the TP can only increase the precipitation in the eastern SCB by 20% due to its limited effects on the atmospheric circulations along the windward slope there, however, the YGP can decrease the precipitation in eastern SCB by 26%, which is attributed to the anomalous northeasterly winds weakening the water vapor transport from the Bay of Bengal, leading to the strengthened stability of stratification and weakened dynamic uplifting along the windward slope in eastern SCB. Finding of this study provides a new perspective on the mechanisms of large‐scale terrain influencing the RHEPEs over SCB."

 Short-duration precipitation extremes pose a risk to human lives and infrastructure and may be strongly affected by climate change. In the past two decades, several studies reported that extreme rainfall intensity can increase with temperature at rates exceeding the thermodynamic Clausius–Clapeyron rate. Two explanations have been proposed for this: (1) convective precipitation—arising from thunderstorms—might be strongly invigorated with temperature; (2) a statistical shift from low-intensity stratiform rainfall to higher-intensity convective rainfall might amplify the scaling rate with temperature. Here we use high spatio-temporal-resolution lightning records in Europe to test these two hypotheses at the storm scale, that is, within 5 km spatially and 10 min temporally. We show that the statistical shift in rain type alone accounts for the observed super-Clausius–Clapeyron scaling rate, and when considered in isolation, both stratiform and convective precipitation extremes increase at the Clausius–Clapeyron rate—thus refuting hypothesis (1). Mesoscale convective systems, which play a dominant role in generating precipitation extremes, do feature a super-Clausius–Clapeyron scaling rate because of a substantial increase in their convective fraction with dew point temperature above 14 °C. Analyses of intensity–duration–frequency curves show that extreme sub-hourly storms are the most strongly intensified with higher dew point temperatures. Warming-induced changes in extreme precipitation intensity that exceed the Clausius–Clapeyron scaling rate can be explained by a statistical shift from stratiform to convective precipitation, according to an analysis of lightning records across Europe."

 Bamboo’s native structure, defined by the vertical growth pattern of its vascular bundles and parenchyma cell tissue, limits its application in advanced engineering materials. Here we show an innovative method that controls localized moisture content to shape natural bamboo into a versatile three-dimensional (3D) structural product. Different temperatures along the transverse direction of bamboo were used to induce directional water transport within the bamboo, so that the distribution of internal stress was shifted from the bamboo surface to the inner layers. The internal stress shifting enabled the control of the transverse deformation. After densification, a 3D-molded bamboo product was obtained that retained the natural heterogeneous structure. The molded bamboo had a high specific strength of 740.58 MPa·kg−1·m3 and impact resistance of 2033.29 J/m, surpassing most renewable and nonrenewable engineering materials. The life cycle assessment revealed that replacing metals and polymers in structural materials with 3D-molded bamboo significantly reduces carbon emissions. Our proposed “localized moisture gradient-driven uneven drying” strategy represents a sustainable path in transforming natural bamboo into high-performance engineering materials.

Here, authors present cryo-EM structures of human riboflavin transporter RFVT2/RFVT3, revealing the structural basis for riboflavin transport and defining the determinant for pH-dependent activity of RFVT3. 
 Riboflavin (vitamin B2) is the precursor of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which act as key cofactors of many enzymes, thus has essential roles in cell growth and functions. Animals cannot synthesize riboflavin in situ, the intake, distribution and metabolism of which are mediated by three riboflavin transporters (RFVT1-3). Many mutations in RFVTs cause severe consequences. How RFVTs recognize and transport riboflavin remains largely unknown. Here we describe the cryo-electron microscopy structures of human RFVT2 and RFVT3 in complex with riboflavin in outward-occluded and inward-open states, respectively. Riboflavin is recognized by a conserved binding pocket in the central cavity of RFVTs, whereas two acidic residues in RFVT3 determine its pH-dependent activity. By combining the structural, computational and functional analyses, this study demonstrates the structural basis of riboflavin recognition and provides a structural framework for the mechanistic comprehension of riboflavin recognition, transport, and pathology in human RFVTs.

Through a global-scale analysis of vent viruses and their interactions, this study reveals that endemism is a key driver of viral ecology and evolution in these extreme ecosystems. 
 Viruses are ubiquitous in deep-sea hydrothermal vents, where they influence microbial communities and biogeochemistry. Yet, viral ecology and evolution remain understudied in these environments. Here, we identify 49,962 viruses from 52 globally distributed hydrothermal vent samples (10 plume, 40 deposit, and 2 diffuse flow metagenomes), and reconstruct 5708 viral metagenome-assembled genomes, the majority of which were bacteriophages. Hydrothermal viruses were largely endemic, however, some viruses were shared between geographically separated vents, predominantly between the Lau Basin and Brothers Volcano in the Pacific Ocean. Geographically distant viruses shared proteins related to core functions such as structural proteins, and rarely, proteins of auxiliary functions involved in processes such as fermentation and cobalamin biosynthesis. Common microbial hosts of viruses included members of Campylobacterota, Alpha-, and Gammaproteobacteria in deposits, and Gammaproteobacteria in plumes. Campylobacterota- and Gammaproteobacteria-infecting viruses reflected variations in hydrothermal chemistry and functional redundancy in their predicted microbial hosts, suggesting that hydrothermal geology is a driver of viral ecology and coevolution of viruses and hosts. Our results indicate that viral ecology and evolution in globally distributed hydrothermal vents is shaped by endemism and thus may have increased susceptibility to the negative impacts of deep-sea mining and anthropogenic change in ocean ecosystems.

 The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO, 56–48 million years ago) is investigated using a multi-model ensemble of deep-time climate simulations. We reveal that ENSO sea surface temperature variability during the EECO had significantly longer periodicity and stronger amplitude than present-day conditions. These changes are attributed to intensified ocean-atmosphere feedback processes and enhanced in-phase tropical inter-basin interactions within a broader ocean basin compared to the present-day. Sensitivity experiments in coupled ocean-atmosphere models suggest that tectonic changes, particularly the expansion of the tropical ocean basin, play a dominant role in amplifying ENSO variability and extending its periodicity, while stronger inter-basin connections further enhance ENSO amplitude. Elevated atmospheric CO2 levels, though driving substantial mean-state changes, partially offset the tectonic influence on ENSO variability by modifying feedback processes. These findings underscore the role of tropical ocean basin geometry and atmospheric CO2 levels in shaping ENSO variability, offering insights into past climate dynamics and implications for future projections under sustained global warming.

 The terrestrial carbon and water cycles are deeply intertwined, and their coupling is critical to shaping ecosystem processes and land-atmosphere feedback. Understanding how the carbon-water coupling (CWC) changes, which remains rarely explored, is essential for predicting eco-hydrological responses to climate change. Here, using data from eddy covariance towers and remote sensing, we demonstrate a substantial decline in the CWC strength—measured as the correlation between gross primary production and evapotranspiration—across northern ecosystems over the past two decades. This weakening is primarily driven by rising CO₂ levels, with temperature, solar radiation, and precipitation playing secondary roles. Land surface models in the TRENDY project fail to capture this weakening synchronization, primarily due to their inadequate representation of the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 levels. The weakening of this synchronous variation between water and carbon may signify that the ecosystems are reshaping their eco-hydrological balances across the Northern Hemisphere."

 Forests provide critical ecosystem services, including soil protection, water regulation, biodiversity conservation, and absorbing carbon dioxide emissions. Forest resilience to climate change is crucial to sustaining these ecosystems. Here, we aim to review to what extent current forest legislation in Finland supports the adaptation of forests to climate change.

Finnish forest laws addressed selection of genetic material for forest regeneration as well as the management of forest after abiotic damages. Climate change was not clearly mentioned in the laws.

Overall, the present Finnish forest norms predominantly rely on a perception of low climate risk and business-as-usual management approach can sufficiently address the challenges posed by climate change.

 Microplastics (MPs) contamination in global inland waters has raised concerns recently. However, quantitative research on the abundance of MP in these environments remains limited. Here we compiled a comprehensive dataset of MPs in global inland waters from 5365 observations across 301 publications, revealing a diverse distribution of MP abundance in inland waters, ranging from 0.00 to 4,275,800.70 items m−3 (mean: 25,255.47 ± 132,808.40 items m−3). Human development index, evapotranspiration, cropland, and land surface runoff emerged as the primary factors influencing MPs levels in water. The predicting map showed particularly high MP abundance in China, but also relatively high abundance in Asia, Europe, Africa, and the eastern United States. Urgent action is needed to monitor and manage MPs in inland waters, especially the small-sized MPs (<1 mm). Implementing effective strategies to regulate plastic production and waste management is imperative for protecting freshwater ecosystems, particularly in countries with high MP pollution.

 Wildfire maintains boreal forest health by catalyzing nutrient cycling and forest succession. However, increased annual burned area due to climate warming may facilitate forest loss and soil carbon release, which makes it important to monitor circumboreal burned area. Our goal was to characterize regional changes in circumboreal burned area from 1983 to 2020 using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data, and to identify the ecoregions where increases in burned area represent significant trends. We accomplished this by developing and applying a new burned area mapping algorithm that is based on an autoregressive analysis of the AVHRR and MODIS MOD09CMGv061 time series. Our algorithm worked well, and resulting burned area totals were similar to those of the MODIS MCD64A1v61 burned area product for years where both were available (2001−2020); however, the advantage of our AVHRR burned area dataset is that it extends back to 1983. Based on the resulting burned area maps, we evaluated circumboreal burned area changes and tested for significant trends. Net changes were substantial: while only 5.37 % of the circumboreal biome burned in the 1980s, 8.22 % did during the 2010s, an increase of 2.85 % (= 8.22–5.37 %) that corresponds to a proportional increase in area burned of 0.53 (= 2.85/5.37). In one ecoregion, Muskwa Slave Lake Forests, burned area more than quadrupled from the 1980s to the 2010s, and in three it more than tripled (Northern Canadian Shield Taiga, Yukon Interior Dry Forests, and Northeast Siberian Taiga). Furthermore, despite interannual variability in burned area typically being high, we found statistically significant increasing trends in burned area in seven of the twenty-three boreal ecoregions, corresponding to 19.6 % of boreal forests (35 % of North American and 11 % of Eurasian boreal forests), while only one ecoregion (Eastern Canadian Shield Taiga) had a decreasing trend. By analyzing the long-term AVHRR record, we were able to capture much larger increases in burned area than from the shorter MODIS record, allowing us to quantify how widespread and substantial these increases have been. By analyzing ecoregions, we found that north-eastern Siberian, north-western Canadian, and Alaskan boreal forests have experienced the most increases in burned area. These increases in burned area may have implications for future forest persistence and carbon storage within Eurasian and North American boreal forests."

 Permafrost degradation on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) has triggered widespread retrogressive thaw slumps (RTSs), affecting hydrology, carbon sequestration and infrastructure stability. To date, there is still a lack of long-term monitoring of RTSs across the TP, the thaw dynamics and comprehensive driving factors remain unclear. Here, using time-series Landsat imagery and change detection algorithm, we identified RTSs on permafrost regions of the TP from 1986 to 2020. Existing RTSs inventories and high-resolution historical imagery were employed to verify the identified results, the temporal validation of RTSs disturbance pixels demonstrated a high accuracy. In the study area, a total of 3537 RTSs were identified, covering a total area of 5997 ha, representing a 26-fold increase since 1986, and 69.2 % of RTSs formed since 2010. Most RTSs are located on gentle slope (4–12°) at elevations between 4500 m and 5300 m, with a tendency to form in alpine grassland and alpine meadow. Annual variations in RTSs area exhibited a significant positive correlation with minimum air temperature, mean land surface temperature, and annual thawing index, while it showing a significant negative correlation with the decrease in downward shortwave radiation. Spatially, RTSs were more common in areas with higher soil water content and shallower active layer. Landsat imagery captured the vast majority of RTSs on the TP and revealed interannual disturbance details, but the 30 m resolution remains inadequate for delineating the refined boundaries of some micro-scale (< 0.18 ha) RTSs.

 The analysis of online communication on social networks has become a central research interest to improve disaster management. Especially geo-referenced textual posts have been investigated extensively using techniques from Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI), topic modelling and sentiment analysis. However, workflows are traditionally sequential with independent processing steps, limiting their ability to capture interconnections between modalities and risking chains of dependencies. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an integrated GeoAI model called the Joint Spatio-Temporal Topic-Sentiment (JSTTS) model. Our proposed method combines semantic, sentiment, spatial and temporal knowledge into continuous feature vectors and is capable of computing geographically delineated sentiment-associated clusters of topics with meaningful location and temporal information. The properties of the JSTTS model were validated experimentally and the approach was evaluated against a comparable sequential workflow. Overall, our JSTTS model achieved higher topic quality scores with an average of 0.145 compared to 0.034 for the sequential workflow and higher average sentiment uniformity with an average of 0.89 versus 0.73. At the same time, both approaches exhibited similar spatial and temporal variance. As a secondary result, the Geographic Growing Self-Organising Map (Geo-GSOM) was developed to cluster multimodal feature vectors meaningfully in geographic space. It was evaluated on artificial training data where it reproduced up to 90% of the spatial autocorrelation while the non-spatial Growing Self-Organising Map (GSOM) only achieved 55%. The learned neuron grid can also be interpreted geographically. The utility of the JSTTS approach is demonstrated through a case study on the 2021 Ahr Valley flooding in Western Germany, where it identified interpretable multimodal clusters, a subset of which proved relevant for disaster management. The approach can be extended to other use cases and adapted for different modalities, holding potential for numerous follow-up studies."

 The acceleration of the global water cycle has led to a remarkable increase in the frequency of extreme disasters such as droughts and floods under changing environment. Drought-flood abrupt alternation (DFAA) events, as compound events more destructive than a single flood and drought event, pose severe threats to the sustainable development of ecosystem and society. This study applied the short-cycle drought-flood abrupt transition index (SDFAI) to identify extreme DFAA events in the Wei River Basin (WRB), the largest tributary of the Yellow River Basin of China, extracting their spatiotemporal evolution and non-stationary characteristics. By integrating meteorological factors and teleconnection indices, the drivers and inherent mechanism of DFAA events were ascertained. The results indicate that: (1) Flood-to-drought (FTD) were more severe than drought-to-flood (DTF) during the rainy season. DTF events are projected to dominate after 2016, and prominent mutations in the SDFAI, Min-FTD, and Max-DTF occurring around 1980 and 1995–2001, respectively. (2) Under the main oscillation period, the periods of extreme FTD and DTF events in the WRB were concentrated at 18–30 years and 10–30 years, respectively. (3) Both meteorological factors and teleconnection indices significantly affected the DFAA events. The teleconnection indices mainly associated with the sub-basins were Southern Oscillation Index, Arctic Oscillation, and North Atlantic Oscillation, which exhibited significant resonance periods with extreme FTD and DTF events. The combined contribution of meteorological factors to DFAA events was more susceptible, and the joint effects of teleconnection indices exerted a greater influence on the contribution rate of meteorological factors."

 As a vital part of the water tower of Asia, water cycle changes in the Pamir Plateau have significant impacts on the climate of the arid inland regions of Central Asia. Using the high-precision precipitation dataset known as TPHiPr, a significant wetting trend in spring and a drying trend in summer over the Pamir Plateau from 1979 to 2020 is identified in this study. Further analysis reveals that dynamic factors are more important than thermodynamic factors in driving these precipitation trends throughout both seasons. The dynamic factors are closely linked to the anticyclonic trend in spring and the cyclonic trend in summer, both of which are influenced by long-term trends in atmospheric circulation. Furthermore, the warming trend of sea surface temperature (SST) in the North Atlantic (NA) may impact atmospheric circulation over the Pamir Plateau. In spring, the pronounced meridional gradient of potential vorticity over the NA facilitates the northward propagation of the wave train induced by the warm SST along the great circle path, resulting in an anticyclonic trend over the Pamir Plateau. In summer, the wave train excited by the heat source at 60°N propagates eastward along the jet stream, leading to a cyclonic anomaly over the Pamir Plateau. The results were also verified in the Atlantic-pacemaker simulations. Overall, this study highlights the distinct wave trains induced by the NA SST warming trend in spring and summer.

Here, we present a groundbreaking approach leveraging digital optical frequency comb–enabled stimulated Brillouin scattering to achieve instantaneous microwave frequency and amplitude detection, attaining a record-breaking 50.8-gigahertz bandwidth, a 1.1-megahertz accuracy, and a 500-nanosecond temporal resolution, which is three orders of magnitude improvement over that obtained with frequency sweeping schemes. In addition to conventional frequency detection, the proposed technique enables simultaneous multifrequency microwave amplitude measurement and achieves a substantial performance enhancement in the figure of merit of more than 10-fold, which paves the way for dynamic microwave signal detection and analysis."

Comparison of the whole-genome sequences of herding and nonherding breeds reveals signatures of positive selection associated with pathways underlying social interaction and cognitive functions. Of the strong selective sweep signals, haplotypes within ephrin type-B receptor 1 (EPHB1), which is linked to locomotor hyperactivity and spatial memory, show evidence of segregation within breed lineages for the conformation versus working lines of border collies and introgression with a genetically and geographically distant herding breed of Entlebucher mountain dogs. We show that a working line–specific haplotype ofEPHB1is associated with elevated levels of chase-bite motor patterns based on a well-validated behavior survey. These findings indicate that functional selection has shaped the genetic architecture of herding breeds, which may relate to their proficiency in addressing diverse tasks and challenges in maintaining control over the herd."

Clock interferometry, where particles with an internal clock are coherently split and recombined along two spatial paths, has sparked interest due to its fundamental implications, especially at the intersection of quantum mechanics and general relativity. Here, we demonstrate that a clock interferometer provides metrological improvement compared to its technical noise–limited counterpart using a single internal quantum state. This enhancement around a critical working point can be interpreted as a geometric phase–induced signal-to-noise ratio gain. In our experimental setup, we infer a sensitivity enhancement of 8.8 decibels when measuring a small difference between external fields. We estimate that tens of decibels of sensitivity enhancement could be attained for measurements with a higher atom flux. This opens the door to developing a superior probe for fundamental physics and a high-performance sensor for various technological applications."

Similarly, peroxisome dysfunction causesSalmonellareplication vacuole destabilization and reduced bacterial burden within host cells. Thus, these two intracellular bacterial pathogens exploit host cell peroxisomes to maintain their replication compartments, establishing a critical role for this organelle in disease."

Here, we present a platform to morph closed surfaces with bistability that harnesses a balanced integration of origami and kirigami principles. By harmonizing panel rotation around creases nearly tangent to the closed surface and panel rotation around hinges nearly perpendicular to the closed surface, we show that origami-kirigami assemblages can shape-morph between a cube and a sphere, scale between spheres of dissimilar size, and change topology between a sphere and a torus, with programmed bistability.

In early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, impaired metabolism and functional connectivity of the retrosplenial cortex strongly predict future cognitive impairments. Therefore, understanding Alzheimer’s disease–related deficits in the retrosplenial cortex is critical for understanding the origins of cognitive impairment and identifying early treatment targets. Using the 5xFAD mouse model, we discovered early, sex-dependent alterations in parvalbumin-interneuron transcriptomic profiles. This corresponded with impaired parvalbumin-interneuron activity, which was sufficient to induce cognitive impairments and dysregulate retrosplenial functional connectivity. In fMRI scans from patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease, we observed a similar sex-dependent dysregulation of retrosplenial cortex functional connectivity and, in postmortem tissue from subjects with Alzheimer’s disease, a loss of parvalbumin interneurons. Reversal of cognitive deficits by stimulation of parvalbumin interneurons in the retrosplenial cortex suggests that this may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy."

The amplitude of the observed distribution is smaller than predicted for maximally quantum entangled two-photon states but larger than expected for separable photons. This result can be well explained by assuming that photons from pick-off annihilation are not entangled, while photons from direct and parapositronium annihilations are maximally entangled.

Here, the inhalable, myofibroblast-targeted, and pH-responsive liposomes (FL-NI) were developed for effective codelivery of nintedanib, a mainstream antifibrotic drug in clinic, and siIL11, a small interfering RNA that silences the key profibrosis cytokine IL-11. Notably, FL-NI achieved a 117.8% increase in pulmonary drug delivery by noninvasive inhalation and a 71.5% increase in delivery specifically to fibroblast activation protein–positive myofibroblasts while reducing nonspecific immune cell and epithelial uptake by 29.8 and 55.8%, respectively. The accurate inhalation codelivery of nintedanib and siIL11 into myofibroblasts achieved synergistic effects, effectively enhanced myofibroblast deactivation, reduced pathological collagen deposition by 50.8%, and promoted epithelial tissue repair.

Application of this pipeline reveals that morphological characteristics of individual astrocytes predict their location within the NAc.

The degradation of micropollutants, e.g., 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2), followed two-stage pseudo-first-order kinetics along with the conversion of IO4– (stage I) to IO3– (stage II) in the UV/IO4– process.

A kinetic model based on first-principles was further developed to simulate reaction kinetics, revealing that •OH was the primary reactive species responsible for EE2 degradation in stage I, while RIS, especially IO3•, played major contributions in stage II. The photolysis of IO3– in stage II could increase the risk of iodinated DBP (I-DBP) formation, especially under acidic conditions.

Fish are used as a model organism in these tests, but have many limitations, including a long time to reach steady-state, difficulty in maintaining constant exposure, and ethical concerns. We developed a method for the (simultaneous) assessment of chronic reproductive toxicity and bioaccumulation using Daphnia magna as a model organism. As test chemicals, we selected heterocyclic polyaromatic hydrocarbons (heterocyclic PAHs), which are often persistent and show high acute aquatic toxicity, raising concerns about their long-term effects. In this study, we developed a robust passive dosing method to maintain constant exposure in chronic toxicity and bioaccumulation tests of four heterocyclic PAHs in Daphnia magna. Passive dosing maintained stable exposure concentrations in the ng to μg L–1 range, even after reusing disks up to three times. All chemicals were toxic to Daphnia magna with EC10 values between 0.1 and 15 μg L–1. Bioaccumulation tests showed that steady-state was not reached, and the uptake rate constant (k1) could not be reliably determined due to complex exposure routes (both via water and diet). However, depuration rates in Daphnia magna were about 2 orders of magnitude higher than in fish, which is advantageous in the assessment of highly hydrophobic compounds. We propose to use the depuration rate constant (k2), which is independent of the uptake route, as an indicator of bioaccumulation potential. The k2 thresholds for Daphnia magna were estimated to identify (very) bioaccumulative compounds by correlating k2 values with bioconcentration factors (BCFs) for Daphnia magna and applying fish BCF thresholds. We suggest that a Daphnia magna bioaccumulation test can be used as a screening tool to trigger further bioaccumulation testing in fish, as it offers higher throughput, is more ethical, and reaches steady-state faster.

Based on direct hygroscopicity measurements conducted across diverse environments, this study quantified the impact of aerosol hygroscopicity on respiratory deposition utilizing the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) model. Our results demonstrate that hygroscopic growth of particles in the HRT notably reduces the total deposition fraction (TDF) for number by as much as 12%, whereas it significantly increases TDF for particle mass by up to 49% for submicrometer particles from various regional backgrounds. For near-source aerosols, mild variations in the TDF were observed, with changes of less than 10% for particle number and less than 17% for particle mass, owing to their low hygroscopicity. These findings imply the importance of appropriately considering aerosol hygroscopicity in assessing respiratory deposition. Furthermore, our results reveal that for many highly toxic aerosols, neglecting hygroscopicity has a negligible impact on deposition estimates. However, as aerosol toxicity under study decreases, the influence of hygroscopicity becomes more pronounced, largely increasing the TDF for mass, which highlights the significance of considering both aerosol cytotoxicity and hygroscopicity in assessing health risks."

We tested these ideas by comparing 45‐year regional rates of air temperature change to unique temporal and spatial air temperature records in the understory of regionally representative stable old forest at the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon, USA. The 45‐year seasonal patterns and rates of warming were similar throughout the forested landscape and matched regional rates observed at 88 standard meteorological stations in Oregon and Washington, indicating buffering, but not decoupling of long‐term climate change rates. Consideration of the energy balance explains these results: while shading and airflows produce spatial patterns of temperature, these processes do not counteract global increases in air temperature driven by increased downward, longwave radiation forced by increased anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In some months, the 45‐year warming in the forest understory equaled or exceeded spatial differences of air temperature between the understory and the canopy or canopy openings and was comparable to temperature change over 1,000 m elevation, while in other months there has been little change. These findings have global implications because they indicate that microclimate refugia are transient, even in this forested mountain landscape."
10.1029/2025GL114953,False,Geophysical Research Letters,该论文主要研究全球变暖背景下，降水分布均匀性的变化趋势。它使用Gini系数来分析降水在不同时间和空间尺度上的分布情况，并探讨了降水强度、年平均降水量和干旱日数之间的关系。虽然涉及气候变化和水循环，但与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析）没有直接关联。,"['precipitation', 'climate change', 'Gini index', 'CMIP6', 'hydrological cycle']",Hsin Hsu;Stephan Fueglistaler,Robust Projections of Changing Precipitation Evenness in a Warming Climate,"Global warming is expected to increase global mean precipitation by 2%–4%/K, but this increase may be uneven, leading to more flooding but also droughts. Utilizing the Gini index, a metric frequently used in economics, we analyze the evenness of precipitation distribution locally and globally from daily to annual‐mean timescale in CMIP6 global warming simulations. Spatial evenness of daily precipitation decreases over land and ocean, tropics and extratropics. Changes in temporal evenness of local‐daily precipitation show a complex geographic pattern. However, particularly over land, we show that a simple theoretical scaling explains this complexity to result from increased precipitation intensity scaling at about the Clausius‐Clapeyron rate, and a local balance between changes in annual‐mean precipitation and dry‐day fraction. These results provide a novel perspective on the relation between global constraints on the hydrological cycle to regional precipitation changes independent of changes in the geographic distribution of precipitation."

This study examines the relative effects of eastern Pacific (EP) and central Pacific (CP) ENSO in driving the PNA teleconnection during boreal autumn. Results show that CP SST anomalies are significantly more efficient, with a one‐degree CP anomaly inducing more than twice the circulation changes of an equivalent EP anomaly. Two factors contribute to this difference: CP warming triggers stronger atmospheric convection, and the associated regional Hadley circulation (HC) anomaly is broader and shifted westward compared to that induced by EP warming. This enhances interaction with the subtropical jet, strengthening the Rossby wave source. These findings underscore the pivotal role of regional HC in amplifying atmospheric teleconnection patterns, highlighting its importance amid the increasing frequency of CP ENSO events under a changing climate."

Using single‐ and dual‐Doppler Doppler on Wheels and in situ anemometer data, the wind structure of the very near‐surface boundary layer of Hurricane Laura (2020) is characterized. Small‐scale hurricane boundary layer (HBL) rolls (HBLRs) with a median size of approximately 400 m are present throughout much of the landfall, but are most vigorous in the eyewall. The maximum turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and momentum flux associated with HBLRs occur in the eyewall and are much larger than previously documented at landfall. DOW‐derived and anemometer‐derived TKE values are comparable. Observed maximum surface gusts were consistent with the maximum radar wind speeds aloft, suggesting the importance of vertical transport within the HBL by sub‐kilometer scale structures for the enhancement of surface wind speeds."

However, the frequencies, intensities, and timescales of these oscillations remain elusive. Here, we measured stratigraphic Δ33Spy from the currently anoxic Cariaco Basin, spanning ∼0.6 million years. Our results reveal two distinct patterns of negative Δ33Spy that are linked to specific redox oscillations, potentially analogous to patterns recorded during Phanerozoic extinctions. During Marine Isotope Stage 1–2 and 9–10, bottom water experienced redox oscillations on a timescale of 10,000 years, resulting in slightly negative Δ33Spy (−0.03‰). In contrast, during the period of 160–200 kyr BP, bottom water underwent frequent redox oscillations on millennial‐ and centennial‐timescales, leading to significantly more negative Δ33Spy values (−0.09‰). We highlight that similarly frequent oceanic redox fluctuations may have contributed to the end‐Guadalupian extinction, when notably negative Δ33Spy values akin to those observed in our study were prevalent."

The overall behavior is slip‐weakening at high rupture speeds (>0.76CR ${ >} 0.76{C}_{\mathrm{R}}$, where CR ${C}_{\mathrm{R}}$ is the Rayleigh wavespeed), but non‐monotonic at low rupture speeds <0.76CR $\left(<  0.76{C}_{\mathrm{R}}\right)$, with a transient increase after an initial strong weakening. The slower ruptures are associated to more weakening in the cohesive zone. The fraction of breakdown work associated to the initial weakening, immediately behind the rupture tip, matches the fracture energy estimated by independent methods, but the total breakdown work can be much larger than fracture energy. Complex stress evolution in the cohesive zone is compatible with a well‐defined fracture energy that explains rupture tip propagation, but the complexity is reflected in local slip rates that will impact radiated waves."

 VISA/MAVS is crucial in antiviral innate immunity. Upon RNA virus infection, VISA recruits TBK1 via TRAFs to mitochondria, inducing IRF3 phosphorylation and type I interferons. However, TBK1 recruitment mechanisms via individual TRAFs are unclear. Here, we reveal that PWWP domain-containing 3A (PWWP3A) serves as a negative regulator of RNA virus-triggered signaling. During viral infection, PWWP3A translocates from nucleus to the mitochondria, competing with TRAF6 for binding to VISA, thereby impeding the recruitment of TBK1 and inhibiting IRF3 activation. However, the extent of PWWP3A-mediated inhibition is regulated by the E3 ligase PJA2, which induces PWWP3A degradation post-infection, highlighting the intricate regulatory network in antiviral immunity. Consistently, PWWP3A deficiency enhances antiviral responses, and Pwwp3a−/− mice exhibit elevated levels of type I interferons and displayed greater resistance following RNA virus infection. Together, our findings unveil the inhibitory role of PWWP3A in virus-triggered signaling, which provides insights into preventing excessive immune responses.

Here, the authors show via molecular dynamics simulations that oscillatory deformations of the right frequency and amplitude can accelerate glassy dynamics, promoting molecular flow and damage repair. 
 Polymer glasses such as the plastics used in pipes, structural materials, and medical devices are ubiquitous in daily life. The nature of their low molecular mobility is still poorly understood and it leads to brittle mechanical behavior, damage, and fracture over time. It also prevents the design of self-healing mechanisms that expand the material’s lifespan, as more commonly done in recent years for higher mobility amorphous polymers such as gels and rubbers. We demonstrate through numerical simulations that controlled oscillatory deformations enhance the local molecular mobility of glassy polymers without compromising their structural or mechanical stability. We apply this principle to increase the molecular mobility around the surface of a cylindrical crack, counterintuitively inducing fracture repair and recovering the mechanical properties of the pristine material. Our findings are a first step to establish a general physical mechanism of self-healing in glasses that may inspire the design and processing of new glassy materials.

Here the authors test an intranasal subunit vaccine fused to albumin to facilitate FcRn-mediated trans-mucosal antigen transport and demonstrate protective immunity in mouse models. 
 Although vaccines are usually given intramuscularly, the intranasal delivery route may lead to better mucosal protection and limit the spread of respiratory virus while easing administration and improving vaccine acceptance. The challenge, however, is to achieve delivery across the selective epithelial cell barrier. Here we report on a subunit vaccine platform, in which the antigen is genetically fused to albumin to facilitate FcRn-mediated transport across the mucosal barrier in the presence of adjuvant. Intranasal delivery in conventional and transgenic mouse models induces both systemic and mucosal antigen-specific antibody responses that protect against challenge with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A. When benchmarked against an intramuscularly administered mRNA vaccine or an intranasally administered antigen fused to an alternative carrier of similar size, only the albumin-based intranasal vaccine yields robust mucosal IgA antibody responses. Our results thus suggest that this needle-free, albumin-based vaccine platform may be suited for vaccination against respiratory pathogens. Compared with intramuscular vaccine, intranasal vaccination has easier administration and local responses, but efficient antigen delivery presents an obstacle.

Here, the authors described the discovery of PVTX-405 as a potent, highly selective, and orally efficacious IKZF2 molecular glue degrader and their preclinical data support the clinical development of PVTX-405. 
 IKZF2 (Helios) is a transcription factor that is selectively expressed by Tregs and is essential for preserving the function and stability of Tregs in the tumor microenvironment (TME), where it suppresses the anti-tumor immune response. Targeted IKZF2 degradation by small molecules represents a promising strategy for the development of a new class of cancer immunotherapy. Herein, we describe the discovery of PVTX-405, a potent, effective, highly selective, and orally efficacious IKZF2 molecular glue degrader. PVTX-405 degrades IKZF2 (DC50 = 0.7 nM and Dmax = 91%) while sparing other CRBN neo-substrates. Degradation of IKZF2 by PVTX-405 increases production of inflammatory cytokine IL-2 and reduces the suppressive activity of Tregs, leading to an increase in Teff cell proliferation. Once-daily oral administration of PVTX-405 as single agent significantly delays the growth of MC38 tumors in a syngeneic tumor model using humanized CRBN mice. PVTX-405 in combination with anti-PD1 or anti-LAG3 significantly increases animal survival compared to anti-PD1 or anti-LAG3 alone. Together, these results demonstrate that PVTX-405 is a promising IKZF2 degrader for clinical development for the treatment of human cancers.

Here, the authors show that LIS1 mutations increase stiffness in human brain organoids due to ECM alterations and that targeted ECM modulation restores mechanical properties. 
 The viscoelastic properties of tissues influence their morphology and cellular behavior, yet little is known about changes in these properties during brain malformations. Lissencephaly, a severe cortical malformation caused by LIS1 mutations, results in a smooth cortex. Here, we show that human-derived brain organoids with LIS1 mutation exhibit increased stiffness compared to controls at multiple developmental stages. This stiffening correlates with abnormal extracellular matrix (ECM) expression and organization, as well as elevated water content, measured by diffusion-weighted MRI. Short-term MMP9 treatment reduces both stiffness and water diffusion levels to control values. Additionally, a computational microstructure mechanical model predicts mechanical changes based on ECM organization. These findings suggest that LIS1 plays a critical role in ECM regulation during brain development and that its mutation leads to significant viscoelastic alterations.

Here, Wang et al reveal that it interacts with the heat shock protein HSPB7 under biomechanical stress, forming a stable hetero-dimer which is regulated by phosphorylation. 
 The biomechanical properties and responses of tissues underpin a variety important of physiological functions and pathologies. In striated muscle, the actin-binding protein filamin C (FLNC) is a key protein whose variants causative for a wide range of cardiomyopathies and musculoskeletal pathologies. FLNC is a multi-functional protein that interacts with a variety of partners, however, how it is regulated at the molecular level is not well understood. Here we investigate its interaction with HSPB7, a cardiac-specific molecular chaperone whose absence is embryonically lethal. We find that FLNC and HSPB7 interact in cardiac tissue under biomechanical stress, forming a strong hetero-dimer whose structure we solve by X-ray crystallography. Our quantitative analyses show that the hetero-dimer out-competes the FLNC homo-dimer interface, potentially acting to abrogate the ability of the protein to cross-link the actin cytoskeleton, and to enhance its diffusive mobility. We show that phosphorylation of FLNC at threonine 2677, located at the dimer interface and associated with cardiac stress, acts to favour the homo-dimer. Conversely, phosphorylation at tyrosine 2683, also at the dimer interface, has the opposite effect and shifts the equilibrium towards the hetero-dimer. Evolutionary analysis and ancestral sequence reconstruction reveals this interaction and its mechanisms of regulation to date around the time primitive hearts evolved in chordates. Our work therefore shows, structurally, how HSPB7 acts as a specific molecular chaperone that regulates FLNC dimerisation.

Here the authors address this challenge by developing a catalytic shunt strategy. 
 Catalytic syngas conversion has the potential to improve the sustainability of chemical products. However, balancing high catalytic activity with selectivity is challenging because the complex interactions among intermediates across various active sites can trigger competing reactions. To address this challenge, we introduce a catalytic shunt strategy that redirects intermediates in a multifunctional catalytic system to guide interdependent reaction pathways. The key to this catalytic shunt strategy is modulating the adsorption of the intermediates across different activity domains. By tuning Mo–O coordination numbers of single atoms in a bifunctional catalyst, we achieve over 80% selectivity for aromatics and a carbon monoxide conversion surpassing 70%, with aromatics yields of over 40%. By absorbing the intermediates on the first activity domain, the shunt pathway prevents their participation in subsequent reactions, thereby boosting methane production with selectivity above 93% and carbon monoxide conversion exceeding 50%. This catalytic shunt strategy also showcases versatility across other bifunctional systems for producing gasoline and light olefins. Overall, this study provides a viable approach for tackling the activity–selectivity trade-off in catalytic syngas conversion, removing a major barrier preventing its practical implementation. Catalytic syngas conversion is an essential part of sustainable chemical production but is hindered by the trade-off between conversion activity and product selectivity.

 Marine heatwaves (MHWs) and tropical cyclones (TCs) are prominent extreme events in the Bay of Bengal (BoB), whose co-occurrence can amplify their impacts. This study explores the mechanisms behind compound MHW-TC events and their influence on the onset of the BoB summer monsoon (BoBSM). Our findings indicate that compound MHW-TC events initiate with increased downward shortwave radiation and Ekman downwelling during MHW formation, followed by latent heat flux release and Ekman upwelling during the TC lifecycle. The interaction between increased maximum potential intensity and steering flow during compound events results in a westward shift in TC tracks, delaying precipitation and atmospheric latent heat release in the eastern BoB. These factors, as well as the warmer sea surface temperatures in the BoB, hinder the reversal of the mid-to-upper tropospheric meridional temperature gradient, ultimately postponing BoBSM onset. These insights enhance the understanding of MHW-TC interactions and their implications for predicting BoBSM onset."

 Close-range LiDAR devices are considered to have great potential for enhancing forest inventory (FI) estimates. However, this potential is still being explored in the case of ground-based LiDAR devices, especially when the target is focused on relatively large spatial scales, such as stand level. This study explored the performance of close-range LiDAR devices in terms of bias and error, particularly terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) instruments, as measurement tools in stand-level FIs. The main premise of the research is that close-range LiDAR devices provide auxiliary information that can be used to accurately and precisely predict the dependent variable of the target population, thereby reducing errors. To this end, this study compared the performance of different statistical inference approaches that can be implemented with these technologies, such as the simple expansion estimator (EXP), two-stage model-assisted regression (REG), conventional model-based (CMB) and three-phase hierarchical model-based (3pHMB) approaches. These approaches were used to compare the following types of data: field measurements and TLS single-scan data (EXP, REG); field measurements and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-LiDAR data (CMB); and field measurements, TLS single-scan data and UAV-LiDAR data (3pHMB). The case study was carried out in a 16 ha experimental plot dominated by Pinus radiata and Pinus pinaster in northwest Spain, focusing on stand volume (V, m3 ha−1) estimates. The findings showed that the use of close-range remote sensing devices as a source of auxiliary data provided lower error in V estimates than the EXP approach using a single data source. The findings also suggest that close-range LiDAR devices can potentially be used as FI instruments. Therefore, the transfer of these sampling techniques may play an important role in operationalizing the use of close-range LiDAR devices in FIs."

 Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) serves as a crucial tool for monitoring vegetation characteristics and plays a vital role in terrestrial ecosystems. The vegetation optical depth dataset from AMSR-E/2 using multi-channel collaborative algorithm (MCCA-AMSR VOD) possesses a longer time series spanning from 2002 to 2022. However, due to the limitations of satellite orbital scanning gap and retrieval algorithms, existing VOD datasets do not achieve complete coverage in global land. To address the need for a VOD dataset with high spatio-temporal coverage across different bands, we reconstruct the MCCA-AMSR VOD dataset using the 3D partial convolutional neural network. Three evaluation methods are employed to further assessthe reconstructed VOD dataset. The reconstructed VOD achieves a higher average spatial coverage (95.01 %) compared with the original dataset (72.55 %). The correlation coefficients (R) between original and reconstructed VOD dataset for all five simulated missing regions exceeded 0.99, indicating that the reconstructed VOD has a very high correlation with the original dataset at the regional scale. Furthermore, comparison with optical vegetation indices indicates that the reconstructed VOD can also capture vegetation water contentwell.

 Aerosol acidity plays a crucial role in atmospheric processes, impacting both environmental and human health. However, previous studies have not comprehensively quantified the pathways through which meteorological parameters and chemical components influence pH changes, particularly overlooking the role of non-ideality (γH+). In this study, we investigate the seasonal variation in aerosol acidity in an urban area of the Pearl River Delta, China, as a case to quantify the contributions of various pathways. We find that H+ concentration is the primary pathway for pH changes, contributing 64.2–81.3 %, followed by non-ideality, which accounts for 18.4–26.7 % and surpasses aerosol liquid water content (ALWC). Temperature affects pH mainly through H+ concentration variation, while relative humidity influences pH primarily via ALWC. Among chemical components, sulfate and ammonium (NH4+) impact pH through H+, while nitrate's influence is mainly driven by non-ideality. Excluding non-ideality shifts the fraction of NH4+ by as large as 48.5 %, underscoring the importance of considering non-ideality in gas-particle partitioning models. Lastly, ionic strength and nitrate fraction significantly influence the activity coefficient, highlighting the need to consider non-ideality when examining aerosol acidity processes."

The results indicate that, although the proportion of MRSCG in the offshore region (45.66 %) is significantly higher than on land (33.46 %), the MRSCG flash density on land is greater, particularly in the Pearl River Delta region. The quantity of MRSCG exhibits a bimodal distribution, peaking in May–June and August. The daily peak occurs between 16:00 and 17:00 CST on land. The mean multiplicity of positive polarity MRSCG (PMRSCG) is comparable between the land (2.21) and offshore (2.22) regions. The mean multiplicity of negative polarity MRSCG (NMRSCG) is slightly higher in the offshore region (4.48) compared to the land region (4.21).

In this work, we report a technology for intracellular protein editing, drawing from split intein–mediated protein splicing, genetic code expansion, and endogenous protein tagging. This approach enables us to rapidly and site-specifically install residues and chemical handles into a protein. We demonstrate the power of this platform to edit cellular proteins, inserting epitopes, protein-specific sequences, and noncanonical amino acids. Notably, we use an endogenous tagging approach to apply our protein editing technology to endogenous proteins with minimal perturbation. We anticipate that the protein editing technology presented in this work will be applied to a diverse set of problems and phenomena in live mammalian cells."

In this work, we discovered a principle that can establish the 3D glomerular map of the fly antennal lobe by reducing the higher dimensionality serially to 1D projections. During development, olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) axons first contact their partner projection neuron dendrites on the spherical surface of the antennal lobe, regardless of whether the adult glomeruli lie near the surface or inside. Along this 2D surface, axons of each ORN type take a specific, arc-shaped trajectory that precisely intersects with their partner dendrites. Altering axon trajectories compromises synaptic partner matching. A 3D search is thus reduced to one dimension, simplifying partner matching."

We discovered that various platinum (Pt) precursors spontaneously disperse in a germanium-MFI (Ge-MFI) zeolite, which opposes the Ostwald ripening phenomenon, producing self-regenerating Pt/Ge-MFI catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. These catalysts reversibly switch between Pt clusters and Pt single atoms in response to reducing reaction and oxidizing regeneration conditions. This environmental adaptability allows them to completely self-regenerate over 110 reaction and regeneration cycles in propane dehydrogenation, and they exhibited unprecedented sintering resistance when exposed to air at 800°C for 10 days. Such spontaneous metal dispersion in a Ge-MFI zeolite is a robust and versatile methodology for fabricating various rhodium, ruthenium, iridium, and palladium cluster catalysts."

We found that the shifts in cell morphology that shape tissues could concomitantly act as conserved instructive cues that trigger asymmetric division and direct core identity decisions underpinning tissue building. We performed single-cell morphometric analyses of endothelial and other mesenchymal-like cells. Distinct morphological changes switched cells to an “isomorphic” mode of division, which preserved pre-mitotic morphology throughout mitosis. In isomorphic divisions, interphase morphology appeared to provide a geometric code defining mitotic symmetry, fate determinant partitioning, and daughter state. Rab4-positive endosomes recognized this code, allowing them to respond to pre-mitotic morphology and segregate determinants accordingly. Thus, morphogenetic shape change sculpts tissue form while also generating cellular heterogeneity, thereby driving tissue assembly."

Through iterative structural and sequence homology-based mining starting with a guide RNA-interaction domain of Cas9, we identified a family of RNA-guided DNA-targeting proteins in phage and parasitic bacteria. Each system consists of a tandem interspaced guide RNA (TIGR) array and a TIGR-associated (Tas) protein containing a nucleolar protein (Nop) domain, sometimes fused to HNH (TasH)– or RuvC (TasR)–nuclease domains. We show that TIGR arrays are processed into 36-nucleotide RNAs (tigRNAs) that direct sequence-specific DNA binding through a tandem-spacer targeting mechanism. TasR can be reprogrammed for precise DNA cleavage, including in human cells. The structure of TasR reveals striking similarities to box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins and IS110 RNA-guided transposases, providing insights into the evolution of diverse RNA-guided systems."

We transition through various interaction regimes and observe coherent superexchange, tunable through on-site interaction and site-to-site energy shift, affecting the Ramsey fringe contrast over timescales >1 second.

We validated this mechanism in model disc petals theoretically, computationally, and experimentally. Our study reveals distinct morphological regimes, ranging from smooth edges to cusp-forming configurations, and demonstrates how stress focusing at cusps influences subsequent petal growth. These findings position MCP incompatibility as a generic mechanism for cusp formation in both natural and manmade self-morphing sheets."

Eleven previously reported coelacanth “muscles” are nonexistent, while three previously unknown muscle subdivisions and connections are found. These findings markedly affect our understanding of the deep-time cranial evolution of jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes). Only 13% of the previously identified myological evolutionary novelties for the major gnathostome lineages proved to be accurate, but several new ones are proposed. We show that low, moderate, and high levels of cranial muscle innovation characterized the emergence of lobe-finned (sarcopterygian), cartilaginous (chondrichthyan), and ray-finned (actinopterygian) fishes, respectively. The novelties in the latter group resulted in the evolution of a second active mechanism for the expansion of the oropharyngeal cavity, which was probably crucial for the predominance of suction feeding versus bite feeding in extant actinopterygians."

Management of OPs and DBPs is further hindered by the historical division between microbial and chemical research. This review brings together the current knowledge regarding OPs and DBPs, identifies factors that influence the occurrence of both, and highlights areas where research is needed to better understand their health risks. First, we examine the current understanding of how OPs and DBPs are jointly influenced by physicochemical parameters, source water characteristics, treatment processes including disinfection, and distribution system properties. Temperature, for example, can affect OP and DBP occurrence, where higher temperatures can promote the growth of some OPs, such as Legionella pneumophila, but temperature’s effect on DBPs is species-dependent. Methods for quantifying the risks associated with OPs (quantitative microbial risk assessment) and DBPs (chemical risk assessment) are compared, finding that the numerous assumptions and data gaps associated with each method limit comparability across contaminant types. We highlight the urgent need to fill existing data gaps and develop a more unified risk framework so as to move toward holistic assessment of microbial and chemical risks. This review provides suggestions for future research, highlighting ways that researchers might utilize established practices in OP or DBP studies to further our understanding of the other. For example, analysis of source water organic matter composition, which has advanced our understanding of DBP formation, could be utilized to elucidate how source water characteristics influence OPs. This review bridges the gap between the OP and DBP disciplines, arguing that collaboration between the two is needed to address the pressing challenges facing water systems today."

In this Perspective, we shed light on hurdles encountered in the lab-scale research and development of aqueous PFAS destruction technologies with a focus on chemical methods and offer recommendations for overcoming them. Best practices are provided for developing robust PFAS laboratory protocols covering crucial aspects such as experimental planning, sample storage and analysis, and waste management.

Nitrogen (N) management not only promotes Nr emission and pollution control but also influences GHG emission sources. Therefore, we constructed a nitrogen–carbon (N–C) coupled model to link N metabolism with GHG emission inventory at the national scale, revealing the contributions of N management for synergistic GHG emission reduction. China was selected as the case study. The results showed that from 2015 to 2020, the N-metabolism system was associated with 1510 Mt carbon dioxide (CO2)eq yr–1 of GHG emissions, including CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, and C sequestration, accounting for 13.5% of the national level. Adopting N–C coupled strategies could synergistically reduce N-associated GHG emissions by 42.1% (607.8 Mt CO2 eq), suggesting that the Nr–GHG comitigation effects have been considerably underestimated. Specifically, the most effective synergistic strategies were balanced N fertilizer use, manure management, food loss, and waste reduction, and garbage sorting, which may become a priority for future N–C synergistic emission reduction."

However, traditional quantitative structure–activation relationship (QSAR) models often fall short in effectively normalizing and characterizing diverse molecular structures, thereby limiting their predictive accuracy for the removal of various ECs. This study uses embedded molecular structure vectors generated by a graph neural network (GNN), combined with functional group prompts, as inputs to a feedforward neural network. A data set of 28 ECs and 542 data points, representing diverse molecular structures and physiochemical properties, was built to predict the residual rate of ECs (REC) in ozonation oxidation. Compared to traditional QSAR models, the GNN-based molecular structure embedded methods significantly improve prediction accuracy. The resulting KANO–EC model achieved an R2 of 0.97 for REC, demonstrating its ability to capture complex structural features. Moreover, KANO–EC maintains exceptional interpretability, elucidating key functional groups (e.g., carbonyls, hydroxyls, aromatic rings, and amines) involved in the oxidation mechanism. This study presents the KANO–EC model as a novel approach for predicting the ozonation removal efficiency of current and potential ECs. The model also provides valuable insights for developing efficient control strategies for ensuring the long-term safety and sustainability of drinking water supplies."

However, the photochemical transformation of PAA in sunlit surface waters has not been previously investigated. For the first time, the photosensitized transformation of PAA was here observed in chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM)-enriched solutions under simulated solar irradiation. Triplet CDOM (3CDOM*) is here proposed to play a key role in the phototransformation processes. Using triplet model compounds, the reaction rate constant of 3CDOM* with PAA can be estimated to around 1.1 × 108 M–1 s–1. The reaction mechanism of triplet with PAA involves both energy- and electron-transfer. CH3COO• was generated from the reaction between PAA and excited triplets. Furthermore, HO• and organic reactive species (i.e., CH3COOO• and CH3COO•) are involved in the photochemical transformation of PAA in sunlit CDOM-enriched solutions. These reactive species (including HO•, CH3COOO•, and CH3COO•) also play a role in the removal of contaminants of emerging concerns (CECs). Overall, the current study provided new insights into the photochemical transformation of PAA in CDOM-enriched solutions.

While existing technologies prioritize adsorption capacity over regenerative sustainability, we engineered a fluorinated hydrogel with tailored fluorous binding sites to target PFAS via their hydrophobic C–F termini. This design achieved over 90% PFAS removal efficiency in real water matrices (e.g., tap and lake water), at environmentally relevant concentrations (1 μg L–1), with robust resistance to competing background ions and natural organic matter. Selectivity correlated strongly with PFAS chain length (F9 > F12 > F6), driven by stable adsorption configurations (C–F···F–C vs C–H···F–C) and a favorable adsorption energy of −29.06 kcal mol–1. Leveraging controlled noncovalent F···F interactions, the hydrogel enabled efficient desorption (60–80% efficiency using 1% NaCl, 1% NH4Cl, or 0.5% NH4OH–NH4Cl) without structural degradation. Full regeneration (>92% recovery) was achieved with 50% methanol, supporting five reuse cycles with minimal performance decline. In continuous operation, using 1% NaCl achieved a 10-fold PFAS enrichment, while 50% methanol enabled a significantly higher 51-fold enrichment. Both approaches reduced eluent consumption by 20–50% compared to conventional activated carbon and resins. Overall, balancing PFAS adsorption and desorption trade-offs significantly reduces environmental footprint and operational costs, providing a sustainable strategy for PFAS remediation."

Silicone wristbands have been used as effective personal passive sampling tools for semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) and serve as integrated measures of inhalation and dermal exposures. However, to-date, translating SVOC concentrations in wristbands to estimated doses has been a gap for their application in exposure assessment. Here, we utilized wristbands as proxy measures for skin-surface lipids to calculate estimated daily intakes (EDIs) from the dermal absorption pathway. EDIs were compared to dermal uptake estimates previously calculated from indoor air measurements and hand wipes, which were collected from residents of both polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated and noncontaminated buildings. Wristband-based estimates showed strong agreement with those from air and hand wipes (rs > 0.8, p < 0.0001), particularly for lower chlorinated PCBs, with dermal uptake accounting for a third of exposed residents’ PCB exposure (∑7PCB = 29.2 ng/kg bodyweight/day). All three dermal estimates were significantly associated with serum measurements among the lower chlorinated congeners. Our results demonstrate wristbands’ potential for quantifying personal external exposure, building on their utility for ranking internal dose. This study further presents a method for using wristbands to calculate dermal absorption for personalized exposure assessment."

Energy efficiency strategies can contribute to indoor radon accumulation, particularly in the winter and summer seasons, when buildings are sealed to maintain thermal comfort. Studies in various regions of the world have shown that meteorological factors influence indoor radon concentration either directly or indirectly. Seasonal variations in radon levels have been observed, with winter concentrations exceeding summer levels by 2–5 times, while extreme weather events further impact radon exhalation. Epidemiological data indicate that the increase of indoor radon concentration by 100 Bq/m3 raises lung cancer risk by 16%, with 35–40% of radon-related lung cancers potentially preventable through exposure reduction. Additionally, recent studies suggest a correlation between radon exposure and cardiovascular diseases, contributing to its significance for public health. Collecting meteorological data alongside indoor radon measurements and analyzing their relationship are essential for understanding such interactions as well as developing public health strategies for prevention and adaptation to future climate conditions.

The evaluation is conducted over Nordic Fennoscandia (Norway, Sweden, and Finland) since there is uncertainty in climate models' representation of key hydroclimatic variables in high‐latitude regions as they experience accelerated transformation in a changing climate. A 13‐year WRF‐CTSM simulation (2010–2022) is performed using a 10.5 km horizontal grid spacing to assess the model biases in simulating mean, minimum, and maximum 2 m temperature, precipitation, snow cover (snow depth, snow water equivalent, fractional snow‐covered duration), and surface energy balance components. The analysis is based on annual, seasonal, monthly, and daily mean comparisons against openly available observational data sets, comprising regional scale gridded station‐based and satellite‐based data sets, as well as point scale observations from ground stations. The model shows robust agreement with the evaluation data sets across all considered variables. Furthermore, in situ scale conditions in 2 m temperature, precipitation, snow cover variables, and latent heat are captured with considerable precision.

 Alkaline–silicate igneous complexes contain a huge diversity of rock types, ranging from silica-undersaturated (feldspathoid-normative) to silica-oversaturated (quartz-normative) compositions. At present, the controls on the formation of such compositional diversity are poorly quantified. Here we apply thermodynamic models to investigate these controls using a case study of the Blatchford Lake Igneous Complex (Canada), which is compositionally representative of worldwide alkaline–silicate systems. By modelling fractionation of a primitive mafic melt across crustal pressures, we identify a narrow (~0.5 kbar) ‘tipping point’ across which residual melts become silica-rich or alkali-rich when shallower or deeper, respectively. This tipping point is consistently present at mid-crustal pressures (3–5 kbar; ~10–15 km depth) for a range of viable primitive melts, moving to higher pressures within this range for more hydrous and more oxidized melts. Crystallization at these pressures (within barometric estimates for the complex) can therefore generate and explain the vast diversity of observed alkali-rich and silica-rich compositions. A similar tipping point is also present in other modelled mafic igneous systems at mid-crustal conditions, indicating it is a widespread phenomenon. This result implies a key role for mid-crustal mafic staging chambers in generating compositional diversity in alkaline–silicate complexes worldwide.

 The increasing interest in utilizing three-dimensional (3D) in vitro models with innovative biomaterials to engineer functional tissues arises from the limitations of conventional cell culture methods in accurately reproducing the complex physiological conditions of living organisms. This study presents a strategy for replicating the intricate microenvironment of the intestine by cultivating intestinal cells within bioinspired 3D interfaces that recapitulate the villus-crypt architecture and 3D tissue arrangement of the intestine. Intestinal cells cultured on these biomimetic substrates exhibited phenotypes and differentiation characteristics resembling intestinal-specific cell types, effectively replicating intestinal tissue. Notably, tissue proliferation and differentiation were achieved within 72–120 h—significantly faster than the several weeks required by conventional bioengineered materials, which often pose risks of tissue necrosis or cross-contamination. Additionally, the differentiated cells on these villi-crypts mimicking bio-interfaces exhibit higher production of natural antimicrobial peptides, resulting in reduced pathogenic infection compared to control samples. Furthermore, our method stands out for simplicity in fabrication, eliminating the need for cleanroom procedures and complex microfabrication techniques.

In this work, the authors report a covalent organic framework (COF)-directed protein refolding strategy to modulate protein conformation by rationally designed covalent COFs with adapted pore structures and customizable microenvironments. 
 Precisely regulating protein conformation (folding) for biomanufacturing and biomedicine is of great significance but remains challenging. In this work, we innovate a covalent organic framework (COF)-directed protein refolding strategy to modulate protein conformation by rationally designed covalent organic frameworks with adapted pore structures and customizable microenvironments. The conformation of denatured protein can be efficiently recovered through a simple one-step approach using covalent organic framework treatment in aqueous or buffer solutions. This strategy demonstrates high generality that can be applied to various proteins (for example, lysozyme, glucose oxidase, trypsin, nattokinase, and papain) and diverse covalent organic frameworks. An in-depth investigation of the refolding mechanism reveals that pore size and microenvironments such as hydrophobicity, π-π conjugation, and hydrogen bonding are critical to regulating protein conformation. Furthermore, we use this covalent organic framework platform to build up solid-phase columns for continuous protein recovery and achieved a ~ 100% refolding yield and excellent recycling performance (30 cycles), enabling an integrated process for the extracting and refolding denatured proteins (such as the harvest of protein in inclusion bodies). This study creates a highly efficient and customizable covalent organic framework platform for precisely regulating proteins refolding and enhancing their performance, opening up a new avenue for advanced protein manufacturing.

Here, the authors report a bimetallic silver–rhenium catalyst that selectively converts cyclic imides to lactams with high efficiency, with close silver–rhenium contact being key to its performance. 
 The rational design of robust nanocatalysts containing the suitable active sites for building relevant organic compounds, such as lactams, is a desired approximation towards the development of a sustainable fine chemistry field. In that sense, the design of a proper nanomaterial able to mediate the selective hydrodeoxygenation of cyclic imides to lactams with high tolerance to the preservation of aromatic rings remains rather unexplored. Here, we show the design of a bimetallic AgRe nanomaterial with notable activity and selectivity to mediate this transformation affording more than 60 lactams from the corresponding imides. Interestingly, in this work we disclose that the optimal AgRe nanocatalyst is constituted by AgReO4 nanoaggregates that undergo an in situ hydrogenative dispersion to form the active centers composed by Ag0 nanoparticles and ReOx species. Deep characterization, together with kinetic and mechanistic studies, have revealed that the intimate Ag-Re contact intrinsic to AgReO4 species is key for the formation of the most active catalytic sites and the proper bimetallic cooperation required for mediating the desired process.

The model is then experimentally validated on a new dataset of 3773 DTIs from a yeast-based screen on 7 human GPCRs. 
 Machine learning has revolutionized drug discovery by enabling the exploration of vast, uncharted chemical spaces essential for discovering novel patentable drugs. Despite the critical role of human G protein-coupled receptors in FDA-approved drugs, exhaustive in-distribution drug-target interaction testing across all pairs of human G protein-coupled receptors and known drugs is rare due to significant economic and technical challenges. This often leaves off-target effects unexplored, which poses a considerable risk to drug safety. In contrast to the traditional focus on out-of-distribution exploration (drug discovery), we introduce a neighborhood-to-prediction model termed Chemical Space Neural Networks that leverages network homophily and training-free graph neural networks with labels as features. We show that Chemical Space Neural Networks’ ability to make accurate predictions strongly correlates with network homophily. Thus, labels as features strongly increase a machine learning model’s capacity to enhance in-distribution prediction accuracy, which we show by integrating labeled data during inference. We validate these advancements in a high-throughput yeast biosensing system (3773 drug-target interactions, 539 compounds, 7 human G protein-coupled receptors) to discover novel drug-target interactions for FDA-approved drugs and to expand the general understanding of how to build reliable predictors to guide experimental verification.

 One of the grand open problems of modern physics is the unification of Einstein’s general relativity and quantum mechanics. This challenge has been approached by the greatest physicists but there is still no complete theory and experimental evidence remains out of reach. The Newton–Schrödinger equation (NSE) offers insight into this puzzle, as it describes a quantum wavefunction under self-gravity dynamics. Having been studied theoretically for decades, optical experiment of this nonlinear model was demonstrated only in 2015. Although the NSE can be generalized to post-Newtonian gravity approximating general relativity, all experiments simulating nonlinear gravity so far have been limited to Newtonian gravity. Here we present experimental emulation of post-Newtonian dynamics by probing a new physical regime of nonlinearity that mimics larger masses in gravity. We find soliton solutions of the post-Newtonian–Schrödinger equations, distinct from their Newtonian counterparts and demonstrate them experimentally. We observe rich beam evolution requiring previously unconsidered nonlinear terms, thereby opening up new experimental capabilities for simulating wavefunction dynamics in the settings of general relativity. An optical emulation experiment of a quantum wave function dynamics under self-induced post Newtonian gravitational potential is presented, including observation of solitons of this system and rich beam evolution due to high-order nonlinear effects."

 Evidence suggests that people are attracted to patterns and regularity. We hypothesized that decision-makers, intending to maximize profit, may be lured by the existence of regularity, even when it does not confer any additional value. An algorithm based on this premise outperformed all other contenders in an international challenge to bias individuals’ preferences. To create the bias, the algorithm allocates rewards in an evolving, yet easily trackable, pattern to one option but not the other. This leads decision-makers to prefer the regular option over the other 2:1, even though this preference proves to be relatively disadvantageous. The results support the idea that humans assign value to regularity and more generally, for the utility of qualitative approaches to human decision-making. They also suggest that models of decision making that are based solely on reward learning may be incomplete.

 Single-cell transcriptome profiling enables unparalleled characterization of the heterogeneous microenvironment of pediatric leukemias. To facilitate comparative analyses and generate pediatric leukemia signatures, we collect, process, and annotate single-cell data comprising over 540,000 cells from 159 different pediatric acute leukemia (myeloid, lymphoid, mixed phenotype lineages) and healthy bone marrow (BM) samples, profiled in our lab and curated from publicly available studies. The analysis identifies a leukemia-enriched signature of nine genes with over-expression in leukemic blast compared to healthy BM cells. This signature is also consistently over-expressed in leukemia samples compared to normal BM in bulk RNA-seq datasets (over 2000 samples). Outcome-based analysis on diagnosis samples using measurable residual disease (MRD) status depicts a significant association of oncogene-induced senescence and g-protein activation pathways with MRD positivity. MRD positivity across pediatric leukemias is also correlated with significant depletion of CD8+ and CD4+ naïve T-cells and M1-macrophages at diagnosis.

 Engineering cell factories that support the production of large quantities of protein therapeutics remains a significant biomanufacturing challenge. The overexpression of secretory proteins causes proteotoxic stress, affecting cell viability and protein productivity. Proteotoxic stress leads to the activation of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), a series of signal transduction pathways regulating protein quality control mechanisms aimed at restoring homeostasis. Sustained UPR activation culminates with the induction of apoptosis. Current strategies for enhancing the production of therapeutic proteins have focused on the deregulated modulation of key components of the UPR. These strategies have resulted in limited and often protein-specific improvements as they may lead to adaptation and cell toxicity and do not account for natural population heterogeneities. We report here feedback-responsive cell factories that sense proteotoxic stress and, in response, modulate the UPR to enhance stress attenuation and delay cell death, addressing the limitations of current strategies. We demonstrate that our cell engineering approach enables dynamic UPR modulation upon proteotoxic stress. The sense-and-respond systems that mediate dynamic UPR modulation enhance the production of the therapeutic enzyme tissue plasminogen activator and the bispecific antibody blinatumomab. Our feedback-responsive cell factories provide an innovative strategy for dynamically adjusting the innate cellular stress response and enhancing therapeutic protein manufacturing.

 The transition to net-zero emissions in Europe is determined by a patchwork of country-level and European Union-wide policy, creating coordination challenges in an interconnected system. Here we use an optimization model to map out near-optimal energy system designs for 2050, focusing on the planning flexibility of individual regions while maintaining overall system robustness against different weather years, cost assumptions and land-use limitations. Our results reveal extensive flexibility at a regional level, where only few technologies (solar around the Adriatic and wind on the British Isles and in Germany) cannot be substituted. National policymakers can influence renewable energy export and hydrogen strategies significantly, provided they coordinate this with the remaining European system. However, stronger commitment to solar in southern Europe and Germany unlocks more design options for Europe overall.

 Solid-state sodium (Na) batteries open the opportunity for more sustainable energy storage due to their safety, low cost and high energy density. Inorganic solid electrolytes show notable advantages for such technologies but suffer from poor interfacial compatibility, rendering hybrid solid–liquid electrolytes an alternative. Here we show that the interfacial failure in the hybrid electrolyte system (Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSP) and 1 M NaClO4 in propylene carbonate/ethylene carbonate/fluoroethylene carbonate) is closely associated with Na vacancies on the surface of NZSP. Asymmetric kinetics of solid and liquid electrolytes lead to the formation of Na vacancies and an unstable environment in the Helmholtz layer, while the organic molecules (propylene carbonate) are energetically favourable towards undesirable dehydrogenation. To eliminate the Na vacancies layer, we designed an ion-anchoring interlayer that serves to minimize the interfacial polarization. The unique O–Na coordination between the interfacial layer and NSZP confers stability to the solid–liquid interface. As demonstrated, the sodium battery with the modified hybrid electrolyte sustains 50,000 cycles with capacity retention of 86.3%. Our work provides a new path for the design of solid-state Na batteries, highlighting their potential for widespread practical applications. Solid-state sodium batteries represent more sustainable options as they combine resource abundance with safety.

This dataset allows for a further discussion on spatially different behavior of precipitation δ18O to the strong ENSO events, and we found that δ18O values are higher in El Niño years and lower in La Niña years in the southern of the line roughly from 30°N 80°E to 40°N 120°E, not fully consistent with the northern region.

 Indian Ocean (IO) variability, including the Indian Ocean Basin (IOB) mode and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) mode has been suggested to influence Tropical Pacific (TP) variability. On the other hand, variability in the tropical Pacific, especially the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has also been presented as a major driver of both IOB and IOD. The relative importance of these coupled feedbacks is still debated. Here, we use a Linear Inverse Model (LIM) capable of selectively including or excluding IO-TP coupling to evaluate the relative roles of the IOB and IOD modes on TP variability, and the preferred timescales of those impacts. Our findings reveal a reduction in TP interannual variability (~40%) and a substantial increase in central TP low-frequency variability (>6 years) in the absence of IO coupling. Specifically, both the IOB and IOD contribute significantly to TP interannual variance. IOB dynamics substantially damp central TP low-frequency variability, while the IOD exhibits negligible impacts on the TP at low-frequencies. We further assess the relative importance of internal IO dynamics versus that induced in the IO by the Pacific in shaping tropical Pacific variability. Our findings indicate that internal IO dynamics predominantly impact Pacific interannual variance, while the Pacific’s influence on the IOB, rather than internal IOB dynamics, is the primary factor dampening Pacific low-frequency variance. This study deepens our understanding of the intricate coupled IO-TP interactions."

 Riverine plumes greatly shape ocean environments and ecosystems. The Changjiang River plume, widely spreading in the Yellow and East China Seas in summer, induces extremely low surface salinity and threatens local aquaculture and fisheries. Passage of tropical cyclones potentially increases surface salinity by stirring upper oceans, yet the extent of cyclones’ effects on the Changjiang River Plume extension and its mechanisms remains less explored. Here, combining satellite and in-situ observations with numerical experiments, we reveal a widespread surface salinification induced by Lekima (2019), with the maximum salinification reaching 6.5 psu and an 83% Changjiang River Plume contraction. Tropical cyclone-induced vertical mixing contributes to this dramatic salinification, while horizontal advection can either contribute to or offset the salinification, depending on specific locations. Further examination of surface salinity during 2015–2022 suggests that tropical cyclones can effectively restrict the Changjiang River Plume extension, potentially shielding fishing and aquaculture industries from low-salinity-related disasters.

 Models describing banded iron formation deposition beneath oxygenated Paleoproterozoic marine shelf waters assume that microaerophilic iron-oxidizing microorganisms were significant contributors. However, direct evidence for this mechanism is lacking, and it remains unclear how associated primary organic biomass and biogenic iron oxyhydroxides transformed into organic carbon-poor iron oxide/carbonate-rich bands in banded iron formations. Here we explore in situ modern Zetaproteobacterial iron-oxidizing mats thriving in the Lucky Strike hydrothermal vent field to develop an empirical model that explains the potential contribution of iron-based metabolisms to deposition of rocks resembling banded iron formations. Petrographic, mineralogical, and geochemical data suggest that abundant production of Zetaproteobacterial stalks nucleates and drives spontaneous biotic/abiotic ferrihydrite precipitation in the mats. Subsequent early diagenetic anaerobic microbial oxidation of dead biomass as the mats aged, coupled to microbial reduction of iron oxyhydroxides/oxides, generates ferrous carbonates and mixed valence magnetite. Collectively, this forms crystalline iron-rich organic carbon-lean 13C-depleted layers reminiscent of Precambrian banded iron formation microbands.

 Carbon capture and storage and carbon dioxide removal technologies are pivotal for net-zero climate goals, requiring extensive carbon dioxide pipeline expansion across the U.S. However, as this network grows, concerns about safety and environmental justice intensify, due to insufficient regulations that may disproportionately expose marginalized communities to risks. Here, we empirically examine the environmental justice implications of existing and potential pipelines across communities. Using census-tract demographic data and pipeline spatial data, we applied LASSO regression to identify key demographic variables and incorporated them into binary logistic regression models to uncover if the locations of, and disadvantages associated with, carbon dioxide pipelines are equally distributed among different demographics. We find higher-income communities are less likely to host existing pipelines. Proposed pipelines are generally in areas with higher concentrations of Black residents, while areas with higher educational attainment show reduced likelihood. Using the Net Zero America study’s 2030 projection of carbon dioxide pipelines, we observe diminished impacts on higher-income and educated communities, although Black residents are less likely to have a pipeline in this scenario. All pipelines were more likely to be in rural areas. These findings reveal persistent demographic disparities in pipeline locations, underscoring concerns about resource accessibility and preparedness.

 Forest attribute maps relying on remotely sensed data are increasingly required for local decision-making related to the use of forest resources. Such maps always have uncertainty, which can be challenging to quantify. The objective of this work is to introduce the conformal prediction methodology to uncertainty quantification in forest attribute mapping, particularly for the k-NN method. We compare several conformal k-NN procedures for the mapping of total volume, broadleaved volume and Lorey’s height using Sentinel-2 satellite images and airborne laser scanning data. We show that all procedures produce valid prediction intervals in the sense that they contain the true value with the desired probability, for example 90%. We use multiple measures to quantify how well the prediction intervals adapt to the difficulty of prediction in different forest strata. We found that there are multiple methods for k-NN to produce prediction intervals competitive with those produced by conformal quantile regression. These methods include conformal prediction based on the standard deviation or quantiles of the k nearest neighbors with commonly used values of k. We present how to produce a forest attribute map with the proposed conformal prediction intervals. We also show a theoretical coverage guarantee for the jackknife conformal k-NN procedure. We recommend conformal prediction for unit-level uncertainty quantification of forest attribute maps."

 Remote sensing and artificial intelligence technology have propelled the development of precision agriculture and smart agriculture. Among them, as a crucial economic crop, tobacco has been rarely studied and its large-scale identification task has consistently encountered several challenges. Firstly, tobacco is often inter-cropped with other crops, such as corn. These crops have similar colors and textures, with only minor differences in planting spacing and arrangement. These slight differences become even less observable in remote sensing imagery. Secondly, tobacco growth is a continuous and evolving process, resulting in drastically different characteristics during various growth stages and seasons, which further complicates the task of identification. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no tobacco dataset is accessible to the public, impeding the development of a deep learning (DL) model with optimal performance. Therefore, a Large-scale UAV remote SEnsing Tobacco dataset (LUSET) which is the world’s first tobacco dataset with a total volume of 67GB has been conducted in this paper. 10 large-scale images in the LUSET are accurately annotated with an average resolution of about 20,000 × 20,000 pixels, which can be divided into 7,252 512 × 512 samples1. Then, a dual-branch ConvFlow Transformer is proposed to address tobacco’s rich diversity and high inter-class similarity among different crops. A novel Convolutional Feature-enhanced Multi-Head Self-attention (CF-MHSA) with a location-free design in the ConvFlow Transformer is developed to replace the value matrix in the standard attention with the convolutional multi-scale features, which effectively achieves feature interaction and fusion from the convolutional and transformer branches. The fusion of refined features allows us to better distinguish the texture characteristics of different crops and represent their morphological features during different growth cycles. This addresses the two major challenges in tobacco recognition. Extensive experiments on the UAV tobacco data proved that the strategy of ConvFlow Transformer can be easily achieved in the mainstream Transformers and significantly improve their performance in tobacco identification with a small amount of computation."

Conversely, in species with a more open system, the H+and Ca2+fluxes are lower, with more seawater exchanged between the environment and calcifying fluid, explaining the relatively high Mg/Ca in these foraminifera. In either of these species, mitochondria were found to be located at the site where the Ca2+/H+exchange takes place and the mitochondrial density aligned with the rate of pumping.

Viral escape drives restriction factors to evolve rapidly at virus-binding interfaces to regain defense. Here, we explore how antiviral proteins balance restricting many viruses with evolving specificity against individual viruses. Human MxA uses its rapidly evolving loop L4 as the specificity determinant for orthomyxoviruses such as thogotovirus (THOV) and influenza (IAV). Previous combinatorial mutagenesis of rapidly evolving residues in human MxA loop L4 identified THOV “super-restrictors” and suggested an antiviral breadth-specificity trade-off. Using a modified combinatorial mutagenesis strategy, we find super-restrictor MxA variants specific to H5N1 IAV. A single L4 residue underlies the MxA breadth-specificity trade-off. However, rare “generalist” super-restrictors or a heterozygous combination of more common “specialist” super-restrictors can overcome the breadth-specificity trade-off. Our findings suggest that at least two strategies enable restriction factors such as MxA to increase their restriction of diverse viruses to overcome breadth-specificity trade-offs, which might be pervasive in host-virus conflicts."

Two distinctive features emerge: large seasonal variability of up to 15.9° ± 4.9°C in Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes, comparable to that found today, a positive sea surface δ18O value related to evaporation (expressed as salinity increases), and the existence of polar ice. Model-predicted patterns of SST change match with high statistical confidence those derived from clumped isotopes in well-preserved oyster fossils from Madagascar and display consistent warm/cold seasonality.

Tree-ring proxies, spanning three centuries, reveal that the recent intensity of this pattern is unprecedented in the historical records. In contrast, the circumglobal teleconnection, which historically dominated the continental-scale Eurasian heatwave occurrences, has shown no discernible trend amid global warming. Consequently, this emerging pattern signifies a radical shift in Eurasian heatwave-drought climatologies. The mechanism involves Rossby wave propagation linked to warming sea surface temperatures in the Northwestern Atlantic and enhanced Sahel precipitation, both amplified recently by overlapping effects of anthropogenic warming and natural variability. Land-atmosphere interactions driven by soil moisture deficits further intensified the pattern regionally. Climate models predict that anthropogenic forcings will continue to strengthen the pattern throughout this century."

We explored how DOM generated from a bloom-forming, centric diatom, infected with taxonomically distinct viruses—a single-stranded (ss) DNA and a ssRNA virus—impacted microbial processing of organic matter. DOM derived from uninfected and ssDNA virus–infected cultures supported growth in bacterial isolates and a mixed assemblage. In contrast, DOM from ssRNA virus infection did not stimulate growth, but rather induced ectoproteolytic activity, suggesting this DOM was less bioavailable. Exoprotease activity was also substantially higher in ssRNA virus–infected cellular exudates compared to ssDNA virus–infected and uninfected cultures. This suggests that DOM produced through virus-mediated host lysis does not a priori support secondary production and implicate ssRNA virus infection as a source of proteolytic activity in the water column, highlighting a multifaceted role for viruses in altering microbial utilization and remineralization length scales of organic matter in the ocean."

Here, we found HMGB2+CD8+T cells as being associated with immune exhaustion and resistance to anti–PD-1 treatment through single-cell RNA sequencing. Mechanistically, HMGB2 impaired the oxidative phosphorylation in CD8+T cells and inactivated the interferon-γ response in tumor cells, reducing the antitumor effector function. Tannic acid, a specific inhibitor of HMGB2, synergized with PD-1 antibody to attenuate tumor growth and reverse T cell exhaustion.

Integrating rock physics experiments under hydrothermal conditions, 24 years of rainfall data, and subsurface hydrodynamics, we found increasing rainfall rates, which indicate reservoir recharge and pressurization. We show that hydrothermal water promotes caprock sealing through the formation of a fibrous microstructure. Our experiments further demonstrate that fluid accumulation rates directly influence deformation rates. Together, these processes drive gradual deformation, natural seismicity, and deepening earthquake foci. Recognizing these recurring patterns is crucial for understanding the caldera’s unrest-driving mechanism, enabling us to offer actionable insights for hazard assessment and engineering solutions, such as intercepting water upstream to prevent drainage toward Pozzuoli."

N2O, with 273 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide (CO2), is also indirectly emitted through transformations of reactive nitrogen (Nr) species, like NH3 and NOx, in natural environments. Understanding ammonia’s climate impact is crucial for evaluating its efficacy as a fossil fuel alternative. We present a functional model to quantify the climate impact of renewable-based (e-ammonia) and natural-gas-based (blue and gray) ammonia, focusing on direct and indirect N2O emissions. The model incorporates Nr emissions─NH3, NOx, and N2O─across the value chain under “low”, “medium”, and “high” emissions scenarios, along with production and pilot fuel GHG emissions. Results show that e-ammonia’s climate benefit depends on well-to-wake Nr emissions and natural processes that control relevant nitrogen to indirect N2O (N-to-N2Oi) conversion pathways. In a low emissions scenario, its CO2-equivalent intensity is 68–80% lower than fuel oil, assuming 1–10% N-to-N2Oi conversion. In a high emissions scenario, this benefit drops to 11–23% for 1–2% N-to-N2Oi conversion, and at 5–10% N-to-N2Oi conversion, e-ammonia’s impact exceeds fuel oil by >24%. Blue ammonia could bring ∼30% climate benefit compared to fuel oil, but only in a low emissions scenario with 1–2% N-to-N2Oi conversion.

It employs a specially designed one-pot pretreatment to create a unique reaction window for the most recoverable Fe/Al–P, achieving the targeted transformation of unstable P species into homogeneous Fe/Al-orthophosphate of 85.6% in proportion. These compounds exhibited remarkable thermal stability during incineration, with volatilization loss of only 60% of conventional technical route (Conv-Tech) even at 1000 °C. Subsequently, these parts of P were completely leached out using H2C2O4 or NaOH through redox reaction and chelating displacement, with the solvent concentration and the codissolution amounts of heavy metals less than half of the mean levels in the literature. Techno-economic analysis showed that HyperPhosⓅ obtained 1.1–2.4 times more P than Conv-Tech, while the unit cost was reduced by up to 49.5%. These findings provide new opportunities to close the P-cycle in a sustainable, economical, and environmentally friendly approach."

Here, we quantify the diel CE of 229 cities across four climatic zones and employ a machine-learning model to assess the influence of variables on CE. We found that for every 10% increase in tree cover, surface temperatures are reduced by 0.25 °C during the day and 0.04 °C at night. Trees in humid regions exhibit the highest daytime CE, while those in arid zones demonstrate the greatest cooling effect at night. This can be explained by the difference in canopy density between the humid and arid zones. During the day, the high canopy density in the humid zone converts more solar radiation into latent heat flux. At night, the low canopy density in the arid zone intercepts less longwave radiation, which favors surface cooling. While climatic factors contribute nearly twice as much to CE as nonclimatic ones, our findings suggest that optimizing CE is possible by managing variables within specific thresholds due to their nonlinear effects. For instance, we revealed that in arid regions, an impervious surface coverage of approximately 60% is optimal, whereas in humid areas, reducing it to around 40% maximizes cooling benefits. These insights underscore the need for targeted management of nonclimatic factors to sustain tree cooling benefits and offer practical guidance for designing climate-resilient, nature-based urban strategies."

Children exhibit heightened sensitivity to Pb exposure compared to adults, and prenatal Pb exposure can harm the developing fetal nervous system. However, the specific regulatory effects of Pb across various developmental stages are not well understood. This study employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to analyze mice brains at different ages (2 and 8 weeks) following prenatal and postnatal Pb exposure. Blood lead level in exposed mice is comparable to those detected in human samples, implying its environmental implication. A total of 43,303 brain cells were sequenced for cell-specific analysis. Pb exposure was found to elevate the proportion of immature neurons in the brains of 2 week-old mice and to perturb neurodevelopment- and neural structure-related pathways within neurons. In 8 week-old mice, Pb primarily influenced pathways implicated in synaptic transmission, signal transduction, and learning and memory in both neurons and glial cells. The communication involving neurotransmitters glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), along with their receptors, was disrupted between neuron and microglia. Through the application of snRNA-seq, this study has demonstrated that the Pb-induced neurotoxicity is characterized by cellular heterogeneity and the disruption of neurotransmitter-related communication between microglia and neurons could be a critical factor in Pb-induced neurotoxicity."

However, many MOFs suffer from structural degradation and performance deterioration upon exposure to water in flue gases. Aiming to discover stable and efficient MOFs for CO2 capture from a wet flue gas, we propose a hierarchical high-throughput computational screening (HTCS) strategy. Machine learning (ML)-assisted stability analysis is incorporated within the HTCS, leveraging prior experimental experience to predict ultrastable (including water-, thermal-, and activation-stable) MOFs from ∼280,000 candidates in the ab initio REPEAT charge MOF (ARC–MOF) database. Among 9755 shortlisted MOFs, molecular simulations identify 1000 top-performing MOFs. Remarkably, several vanadium-based MOFs are revealed to be ultrastable, exhibiting high CO2 capture capability of 3–7 mmol/g and CO2/N2 selectivity of 95–401. Subsequently, ML regressors are developed to derive design principles for MOFs capable of overcoming the trade-off effect. Furthermore, an ML classifier is developed to analyze the impact of water on CO2 capture by comparing dry and wet conditions. The proposed hierarchical HTCS and developed ML models lay a solid foundation for the potential transition of MOFs into practical applications."

Here we combined the concentration with the carbon isotope analysis of DOM and its generated CO2 to quantify the contribution of •OH-based oxidation. Results showed that the 13C enrichment factors (ε values) were −8.1‰ to −8.9‰ for benzene ring oxidation in aromatic compounds, −4.2‰ to −28.9‰ for lower-molecular-weight organic acids, and −13.0‰ for DOM from sediment. The fractionation of sediment DOM reflects the average ε value of humic substances and organic acids. These ε values were more negative than those of the photochemical and microbial processes, enabling the identification of DOM transformation mechanisms.

The warmth of the West Pacific in boreal autumn strengthens the Walker circulation and the zonal temperature gradient across the Pacific, leading to the growth of El Niño events during that season.

Specifically, the Fram Strait inflow has decreased in volume by 28% (0.32 Sv/decade, responsible for AW cooling), while its salinity has increased (∼0.1 psu, resulting in the AW sinking by several tens of meters) over recent decades.

Based on the lower tropospheric vertical profiles and cross‐sections, three cloud‐boundary layer coupling modes are identified including a coupled mode with a weak positive surface heat flux (type 1), and two decoupled modes in the presence of either a negative surface heat flux driving a shallow stable boundary layer (type 2) or a strong positive surface heat flux (type 3). Numerical simulations are conducted for representative cases of each mode using the conventional YSU PBL scheme without and with the cloud‐induced top‐down mixing option (referred to as YSUtopdown), as well as the MYNN and the MYNN eddy‐diffusivity mass‐flux scheme (MYNN‐EDMF) that adopts a holistic treatment of mixed‐layer thermals and shallow convective clouds. The MYNN‐EDMF scheme offers the best representation of the decoupled type 3 mode where its capability to simulate different vertical extents of local mixing and nonlocal mass flux is found to be essential. Two key parameters in MYNN‐EDMF dictating shallow cloud formation are also identified.

The technique is scalable, cost effective, and could enable advanced sensors, clocks, and communication technologies. 
 Incorporating rare-earth elements into wurtzite nitride semiconductors, such as scandium-alloyed aluminum nitride (ScAlN), significantly enhances the piezoelectric response, which is vital for a broad range of acoustic, electronic, photonic, and quantum applications. To date, however, the measured piezoelectric response of nitride semiconductors is far below what theory has predicted. Herein, we demonstrate a simple, scalable, post-growth thermal annealing process that can dramatically boost the piezoelectric response of ScAlN. We achieve a 3.5-fold increase in the piezoelectric modulus, d33 for ScAlN, from 12.3 pC/N in the as-grown state to 45.5 pC/N, which is eight times larger than that of AlN commercially used in 5 G cellphones. The observed enhancement is unambiguously confirmed by three separate measurement techniques. Detailed material characterization techniques reveal that optimized annealing conditions significantly improve the macroscopic structural quality, achieving a more homogeneous and ordered domain orientation, and reduces the lattice parameter ratio (c/a) in the wurtzite crystal structure. The dramatic enhancement of d33 in ScAlN thin films promises extreme frequency scaling opportunities for bulk acoustic wave resonators for beyond-5 G applications. The authors present a process that boosts the piezoelectric properties of ScAlN thin films by 3.5 times, enhancing their performance for use in acoustic devices.

 Chiroptoelectronic devices are crucial for applications in quantum computing, spin optical communications, and magnetic recording. However, the limited efficiency and low stability of conventional circularly polarized light (CPL)-sensing materials have restricted their broader use. Here, we introduce atomic chiral Se nanorod (NRs) films as broadband CPL detectors, leveraging the intrinsic chirality and stability of Se nanocrystals.

The Se NRs thin films detected CPL across a broad range from ultraviolet (UV) to short-wavelength infrared (SWIR), with a responsivity dissymmetry factor of up to 0.4, maintaining high stability under ambient conditions for longer than 13 months.

 Long-circulating, transfection-competent lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-mRNA delivery systems are critical for achieving efficient transfection in extrahepatic tissues. Here we investigate the properties of LNP mRNA systems containing high proportions of bilayer forming lipids, using equimolar egg sphingomyelin and cholesterol as the bilayer-forming components. We show that LNP mRNA systems prepared at bilayer lipid to ionizable lipid molar ratios of 4-0.67 exhibit high mRNA encapsulation efficiencies (90–100%) and excellent transfection potencies in vitro. Systems with bilayer lipid to ionizable lipid molar ratios equating to 4 exhibit a liposomal morphology with a solid core suspended in an aqueous interior surrounded by a lipid bilayer. These liposomal LNPs exhibit longer circulation lifetimes than LNP systems with Onpattro-like lipid compositions and have enhanced extrahepatic transfection properties. The prolonged blood circulation lifetime is attributed to reduced plasma protein adsorption. The transfection competency of liposomal LNP systems is attributed to export of the solid core containing mRNA from the LNP as the endosomal pH is lowered.

 Polyamines play essential roles in gene expression and modulate neuronal transmission in mammals. Vesicular polyamine transporters (VPAT) from the SLC18 family exploit the transmembrane H+ gradient to translocate polyamines into secretory vesicles, enabling the quantal release of polyamine neuromodulators and underpinning learning and memory formation. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of human VPAT in complex with spermine, spermidine, H+, or tetrabenazine, elucidating discrete lumen-facing states of the antiporter and pivotal interactions between VPAT and its substrate or inhibitor. Leveraging structure-inspired mutagenesis studies and protein structure prediction, we deduce an unforeseen mechanism whereby the polyamine and H+ compete for multiple acidic protein residues both directly and indirectly, and rationalize how the antidopaminergic therapeutic tetrabenazine impedes vesicular transport of polyamines. This study unravels the mechanism of an H+-coupled polyamine antiporter, reveals mechanistic diversity between VPAT and other SLC18 antiporters, and raises new prospects for combating human disorders of polyamine homeostasis.

 Plant physiological responses to rising CO2 have been shown to contribute to increasing extreme heat; but their impacts on co-occurrences of high heat and humidity have not been assessed previously. Since heat stress depends on both, reductions in evapotranspiration and increases in sensible heat can incite competing influences on co-occurrence metrics (e.g., heat index). Here we analyze plant physiological forcing in idealized simulations that isolate plant physiological from radiative impacts of rising CO2. Our results demonstrate that increasing temperature has a larger influence than declining moisture, leading to overall CMIP6 multi-model mean heat index increases. Model differences are driven by varying levels of transpiration decline, which can be partially offset by leaf-area-driven increases in canopy evaporation in some models/regions; as highlighted by differences between two versions of one model (CESM) with high and low levels of leaf-area change.

 Summer monsoon breaks can have far-reaching impacts by triggering abnormal weather both locally and remotely. However, their formation mechanisms remain incompletely understood, with intraseasonal oscillations (ISOs) widely recognized as a primary driver. This study investigates South China Sea monsoon break events and finds that 72.9% originate from the Philippine Sea, associated with ISOs, while the residual 27.1% are locally generated, which have yet to be elucidated previously. Our results suggest that these locally generated events are often preceded by anomalously active tropical cyclones, which amplify in situ air–sea interaction, inducing SST cooling that increases large-scale atmospheric stability, thereby promoting monsoon break establishment. Moreover, differing from ISO-related monsoon breaks that increase precipitation over the Yangtze River Valley, locally generated breaks induce significant warming over South China. The diverse mechanisms and climate impacts of monsoon breaks revealed in this study may provide new insights for further improvement of subseasonal predictions."

 Sea ice and snow are crucial components of the cryosphere and the climate system. Both sea ice and spring snow in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) have been decreasing at an alarming rate in a changing climate. Changes in NH sea ice and snow have been linked with a variety of climate and weather extremes including cold spells, heatwaves, droughts and wildfires. Understanding of these linkages will benefit the predictions of climate and weather extremes. However, existing work on this has been largely fragmented and is subject to large uncertainties in physical pathways and methodologies. This has prevented further substantial progress in attributing climate and weather extremes to sea ice and snow change, and will potentially risk the loss of a critical window for effective climate change mitigation. In this review, we synthesize the current progress in attributing climate and weather extremes to sea ice and snow change by evaluating the observed linkages, their physical pathways and uncertainties in these pathways, and suggesting ways forward for future research efforts. By adopting the same framework for both sea ice and snow, we highlight their combined influence and the cryospheric feedback to the climate system. We suggest that future research will benefit from improving observational networks, addressing the causality and complexity of the linkages using multiple lines of evidence, adopting large-ensemble approaches and artificial intelligence, achieving synergy between different methodologies/disciplines, widening the context, and coordinated international collaboration."

 Satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) is a directional variable and has significant angular anisotropy. This characteristic contributes to enhance the differences among different satellite-derived LST products, and therefore increases the challenge of using multi-sensor and multi-decadal data to provide a long-term and angle-consistent LST climate data record. The kernel-driven model can balance the interpretability and operability well, so that it is suitable for angular normalization of LST products. The calibration of the kernel-driven model depends on multi-angle data which is difficult to obtain due to the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of LST. In this study, a novel LST angular normalization method based on the kernel-driven model was proposed to correct the angular effect of satellite-derived LST product by constructing multi-angle LST dataset from one geostationary satellite (GOES-R/ABI) and four polar-orbiting satellites (Terra/MODIS, Aqua/MODIS, Metop/AVHRR, and S-NPP/VIIRS). The dataset gathered more abundant angle information, i.e., LSTs from three different observation geometries for the same pixel. The kernel-driven model was calibrated using the multi-angle LST dataset in the Continental United States (CONUS) during the year 2020. The discrepancies of the root mean square difference between LST before and after angular normalization range from 0.14 K to 1.10 K over nine land cover types in the four seasons. Similar results are obtained when the calibrated kernel-driven model was further expanded to other years and areas (i.e., the CONUS in 2021 and East Asia in 2020). The LST angular normalization method was applied to correct the angular effect of MODIS LST product. The results indicate that there is a strong correlation between the spatial distribution of LST differences (LST before and after angular normalization) and view zenith angle (VZA). MODIS LSTs before and after angular normalization were compared with Landsat 8 LST and Sentinel-3 A LST in near-nadir viewing for January, April, July, and October 2020. The angular normalization reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) between MODIS LST and Landsat 8 LST by 0.94–2.06 K in different months and by 0.13–2.61 K over various land cover types. For Sentinel-3 A, the RMSE decreased by 0.30–0.64 K in different months. The accuracies of MODIS LST before and after angular normalization were further validated using in situ measurements at the six SURFRAD sites. There are large discrepancies between the RMSE of MODIS LST before and after angular normalization versus in situ LST for VZA ≥ 45°. The largest discrepancy is up to approximately 1.3 K at the GWN site. The LST angular normalization method has the potential to provide an angle-consistent LST climate data record."

 The Gálvez-Davison Index (GDI) was developed to enhance forecasting capabilities of tropical convection. This study evaluates the applicability of the GDI in forecasting deep tropical and subtropical convection, particularly in synoptic scale systems, such as the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ), and mesoscale phenomena like Mesoscale Convective Complexes (MCC). A hybrid methodology was applied, integrating retrospective and prospective analyses. Initially, a statistical evaluation of the GDI was conducted over the historical period from 1994 to 2024, using convection proxies including omega (vertical velocity) at 500 hPa and net longwave radiation flux (LWR). Subsequently, a brief diagnostic of SACZ and MCC events, which occurred respectively in January 2024 and October 2016, was performed. Based on these events, GDI forecasts derived from the Global Forecast System (GFS) model were compared against satellite observations and ERA5 reanalysis data within the affected regions. Key results demonstrated that, as expected, the GDI performed better in tropical than subtropical regions, showing stronger correlations with convection proxies. Statistical analysis for the SACZ (tropical region) indicated a strong negative correlation between the GDI and omega at 500 hPa (R=−0.93). Conversely, the correlation between GDI and omega at 500 hPa was weaker for MCC events (subtropical region; R=−0.21), highlighting a greater influence of dynamic factors in these systems. The GDI successfully identified regions prone to deep convection, particularly within the SACZ domain, where high GDI values coincided with regions of instability and intense precipitation. For MCC events, the index effectively captured convective intensification in subtropical regions. Forecasts of the GDI were reliable in regions where SACZ and MCC systems were active, as validated by satellite imagery. However, high index values were also recorded in areas without actual convection, indicating potential limitations. Comparison between GFS forecasts and ERA5 reanalysis revealed a systematic tendency of the global model to underestimate GDI values across all analyzed regions. The root mean square error (RMSE) varied regionally, reaching a maximum of 6.75 in the oceanic portion of the SACZ. Overall, the GDI proved valuable in forecasting deep convection, capturing both intensification and dissipation stages of convective systems. Its use as a complementary tool is promising, although systematic underestimation by the GFS highlights the need for model improvements. While originally designed for tropical regions, caution is advised when applying the GDI to subtropical areas due to its generally lower performance and weak correlations with convection proxies, particularly in the MCC domain, emphasizing the necessity for methodological refinements."

 The general surface temperature is influenced by changes in air temperature and is affected by local factors. The Tibetan Plateau, characterized by its high altitude and intense solar radiation, shows substantial effects related to slope orientation. Slope orientation plays a crucial role in controlling the absorption and reflection of solar radiation, leading to variations in surface temperatures across various slope orientations and complicating the relationship between surface and air temperatures. This study focused on air temperature and slope orientation. Considering atmospheric parameters such as solar altitude angle (h), solar declination angle (δ), hour angle (ψ), and local geographical parameters like latitude and longitude. We proposed a novel method for estimating surface temperature on slopes based on air temperature, validated using measured data from the established octagonal platform at the Huashixia permafrost observation station in the Tibetan Plateau. Results indicated that at a significance level of P < 0.05, the highest correlation coefficient and linear fitting coefficient (R2) calculated using daily average air temperature were 0.89 and 0.79, respectively. When applying monthly average air temperature, these values were 0.99 and 0.98. This demonstrated that using monthly average air temperature as an inversion parameter yielded high-accuracy near-surface temperatures.

Under acidic conditions and increased shear stress, the supramolecular assemblies disintegrate, enabling site-specific cargo release.

Enhanced ACOD1 expression induces CD274/PD-L1 production independently of itaconate, precipitating inflammation-associated immunosuppression in sepsis. Delayed administration of pramipexole, a dopamine agonist, mitigates lethality in bacterial sepsis mouse models. Conversely, the dopamine antagonist aripiprazole exacerbates sepsis mortality. Dysregulation of the dopamine-ACOD1 axis correlates with sepsis severity in patients, indicating a potential therapeutic target for modulating this neuroimmune pathway."

Proxy data from the middle to late Miocene reveal that large-scale cooling and drying occurred; however, the reasons for this climate transition remain unclear. Through a compilation of proxy data and climate simulations, our results indicate that atmospheric CO2decline markedly decreased the temperature and reduced the precipitation in most of the land area, while the paleogeographic changes enhanced cooling at northern high latitudes and increased precipitation in East Asia, East Africa, and South America. In comparison, vegetation changes accelerated cooling at northern high latitudes (the maximum cooling exceeded 10°C) and modulated precipitation at low- and mid-latitude continents (the maximum decrease was close to 30%).

However, the precise structure of their polyamide selective layer under hydrated conditions and its relationship to membrane transport remain poorly understood. Using cryo–electron tomography, we successfully reconstructed the three-dimensional structure of six commercial polyamide membranes under hydrated conditions, revealing a fully swollen nodular network. The highly heterogeneous nodules, measuring 17.2 ± 2.8 nanometer in thickness, were directly connected to the pores of the underlying polysulfone substrate. The nodules occupied most of the surface area compared to the 75.9 ± 26.8-nanometer-thick dense layer of the polyamide film. Key structural parameters of the nodules, including surface area index and wall thickness, were correlated with the water permeance of an additional 16 polyamide membranes, validating the major role of these nodules in water transport.

We investigated the spectral curvature of the entire surface of Mercury and its relationship with surface temperature. High spectral curvatures map the youngest terrains: hollows, bright spots and very bright craters within the Mercury cold poles. These results demonstrate that freshly exposed materials are spectrally similar to hollows‐forming material and sulfides. High spectral curvature is muted by thermal processing near Mercury's hot poles. The optical effect of thermal weathering that we observed on Mercury are consistent with laboratory measurements on weathered CaS and includes a flattening of the reflectance in the visible.

The estimated mechanisms were consistent with the distribution of P‐wave polarities from conventional seismometers despite recording only one component along the cable.

In a simulation with a rigid substrate, the shoreline trajectory initially moved basinward and then retreated landward, following the theoretical autoretreat in response to steady relative sea level (RSL) rise. In a simulation with a viscous substrate, the occurrence of syn‐depositional deformation resulted in a much more complex shoreline trajectory, even with the same sediment supply and sea level rise.

Abrupt SST changes mostly consist of decadal cooling followed by warming, apparently related to coupled dynamics involving the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).

We conduct two sets of experiments: a Control experiment with interactive SM and a fixed SM experiment (FixedSM) with invariable SM conditions. We focus on two regions in South America: the Amazon and southeastern South America (SESA). Larger organized convective systems are associated with greater SM heterogeneity in both regions, though other large‐scale synoptic influences affect the robustness of this relationship in SESA. These results remain largely unaffected by disabling the effects of precipitation on SM in the FixedSM experiment, and complementary analyses using satellite‐based estimates of SM and precipitation support these findings. Spatial compositing of mesoscale environments in the Amazon shows the presence of well‐defined SM gradients, at a length scale of a few hundred kilometers, many hours (O(10)) $(\mathcal{O}(10))$ before convective system detection. Larger SM gradients correspond to larger gradients in thermodynamic variables, particularly surface temperature and sensible heat flux, and are associated with larger convective systems. Overall, our findings suggest that surface heterogeneities such as SM gradients not only affect deep convection initiation, as previously suggested, but they can also encourage the growth and organization of convective systems into larger clusters, particularly in the absence of significant synoptic influences."

Although moist‐ARs and windy‐ARs have similar duration and magnitude of integrated water vapor transport (IVT) at the AR core after they make landfall, their accompanying precipitation patterns are different. Over the duration of the AR, moist‐ARs produce higher cumulative precipitation in inland and interior areas while windy‐ARs produce higher cumulative precipitation in coastal areas. We explore the mechanisms leading to the precipitation pattern differences from both dynamical and thermodynamical perspectives. Moist‐ARs are associated with a weaker but a more zonally extended anomalous trough at 500 hPa, which leads to stronger zonal wind and IVT that favor penetration of moisture and enhanced precipitation inland. Moist‐ARs also have more moisture in the upper troposphere everywhere and stronger integrated water vapor and column relative humidity over the ocean and the interior. Windy‐ARs are associated with an enhanced trough at 500 hPa and lower pressure at sea level, which promote a stronger low‐level southerly wind component and colder temperatures. These together lead to stronger low‐level IVT that are more perpendicular to the coastline and mountain ranges and stronger low‐level relative humidity near the coastline, despite less total column moisture. Windy‐ARs are also associated with stronger IVT convergence and stronger synoptic‐scale ascent forcing near coastal areas than moist‐ARs."

We employed the Polar‐WRF model, driven by ERA5 initial and boundary conditions between 2005 and 2011. The sea ice concentration (SIC) and sea surface temperature (SST) conditions were derived from two realistic regional Southern Ocean MITgcm simulations, consisting of a control and a wind sensitivity experiment. In the latter, the zonal wind stress over the Southern Ocean is increased by a factor of 1.5, leading to a significant decrease in SIC and an increase in SST. Our Polar‐WRF simulations indicate that the winter and spring seasons are marked by significant meteorological changes, including a notable increase in surface air temperature (over 2.4°C) and sea level pressure (over 2 hPa). These atmospheric changes are particularly large in the Bellingshausen Sea, adjacent to the Antarctic Peninsula and the Western Pacific Ocean. The intensified advection of warm‐moist air may further contribute to sea ice decline, with potential implications for increased melting of ice shelves in the Weddell and Ross Seas. The simulations illustrate that variations in wind stress could provide insights into the atmospheric‐sea ice dynamics driving recent record lows in Antarctic sea ice, underscoring the importance of such modeling for understanding and predicting changes."

They find an analytic steady-state solution that exhibits a symmetry-breaking bifurcation responsible for the rectification. 
 Conventional metals cannot undergo rectification at low-field regions because the existence of Fermi energy prohibits nonlinear responses. Similarly, materials with inversion symmetry typically do not exhibit rectification as it necessitates the inversion symmetry breaking in the conventional mechanism. In this study, we report our observation of symmetry-forbidden rectification in metals, realized as a non-equilibrium steady state in an inversion-symmetric Weyl metallic phase of Bi1-xSbx (x = 3–4%). Constructing a van der Pol nonlinear differential equation derived from axion electrodynamics, we find an analytic steady-state solution that exhibits a symmetry-breaking bifurcation responsible for the rectification.

This study shows that the morphological adaptations of ciliates for phagotrophy were shaped by hydrodynamic forces. 
 Phagotrophy, the ability of cells to ingest organic particles, marked a pivotal milestone in evolution, enabling the emergence of single-celled eukaryotes that consume other organisms and leading to multicellular life. However, reliance on food particles also created a mechanical challenge—how to coordinate the transfer of particles from the exterior environment to the cell interior? Here, we investigate this important link using mechanistic models of ciliates, a clade of single-celled eukaryotes that either swim or attach and generate feeding currents to capture prey. We demonstrate that ciliates optimize their feeding efficiency by designating a specific portion of the cell surface as a ‘mouth,’ and optimal cilia coverage varies by life strategy: for sessile ciliates, prey encounter is most efficient when cilia are arranged in bands around oral structures while ciliates that swim display diverse ciliary arrangements that meet the cell’s nutritional needs. Importantly, beyond a threshold of doubling nutrient uptake, further increases in feeding flux do not seem to be a dominant selective force in cell design.

 The Perseverance rover is currently exploring Jezero crater to collect, characterize and cache the first planned samples of Mars for future return to Earth. Orbital and rover observations suggest a volcanic origin for crater floor materials, sources of which have thus far been unknown. Here we describe a mountain on the crater’s southeastern rim with morphological, thermophysical, and mineralogical properties consistent with explosive volcanoes previously identified on Mars and Earth. The mountain’s low thermal inertia and scarcity of superposed impact craters are consistent with a fine-grained, weakly consolidated material such as volcanic ash. Possible flow margins from its northwestern flank extending onto Jezero crater’s floor indicate that it could have plausibly supplied volcanic materials to the crater. If so, then radioisotope dating of igneous rock samples cached by Perseverance could eventually make this the first volcano of precisely known age on another terrestrial planet.

 Climate change in seasonally snow-covered mountain catchments is reducing water supply and decreasing streamflow predictability. Here, we use tritium age dating to show that contrary to the common assumption that snowmelt quickly contributes to runoff, streamflow during snowmelt in western US catchments is dominated by older groundwater. The average age of streamwater during snowmelt runoff (5.7 ± 4.3 years) was intermediate to the average age of groundwater (10.4 ± 4.5 years) and recent precipitation, indicating that 58% (±34%) of snowmelt runoff was derived from groundwater. Water ages, streamflow, and groundwater storage were mediated by bedrock geology: low-permeability hard rock/shale catchments exhibited younger ages, less storage, and more efficient streamflow generation than high-permeability sandstone/clastic catchments. Our results demonstrate that snowmelt runoff is the result of multiple prior years of climate mediated by groundwater storage. Including these interactions will be crucial for predicting water resources as climate and landscape changes accelerate.

 Compound flooding, which is driven by both inland and coastal forcing, poses an increasing threat to coastal regions. However, the current preliminary flood risk assessments under the EU Floods Directive (FD) focus primarily on single-driver events, often overlooking compound flooding risks. Here we introduce a cost-effective framework to identify and rank areas of potential significant flood risk (APSFRs) on the basis of their compound flooding potential. The framework uses a composite index that considers intensity, correlation and probability, along with a cluster analysis, to categorize the APSFRs by dominant flood mechanisms. Using the 1,600 km Spanish Western Mediterranean coastline as a case study, the framework is used herein to identify three key regions with high compound flood potential, with 11% of the 214 analyzed APSFRs falling into the most severe category. The results demonstrate the ability of the proposed methodology to pinpoint areas where high-resolution flood risk assessments are needed and support the efficient integration of compound flooding analysis into the third implementation cycle of the FD.

 Tree-level structural parameters estimation plays a key role in the researches and practice in sustainable forest management, carbon storage estimation, as well as ecological function evaluation. However, single Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) platform exhibits limitations when acquiring complete (i.e., including over-story and under-story) point cloud data for forest stands, e.g., UAV LiDAR systems tend to overlook details of the tree trunk or the lower ground, while Backpack LiDAR systems struggle to capture the treetop, etc. The limited shared features of point clouds from UAV and Backpack LiDAR sensors also pose challenges in the accurate registration and merging of these datasets. In this study, we proposed a marker free automatic registration framework for multi-platform forest point clouds with terrain features. The framework comprised three key stages: first, a curvature-adaptive weighting mechanism was adapted to optimized the Fast Point Feature Histogram (FPFH) descriptors for initial coarse registration, utilizing terrains features. Second, individual tree positions were extracted from each platform’s LiDAR dataset and employed as key feature points for matching. Third, a similarity function was constructed to evaluate the most geometrically consistent point correspondences across platforms, which were subsequently refined through an Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. Furthermore, a voxel-based denoising algorithm that integrated point density with vertical connectivity was developed to identify and filter out noise from the backpack LiDAR data—specifically, non-structural elements such as branches and shrubs. This denoising process laid a robust foundation for accurately locating individual tree centers. Additionally, a layer-wise adaptive circular fitting method was introduced for determining trunk positions. By clustering trunk point clouds at successive vertical layers, this method yielded precise estimates of straight, individual tree trunk centers for use in subsequent registration steps. The proposed framework achieved a registration accuracy of RMSE = 0.098–0.134 m across diverse forest types and terrain conditions, demonstrating its robustness and applicability in complex environments. This facilitated the integration of UAV and backpack LiDAR technologies in forestry resource monitoring.

 Flood forecasting is a vital segment of disaster risk management in that it contributes to the prediction of the magnitude, occurrence, duration and timing of floods. Owing to the nonlinear nature of atmospheric phenomena, however, forecasting becomes a challenging task that requires a multifaceted approach involving various sensors. Indeed, there exist compounding evidence that flood processes would benefit from use of various sensors. One such sensor is the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on (GRACE-FO), which provides Total Water Storage (TWS) products that could potentially be useful for flood monitoring and forecasting. However, GRACE/GRACE-FO’s coarse spatial resolution of 300 km remains a bottleneck to the full exploitation of its products for flood studies and management. Herein, a deep learning Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method with high learning capability that optimizes the hyperparameters is proposed to downscale the coarse GRACE/GRACE-FO TWS products (from 300 km to 55 km). Its spatial and temporal learning is subjected to three different training scenarios (i.e., 60 %, 70 % and 85 %), where the one with least root-mean-square-errors (RMSE) is selected as the best-case scenario. The proposed LSTM deep learning approach is tested based on the 2019 Lorestan flood in Iran, where the results show that it successfully models the spatio-temporal behavior of TWS changes with its long-term and short-term memory capabilities. In March and April 2019, heavy precipitation caused a significant increase in TWS changes, approximately 40 ± 2 cm. This is captured by the LSTM-downscaled products but not the coarse GRACE/GRACE-FO TWS changes. Furthermore, the LSTM downscaled GRACE-FO TWS for the period after 2018 shows a strong and statistically significant mean correlation (above 0.70 at the 95 % confidence level) with both river discharge and precipitation. The original GRACE-FO on the other hand shows a correlation of 0.40, indicating the superiority of the LSTM-derived GRACE-FO’s TWS changes. The coarse resolution of the GRACE satellite is a major cause of low correlation, which improves after downscaling. LSTM thus has the potential of downscaling GRACE products, providing data that are useful for flood process, management and studies."

 Topographic effects in mountainous forested regions disrupt the spectral consistency of remote sensing imagery, hindering accurate forest disturbance detection in Landsat time series acquired over wide time intervals (WTW-LTSs). This study evaluates the necessity of topographic correction for improving forest disturbance detection and proposes a novel post-processing topographic correction framework using the sun-canopy-sensor with C corrections (SCS + C) model. The framework simulates spectral reflectance distortions from illumination variations in uncorrected WTW-LTSs before change detection and employs post-processing to remove the resulting topographic artifacts from detected disturbances. Applied in Yunnan Province, China, the results show that (1) the post-processing framework effectively distinguishes topographic artifacts caused by intra-annual variations, achieving a high accuracy of 81.65 %; (2) by removing topographic artifacts, the post-processing framework significantly enhances forest disturbance detection, improving overall accuracy (OA), user’s accuracy (UA), and producer’s accuracy (PA) by 0.38 %–0.51 %, 1.08 %–1.83 %, and 0.18 %–2.18 %, respectively; (3) the pre-processing framework introduces uncertainties, reducing OA and PA by 0.1 % and 1.93 %–2.99 %, leading to the omission of 14.15 %–16.77 % of disturbances and the false detection of 10.03 %–14.57 % of new disturbances. These findings underscore the importance of eliminating topographic effects in WTW-LTSs for accurate forest disturbance detection. The proposed post-processing framework significantly improves accuracy, particularly in complex terrains, contributing to more reliable disturbance maps. This advancement provides valuable insights for ecological monitoring and supports sustainable forest management for mountainous regions."

 The Zonally Averaged Energy and Moisture BAlance (ZEMBA) climate model is introduced as a simple and computationally efficient tool for studies of the glacial–interglacial cycles of the Quaternary. The model is based on an energy balance model comprising an atmospheric layer, a land component and a two-dimensional ocean transport model with sea ice. In addition, ZEMBA replaces temperature with moist static energy for calculations of diffusive heat transport in the atmospheric layer and includes a hydrological cycle for simulating precipitation and snowfall. Prior to coupling with an ice sheet model, we present and evaluate equilibrium simulations of the model for the pre-industrial period and the Last Glacial Maximum, using prescribed land ice fractions and elevation. In addition, we test the sensitivity of ZEMBA to a doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration and a 2 % increase in solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere. Compared to a global climate model (the Norwegian Earth System Model version 2, NorESM2) and reanalysis data (ERA5), ZEMBA reproduces the zonally averaged climate of the pre-industrial period with reasonable accuracy, capturing features such as surface temperature, precipitation, radiative fluxes, snow cover, sea ice cover and meridional heat transport. The response of ZEMBA to increasing CO2 concentrations is qualitatively similar to the observational record and climate models of higher complexity, including polar amplification over the Northern Hemisphere and during the winter months. The globally averaged rise in surface air temperature for a doubling in CO2 is 3.6 °C. Finally, ZEMBA shows success in emulating changes in surface temperature and precipitation during the Last Glacial Maximum when compared to reconstructions and global climate models."

We show that RPs were exponential only for colloids that attached under favorable conditions, whereas RPs were nonmonotonic for colloids that attached under unfavorable conditions, with RPs for multiple intercepting attachers assuming γ distributions having maxima at transport distances that increased with interception order. We show that in our experiments the value of attachment efficiency (α) was greater for multiple than single interception attachers, and we speculate on the origin of this change in α.

Existing methods for estimating Tmh fall into four categories: single‐source methods employing spatial downscaling or diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) models and multisource methods employing spatiotemporal fusion or DTC models. Despite this methodological diversity, a comprehensive evaluation of their respective strengths and weaknesses remains lacking, posing a challenge for advancing Tmh estimation. To address this critical gap, we performed a wide‐ranging comparison of eight representative approaches for estimating Tmh, comprising two from each category. Their accuracies were assessed over various timescales and conditions, utilizing in situ LST observations from 77 ground‐based stations worldwide. Our evaluations show that DTC‐based multisource approaches exhibit the highest overall accuracy, outperforming both spatial downscaling‐based single‐source approaches and spatiotemporal fusion‐based multisource approaches. Conversely, the performance of DTC‐based single‐source methods exhibits substantial disparity. This observed pattern of overall accuracy remains valid across months, seasons, land cover types, and climatic zones. Furthermore, our assessments indicate that accuracies are time‐of‐day dependent. Spatial downscaling and spatiotemporal fusion approaches are most effective around 2 hr after sunrise, while DTC‐based approaches show better performance around midday. Our findings suggest that this work holds potential significance for generating fine‐resolution hourly LST data with enhanced accuracy."

Traditional methods rely on rainfall intensity (R) as a proxy, oversimplifying the complex microphysical processes of raindrop formation. In contrast, our study introduces a physically based framework that leverages dual‐polarization radar (DPR) variables—capturing key raindrop properties—to enhance RKE prediction through methods ranging from statistical regression to advanced machine learning. Statistical regression models with DPR variables show superior accuracy over traditional R‐based methods in RKE prediction. Meanwhile, machine learning models, developed through four algorithms to create 12 advanced models, surpass linear DPR models by better handling extreme conditions. Among these, the Local Cascade Ensemble model utilizing DPR variables and simple environmental conditions (LCE‐DPRS) stands out for its balance of effectiveness and ease of use, making it the recommended approach for RKE estimation. Specifically, this model achieves reductions exceeding 70% in both root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error compared to traditional rainfall R‐based methods. Additionally, 1 month of X‐band dual‐polarization radar observations was validated using in situ raindrop size distributions measured by disdrometers. The LCE‐DPRS model demonstrated effective high‐resolution, real‐time spatiotemporal predictions, significantly reducing errors during intense rainfall events.

The stratification conditions in the surface layer are represented by the stability parameter (ζ), calculated as the ratio of the reference height z to the Monin‐Obukhov length L (i.e., ζ = z/L). Current surface layer schemes exhibit uncertainties under strong stable conditions (ζ > 1). The Grachev2007 scheme for ζ > 1 and the Li2014 and Li2015 schemes for calculating ζ are implemented into the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF‐Chem). Two successive radiation fog events in the Yangtze River Delta are simulated to compare the improved scheme with the default scheme. Both fog events occur under high‐pressure conditions characterized by clear sky and light wind during the nighttime. The results indicate that strong stable conditions dominate before fog formation, and the improved scheme improves threat scores for fog formation. Regarding surface flux, due to reduced surface thermal resistance in parameterization, increased surface heat exchange in the improved scheme enhances cooling from sensible heat flux for ζ > 1, which is conducive to fog formation. Regarding turbulent thermal mixing, the increased surface dynamic exchange in the improved scheme enhances surface drag and reduces wind speed for ζ > 1. This weakens the contribution of wind shear to turbulent kinetic energy, ultimately promoting fog formation. The findings of this paper are applicable to radiation fog simulations in other regions, such as plain areas covered with grassland, cropland, or other vegetation, providing support for improving fog simulation."

While global climate models generate invaluable dynamical temperature forecasts, the crucial role of model output statistics (MOS) in enhancing forecast skill has not been thoroughly investigated. This paper aims to unravel the potential of MOS methods for improving global temperature forecasts. It is achieved by developing a MOS toolkit to iteratively incorporate the attributes of bias, spread, trend, and association into forecast post‐processing, resulting in a series of methodical one‐factor‐at‐a‐time experiments. A case study is devised for monthly forecasts of July 2‐m air temperature (T2m) over land and sea surface temperature (SST) generated by the National Center for Environmental Prediction's Climate Forecast System version 2. The results expose the detrimental impacts of biases and unreliable ensemble spreads within raw temperature forecasts. At the lead time of 0 months, the continuous ranked probability skill score (CRPSS) is −128.51 ± 252.46% for T2m over land and 7.72 ± 76.66% for SST over ocean, indicating considerable underperformance of raw forecasts against reference climatological forecasts across numerous grid cells. The incremental considerations of bias, spread, trend, and association of the MOS methods result in substantial skill enhancements across global land and marine grid cells. Notably, the CRPSS of T2m is improved to 21.00 ± 23.63% and the SST forecast skill is improved to 42.26 ± 22.43%.

Prior studies have used localized observational records to analyze air temperature trends across distinct geographical regions, leaving local and inter‐regional variations to be undetected. Using the high‐resolution temperature product AntAir ICE, air temperature trends and extreme warming events were identified across Antarctica for the period 2003–2021. Unsupervised clustering was applied to austral summer and annual mean air temperature trends to divide Antarctica into 12 regions exhibiting similarity in temperature trends. Our results show a significant annual mean cooling trend of ‒0.12°CYr $0.12\,\sfrac{{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}}{\text{Yr}}$ for the terrestrial Antarctic Peninsula, and an austral summer (annual) warming trend of +0.08°CYr $0.08\,\sfrac{{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}}{\text{Yr}}$ (+0.07°CYr $0.07\,\sfrac{{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}}{\text{Yr}}$) in the Ross Sea region's Victoria Land and Transantarctic Mountains. The spatial extent of each of the 12 clusters' extreme air temperature events was mapped in austral summer revealing that West Antarctica has spatially confined events, while East Antarctica events are widespread. ERA5 data indicate that West Antarctica's extreme air temperature events are associated with consistent meridional atmospheric flows. Local to regional extreme warming events in East Antarctica are associated with inland high‐pressure systems, which enhance katabatic winds. Localized warming events around complex coastal geographies appear to be related to mesoscale wind systems such as foehn but require further investigation using mesoscale numerical weather models.

Glacier runoff is a crucial source of water in mountain basins, and a decrease in its contribution can affect agricultural production. In this study, we modeled the agricultural sector's response to changes in glacier runoff in the Asian basins of Amu Darya, Tarim Interior, and Indus, using the Global Change Analysis Model, which was driven by surface runoff derived from the Xanthos hydrological model and the Open Global Glacier Model. Our findings indicate that under SSP5‐8.5, there is an increase in accessible water during the Peak‐Water Glacier Runoff compared to the Historical Glacier Runoff scenario. However, accessible water under SSP58.5 falls below the Historical Glacier Runoff scenario in the last decades of the 21st century. The initial increase in accessible water drives the GCAM agricultural model to increase the production of oil crops, root tubers, sugar crops, and fruits, but only temporarily until peak glacier runoff occurrence. In Pakistan, we observe the adaptive response of neighboring basins (increased production) to a reduction in crop production in the Amu Darya and Indus and vice versa. Our results support the argument that policymakers should implement a holistic long‐term perspective, in which the apparent positive economic effect of the temporary increase in accessible water is balanced with the threat to intergenerational access to freshwater and ecosystem conservation."

This study explored the change in heat‐hospitalization association from days with low to high temperature variabilities (TVs) in Brazil. We collected data on daily hospitalization and weather from 1,814 Brazilian cities during the 2000–2015 hot seasons. For each city, the heat‐hospitalization association was estimated using the quasi‐Poisson regression with constrained lag model on days with low and high TVs, respectively. City‐specific effect estimates were then pooled using random‐effect meta‐analysis. Stratified analyses were performed by region, sex, age‐group and cause category. Our results showed that at the national level the risk of hospitalization increased by 4.4% [95% confidence interval (CI): 4.0%–4.7%] and 2.7% (95%CI: 2.4%–3.0%) per 5°C increase in daily mean temperature on days with low and high TVs, respectively. The effect modification of TV on heat‐hospitalization association was significant in the northeast, southeast and south, and for most population groups except for the children aged 0–4 years and the elderly aged ≥80 years. Significant effect modification of TV was observed in injury and poisoning, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Our findings suggest that in Brazil, the heat‐health association is substantially modified by exposure to TV.

We used a time‐stratified case‐crossover design, restricted to the warm season (May through September) and stratified by maternal age, maternal education, ZCTA‐level impervious land cover or social deprivation index. We pooled estimated odds ratios across states using inverse‐variance weighting. The PTB and ETB analyses included up to 945,836 and 2,966,661 cases, respectively. Heat‐related ETB risk was consistently highest among women <25 years of age, women with ≤high school education, and women living in areas of higher social deprivation and impervious land cover. PTB associations were also elevated in these subgroups, but positive associations were also observed among older, more educated mothers, and in areas with less social deprivation. Across all subgroups and outcomes, the change in odds associated with heat waves ranged from no increase to a 7.9% increase.

This straightforward and gas-free protocol transforms a diverse array of styrene and unactivated alkenes into highly valuable α-arylated dialkyl ketones with high levels of enantioselectivity, allowing for the construction of enantioenriched unsymmetric dialkyl ketones from only alkenes.

 Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are promising candidates for beyond-silicon electronic devices. However, an excessive contact resistance due to ineffective or non-existent doping techniques hinders their technological readiness. Here, we unveil the doping mechanism of pure nitric oxide and demonstrate its effectiveness on wafer-scale grown monolayer and bilayer tungsten diselenide (1L- and 2L-WSe2) transistors, where doping bands induced by nitric oxide can realign the Schottky barrier and approach p-type unipolar transport. This doping approach, combined with a scaled high-κ dielectric, yields WSe2 transistors with high performance metrics.

 Gestational diabetes mellitus, a heritable metabolic disorder and the most common pregnancy-related condition, remains understudied regarding its genetic architecture and its potential for early prediction using genetic data. Here we conducted genome-wide association studies on 116,144 Chinese pregnancies, leveraging their non-invasive prenatal test sequencing data and detailed prenatal records. We identified 13 novel loci for gestational diabetes mellitus and 111 for five glycemic traits, with minor allele frequencies of 0.01-0.5 and absolute effect sizes of 0.03-0.62. Approximately 50% of these loci were specific to gestational diabetes mellitus and gestational glycemic levels, distinct from type 2 diabetes and general glycemic levels in East Asians. A machine learning model integrating polygenic risk scores and prenatal records predicted gestational diabetes mellitus before 20 weeks of gestation, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.729 and an accuracy of 0.835. Shapley values highlighted polygenic risk scores as key contributors. This model offers a cost-effective strategy for early gestational diabetes mellitus prediction using clinical non-invasive prenatal test.

This work demonstrates an outdoor radiant cooling structure incorporating infrared-reflective surfaces that delivers enhanced thermal comfort. 
 As climate change accelerates, extreme heat events will intensify, threatening vulnerable populations experiencing dangerous heat outdoors. Active radiant cooling has recently emerged as a promising strategy for outdoor thermal comfort, at it offers cooling at a distance without the inefficiency of conditioning unconfined air. However, for radiant cooling structures to be effective, the overwhelming majority of their internal surfaces must be actively cooled, typically with visibly opaque panels, raising practicality and safety concerns. Here, we demonstrate that thermal comfort can be achieved in an outdoor cooling structure that lightly uses radiant cooling and amplifies this cooling effect using visibly transparent, infrared-reflective surfaces. This approach enables visibly open cooling structures that will be accepted by a wide range of communities. We first derive an analytical model that relates the mean radiant temperature to the proportion of cold and reflective surfaces in a structure. We then experimentally demonstrate such a structure, with human subject testing revealing a substantial enhancement in thermal comfort as experienced by occupants. Our results highlight how next-generation radiant cooling structures can use fewer actively cooled surfaces without compromising on cooling effectiveness. This is a practical approach to enabling thermal comfort outdoors in extreme heat conditions.

 Atmospheric moisture flows play a vital role in the hydrological cycle, connecting evaporation sources to precipitation sinks. While high-resolution tracking models provide valuable insights, discrepancies arise comparing tracked flows to atmospheric reanalysis data. Here we reconcile tracked atmospheric flows with reanalysis data by means of the Iterative Proportional Fitting applied to the UTrack dataset (averaged over 2008–2017) aggregated within countries and ocean boundaries. It corrects country-scale discrepancies of up to 275% in precipitation and 225% in evaporation, adjusting bilateral flows by  ~ 0.07 %, on average. The resulting dataset ensures that the total tracked moisture matches total precipitation at the sink and evaporation at the source annually. Remarkably, this procedure can be applied to any tracking model output and scale of analysis. The reconciled dataset enhances transboundary atmospheric water flows analysis, revealing that 45% of total terrestrial precipitation (~1.5  ⋅ 105 km3yr−1) originates from land evaporation (9.8  ⋅ 104 km3yr−1).

 Increased CH4 emissions from rewetted organic soils can undermine the climate benefits of reduced CO2 release. This is especially problematic in low-lying areas that tend to remain waterlogged and act as potential CH4 hotspots. Here we test whether burning the soil surface before rewetting can reduce CH4 emissions. Using laboratory experiments with soil cores collected from degraded farmland in Denmark, we found that rewetting organic soils following burning reduced CH4 emissions by more than 95% over a 90-day period compared to rewetting alone. The reduction was likely associated with changed soil chemistry such as increased soil carbon stability and the decrease in methanogen abundance and activity. Our results suggest that targeted burning could help suppress short-term CH4 emissions after rewetting. However, long-term field studies are needed to understand whether this effect persists and to assess potential ecological risks such as pollution runoff, before any broader field-scale implementation is considered.

 China has restored extensive forest areas through afforestation and natural regeneration, contributing to climate change mitigation. However, the restoration patterns and the mechanisms driving aboveground carbon accumulation in these forests remain unclear. We mapped the distribution of the aboveground carbon accumulation rates for China’s young planted and natural forests in 2020 and identified key factors influencing their variability using remote sensing and field data. The analysis reveals marked spatial heterogeneity in aboveground carbon accumulation rates of these restored young forests, driven primarily by seasonal temperature. At comparable ages, young planted forests show lower aboveground carbon accumulation rates than young natural forests, mainly due to different tree density. Although young planted forests currently sequester more carbon, projections indicate that by 2060 its total aboveground carbon stock will be lower than that of young natural forests. Consequently, our findings emphasize optimizing forest structure in managing China’s planted forests to enhance carbon storage.

 The growth of the Tibetan Plateau is traditionally attributed to the India-Asia collision and subsequent convergence. However, recent paleo-elevation reconstructions suggest that Gangdese arc in southern Tibetan Plateau reached >4.0 km before or alongside the collision. Here we reconstruct the crustal thickness evolution of the Gangdese arc during the Late Cretaceous-Cenozoic using a machine learning model and investigate the thermal evolution by analyzing the metamorphic temperature-pressure-age properties of crustal rocks. Isostatic calculations are performed to constrain the crustal density evolution. Our results show that crustal thickness decreased from ~60 to ~40 km between 80 and 55 Ma, with an increase in lithosphere geotherm and a drop in average crustal density (from ~2.97 to ~2.70 g/cm3). These results suggest the removal of a 20 km thick dense lower crust during that period. Combined with numerical modeling and geological evidence, we propose that lower crustal foundering drove the uplift of the Gangdese arc during the Paleocene, independent of the India-Asia collision.

 Satellite remote sensing has greatly advanced the study of land surface phenology, providing crucial insights into large-scale vegetation dynamics in the context of climate change. Multi-sensor satellite-derived vegetation proxies, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in optical mode, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) in fluorescence mode, and vegetation optical depth (VOD) in microwave mode, are effective indicators of vegetation dynamics in greenness, biomass, and productivity. However, a comprehensive understanding of phenological patterns derived from these proxies and their climatic responses remains limited. In this study, spanning 1988–2021, we analyzed spatio-temporal patterns and climatic responses of spring green-up dates (GUDs) and autumn dates of foliar senescence (DFSs) across the three vegetation proxies. We found broadly consistent trends of advancing GUDs (−2.4 to −1.1 days decade−1) across proxies, while DFSs exhibited divergent temporal patterns: VOD-derived DFSs showed significant delays (+1.1 days decade−1), whereas NDVI- and SIF-derived DFSs displayed no clear trends. Rising temperatures were the primary driver of earlier GUDs, while precipitation and insolation had limited influence. In autumn, warming delayed VOD-based DFSs but had minimal effects on NDVI- and SIF-based estimates. Spatial attribution analyses indicated that both biotic and abiotic factors contributed to the spatial variability in climatic responses, with species richness and tree density modulating temperature effects. These findings highlight the importance of proxy selection in phenological studies and underscore the need for integrated investigations into the biophysical mechanisms driving non-uniform climatic responses across vegetation proxies."

 Gaseous and particulate organic compounds are key components of atmospheric chemistry and better understanding their composition, sources and processes is essential to limit their impacts. Source apportionment using positive matrix factorization (PMF) is customarily performed for such studies. Combining organic aerosol data with their gaseous precursors was shown to be a promising approach, however very rarely attempted so far, to refine their origins using PMF. In this study, co-located continuous proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) and aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) measurements were performed at the suburban SIRTA station located in the Paris region. A combined dataset using both instruments during summer (June–August 2020) was then used in an exploratory PMF analysis to investigate the sources and processes of organic compounds, particularly the influences of biogenic emissions and important photochemical reactions on the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in this period of the year. Specific parameters and evaluation procedures were needed to ensure an equivalent representation of both instruments in the PMF model. A weighing factor was applied to the PTR-MS uncertainties which was controlled and optimized based on the analysis of the modelled scaled residuals. Seven main factors were obtained, describing anthropogenic sources (hydrocarbon-like organics, cooking-like organics), primary biogenic volatile organics, nighttime VOC, oxidized organics, aged organics and a specific isoprene oxidation factor which contributed 11 % to VOC and 4 % to OA. Compared to single-instrument PMFs, more factors were obtained, notably including the cooking-like factor which is not usually resolved using only ACSM data. This method also showed a better mathematical performance for the PTR-MS variables (mean absolute scaled residuals lower for the combined PMF (11.2) than for the PTR-MS-only PMF (38.2)) and a better separation of the factors for the ACSM variables in the combined PMF."

 In recent years, the demand for rice in Africa has been growing rapidly, and, in order to meet this demand, the rice cultivation area is also expanding rapidly; thus, it is of great significance to monitor the rice cultivation in Africa. The spatial and temporal distribution of rice cultivation in Africa is complex, making it difficult to use phenology-based rice identification methods, and the existing rice distribution products of Africa are all made up of grid-based statistical data with a low resolution, unable to obtain accurate rice field location and available labels. To address these two difficulties, based on time series optical and dual-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, this study proposes a sample set construction method by means of fast-coarse-positioning-assisted visual interpretation and a feature-importance-guided supervised classification combining multiple temporal optical and SAR features to reduce the impact of rice diversity in Africa. Firstly, we use the time series statistical features of vertical transmit, horizontal receive (VH) data for fast coarse positioning and screening of possible rice areas and combine multiple auxiliary data for visual interpretation to construct the sample set; secondly, based on the complementary information in SAR data and optical data, the 20 m Africa rice distribution map of 2023 was completed by combining the object-oriented segmentation results of temporal optical images and the pixel-based classification results of temporal SAR data features after feature selection. The average classification accuracy of the proposed method for the validation set is more than 85 %, and the R2 of the linear fit to various existing statistical data is more than 0.9, which proves that the proposed method can achieve the spatial distribution mapping of rice under complex climatic conditions in a large region, providing crucial data support for rice monitoring and agricultural policy development.

A new dataset, which spans the period from 1995 to 2021, offers consistently processed coordinate time series for 286 GPS sites and promises to enhance future geodynamic research. 
 For nearly 3 decades, geodetic Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements in Antarctica have provided direct observations of bedrock displacement, which is linked to various geodynamic processes, including plate motion, post-seismic deformation, and glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). Previous geodynamic studies in Antarctica, especially those pertaining to GIA, have been constrained by the limited availability of GNSS data. This is due to the fact that GNSS data are collected by a wide range of institutions and network operators, with the raw observational data either not publicly available or scattered across various repositories. Further, the metadata necessary for rigorous data processing have often not been available or reliable. Consequently, the potential of GNSS observations for geodynamic studies in Antarctica has not been fully exploited yet. Here, we present consistently processed coordinate time series for GNSS sites in Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic region for the time span from 1995 to 2021. The data set is composed of 286 continuous and episodic sites, with 258 sites having a time span longer than 3 years. The coordinate time series were obtained from a combination of four independent processing solutions using different GNSS software and products, allowing the identification of inconsistencies in individual solutions. From these, we infer a reliable and robust combined solution. A key issue was the thorough reassessment of station metadata to minimise artefacts and biases in the coordinate time series. The resulting data set provides coordinate time series with unprecedented spatiotemporal coverage, promising significant advancements in future geodynamic studies in Antarctica.

We built source-associated genome databases using publicly available reference genomes and metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) recovered from short- and long-read sequencing of the fecal spike-ins, and then created an associated bioinformatic tool, called SourceApp, for inferring source attribution and apportionment by mapping the metagenomic data to these genome databases. SourceApp’s performance varied substantially by source, with cows being underestimated due to under sampling of cow fecal microbiomes. Parameter tuning revealed sensitivity and specificity near 0.90 overall, which exceeded all alternative tools.

This study explores OA composition, sources, and atmospheric transformations in Beijing before and during the coal ban using online aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) and offline 14C measurements. Four primary factors (hydrocarbon-like, cooking, biomass burning, coal combustion OA) and one secondary factor (oxygenated OA, OOA) were resolved from ACSM. In response to the coal ban, OA concentrations generally decreased, but coal combustion OA decreased most strongly, consistent with the decreased fossil carbon contributions to OA (67 ± 3% before vs 55 ± 4% during the ban). Concurrently, the OOA fraction increased from 45 to 72%, due to a larger decrease in  concentrations of primary OA (POA; 59–88%)  compared to OOA (34%), highlighting the enhanced secondary aerosol formation during the coal ban period. This aligns with the 14C evidence of higher water-soluble carbon in fossil OA (which has mostly secondary sources). During the coal ban period, Ox concentrations doubled and were positively correlated with the OOA fraction, highlighting strong photochemical OA production. The results show that the reduction of POA from stringent clean air actions is partially offset by enhanced secondary OA formation."

The findings demonstrated that 6PPD-Q accumulated at a higher concentration (6.77 ± 0.124 ng/g) in earthworms (Eisenia fetida) compared to 6PPD (5.41 ± 0.002 ng/g), triggering more severe oxidative stress and cellular homeostatic imbalance. Specifically, 100 ng/g of 6PPD-Q in soil significantly elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels by 180.77% and suppressed acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and Ca2+-ATPase activities by 17.14% and 44.70%, respectively. Notably, 6PPD-Q uniquely disrupted the nitrogen balance and disturbed energy supply by strongly inhibiting fatty acid degradation and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathways. Additionally, 6PPD-Q profoundly altered the abundance of key microbes and microbial network stability, affecting intestinal microbial functions such as bile secretion, hormone synthesis, and lipid digestion, thus exacerbating the energy metabolic imbalance in earthworms.

Applying a nontargeted analysis (NTA) approach, we sought to isolate occupationally related chemical exposures that were unique to nurses by flagging features that were different from office workers in abundance (mean; 95th percentile) or detection frequency. Of 9828 negative electrospray ionization (ESI-) and 6898 positive electrospray ionization (ESI+) detected chemical features, 1094 and 938, respectively, were higher in nurses, possibly due to workplace exposures. We deciphered the molecular structures of these chemical features by applying data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and targeted MS/MS approaches to pooled samples from each occupational group, and we annotated them using spectral MS/MS databases in MS-DIAL. Nurses had higher concentrations of 14 chemicals that we identified at Schymanski Level 1 (N = 6) or 2 (N = 8), as well as 20 tentatively identified chemicals without spectra. Several chemicals may be occupationally relevant for nurses, including a PFAS (6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid), tridecanedioic acid, salicylic acid, and the medications acetaminophen and theophylline.

Previous studies have demonstrated the adverse effects of pesticide exposure on lipid metabolism. However, population studies have focused primarily on individual pesticides and have short-term fluctuations, and the animal experiments used doses far higher than those exposed by the general population. In this study, urinary concentrations of metabolites of three classes of pesticides, including organophosphate, pyrethroid, and phenoxy carboxylic acid, were determined in 1858 participants of repeated cross-sectional biomonitoring programs from 2018 to 2022. We comprehensively analyzed the association of pesticide metabolites and pesticide exposure patterns with lipid metabolism biomarkers. The indirect effects of liver function markers in these associations were explored by using the structural equation model analysis. Generalized linear models showed that 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol and para-nitrophenol were positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride. In contrast, 3-phenoxybenzoic acid was negatively correlated with apolipoprotein B. Quantile g-computation and Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression showed a consistent gradual increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels but a gradual decrease in apolipoprotein B levels with increasing exposure to pesticide mixtures. By analyzing the exposure patterns of different categories of pesticides, we found that the population has a high level of exposure to organophosphate pesticides, which disrupts lipid metabolism more significantly than other pesticides. Liver function exhibited significant mediating effects in the association between pesticide exposure and lipid metabolism biomarkers. The results indicated that pesticide exposure was significantly associated with lipid metabolism, and this association may be modulated by improvements in liver function."

Here, we report that intact hydrophobic crystalline talc was mechanochemically changed into hydrophilic talc, by comminution using high‐energy ball milling. The weight fraction of water on the intact talc was close to zero, which gradually increased to approximately 0.13 with comminution. Then, we performed thermo‐mechanical‐chemical numerical modeling of thermal pressurization (TP) under seismic slip with parameterization of the water content of hydrophilic talc. In the comminuted hydrophilic talc model, the effective shear stress of the talc‐bearing fault patch converges to near zero, accompanied by pore pressure buildup due to seismic frictional heating and TP.

Here, we explore the potential of the Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Programme (OSNAP) array to inform us on mid‐latitude AMOC strength on interannual‐to‐multiannual timescales in two high‐resolution coupled models. We find that the AMOC strength measured at OSNAP is not related to the variability of the AMOC strength at mid‐latitudes. Instead, our study reveals that the density at which the maximum overturning occurs at OSNAP is a key precursor of the mid‐latitude AMOC strength. The causal relationship between AMOC density at the OSNAP array and AMOC strength at 45°N is linked to an atmospherically driven shoaling of isopycnal surfaces that propagates along the western boundary in a year."

Therefore, the ultimate change in ASM precipitation stems from the balance of both the thermodynamic and dynamic effects. This study further examines the impact of rising CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ on ASM rainfall, by taking into account various climate states. Our results suggest that an increase in CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ during warm interglacial periods has a stronger influence from thermodynamic factors than from dynamic factors, resulting in an enhancement in ASM rainfall.

 Deep ocean circulation modulated glacial–interglacial climates through feedbacks to the carbon cycle and energy distribution. Past work has suggested that contraction of well-ventilated North Atlantic Deep Water during glacial times facilitated carbon storage in the deep ocean and drawdown of atmospheric CO2 levels. However, the spatial extent and properties of different water masses remain uncertain, in part due to conflicting palaeoceanographic proxy reconstructions. Here we combine five independent proxies to increase confidence and reconstruct Atlantic deep water distributions during the Last Glacial Maximum (around 21 thousand years ago) and the following Heinrich Stadial 1—a time when massive ice rafting in the North Atlantic interfered with deep water formation and caused global climate shifts. We find that North Atlantic Deep Water remained widespread in both periods, although its properties shifted from a cold, well-ventilated mode to a less-ventilated, possibly warmer, mode. This finding implies a remarkable persistence of deep water formation under these cold boundary conditions, sustained by compensation between the two formation modes. Our constraints provide an important benchmark for evaluating Earth system models, which can enhance confidence in future climate projections.

Here, the authors show that impaired ketogenesis in Leydig cells drives testicular aging, and boosting ketogenesis or supplementing with the ketone body BHB can help mitigate testicular aging. 
 Testicular aging commonly leads to testosterone deficiency and impaired spermatogenesis, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that Leydig cells are particularly vulnerable to aging processes in testis. Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies the expression of Hmgcs2, the gene encoding rate-limiting enzyme of ketogenesis, decreases significantly in Leydig cells from aged mice. Additionally, the concentrations of ketone bodies β-hydroxybutyric acid and acetoacetic acid in young testes are substantially higher than that in serum, but significantly diminish in aged testes. Silencing of Hmgcs2 in young Leydig cells drives cell senescence and accelerated testicular aging. Mechanistically, β-hydroxybutyric acid upregulates the expression of Foxo3a by facilitating histone acetylation, thereby mitigating Leydig cells senescence and promoting testosterone production. Consistently, enhanced ketogenesis by genetic manipulation or oral β-hydroxybutyric acid supplementation alleviates Leydig cells senescence and ameliorates testicular aging in aged mice. These findings highlight defective ketogenesis as a pivotal factor in testicular aging, suggesting potential therapeutic avenues for addressing age-related testicular dysfunction.

 Interlayer magnetic interactions play a pivotal role in determining the magnetic arrangement within van der Waals (vdW) magnets, and the remarkable tunability of these interactions through applied pressure further enhances their significance. Here, we investigate NiI2 flakes, a representative vdW magnet, under hydrostatic pressures up to 11 GPa. We reveal a notable increase in magnetic transition temperatures for both helimagnetic and antiferromagnetic states, and find that a reversible transition between helimagnetic and antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases at approximately 7 GPa challenges established theoretical and experimental expectations. While the increase in transition temperature aligns with pressure-enhanced overall exchange interaction strengths, we identify the significant role of the second-nearest neighbor interlayer interaction

Experimental and simulated results converge on the existence of an intermediate helimagnetic ordered state in NiI2 before transitioning to the AFM state. These findings underscore the pivotal role of interlayer interactions in shaping the magnetic ground state, providing fresh perspectives for innovative applications in nanoscale magnetic device design. Van der Waals magnetic materials are characterized by strong magnetic interactions within each van der Waals layer, while the interaction between the layers is typically weaker.

 Current Aβ-targeting therapeutics for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) only slow cognitive decline due to poor understanding of AD pathogenesis. Here we describe a mechanism of AD pathogenesis in which the histone methyltransferase G9a noncanonically regulates translation of hippocampal proteins associated with AD pathology. Correspondingly, we developed a brain-penetrant inhibitor of G9a, MS1262, which restored both age-related learning & memory and noncognitive functions in multiple AD mouse models. Further, comparison of AD pathology-correlated mouse proteomes with those of AD patients found G9a regulates pathological pathways that promote Aβ and neurofibrillary tangles. This mouse-to-human overlap of G9a regulated AD-associated pathologic proteins supports at the molecular level the efficacy of targeting G9a translational mechanism for treating AD patients. Additionally, MS1262 treatment reversed the AD-characteristic expression or phosphorylation of multiple clinically validated biomarkers of AD that have the potential to be used for early-stage AD diagnosis and companion diagnosis of individualized drug effects.

 Long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) are increasingly recognized as being involved in human physiology and diseases, but there is a lack of mechanistic understanding for the majority of lncRNAs. We comparatively test proposed mechanisms of antisense lncRNA regulation at the X-chromosome Inactivation (XCI) locus. We find that due to stochasticity in transcription, different mechanisms based on the act of transcription regulate Xist and Tsix at different levels of nascent transcription. At medium levels, RNA polymerases transcribe Xist and Tsix on each strand at the same transcription site and deposit significant amounts of the histone mark H3K36me3, which inhibits Xist. At high levels of nascent transcription, many RNA polymerases transcribe Xist or Tsix resulting in transcriptional interference. Therefore, lncRNA expression variability is not just a quirk of transcription but an important aspect of regulation that allows multiple mechanisms to be employed by the same gene locus within the same cell population. This study reveals how stochastic transcription regulates Xist and Tsix through multiple mechanisms. Using single-cell imaging, the authors demonstrate that transcriptional interference occurs at high expression levels, while histone modifications regulate Xist at medium levels."

 Flexible thermoelectric devices enable direct energy conversion between heat and electrical energy, making them ideal for wearable electronics and personal thermal management. Yet, current devices lack functional module expansion, which limits the customization for diverse energy-harvesting heat sources and complicates their assembly to meet the specific power requirements of electrical appliances. Moreover, existing devices cannot be stacked to enhance thermoelectric cooling performance while maintaining flexibility and self-healing capabilities. Here, by selectively encapsulating liquid metal electrodes with carbon nanotube-doped self-healing materials with increased thermal conductivity, we substantially improve heat transfer across thermoelectric legs, thereby maximizing energy conversion efficiency. The device achieves a normalized power density of 3.14 μW⋅cm−2 ⋅ K−2, setting a benchmark for self-healing thermoelectric devices. Benefiting from self-healing materials and liquid metal, the device demonstrates both self-healing capabilities and modular assembly, greatly expanding the application scenarios of flexible thermoelectric devices in wearable power generation and refrigeration.

 The Sudan virus (SUDV) outbreaks in Uganda in 2022 and 2025 created public health concerns in-country and the entire East African region. There are currently no licensed countermeasures against SUDV. We developed a SUDV vaccine candidate based on a nanocarrier (LIONTM) complexed with an alphavirus-based replicon RNA. Here, we compare the protective efficacy of the LION-SUDV vaccine either encoding the SUDV glycoprotein (GP) alone or in combination with the Ebola virus (EBOV) GP (LION-Combination). A LION-EBOV vaccine which is protective against EBOV was also included to determine the potential for cross-protection against SUDV infection. Single-dose vaccinations were conducted three weeks before challenge with a lethal dose of guinea pig-adapted SUDV using a female guinea pig disease model. We demonstrate 100% survival and protection with the LION-SUDV and the LION-Combination vaccines, while the LION-EBOV vaccine achieved 50% protection. Antigen-specific humoral responses correlate with decreased virus replication and survival. This result warrants further studies in larger animal species to ensure that protective efficacy is maintained with the single-dose LION-SUDV vaccine.

Here the authors show that targeting IGF2BP3 disrupts the serine synthesis pathway in AML cells in an RNA N6-Methyladenosine modification dependent manner, sensitizing AML cells to serine and glycine deprivation. 
 Metabolic reprogramming of amino acids represents a vulnerability in cancer cells, yet the mechanisms underlying serine metabolism in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and leukemia stem/initiating cells (LSCs/LICs) remain unclear. Here, we identify RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification as a key regulator of serine biosynthesis in AML. Using a CRISPR/Cas9 screen, we find that depletion of m6A regulators IGF2BP3 or METTL14 sensitizes AML cells to serine and glycine (SG) deprivation. IGF2BP3 recognizies m6A on mRNAs of key serine synthesis pathway (SSP) genes (e.g., ATF4, PHGDH, PSAT1), stabilizing these transcripts and sustaining serine production to meet the high metabolic demand of AML cells and LSCs/LICs. IGF2BP3 silencing combined with dietary SG restriction potently inhibits AML in vitro and in vivo, while its deletion spares normal hematopoiesis.

Now a study explores how various dietary transformations in China can improve public health, make food affordable and reduce environmental impacts, while evaluating the feasibility of the diet changes. 
 The transition to more sustainable diets is critical to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and meet the Paris Agreement commitments. In China, this transition is particularly urgent due to the double burden of malnutrition and environmental degradation. In this study, we explored the potential of alternative diets in China to enhance public health, ensure food affordability and reduce adverse environmental impacts. We assessed these patterns through a multi-objective diet optimization model combined with an agro-economic modelling framework that captures key socio-economic and biophysical dynamics in China. The proposed healthy, affordable and low-environmental-impact diets substantially improve dietary quality and are projected to reduce food expenditures by 20–28% (US$128–186 capita−1 in power purchasing parities of 2005) by 2050. These diets also bring environmental benefits, including a 3–11% (4–13 Mha) expansion of non-forest natural vegetation area and modest biodiversity gains by 2050, a 9–40% (3–13 Gt CO2-equivalent) reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a 5–12% (347–772 km3) decrease in freshwater withdrawals between 2020 and 2050. Our findings underscore the potential to achieve multiple co-benefits through long-term and target-oriented dietary transformations, while also balancing the transformation feasibility with achievable gains.

 The changing character of mid-latitude cold air outbreaks in a warming climate remains unclear, primarily due to uncertainty associated with changing atmospheric dynamics. Here, we employ an event-based storyline approach in which the evolution of the large-scale atmospheric circulation is nudged to reanalysis data at different global warming levels based on historical and medium-to-high-emission scenario simulations. We thereby quantify the thermodynamic climate-change effects of pre-industrial, 2 °C and 4 °C warmer climates compared to present-day climate for three cold surges in East Asia during winter 2020/21. The strongest warming occurs over northeast Asia, reaching up to +12 °C in a + 4 °C warmer climate and caused by the advection of less cold air from winter ice-free regions in the Arctic, where surface air temperature increases by over +20 °C. In contrast, over southern China, a moderate cooling is found from pre-industrial to present-day climates, due to the observed increase in aerosol concentration, peaking by the mid-21st century and altering radiative balances. This cooling effect is likely to persist well into a + 2 °C-warmer climate; however, it may become undetectable at the end of the 21st century (+4 °C warming). Our findings underscore the important thermodynamic impact associated with Arctic amplification and cooling effect of aerosol-induced changes in the radiation budget under a high aerosol emission scenario on East Asian cold extremes."

 We report the drivers of spatiotemporal variability of ice nucleating particles (INPs) for mixed-phase orographic clouds (~−25 °C) in the Eastern Mediterranean. In the planetary boundary layer, pronounced INP diurnal periodicity is observed, which is mainly driven by biological (and to a lesser extent, dust) particles but not aerosols from biomass burning. The comparison of size-resolved and fluorescence-discriminated aerosol particle properties with INPs reveals the primary role of fluorescent bioaerosol. The presence of Saharan dust increases INPs during nighttime more than daytime, because of lower boundary layer height during nighttime which decreases the contribution of aerosols (including bioaerosols) from the boundary layer. INP diurnal periodicity is absent in the free troposphere, although levels are driven by the availability of bioaerosol and dust particles. Given the effective ice nucleation ability of bioaerosols and subsequent effects from ice multiplication at warm temperatures, the lack of such cycles in models points to important and overlooked drivers of cloud formation and precipitation in mountainous regions."

 As global change reshapes ecosystems, establishing conservation priorities is crucial for managing threatened areas with limited resources. Biodiversity hotspots, often defined by high endemism, are key in conservation management. However, these may not capture other dimensions of biodiversity, including functional and phylogenetic diversity or knowledge from Indigenous communities. Here, we demonstrate that different metrics identify different hotspots using simulated plant communities as a case study. We compiled existing data on 318 plant species, including functional trait data and Traditional Ecological Knowledge on Indigenous plant names and uses. We simulated 100,000 communities by randomly assembling species that naturally co-occur within an ecoregion, and calculated taxonomic, phylogenetic, functional, and Traditional Ecological Knowledge-based biodiversity metrics. The metrics cluster into two groups based on shared hotspot identification, with phylogenetic and functional metrics distributed between groups, and Traditional Ecological Knowledge-based metrics aligning with some metrics, but not all. This suggests that integrating Traditional Ecological Knowledge into conservation planning can expand the scope of biodiversity assessments and help recognize places of cultural significance that might otherwise be overlooked.

 We compare five daily MODIS-derived snow albedo products to terrain-corrected, in situ data from sites in California and Colorado, USA, and to snow albedo derived from airborne hyperspectral imagery over several basins in California and Colorado. The MODIS-derived products we consider are NASA standard products MOD10A1, MCD43A3, and MCD19A3D, along with STC-MODSCAG/MODDRFS and MODIS SPIReS. These products vary in their retrieval algorithms, including whether, for mixed pixels, they represent the albedo of snow within the pixel or the albedo of the whole pixel. When compared to in situ data, STC-MODSCAG/MODDRFS and SPIReS products have the highest accuracy (RMSE ≤0.093) and most spatially and temporally complete data records (∼99 %) because the algorithms each have independently developed gap filling and interpolation methods. The MOD10A1 and MCD43A3 products underestimate snow albedo (RMSE ≤0.248) because they incorporate non-snow land surfaces into their calculations and have less complete data records (∼76 %) due to less accurate snow detection and lack of interpolation. The MCD19A3D product has accuracy similar to STC-MODSCAG/MODDRFS and SPIReS (RMSE = 0.090) but the lowest data completeness of all datasets (56 %). We found similar performance trends when comparing the MODIS products to airborne hyperspectral data. Our analysis shows algorithms that account for fractional snow cover and incorporate all available spectral information result in the best snow albedo products across time and space. Similar algorithms applied to hyperspectral data can better resolve spectral features to retrieve optical properties of snow; hence we can expect improvements in snow albedo retrievals from future hyperspectral satellite missions."

 Style transfer has emerged as a prominent technique for transferring stylistic elements between images (e.g., a reference image and a map). However, current methods face two challenges when applied to create image maps, especially when the reference image and map are not spatially aligned (e.g., covering different regions). These challenges include aligning the semantic elements between maps and remote sensing images, and then balancing the photorealistic textures with cartographic symbolism to maintain cartographic quality. To address these challenges, we propose a flexible style transfer method from remote sensing images to maps, relaxing the requirement of strict spatial alignment between remote sensing images and maps. Our approach enables the generation of image maps with adjustable stylistic results, offering a balance between photorealism and symbolization. First, we analyze the semantic of the input map and the reference imagery including semantic classes and semantic relationships encoded by colors. Then we implement hierarchical control and parameter interpolation to enable style matching. We also compare the transfer results of our method to those of the baseline image style transfer methods across four aspects including visual similarity, graphic discriminability, semantic consistency, and overall readability. The evaluations show that our approach significantly enhances cartographic quality by flexibly balancing photorealism and symbolization, while offering the flexibility to generate image maps with varying preferences."

 Unsaturated alcohols with two functional groups (C=C and OH), such as prenol, are gaining attention as potential second-generation biofuels. As demand for sustainable energy sources grows, increased use of prenol in biofuel applications could lead to additional atmospheric emissions contributing to secondary pollution and affecting air quality. As the OH radical is the major oxidant during daytime and is highly reactive toward organic compounds, the OH-initiated oxidation of prenol needs to be investigated. Therefore, the reaction of prenol with OH was studied in the atmospheric simulation chamber THALAMOS (THermally Regulated Atmospheric Simulation Chamber), under atmospheric pressure and in the temperature range 273–353 K. The temperature-dependent rate coefficient, measured by the relative method, follows the Arrhenius equation: kprenol+OH(273−353K)=(1.43±0.28)×10−11×exp(691±59T) cm3 molecule−1 s−1. Our results were combined with literature data determined under combustion relevant temperatures, to provide the following expression: kprenol+OH(273−1290K)=1.46×10−10 ×(T300)−2.18 + 1.14 ×10−10 ×exp(−2961T) cm3 molecule−1 s−1 which covers a wide range of temperatures under atmospheric, but also cold (273–353 K) and traditional combustion conditions (900–1290 K). In addition to kinetic measurements, the reaction mechanism was investigated through product analysis. The major oxidation products, formed predominantly via the OH addition pathway, were acetone with a yield of 97 %, glycolaldehyde, and formaldehyde, with minor traces of 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanal. The H-atom abstraction was found to be less significant (<3 %), leading primarily to the formation of prenal. These findings were further supported by structure–activity relationship(SAR) calculations, which estimated the rate coefficient at room temperature and confirmed that the reaction proceeds mainly (∼97 %) via OH addition to the C=C double bond of prenol. To our knowledge, this work is the first determination of the Arrhenius equation over the temperature range 273–353 K for the reaction between prenol and hydroxyl radical."

 Plant litter could be a potential source of atmospheric volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Previous studies are mostly restricted to forest litter, but VOC budget of wetlands resulting from litter decomposition remains largely unexplored. Here we performed in-situ VOC flux measurements in a freshwater wetland and three treatments including A (no litter addition), B (1.15 kg litter m−2) and C (2.30 kg litter m−2) were designed to investigate impacts of litter decomposition on wetland-atmosphere exchange of VOCs. During year-round observation, average fluxes of net VOCs for B and C were 5.14 ± 2.75 μg m−2 h−1 and 7.85 ± 3.80 μg m−2 h−1, respectively, significantly higher than that of A (2.13 ± 2.41 μg m−2 h−1). These results suggested that freshwater wetlands were potential sources of atmospheric VOCs and that litter decomposition could enhance VOC release. The net VOC flux exhibited distinct seasonal patterns and was correlated with ambient temperature (p < 0.05). Moreover, the release or uptake of VOCs varied among different chemical groups. Specifically, non-methane hydrocarbons including alkanes, alkenes and aromatics showed positive net fluxes that increased with added litter. Halocarbons exhibited a negative net flux in A, but positive net fluxes in B and C. Oxygenated VOCs demonstrated negative net fluxes in both A and B, but switched to a positive flux in C. Positive net fluxes of volatile organic sulfide compounds were observed in three treatments. Based on the flux variations of specific VOC groups, our findings suggest that both temperature-dependent biotic and abiotic processes regulated the exchange of VOCs between freshwater wetland and atmosphere."

 Exposure to carcinogenic elongated mineral particles (EMPs), such as erionite, found in rocks and released into the air by construction, quarrying, or roading activities, poses a significant possible health risk due to their respirable size and potential for airborne dispersion. The detection of EMPs in the air is typically achieved by filter sampling and subsequent examination using a range of microscopic methods, including phase contrast microscopy (PCM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Such analyzes require the manual searching for fibers through many image fields and are both labor-intensive and time-consuming. Moreover, these methods do not result in conclusive particle identification, limiting their effectiveness in large-scale monitoring programmes. This paper introduces a novel methodology for the automated detection and quantification of EMPs using an automated SEM with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to identify fibers on pre-sampled polycarbonate (PC) filters. This method provides a streamlined workflow for fiber identification based on their size, morphology, and elemental composition. Performance evaluation (PE) standards were prepared by spiking filters with a series of known concentrations of one EMP, namely erionite, and fiber concentrations were measured using the automated SEM-EDS approach. Our results demonstrate a linear relationship (R2 = 0.98∗∗∗) between the erionite mass percentage in a bulk sample and the fiber counts in an aerosolized air volume, with a detection limit of 7.4 f/cc. The approach can be optimized based on the time available for analysis and the choice of detection limit suitable for the specific site and application. Additionally, the automated SEM-EDS method has been applied to real-world air samples collected from Auckland, New Zealand, showing promising results for fiber detection in complex environmental matrices."

Cox proportional-hazard models were used to examine their associations with death outcomes.ResultsDuring a median follow-up of 11.99 years, deaths due to all-cause, all-cancer, CVD, respiratory disease were 24,264, 12,602, 4903, and 1680, respectively. Per PA-level increment was associated with lower risk of all-cause, all-cancer, CVD, and respiratory disease death, with hazard ratios of 0.86 (0.84–0.87), 0.91 (0.89–0.93), 0.86 (0.82–0.89) and 0.70 (0.66–0.75), respectively. However, an interquartile increment in air pollutant mixture was associated with higher risk of the above death outcomes. Notably, PA's effect on decreasing mortality risk remained relatively robust across all strata of air pollutant mixture. The combination of high PA and lowest air pollutant mixture reduced mortality risk by 37%, 24%, 41% and 64% from all-cause, all-cancer, CVD, and respiratory disease, respectively.ConclusionsAt all levels of air pollutant mixture, PA was inversely related with mortality risk. PA might still be an appropriate strategy to lower all-cause and cause-specific mortality risk, even for individuals exposed to high-level air pollution in the UK."

 This study investigates the advantages of employing a nested High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model for simulating highly localized heavy rainfall events over the Indian Himalayan region, characterized by a complex terrain. Accurate weather prediction in such a region necessitates a model configuration that resolves the underlying terrain features, incorporates optimal physics combinations, and assimilates the most precise atmospheric state. A nested HRRR system with 5 km and 1 km resolutions was developed, incorporating all available quality observations through an hourly assimilation cycle. Three rainfall episodes from July–August 2023 were analyzed, focusing on spatial rainfall, diurnal variations, dynamic, thermodynamic, and microphysical properties. This nested HRRR system could effectively capture the rainfall intensity and location, as it is better tuned to the realistic atmospheric conditions through frequent assimilation of observations, and thereby, the dynamics and thermodynamics are modified. However, a lead or lag of 1–2 h is observed in the diurnal rainfall variation in both domains. The quantitative model evaluation for rainfall, using various statistical skill scores, demonstrates the better performance of the 1 km domain, emphasizing the impact of higher resolution and frequent updates to initial conditions on the high-impact weather simulation accuracy. The spatial verification with the Contiguous Rain Area (CRA) analysis method reveals that pattern errors dominate over displacement errors and highlights improved spatial accuracy. Overall, the comparison between the 5 km and 1 km domains underscores the importance of high-resolution models, combined with frequent updating of initial conditions, for accurately predicting highly localized, high-impact rainfall events over the Indian Himalayan region."

They cause severe impacts to society and the environment, and the magnitude of impacts increase when they are compounded- occurring simultaneously or sequentially. Using CMIP6 projections dynamically downscaled with the Conformal Cubic Atmospheric Model to a 10 km resolution over Australia, we examine the impact of climate change on compound drought heatwave events (CDHWs). We define droughts using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), and for heatwaves use the Excess Heat Factor. In the historical period, most models capture the temperature-precipitation correlation well, however, most fail to capture the observed strengthening of this relationship over time. The models also over-estimate the number of CDHWs. In the historical period, the choice of SPEI or SPI has little impact on CDHWs, however for climate change impacts, using SPEI results in more severe impacts with less uncertainty. Under SSP370, by the end of the century, for SPEI CDHWs, there are around 3 more events/year, versus little change for SPI CDHWs. However, the duration of both events increase by around 3 days. A global warming level (GWL) analysis shows spikes in impacts when moving from 2 to 3°C, with a doubling in the number of SPEI CDHWs for Northern Australia. Moving from 3 to 4°C of warming, the length of SPEI CDHWs increases from 8 to 13 days in Northern Australia. This highlights the urgent need to reduce emissions to avoid more than 2°C of warming. A storyline analysis reveals that even in a wetter future, CDHWs will increase due to increasing temperatures and heatwaves, showing that as the climate warms, CDHWs are likely to increase despite uncertainty in precipitation projections. This research applies a novel approach to examine CDHWs using downscaled climate simulations, considering two drought metrics, GWLs and storylines, offering new insights to disentangle uncertainty in future compound extreme events."

Several reviews have explored historic associations between meteorological factors and diarrheal diseases, but none have evaluated the literature on projections of future trends. We summarize climate change-attributable projections of diarrheal diseases, appraise study methods and results, and examine evidence for adaptation strategies. We searched Web of Science and PubMed databases for terms related to diarrhea, dysentery, and projected climate change through February 2024 and included studies with future projections of climate-related diarrhea burden. We summarized range of projected percent change in future diarrheal disease relative to study baseline, stratified by economic context, pathogen, time period, and emission scenario. We assessed modeling approaches and quality of evidence for included studies. We screened 2949 records, reviewed full text for 105, and ultimately included 35. There was substantial heterogeneity in study approaches, for example types of models implemented, exposure and outcomes considered, covariates included, and adaptation or vulnerability scenarios examined. The majority of studies indicated an increase in future diarrheal diseases in the near (2020–40), mid (2040–2060) and long term (2060+) due to climate change, despite overall downward trends in diarrhea rates globally. There was substantial heterogeneity in study approaches. High baseline burdens translated to large increases, even under conservative assumptions about temperature sensitivities and emissions. Projected increases by percent change from baseline were greatest in high-income countries and low-and middle-income countries, and increased in size with increasing severity of emissions scenarios modeled. There were no studies in LICs. Viral pathogen estimates tended to decrease in a warming climate while bacterial pathogens estimates tended to increase. Most studies included multiple emissions scenarios and accounted for future population change, but few incorporated adaptation strategies or changes in underlying population vulnerability. When stratified, studies that considered future adaptation and vulnerability estimated higher projections of future burden compared to studies that did not. Climate change has the potential to increase diarrhea burden, absent adaptation. Diarrhea is heavily dependent on the underlying development context, so explicit inclusion of assumptions on future development factors, including population exposure, vulnerability, and adaptation, is essential for projections of climate-related diarrhea burden. Scenarios such as the shared socioeconomic pathways can help align projections by standardizing modeling approaches and offering future population and economic storylines to be paired with emissions scenarios."

Meanwhile, it is a key driver of local and regional climate due to its influence on energy and water exchange between land surface and atmosphere. Despite the irrigation-induced evaporative cooling on temperature alone, how irrigation affects summer heat stress—a combination of temperature and humidity can become a concern to public health—is not well understood. This study examines the potential impacts of irrigation practices on summer temperature and heat extremes in the Great Plains using a set of sensitivity experiments conducted with the Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF) model for 10 growing seasons. Results show that intensive irrigation lowers the ambient temperature, but the increased humidity from enhanced evapotranspiration, especially during the extreme hot and dry summers, can possibly elevate the risks of heat stress in the heavily irrigated area and its surroundings. The response of humid heat extremes to irrigation depends on the heat metrics used in the assessment. For variables like wet-bulb temperature, wet-bulb globe temperature, and equivalent temperature, irrigation leads to significantly intensified humid heat extremes by up to 5 °C and increased heatwave frequency by 3 events year−1. In contrast, metrics like the heat index and environmental stress index suggest that irrigation mitigates heat intensity by decreasing the temperature metrics by up to 1 °C. Given the importance of irrigation in Great Plains agriculture in a changing climate, these uncertainties underscore the urgent need to connect heat metrics with health outcomes to better address heat mitigation in rural communities."

When flood events occur in close succession, they pose significant challenges for emergency management due to limited recovery time between events. This study focuses on multi-peak (MP) floods, where peaks occur within hours to days. Using discharge data from 77 hydrometric stations in Northern Italy’s Po district, we examined statistical differences between MP and single-peak (SP) flood events and analyzed their seasonal patterns and generating mechanisms across diverse river regimes. We demonstrated that SP and MP events exhibit distinct statistical behaviors. The first type of events has more skewed distributions with heavy tails, while the second displays flatter distributions with lighter tails and higher mean values. Seasonal analyses suggest that MP floods in glacial and nival-pluvial regimes are influenced by glacier and snow melting, whereas those in the Padanian regime are driven by tributary routing effects. These triggering mechanisms seem to be responsible of the lighter tails of the distribution of MP floods. By highlighting the distinct statistical behaviors and generating mechanisms of MP and SP floods, we identified recommendations for designing MP flood hydrograph, supporting flood-risk management."

However, the impact of changing snow dynamics on drought propagation time (tP) has rarely been assessed. Utilizing observed streamflow and reanalyzed climate data from ∼900 northern snow-affected catchments, here we provide a comprehensive investigation on temporal changes in tP and underlying mechanisms in the context of diminishing snow. Results show that catchments with a higher fraction of precipitation falling as snow (fs) exhibit a longer tP compared to catchments with marginal snowfall. Over the past 70 years, tP has significantly decreased following decreased fs, indicating accelerated drought propagation in a snow-diminishing world. Specifically, for catchments with lower mean annual fs ( ⩽ 30%), tP is decreasing at a rate of −0.8 d per decade. In contrast, for catchments with higher ( > 50%), tP is decreasing at a rate of −3.4 d per decade, four times faster than the rate observed in low- catchments. This acceleration is attributed to a reduced total snowmelt and slower snowmelt rate during the drought propagation process, which decreases streamflow recharge from snowmelt and increases evaporation losses. These findings are important for enhancing drought prediction and risk management in snow-affected regions."

Separating targets for emission reduction and CDR has emerged as a key policy proposal to address this risk, limiting the fungibility of emission reduction and CDR, and enabling critical assessment of the credibility and ambition of mitigation plans. However, stakeholder preferences and rationales as well as factors shaping political decisions on target separation have not been systematically analyzed to date. Here, we investigate the politics of the EU’s 2040 climate target design as a key conflict over how to deal with mitigation deterrence risks in climate policy-making through target separation. Drawing on data from the EU consultation process, document analysis, expert interviews and relevant online events, we find that a majority of stakeholders, including business actors, prefer separate targets over a net target, albeit based on different rationales. We also provide evidence on the political factors that led the European Commission to opt against target separation in its 2040 climate target communication. Our analysis suggests that the Commission perceived separate targets as too complex, inflexible, and potentially costly, particularly in light of a growing backlash to climate policy, concerns over growth and competitiveness, and pressures for legislative simplification and deregulation.

The enhanced Arctic sea-ice melt increases the mid-latitude waviness and intensifies the circumglobal teleconnection-like pattern and strengthens the subtropical high over East Asia. This, together with a La-Nina like response in the Pacific enhances mean summer monsoon precipitation over South Asia. Additionally, the enhanced energy in the tropics and the anomalous mid-latitude intrusions due to the Arctic sea-ice melt provide a conducive environment for moisture convergence and intense summer monsoon precipitation events over South Asia.

Validated against high-resolution NTL datasets and ground-truth records, HDNTL enables precise monitoring of nighttime human activities. 
 Nighttime light (NTL) data at daily scales presents an innovative foundation for monitoring human activities, offering vast potential across various research domains such as urban planning and management, disaster monitoring, and energy consumption. The VNP46A2 dataset, sourced from NPP/VIIRS, has been providing globally corrected daily NTL data since 2012. However, persistent challenges, such as fluctuations in daily NTL series due to spatial mismatch and angular effects, as well as missing data holes, have significantly impacted the accuracy and comprehensiveness of extracting daily NTL changes. To address these challenges, a dataset production framework focusing on error correction, interpolation, and validation was developed. This framework led to the creation of a high-quality daily NTL dataset from 2012 to 2024, named HDNTL, which specifically targets 653 cities with populations predictably exceeding one million in 2025. A comparative analysis with the VNP46A2 dataset revealed promising results in spatial mismatch correction for two sample areas – the airport and flyover (angular effect can be ignored). These areas exhibited reduced fluctuations in HDNTL time series and maintained or strengthened weekly periodicity, which reflects traffic flow dynamics. Furthermore, the correction of angular effects across various urban building landscapes demonstrated sound improvements, mitigating angular effects in different directions and reducing periodicity from the angular impacts. The spatiotemporal interpolation of missing data holes has high similarity with the reference data, as indicated by an R2 of 0.98, and it increased the valid pixels of all cities by 15.12%. The HDNTL dataset exhibited enhanced consistency with high-resolution SDGSAT-1 data regarding the NTL change rate and alignment with ground truth data of power outages, showcasing superior performance in short-event detection. Overall, the HDNTL dataset effectively mitigates instability in daily series caused by spatial mismatch and angular effects observed in VNP46A2, improving data comparability across time and space dimensions. This dataset enhances the ability of the NTL to reflect the ground events, providing a more accurate reference for daily-scale nighttime light research. Additionally, the dataset production framework facilitates easy updates from future VNP46A2 products to HDNTL.

However, the roles of functional microbial types, OM molecular characteristics, and microbe-OM interactions in iodine mobilization remain unclear. In this study, groundwater samples with different iodine concentrations were collected from the central Yangtze River basins, China. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we identified sulfur disproportionation and methanogenesis as dominant metabolic processes in relatively low-I (<300 μg/L) and high-I (>300 μg/L) groundwater, respectively. Sediment incubation experiments showed that combined sulfur disproportionation and methanogenesis can promote iodine release by 87.1%. Ultrahigh-resolution molecular characterization of the organic components revealed that sulfur-disproportionating microbes may selectively metabolize bioactive OM (e.g., aliphatic compounds and oxygen-poor highly unsaturated compounds), leaving recalcitrant OM (e.g., N-containing oxygen-rich highly unsaturated compounds, polyphenols, and polycyclic aromatic compounds) in groundwater, and methanogenic microbes preferentially consume bioactive OM in low-I groundwater and recalcitrant OM in high-I groundwater. Thus, a cooperative-competitive pattern between methanogens and sulfur disproportionating microorganisms may influence OM degradation and potentially contribute to iodine mobilization. This study highlights that the OM transformation process, driven by biological sulfur disproportionation and methanogenesis, promotes iodine enrichment in alluvial-lacustrine groundwater and improves our understanding of the genesis of geogenic high-iodine groundwater systems."

Across space (16 lakes: 1 year) and time (6 years: 1 lake), anoxia decreased selenium and was associated with elevated fish mercury, with no effect on omega-3 content. Because selenium may mitigate some end points of mercury toxicity, highly variable Se:Hg molar ratios (0.70–35.79) in neighboring lakes may have health risk implications. For fish consumers, ongoing lake deoxygenation under climate change could potentially reduce selenium intake while enhancing mercury exposure.

Phytoremediation, in which metals in contaminated soil are accumulated by plants for remediation, is energy- and cost-intensive, as the recovered plants are typically burned with the aim of concentrating the metals. In this study, we propose a Li recovery method that entails harvesting the salts excreted by Li-tolerant halophytes. Acids exuded from the roots of halophytic Rhodes grass can leach Li+ ions from soil-borne Li ore, thereby facilitating Li absorption via the roots and subsequent excretion through leaf salt glands. Li concentrations in the salts excreted by Rhodes grass grown in soil containing Li ore (amblygonite) at 200 mg Li kg–1 were 110-fold higher than those in the soil. Efficient recovery of Li from Li-containing soil as excreted salts thus reduces soil contamination and ultimately contributes to a sustainable Li cycle with low environmental impact."

Similarly to the water–air transfer process, such as sea spray, aerosols generated during the wastewater treatment process, driven by aeration and mechanical agitation, are an overlooked potential source of airborne microplastics. This study constitutes the first attempt to investigate the pollution characteristics of microplastics in aerosols generated during wastewater treatment, based on laser direct infrared spectroscopy (LDIR) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). Microplastics were ubiquitously observed in aerosols from each unit of the wastewater treatment plant, with abundances in the range of 0.83–28.03 items·m–3. A total of 30 different polymer types were identified by LDIR, while polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene terephthalate were the most common polymers. Film and fragment were the main shapes, with a predominant size range of 20–50 μm. The aerosolization degree of microplastics is affected by the aeration intensities and hydrodynamic conditions maintained in each unit, but also varied depending on their inherent characteristics. These findings suggest that the aerosolization of microplastics from wastewater treatment is a potential source of airborne microplastics.

Aerobic methanotrophs, which serve as biological methane sinks, play a key role in methane cycling, but their responses to Cd stress remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the relationship between Cd pollution levels and aerobic methane oxidation potential in paddy soils. We evaluated methanotrophic enrichments under Cd exposure, applied metagenomic sequencing to identify functional microbes, and investigated Cd tolerance mechanisms in pure culture. Aerobic methane oxidation rates were positively correlated with Cd levels in paddy soils from South China, with Methylocystis and Methylomonas emerging as dominant genera possessing diverse Cd tolerance genes. Notably, interspecific differences in Cd tolerance were observed among methanotrophic strains. The faster-growing Methylomonas sp., endowed with more robust antioxidant defenses and extracellular polymeric substances synthesis genes, exhibited Cd resistance through markedly enhanced loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances production, in contrast to the Cd-sensitive Methylobacter sp. Gene knockout experiments confirmed the essential roles of glutathione synthase, glutathione peroxidase, and exosortase in exopolysaccharide extrusion for Cd detoxification.

Determining how to control both greenhouse gas emissions and water quality decline is a long-term challenge. We compiled data on the annual average carbon dioxide (CO2) flux and water quality parameters for 422 global lakes, revealing that 82.42% of the lakes act as carbon sources and that 66.56% have experienced water quality deterioration. Carbon sources and eutrophication trends were observed for lakes from the 1990s to 2020s, with further deterioration expected over the next 80 years. Unmanaged land use change in lake watersheds could exacerbate the CO2 flux into lakes and water quality degradation. In this study, a watershed land use planning (WLUP) framework was established, and a 24.83% reduction in the CO2 flux into lake water, a 5.07% reduction in chlorophyll a (Chl-a), a 4.70% reduction in total phosphorus, and a 12.92% increase in Secchi depth were achieved. The WLUP framework identifies Asia and Europe as the regions experiencing the greatest demands for land use transformation, where optimization leads to the most significant improvements. Metagenomic analysis revealed that forests enhance carbon fixation and that grasslands reduce carbon degradation and phosphorus metabolism in lake watersheds, explaining and supporting the possibility of WLUP.

Understanding the complex interactive effect of these factors on GDM is essential. In a cohort of 852 pregnant women, we assessed pesticide levels in serum and analyzed the gut microbiota using 16S rRNA and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We explored the interactions between pesticides and gut microbiota, assessed their roles in GDM development, and proposed a predictive model based on identified biomarkers. We identified an environmental risk score (ERS), denoting the pesticide mixture level significantly associated with GDM, with the gut microbiota, particularly involving the Dorea branch, playing a crucial mediating role. In addition, we found an interactive effect of pesticide exposure and gut microbiota on GDM risk. Notably, low Prevotella enrichment combined with high ERS arisen from pesticide levels led to a 10.36-fold increased GDM risk. The identified pesticide and gut microbial biomarkers achieved high predictive accuracy for GDM (AUC: 0.833, 95% CI: 0.748–0.918).

This study demonstrated that cadmium ion (Cd(II)) mediation accelerated the photoaging of polystyrene NPs (carboxyl-modified CNPs, amino-modified ANPs, sulfonate, and amino comodified SANPs) by generating more •OH and 1O2, thereby altering their physicochemical properties and consequent transport behavior. Kinetic attachment models and Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek theory proved that the Cd(II)-mediated photoaging process had diverse effects on the transport and retention of surface-functionalized NPs in water-saturated sand media. In particular, Cd(II) mediation at 50 mg/L increased the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on aged CNPs, facilitating their transport by 20.3% with reduced k2 (0.036 vs 0.021) and increased φmax (74.804 KBT vs 85.127 KBT) values. Conversely, enhanced aged ANP agglomerates driven by amino-carboxyl electrostatic attraction had ripening adsorption on additional heterogeneous surfaces of sand. The presence of reinforced fragments of aged ANPs deposited on sand led to remarkable detachment. Aged SANPs retained their original mobility after Cd(II) mediation due to negligible changes in surface groups, whereas their retention associated with a higher k1d (0.347 vs 0.183) became more reversible to be flushed out by water.

Because prolonged use of pharmaceutical glucocorticoids in humans has been linked to osteoporosis and impaired bone growth, we hypothesized that the ability of teleost fish to regenerate fins following damage may be inhibited by exposure to synthetic glucocorticoids in the environment. In the present study, we examined fin regeneration following a 7 days waterborne exposure of juvenile fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) to the synthetic glucocorticoids, fluticasone propionate and dexamethasone. Expression of several biologically relevant gene products (sgk1, tdgf1, runx2a, lef1, shha, and tsc22d3) was measured in paired caudal fin and whole-body tissues. Fluticasone propionate and dexamethasone significantly impaired fin regeneration at measured water concentrations of 2.62 μg/L and 4.62 mg/L, respectively. Changes in gene expression indicated disruption of intercellular communication in the Wnt/β-catenin and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways after exposure to 4.86 μg/L fluticasone propionate. Upregulation of tsc22d3, a transcription factor responsible for suppression of anti-inflammatory response, may be the plausible cause of repressed cellular signaling. These findings advance the development of adverse outcome pathway 334─Glucocorticoid Receptor Activation Leads to Impaired Fin Regeneration─and elucidate both the mechanistic relationship between activation of the glucocorticoid receptor by fluticasone propionate and inhibition of fin regeneration, which could plausibly reduce individual fitness in aquatic systems."

This study explores these processes within semi‐confined aquifers using laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. The results reveal, for the first time, that contaminants from semi‐confined aquifers mix within the interiors of overlying saltwater wedges in unconfined aquifers. As aquitard permeability decreases, contaminant composition mixed within overlying wedges changes from saltwater‐density to freshwater‐density counterparts. Two primary retention mechanisms are identified for deep‐layer contaminants: One involves entrapment within aquitards, facilitating the mixing of contaminants into overlying wedges; the other arises from gravity‐induced mixing between saltwater‐density plumes and saltwater wedges. Interestingly, the residence times of freshwater‐density and saltwater‐density contaminants increase initially and then decline with reduced aquitard permeability.

Previous studies have proposed using outputs from sea‐ice growth model to estimate microwave emissivities and emission temperatures for DA. However, this approach poses practical challenges, as it operates independently of numerical weather prediction systems. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces an artificial neural network (ANN) technique that transforms the modeling approach into an algorithm capable of directly retrieving radiative boundary conditions from satellite observations. The ANN leverages empirical knowledge that sea‐ice emissivity is closely related to ice type and that microwave penetration depth varies with frequency, capturing temperature profiles within sea ice. It targets winter Arctic Ocean, using brightness temperatures (TBs) from ATMS channels 1 to 3 (23, 36, and 51 GHz) as inputs to retrieve emissivity and emission temperature for surface‐sensitive channels 6 and 7 (53 and 54 GHz). The ANN algorithm was trained and validated using simulated data sets, demonstrating high accuracy with correlation coefficients of 0.99 and low errors. Further evaluation using ATMS observations from the winters of 2021 and 2022 was conducted by converting the retrievals into top‐of‐atmosphere TBs, yielding consistent error statistics: correlation coefficients of 0.99, mean deviations of about −0.3 K, and standard deviations of about 0.3 K for both channels.

The role of mixed Rossby‐Gravity (MRG) waves in modulating the east Pacific Hadley circulation (EPHC) strength is explored during boreal summer season using ERA5 reanalysis data. Composite analysis of MRG activity for five strong and five weak EPHC seasons identified based on a mass stream function based metric reveal that strong EPHC seasons are associated with pronounced MRG activity, whereas the MRG activity is weak during weak EPHC seasons. Although the sea surface temperature (SST) background state over EP is not favorable for thermally driven deep convection, low‐level convergence induced by synoptic scale disturbances such as the MRG waves can trigger deep convection over the region, and in turn influence the EPHC strength. The question of whether boundary forced convergence can have an impact on the EPHC strength is further investigated using an atmospheric mixed layer model. Surface convergence driven by meridional SST gradients are not found to be significantly different during strong and weak EPHC seasons, implying the dominant role of MRG in modulating the strength of EPHC. The study also reveals a new possible mechanism via which the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences the strength of EPHC—ENSO induced changes in the mean background state modulates the spatio‐temporal characteristics of MRG waves which in turn affect the low‐level convergence over the region and impacts the strength of EPHC."

Few studies try to model these co‐benefits at a regional scale and even fewer consider health inequalities in their analyses. We analyze the health impacts across Western and Central Europe from exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5 ${\text{PM}}_{2.5}$) and surface level ozone (O3 ${\mathrm{O}}_{3}$) in 2014 and in 2050 using three scenarios with different levels of climate change mitigation, using a high‐resolution atmospheric chemistry model to simulate future air quality. We use recent health functions to estimate mortality related to the aforementioned pollutants. We also analyze the relationship between air quality mortality rate per 100,000 people and Human Development Index to establish if reductions in air quality mortality are achieved equitably. We find that air quality‐related mortality (PM2.5 ${\text{PM}}_{2.5}$ + O3 ${\mathrm{O}}_{3}$ mortality) will only reduce in the future following a high‐mitigation scenario (54%). It could increase by 7.5% following a medium‐mitigation scenario and by 8.3% following a weak mitigation scenario. The differences are driven by larger reductions in PM2.5 ${\text{PM}}_{2.5}$‐related mortality and a small reduction in O3 ${\mathrm{O}}_{3}$‐related mortality following the high‐mitigation scenario, whereas for the other scenarios, smaller improvements in PM2.5 ${\text{PM}}_{2.5}$‐related mortality are masked by worsening O3 ${\mathrm{O}}_{3}$‐related mortality. We find that less developed regions of European countries have higher mortality rates from PM2.5 ${\text{PM}}_{2.5}$ and O3 ${\mathrm{O}}_{3}$ exposure in the present day, but that this inequity is reduced following greater climate change mitigation."

 Soils can be either a source or sink of atmospheric CO2 depending on how soil organic carbon (SOC) responds to climate warming and changes in plant productivity. Whereas warming typically accelerates SOC decomposition, the effect of plant productivity changes remains unclear. Here we use a space-for-change substitution approach to analyse a global dataset of SOC measurements down to 1 metre. We find that warming-induced SOC reduction in the 0–0.3-m topsoil is gradually offset by increasing plant productivity but exacerbated in the 0.3–1-m subsoil until plant productivity increase crosses a threshold of 30%. Consequently, entirely offsetting warming-induced SOC reduction in the top metre of soil requires an unrealistically high increase in plant productivity, albeit with substantial variance across ecosystems. Soil carbon-to-nitrogen ratio is the dominant predictor of the variance in SOC response, as this ratio determines whether nitrogen released during carbon loss meets the requirement for additional plant growth or whether additional nitrogen must be mined from soil organic matter. Such mining accelerates SOC losses, particularly in the subsoil, where the soil carbon-to-nitrogen ratio is lower than in topsoils. We conclude that globally, increased plant productivity may exacerbate SOC losses under climate warming, particularly in the subsoil. Soils may release more CO2 under warming when increases in plant productivity mine nitrogen from soil organic matter, according to an analysis of a global dataset of soil organic carbon measurements."

Here, the authors suggest that adaptations endotherms needed to return to marine life are associated with longer reproductive lifespans and delayed development, favouring a slow-paced life strategy. 
 All organisms face a certain risk of dying before reproducing, putting strong pressure on individuals to reproduce as early as possible. Despite this, some organisms delay maturity, defer reproduction, and age slowly. The evolution of such slow-paced life is classically attributed to allometric effects and reduced extrinsic mortality, but might also result from the invasion of challenging environments requiring adaptations that boost adult survival yet impose substantial energetic and developmental costs. Here, we reveal that the invasion of marine environments by endotherms may have triggered adaptive shifts towards slow life histories, particularly in pelagic lineages. Such life history convergences may have been facilitated by the slow-paced nature of their non-marine ancestors, and were associated with adaptations for enhanced energy acquisition and storage, enabling a long reproductive lifespan at the expense of extended development. Ancestral traits and lifestyle changes might thus have been important in shaping the evolution of slow life histories. The evolution of a slow life history may be due to reduced extrinsic mortality and allometric effects. Here, the authors suggest that adaptations endotherms needed to return to marine life are associated with longer reproductive lifespans and delayed development, favouring a slow-paced life strategy."

 Lipid degradation is generally considered an antagonistic pathway to lipid synthesis, so this pathway is often removed to improve lipid production. In this study, triacylglycerol (TAG) cycling formed by lipid degradation is found to be crucial for long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) biosynthesis; this result contradicts the notion that lipid degradation is a useless process. Specifically, we demonstrate that TAG cycling promoting PUFA biosynthesis occurred in Yarrowia lipolytica and Mortierella alpina via the desaturase/elongase pathway but not in Schizochytrium sp. with the polyketide synthase (PKS) pathway. Exploiting the TAG cycling mechanism, a strategy of decoupling the TAG biosynthesis and degradation is developed. Using this strategy, the titers of C20:5, C22:5 and prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) in Y. lipolytica are improved by 116.2%, 99.4% and 41.7%, respectively. Our findings highlight the potential of the TAG cycling for related biochemical synthesis in the construction of excellent oleaginous engineered strains.

 Guided bone regeneration (GBR) is a standard therapy for treating bone defects, with collagen-based barrier membranes widely used clinically. However, these membranes face challenges like poor mechanical properties, early bacterial invasion and immunomodulation deficiency, potentially risking GBR failure. Orchestrating macrophage activation and controlling their M1 or M2 polarization are effective strategies for bone repair. Here, we present a Janus collagen-based barrier membrane with immunomodulation. The porous layer promotes direct osteogenic differentiation and inward growth of osteoblasts. The dense layer prevents invasion of soft tissue into bone defects and protects bone defects from bacterial infection. The membrane also enhances rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell infiltration, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation by regulating the immune microenvironment, demonstrating superior bone regeneration compared to the commercial Bio-Gide® membrane. Overall, the Janus collagen-based membrane reduces tissue inflammation and fosters an osteoimmune environment conducive to new bone formation, offering effective material design for advanced GBR technology.

The authors here unveil the selective stepwise transition, achieve ideal antiferroelectricity with large digital electrostrain in PbZrO3 epitaxial thin films. 
 Antiferroelectrics exhibit reversible antipolar-polar phase transitions under electric fields, yielding large electrostrain suitable for electromechanical devices. Nevertheless, in thin-film form, the antiferroelectric behavior is often obscured by competing ferroic orders, resulting in slanted hysteresis loops with undesired remnant polarization, subsequently posing challenges in obtaining ideal antiferroelectricity and understanding their intrinsic electrical behavior. Here, atomistic models for controllable antiferroelectric-ferroelectric phase transition pathways are unveiled along specific crystallographic directions. Guided by the anisotropic phase transition and orientation design, we achieved ideal antiferroelectricity with square double hysteresis loop, large saturated polarization (~60 μC/cm2), near-zero remnant polarization, fast response time (~75 ns), and near-fatigue-free performance (~1010 cycles) in (111)P-oriented PbZrO3 epitaxial thin films. Moreover, a bipolar and frequency-independent digital electrostrain (~0.83%) was demonstrated in this architype antiferroelectric system. In-situ X-ray diffraction studies further reveal that the large digital electrostrain results from an intrinsic field-induced antiferroelectric-ferroelectric structural transition. This work demonstrates the anisotropic phase transition mechanism and ideal antiferroelectricity with large digital electrostrain in antiferroelectric thin films, offering a new avenue for applications of antiferroelectricity in nanoelectromechanical systems.

 K+ homeostasis is crucial for bacterial survival. The bacterial K+ channel KtrAB is regulated by the binding of ADP and ATP to the cytosolic RCK subunits KtrA. While the ligand-induced conformational changes in KtrA are well described, the transmission to the gating regions within KtrB is not understood. Here, we present a cryo-EM structure of the ADP-bound, inactive KtrAB complex from Vibrio alginolyticus, which resolves part of KtrB’s N termini. They are short intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) located at the interface of KtrA and KtrB. We reveal that these IDRs play a decisive role in ATP-mediated channel opening, while the closed ADP-bound state does not depend on the N-termini. We propose an allosteric mechanism, in which ATP-induced conformational changes within KtrA trigger an interaction of KtrB’s N-terminal IDRs with the membrane, stabilizing the active and conductive state of KtrAB.

 Directed evolution is a process of mutation and artificial selection to breed biomolecules with new or improved activity. Directed evolution platforms are primarily prokaryotic or yeast-based, and stable mammalian systems have been challenging to establish and apply. To this end, we develop PROTein Evolution Using Selection (PROTEUS), a platform that uses chimeric virus-like vesicles to enable extended mammalian directed evolution campaigns without loss of system integrity. This platform is stable and can generate sufficient diversity for directed evolution in mammalian systems. Using PROTEUS, we alter the doxycycline responsiveness of tetracycline-controlled transactivators, generating a more sensitive TetON-4G tool for gene regulation with mammalian-specific adaptations. PROTEUS is also compatible with intracellular nanobody evolution, and we use it to evolve a DNA damage-responsive anti-p53 nanobody.

Here the authors show that the posterior parietal cortex can represent these associations and generate mismatch responses to deviations in these sequences. 
 An important function of the neocortex is to compare sensory feedback stimuli with internal predictions of the outside world and evoke mismatch responses to deviations, thus allowing expectations to be updated. The mechanisms behind sensory feedback mismatch and prediction formation however remain unclear. Here we created a learned association of an auditory-tactile stimulus sequence in awake head-fixed mice, where a sound predicted an up-coming whisker stimulus and introduced mismatches by omitting or altering the whisker stimulus intensity. We showed that layer 2/3 posterior parietal cortex (PPC) neurons could report stimulus sequence mismatches, as well as display neural correlates of expectation. Inhibition of PPC-projecting secondary motor cortex (M2) neurons suppressed these correlates, along with population mismatch responses. Hence, M2 can influence sensory processing in the PPC and potentially contribute to the prediction of sensory feedback from learned relationships within sequences of sensory stimuli. How learned associations of sensory sequences can influence subsequent processing remains unclear.

Here, the authors report on endosomolytic chloroquine-like lipid nanoparticles for mRNA delivery and genome editing by integrating the chloroquine scaffold into ionizable lipids, demonstrating improved transfection in vivo. 
 Despite remarkable progress in designing RNA delivery systems, endosomal escape remains a recognized challenge for efficient RNA delivery. In this study, we develop a robust mRNA delivery platform termed endosomolytic chloroquine-like optimized lipid nanoparticles (ecoLNPs) for versatile mRNA delivery in vitro and in vivo via integrating the signature scaffold extracted from endosomolytic chloroquine into ionizable lipids. RNase-resistant ecoLNPs are capable of delivering a broad variety of mRNA payloads to diverse cell types, even hard-to-transfect 3D cells, with an efficiency of up to 18.9-fold higher than that of commercial transfection reagents. The pH-responsive endosomolytic activity of ecoLNPs can be largely attributed to the proton sponge effect and saposin B-promoted membrane disruption. In vivo, ecoLNPs enable potent local and systemic mRNA delivery and exhibit comparable potency to the clinically approved mRNA vaccine carrier, but strong tropism for lymph nodes following intramuscular injection.

Here researchers examine how affluent groups disproportionately contribute to the increase in mean temperature and the frequency of extreme events. 
 Climate injustice persists as those least responsible often bear the greatest impacts, both between and within countries. Here we show how GHG emissions from consumption and investments attributable to the wealthiest population groups have disproportionately influenced present-day climate change. We link emissions inequality over the period 1990–2020 to regional climate extremes using an emulator-based framework. We find that two-thirds (one-fifth) of warming is attributable to the wealthiest 10% (1%), meaning that individual contributions are 6.5 (20) times the average per capita contribution. For extreme events, the top 10% (1%) contributed 7 (26) times the average to increases in monthly 1-in-100-year heat extremes globally and 6 (17) times more to Amazon droughts. Emissions from the wealthiest 10% in the United States and China led to a two- to threefold increase in heat extremes across vulnerable regions. Quantifying the link between wealth disparities and climate impacts can assist in the discourse on climate equity and justice.

 Natural rubber, with annual production of 15 million tonnes, is the most used bio-elastomer. Improving its resistance to crack growth is highly desired, to prolong its service life for many applications and eventually improve its sustainability. Here we markedly amplify the resistance to crack growth in natural rubber by forming a tanglemer, a polymer network in which entanglements greatly outnumber crosslinks. Specifically, we cast natural rubber latex without high-intensity processing that cuts long polymers. The long polymers densely entangle by thermal motion and are then sparsely crosslinked. At a crack tip, long polymer strands between neighbouring crosslinks deconcentrate stress, extend strain-induced crystallization over a large region and enhance crystallinity. For example, when the ratio of crosslinks to repeat units reduces from 10−2 to 10−3, the network amplifies fatigue threshold from ~50 J m−2 to ~200 J m−2, and toughness from ~104 J m−2 to over 105 J m−2. Overall, this work provides a viable strategy to improve the practical applicability of natural rubber, contributing to the development of sustainable polymers.

 From 2021 to 2023, satellite records reveal that February Antarctic sea ice extent reached record lows in 2022 and 2023. Simultaneously, the Antarctic ice sheet experienced a transient mass gain and rebounded temporarily from a decadal decline since 2002. The reasons behind these dramatic changes are unknown. Here, we show that the triple-dip La Niña event during 2021–2023 (referred to as TD_LN2023) played a major role in these changes. Compared to a previous triple-dip La Niña event (1999–2001), the tropical-Antarctic teleconnections during TD_LN2023 were stronger. A more pronounced southward shift of the Ferrel Cell was identified as a key driver for the enhanced tropical-Antarctic teleconnections during TD_LN2023 against the background of intensified westerly winds and tropical expansion. The poleward increase, which facilitated poleward atmospheric heat and moisture transport, contributed to the sea ice extent decline and the ice sheet mass growth. Additionally, this southward shift strengthened the Rossby wave train, which, sustained by enhanced stratosphere-troposphere coupling, amplified the Pacific-South American pattern, and further promoted regional sea ice decline. Finally, this southward shift, associated with the southward shift of the westerly jet, enhanced Ekman suction, bringing subsurface warm water to the surface and contributing to pan-Antarctic low sea ice. The physical processes outlined in the case study are further validated through empirical orthogonal function and regression analysis. Under global warming, multi-year La Niña events are projected to occur more frequently. The evolving tropical-Antarctic teleconnections in the context warrant close attention."

 The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the principal mode of atmospheric variability over the North Atlantic, modulating the weather and climate of neighboring regions in both winter and summer. While Earth System Models generally project a more positive NAO under 21st century high-emission scenarios, uncertainties persist as to the precise response of the NAO to increased CO2 levels, owing to large internal variability. In this study we investigate the response of the NAO to a wide range of CO2 forcings, from two to eight times the preindustrial values. Analyzing a large sample of present-generation climate models, we find that the NAO likely becomes more positive with increasing CO2 concentrations. Moreover, we find a reduction in NAO variability. This leads to a smaller increase in the likelihood of extremely positive NAO events than would be expected based solely on the shift in the mean. On the other hand, we also find a reduction in extremely negative NAO events, which is attributable to both the shift toward more positive values and the decrease in variance. Finally, our analysis reveals that the distribution of the NAO response at high CO2 forcing is negatively skewed. This fact partially offsets the decrease in extremely positive NAO events associated with reduced variability. Ultimately, our results suggest a greater increase in positive NAO events compared to the decrease in extremely negative NAO events at higher CO2 forcing."

 Accurate estimations of global land surface energy balance components [including net radiation (Rn), latent heat flux (LE), soil heat flux (G) and sensible heat flux (H)] are crucial for quantifying the exchange of heat and water between the land surface and atmosphere. In this study, a novel and practical model for Coordinated estimates of 4-day 500 m global land Surface Energy Balance components (CoSEB) was developed, using the multivariate random forest technique and a synthesis of remote sensing and reanalysis datasets, as well as the extensive observations at 336 eddy-covariance sites worldwide. The CoSEB model effectively balances the estimates of Rn, LE, H, and G by learning the physics of energy conservation embedded in these components within the training datasets. Its advantages include 1) the accurate estimation of the four energy components and their ratios [i.e. evaporation fraction, defined as LE/Rn−G, which reflects the proportion of surface available energy that is allocated to LE instead of H], and 2) the ability to maintain energy balance among the four energy components, i.e. Rn−G−LE−H=0. With the 10-fold cross-validation at 286 sites, the CoSEB model achieved the root mean square error (RMSE) of 16.42 W/m2, 16.40 W/m2, 16.49 W/m2, 4.79 W/m2 and 0.22, and the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.92, 0.86, 0.83, 0.55 and 0.59, respectively, for estimating Rn, LE, H, G and evaporative fraction, which were comparable or superior to those estimated by other typical data-driven uncoordinated and coordinated models. In the validation with test datasets at another 50 eddy-covariance sites, the CoSEB model, with the RMSE of 18.23 W/m2, 17.98 W/m2, and 19.17 W/m2, and the R2 of 0.87, 0.72, 0.71 in estimating Rn, LE, and H, respectively, outperformed all six state-of-the-art algorithms/products, i.e. FLUXCOM, BESSV2.0, MOD16A2, PML_V2, ETMonitor and GLASS. Besides, the CoSEB model successfully maintained energy balance, exhibiting an energy imbalance ratio [EIR, defined as 100%×Rn−G−LE−H/Rn] of 0, in comparison to other coordinated and uncoordinated models/products presenting the EIRs of as high as 50%. The new model also produced consistent global patterns with the six state-of-the-art products for each of the Rn, LE, and H estimates at 8-day, monthly, and yearly scales. The CoSEB model is promising for operationally generating high-accuracy global balanced land surface energy components and their ratios, which is essential for rationally partitioning surface available energy into H and LE, and for revealing the spatiotemporal variations of the energy components and their attributions and mechanisms at regional and global scales."

 Tunnel mapping systems are essential for tunnel inspection, integrating sensors like LiDAR, cameras, and odometers to enhance data accuracy. However, calibration is challenging due to mechanical constraints and repetitive sensor installations, especially for LiDAR-Camera alignment. Existing methods struggle in tunnels with poor lighting and low texture, and they fail to address irregular vibrations from the flashing light system, causing instability. We propose a robust online calibration technique for LiDAR-Camera extrinsic parameters. By establishing a reversible mapping through surface parameterization, our approach ensures accurate cross-modality alignment. Additionally, we use depth constraints to stabilize adjacent camera stations, which are typically short-edge connections and prone to instability in photogrammetric bundle adjustment. This effectively mitigates irregular vibration effects. Validation in real-world tunnels confirms persistent vibration issues despite mechanical reinforcement. Our algorithm achieves precise point cloud and image alignment, reducing back-projection errors by over 50% and significantly improving data fusion accuracy in challenging conditions."

 Reliable tropical cyclone (TC) modeling and forecasting requires appropriate selection of physical parameterization schemes. This study focusses on the poleward-moving TCs in the northern East China Sea. Numerical experiments are carried out to examine the sensitivity of modeled TC parameters to different combinations of microphysics (MP), planetary boundary layer (PBL), and cumulus convection (CC) schemes. Model performance is evaluated against observations from China Meteorological Administration best-track dataset, satellite retrieved wind fields, and land-based meteorological stations. A composite evaluation metric is introduced to enable cross-variable model assessment and quantify the relative performance of each scheme combination. Results indicate that while MP schemes have a moderate impact on TC's minimum sea level pressure and maximum wind speed, they evidently influence surface wind field reproduction. Model performance across the PBL schemes is generally comparable, except for the University of Washington boundary layer scheme, which demonstrates strong forecasting skill for maximum wind speed but introduces substantial discrepancies in TC track, minimum sea level pressure, and surface wind fields. Moreover, model performance is highly sensitive to the choice of CC scheme. The Tiedtke scheme consistently yields the highest performance score across all datasets, particularly effective in reducing wind field discrepancies. This study underscores the necessity of considering multiple TC parameters and addressing spatial discrepancies in model calibration and performance evaluation. The findings provide insights into optimizing physical scheme combinations for TC modeling in the northern East China Sea, with broader implications for improving extreme weather forecasting. However, their applicability to other regions and TC types remains uncertain. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the physical mechanisms driving scheme-related differences in model performance."

 Instead of passively receiving and transmitting air-sea interaction signals from the Pacific Ocean, the view that the Tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) significantly influences the climate of neighbouring continents is becoming increasingly accepted. Through the investigation of interannual variations in extreme wet spells (EWS) and their potential causes across three subregions of Southwest China (SWC), we have discerned the differing impacts of the Indian Ocean Basin mode (IOBM) and ENSO on the interannual variation of EWS in SWC. Specifically, 1) the positive phase of the IOBM favours anomalous diabatic cooling extending from northern India to the northeastern maritime continents, which induces anomalous anticyclonic circulation there and a negative phase of East Asia-Pacific teleconnection, resulting in more EWS in the west Sichuan Plateau; 2) the atmospheric heating anomaly over the maritime continents in the El Niño decaying summertime shows an anomalous diabatic cooling in the northeastern part and anomalous diabatic warming in the southwestern part, which corresponds to a more robust and westward extending western Pacific subtropical high and favours the occurrence of EWS in the Sichuan Basin; 3) to the interannual variation of EWS in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, it is closely related to the anomalous cyclonic circulation covering South China, which is significantly associated with the anomalous diabatic cooling over the Arabian Sea-Bay of Bengal region.

 The CMIP6 global climate models (GCMs) yield a generally large bias in air temperature simulation over China, necessitating corrections before we can rely on their future projections. In this study, we performed air temperature corrections of 26 CMIP6 GCMs using two methods—bias correction method (BC-correction) and quantile mapping (QM-correction), with the CN05.1 observational data serving as the benchmark. We conducted a comparative assessment of the simulation performance of the CMIP6 GCMs and their multi-model ensemble means (MMEs) before and after corrections, considering both temporal and spatial scales across historical and future periods under multiple shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios. The results show that the BC-correction method substantially rectifies the systematic underestimation of annual mean air temperature in CMIP6 GCMs across China, demonstrating superior performance compared to the QM approach, but with varying correction effects observed across different seasons. The MMEs show efficacy in capturing temporal-spatial variation patterns of air temperature recorded by the CN05.1 observation, however, certain discrepancies persist in specific trend magnitudes and locations. Moreover, compared to the original MME, the BC-corrected MME reveals projected enhanced future warming amplitudes across various timeframes and SSPs relative to the baseline period (1995–2014).

Moreover, on the basis of mounting evidence that the moment release during these operations is often predominantly aseismic, we derive a scaling relation for the maximum magnitude of aseismic slip events. Our theoretical predictions are consistent with observations over a broad spectrum of event sizes, from laboratory to real-world cases, indicating that fault zone storativity, background stress change, and injected fluid volume are key determinants of the maximum size and magnitude of injection-induced slow slip events."

Loss-of-function mutations inCLN1, encoding palmitoyl-protein thioesterase-1 (PPT1), cause CLN1 disease, a devastating neurodegenerative LSD that has no curative treatment. Numerous proteins in the brain require dynamic S-palmitoylation (palmitoylation-depalmitoylation) for trafficking to their destination. Although PPT1 depalmitoylates S-palmitoylated proteins and its deficiency causes CLN1 disease, the underlying pathogenic mechanism has remained elusive. We report that Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), a polytopic membrane protein mediating lysosomal cholesterol egress, requires dynamic S-palmitoylation for trafficking to the lysosome. InCln1−/−mice, Ppt1 deficiency misroutes NPC1-dysregulating lysosomal cholesterol homeostasis. Along with this defect, increased oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) promotes cholesterol-mediated activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin C1 (mTORC1), which inhibits autophagy contributing to neurodegeneration. Pharmacological inhibition of OSBP suppresses mTORC1 activation, rescues autophagy, and ameliorates neuropathology inCln1−/−mice. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized role ofCLN1/PPT1 in lysosomal cholesterol homeostasis and suggest that suppression of mTORC1 activation may be beneficial for CLN1 disease."

Emerging evidence suggests that impaired megakaryogenesis plays a critical role in the development of DPR. In this study, we report remarkable hypermethylation within CG islands of HSCs and megakaryocyte progenitor cells (MKPs) in patients with DPR. Treatment with the hypomethylating agent decitabine reduced methylated CG levels in MKPs and enhanced megakaryocyte production in mice. In addition, we found that DNMT3A negatively regulated megakaryogenesis in megakaryocyte lineages derived from primary HSCs. Transplantation with HSC-overexpressed DNMT3A impeded platelet engraftment following HSCT in mice. We further demonstrated that DNMT3A was directly bound to and methylated ETS1 and RUNX1 during megakaryogenesis. These findings highlight abnormal DNA methylation in DPR and indicate that hypomethylating agents may improve megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation by targeting DNMT3A-mediated methylation."

The Eyes absent (EYA) family of proteins, which are crucial for embryonic development, become dysregulated in cancer, where they have been shown to mediate proliferation, migration, and invasion. Our study reveals an unusual mechanism by which EYA3 reduces the presence of cytotoxic natural killer (NK) cells in the premetastatic niche (PMN) to enhance metastasis, independent of its effects on the primary tumor. We find that EYA3 up-regulates nuclear factor κB signaling to enhance CCL2 expression, which, in contrast to previous findings, suppresses cytotoxic NK cell activation in vitro and their infiltration into the PMN in vivo. These findings uncover an unexpected role for CCL2 in inhibiting NK cell responses at the PMN and suggest that targeting EYA3 could be an effective strategy to reactivate antitumor immune responses to inhibit metastasis."

However, research has predominantly focused on their quasi-static characteristics, leaving their behavior under extreme dynamic conditions, especially at length scales relevant to practical applications largely unexplored. Here, we present a strategy to achieve extreme impact mitigation at the macroscale by combining shell-based microarchitecture with an additively manufactured medium-entropy alloy (MEA) featuring low stacking fault energy (SFE). Notably, the shell-based architecture amplifies the effective dynamic stress within the metamaterial compared to truss-based morphologies, leading to the earlier activation of multiscale toughening mechanisms in the alloy. The low SFE of the MEA enables the evolution of a diverse array of defect types, thereby prolonging strain hardening behavior across seven orders of magnitude in strain rate. These fundamental insights could establish the groundwork for developing scalable, lightweight, impact-resistant metamaterials for structural and defense applications."

By leveraging full-length RNA isoform sequencing with short-read RNA sequencing of DUX4-inducible myoblasts, we elucidate an isoform-resolved transcriptome featuring numerous unannotated isoforms from known loci and novel intergenic loci. While DUX4 activates similar programs in early embryos and FSHD muscle, the isoform usage of known DUX4 targets is notably distinct between the two contexts. DUX4 also activates hundreds of previously unannotated intergenic loci dominated by repetitive elements. The transcriptional and epigenetic profiles of these loci in myogenic and embryonic contexts indicate that the usage of DUX4-binding sites at these intergenic loci is influenced by the cellular environment.

Pregnancy complications like preeclampsia are associated with altered expression of interferon-stimulated genes, including guanylate-binding protein 5 (GBP5). Here, we show that misdirected antiviral activity of GBP5 impairs processing and activation of Syncytin-1. In contrast, the proteolytic activation of Syncytin-2 is not affected by GBP5, and its fusogenic activity is only modestly reduced. Mechanistic analyses revealed that Syncytin-1 is mainly cleaved by the GBP5 target furin, whereas Syncytin-2 is also efficiently processed by the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 7 (PCSK7) and thus resistant to GBP5-mediated restriction. Mutational analyses mapped PCSK7 processing of Syncytin-2 to a leucine residue upstream of the polybasic cleavage site. In summary, we identified an innate immune mechanism that impairs the activity of a co-opted endogenous retroviral envelope protein during pregnancy and may potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of pregnancy disorders."

Here, to recapitulate a multilayer structure of the skin, we developed a hydrodynamically mediated approach to the generation of large arrays of fibroblast spheroids (a dermal core) that were engulfed with an epidermal layer of keratinocytes. These spheroids expressed biomarkers of the epidermis, epidermal-dermal junction, and dermis, and exhibited skin-like barrier properties. Screening of the synergistic effect of vitamins and peptides on protein synthesis by the spheroids and evaluation of skin toxicity with chemical agents showed a correlation with clinical results or existing standards.

BPD also increases the risk of adult emphysema, marked by alveolar loss. Despite this connection, mechanisms linking these conditions and effective treatments are still lacking. We identify hedgehog-interacting protein (HHIP), associated with both BPD and emphysema, as a critical regulator of alveologenesis. During this process,Hhip-expressing cells expanded, accompanied by hedgehog (Hh) signaling inhibition and myofibroblast transition. Stromal-specificHhipdeletion led to hyperactivation of Hh-IGF1 signaling axis, causing persistent SMA+myofibroblasts and epithelial stem/progenitor cell senescence. Hyperactivation of this pathway was also observed in human BPD and hyperoxia-induced BPD models. EarlyHhipdeficiency resulted in adult emphysema with myofibroblast accumulation. We developed a therapeutic Fc-fused HHIP protein that mitigated BPD in neonatal mice and prevented adult emphysema.

Here, we use a genome-scale dataset to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the wrasses and parrotfishes (Labridae), which rank among the most species-rich and ecologically diverse lineages of reef fishes. We show that major labrid clades experienced pulses of evolutionary innovation and accelerated diversification during the Miocene approximately 20 to 15 million years ago that the origin of no single phenotypic trait can explain.

Using deep potential molecular dynamics simulations with ab initio accuracy, we explored the dissociation dynamics of H2CO3in solution on the nanosecond timescale. While the CC conformer is the most abundant, the CT conformer is the dominant proton donor. This enhanced deprotonation ability arises from the CT conformer’s involvement in more hydrogen-bonding ring structures, enabling diverse proton transfer pathways, and its greater electronic asymmetry, which increases hydrophilicity and destabilizes the hydroxyl group. Furthermore, protons dissociated from the CT conformer demonstrate a stronger preference for the homing pathway.

Yamashita,Intrinsically weak sex chromosome drive through sequential asymmetric meiosis,"Meiotic drivers are selfish genetic elements that bias their own transmission, violating Mendel’s Law of Equal Segregation. It has long been recognized that sex chromosome–linked drivers present a paradox: Their success in transmission can severely distort populations’ sex ratio and lead to extinction. This paradox is typically solved by the presence of suppressors or fitness costs associated with the driver, limiting the propagation of the driver. Here, we show thatStellate (Ste)inDrosophila melanogasterrepresents a novel class of X chromosome–linked driver that operates with an inherent mechanism that weakens its drive strength. Ste protein asymmetrically segregates into Y-bearing cells during meiosis I, subsequently causing their death. Unexpectedly, Ste segregates asymmetrically again during meiosis II, sparing half of the Y-bearing spermatids from Ste-induced defects, thereby weakening the drive strength. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which sex chromosome drivers avoid suicidal success."

Their strong spin-orbit interaction and broken inversion symmetry lead to the spin-valley locking effect, in which carriers occupying theKandK′ valleys of the reciprocal space must have opposite spins. This effect is particularly strong for holes due to a larger spin-orbit gap in the valence band. By reducing the dimensionality of a monolayer of WSe2to 1D via electrostatic confinement, we demonstrate that spin-valley locking and strong hole-hole interactions lead to a ferromagnetic state where hole transport is spin-valley polarized, even without an applied magnetic field. A massive Dirac fermion model in the Hartree-Fock approximation reveals that many-body hole-exchange interactions lead to this polarized ground-state. This observation opens the possibility of implementing a robust and stable valley-polarized system, essential in valleytronic applications."

Plasmodesmata (PD) are plant-specific nanopore structures pivotal for cell-to-cell communication and plant survival. However, how PD form and their structure, regulation, and evolution remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the exogenous supply of abscisic acid (ABA), a well-conserved phytohormone in land plants, reduces primary PD density in the mossPhyscomitrium patens. This regulation requires all core components of the ABA signaling pathway. Furthermore, we reveal that ABA-INSENSITIVE 5, a well-conserved transcription factor in the ABA signaling pathway of land plants, plays a pivotal role in PD density regulation, whereas ABA-INSENSITIVE 3 does not. Our findings show that the ABA-induced reduction in primary PD density is mediated by these ABA-responsive factors inP. patens. Considering previous reports on ABA-dependent PD regulation in both moss and angiosperms, we propose that the ABA-mediated control of PD biogenesis and permeability represents a conserved mechanism in land plants, with critical implications for cell-to-cell communication and stress adaptation."

Nilo;Giandomenico Pace;Bernhard Pospichal;Filomena Romano,Atmospheric stability from numerical weather prediction models and microwave radiometer observations for onshore and offshore wind energy applications,"Atmospheric stability indicates whether air vertical motion is dumped or amplified. This is important for wind energy applications as it affects wind turbine wakes and thus the yield of wind parks. The paper provides an assessment of stability metrics measured by ground-based microwave radiometers in different climatological conditions and instrument types, onshore and offshore. Results indicate that special precaution may be required offshore to achieve typical onshore performances. 
 Atmospheric stability controls the evolution of wind turbine wakes and thus the yield and performance of wind parks. For estimations of wind park power output and for improving analyses of wind park wakes, crucial parameters were found to be profiles of atmospheric temperature and stability metrics. Atmospheric temperature profiles are available from numerical weather prediction (NWP) models or are measured in situ by balloon-borne sensors but can also be estimated from the ground using radiometric observations. This paper reviews the stability metrics useful for monitoring wind park performances and provides a quantitative assessment of the value of NWP model data for estimating these metrics. This paper also extends previous work, quantifying the performances of microwave radiometer (MWR) observations to estimate stability metrics from surface-based observations in three climatological conditions (marine, continental, and polar) and with different instrument types, situated either on land or in the ocean. Two NWP systems (DOWA and NEWA) have been evaluated against temperature profiles measured by offshore met masts in the 30–100 m layer from the surface. The systematic differences are ∼ 0.3–0.5 K, with no clear dependence on the stability class. Conversely, both models show larger random differences in stable compared to unstable conditions. Root-mean-square (rms) differences were within 1 K for DOWA (Dutch Offshore Wind Atlas), while they exceeded 2 K for NEWA (New European Wind Atlas) in very stable conditions. For temperature gradients in the 50–100 m vertical layer, the mean absolute error (MAE) was ∼ 3.4–4.2 K km−1, with 5.8–8.4 K km−1 rms and 0.7–0.8 correlation. From the six datasets of MWR and radiosonde observations considered here, temperature profiles mostly agree within ∼ 0.5 K near the surface, increasing to ∼ 1.5 K at 2 km. Substantial differences are found between MWR performances in retrieving temperature and potential temperature gradients (50–300 m) onshore and offshore. Onshore, potential temperature gradients agree with 2.1–3.4 K km−1 MAE and 0.7–0.9 correlation. Offshore, both MAE (0.9–1.9 K km−1) and correlation (0.3–0.4) are relatively lower, although performances tend to improve using elevation scanning retrievals. Considering all the datasets, the reported MAE values range from 0.9–3.4 K km−1 while rms values range from 1.2–5.1 K km−1. Thus, the uncertainty of MWR for temperature and potential temperature gradients in the 50–300 m vertical layer is ∼ 0.5–4.3 K km−1. The relatively lower performances offshore may be attributed to the training of the inversion method, which may under-represent the peculiar offshore conditions, and the ship movements, which can impact low-elevation observations. These considerations suggest that appropriate dedicated training and elevation scanning with ship movement compensation may be required for the MWR to better catch potential temperature gradients typical of offshore conditions."

These data enhance our understanding of glacier change variability before 2000. When combined with existing research, our dataset provides a nearly 5-decade record of mass balance, aiding hydrological simulations and assessments of mountain glacier contributions to sea-level rise. 
 The highly glacierized eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau is the key source region for seven major rivers: the Yangtze, Yellow, Lancang–Mekong, Nu–Salween, Irrawaddy, Ganges, and Brahmaputra rivers. These rivers are vital freshwater resources for more than 1 billion people downstream for their daily life, irrigation, industrial use, and hydropower. However, glaciers have been receding during recent decades and are projected to decline further, which will partly and temporarily impact water availability during drought periods, especially in headwater catchments of these larger river systems. Although few studies have investigated glacier mass changes in these river basins since the 1970s, they are site- and period-specific and limited by data availability. Hence, knowledge of glacier mass changes is especially lacking for the years prior to 2000. We therefore used digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from large-scale topographic maps based on aerial photogrammetry from the 1970s and 1980s and compared them to the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM to provide a complete picture of mass change in glaciers in the region. The mass changes are presented on individual glacier bases with a resolution of 30 m and are also aggregated into gridded format at a resolution of 0.5°. Our database consists of 13 117 glaciers with a total area of ∼ 21 695 km2. The annual mean mass loss of glaciers is −0.30 ± 0.13 mw.e. in the whole region. This is larger than the previous site-specific findings: the surface thinning increases on average from west to east along the Himalayas–Hengduan mountains, with the largest thinning in the Irrawaddy basin. Comparisons between the topographic map-based DEMs and DEMs generated based on Hexagon KH-9 metric camera data for parts in the Himalayas demonstrate that our dataset provides a robust estimation of glacier mass changes. However, the uncertainty is high at high altitudes due to the saturation of aerial photos over low-contrast areas like a snow surface on a steep terrain.

We also provide and apply a new compilation of over 21 000 global TOC measurements and a new set of predictors, including features such as seafloor lithologies, benthic oxygen fluxes, and chlorophyll-a satellite data. Moreover, we compare different machine learning models based on their performance metrics and predictions and assess their strengths and limitations. For the dataset used, we find that the performance metrics of the models are comparable and that the neural network approach outperforms, on unseen data, methods such as k-nearest neighbours and random forests, which tend to overfit the training data. We provide estimates of mean TOC concentrations and stocks, both on continental shelves and in deep-sea settings across various marine regions and oceans.

The precise mechanisms by which microcystin-LR, a potent cyanotoxin, disrupts lipid metabolism in amphibian tadpoles remain unclear. In this study, tadpoles (Pelophylax nigromaculatus) were exposed to MC-LR and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments were performed to investigate whether or how MC-LR at environmental concentrations interfered with tadpole lipid metabolism from the perspective of the gut microbiota-gut-liver axis. Following exposure, the liver exhibited significant inflammation, hypertrophy, and fibrosis, accompanied by elevated serum lipid levels. Furthermore, the expression levels of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor, were significantly downregulated. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations indicated a strong and stable binding between FXR and MC-LR. Moreover, MC-LR suppressed liver FXR expression or activity, triggering: (1) upregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1)-mediated triglyceride (TG) synthesis, (2) inhibition of free fatty acid (FFA) β-oxidation, and (3) activation of SREBP2-dependent bile acid biosynthesis. Moreover, MC-LR altered the composition of gut microbiota and specific bile acid levels (e.g., taurocholic acid and glycochenodeoxycholic acid) in the gut, thereby interfering with hepatic lipid metabolism, as evidenced by FMT-induced hepatic lipid accumulation in recipient tadpoles. These findings identify FXR as a potentially key molecular target for MC-LR and suggest that changes in bile acid levels of intestinal microbiota metabolism also may be an important pathway driving hepatic lipid dysregulation in amphibians exposed to environmental concentrations of MC-LR."

This study assesses the impact of aviation-related PM2.5 emissions on deaths in China from 2024 to 2050. PM2.5 concentration data from 2015 to 2022 are used as a baseline, and three healthcare development scenarios are considered. The study then compares the changes in aviation PM2.5 concentrations under different mitigation pathways, including Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), Hydrogen Turbine Engine (HTE), and Hydrogen Fuel Cell (HFC) engine. It incorporates these into the Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM) to estimate the excess deaths attributable to aviation activities in China. The scenario with significant medical improvements results in 4365 deaths by 2050, only 15.37% of the deaths in Business as Usual (BAU), and 32.91% in the scenarios with medical congestion due to severe aging. Using clean energy in China’s aviation sector can reduce the number of deaths caused by PM2.5 emissions from aviation, with varying degrees of improvement depending on the start time and type of clean energy used. Further analysis reveals that in all scenarios, the proportion of male deaths is higher than that of females, at 58.10, 61.20, and 59.23%.

Although recent ecotoxicological studies of reptiles have increased, little is known about how these two stressors interact to affect reptile reproductive processes. This study investigated the single and combined effects of atrazine and warming on reproduction in female lizards (Eremias argus) following 10 weeks of exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of atrazine (0–10 mg·kg–1) at two temperature treatments (control or warming). Reproductive traits, clutch characteristics, and endpoints related to endocrine disruption (HPG axis gene expression) and energy metabolism (enzyme activity, hepatic metabolomics) were assessed. Atrazine inhibits female reproduction by disrupting HPG axis-related gene expression and energy metabolism, resulting in delayed spawning time and reduced fecundity. In contrast, warming promoted female reproduction and partly alleviated the inhibitory effects of atrazine, which is related to the upregulation of HPG axis-related gene expression and an additional energy metabolism compensatory response. Additionally, atrazine and/or warming altered the direction and intensity of the trade-off between egg number and size and affected maternal nutritional investment in eggs. These findings highlight the complex interplay of environmental stressors on lizard reproduction and add to a better understanding of reptile reproductive strategies and ecological consequences under environmental stress."

The present study investigated the distribution, accumulation, and phytotoxicity of polystyrene (PS) NPs in radish and evaluated the potential risks of PS NPs to human health via a simulated INFOGEST model. PS NPs were mainly accumulated in the cortex and xylem of radish roots and primarily accumulated within the peels via direct adsorption onto tuber surfaces. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that exposure to PS NPs triggered plant defense systems by upregulating gene expression and metabolites involved in flavonoid biosynthesis as well as starch and sucrose metabolisms. However, the downregulation of genes associated with plant hormone signal transduction, as well as the biosynthesis of glucosinolates (the most valued compounds contributing to radish nutrition and flavor), and amino acids reduced crop yield and quality. Importantly, the investigations using a simulated INFOGEST model showed that PS NPs significantly reduced bioaccessibilities or index of nutritional quality (INQ) of amino acids and glucosinolates in the digesta of radish fruits, thereby compromising the nutritional value of radish.

The primary goal is to refine emission estimates for key sources, including enteric fermentation, manure, and feed production, using the latest climate science, predictive models, and updated industry data, including a broader range of dietary rations across 12 distinct dairy regions. Compared with previous studies that employed generalized models and less granular data, this approach offers greater accuracy and regional specificity. In addition to establishing the 2020 GHG emissions baseline, we compare the results to 2007 estimates to highlight trends and improvements in emission intensities and production practices. U.S. raw milk production in 2020 generated 138.88 million tonnes of CO2e, corresponding to an average of 1.38 kg CO2e per kg of fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM), with regional emissions ranging from 1.24 to 1.87 kg CO2e/kg FPCM. Notably, the study shows that while enteric fermentation and manure emissions remain substantial contributors, their share of total emissions is less than in previous assessments.

Our strategy was to tailor suitable Cu–O–Mn coordination environments across numerous types of widely used CuMn bimetallic oxides. Unexpectedly, Cu–O–Mn sites within the CuO phase ignited greater catalytic activity toward alkanes like cyclohexane under 5.0% relative humidity, with a lower T90 at 219 °C, and excellent stability over 48 h, compared to spinel phases noted for electron transfer. Doping CuO with high-valence Mn3+ and Mn4+ prefers to generate oxygen interstitials, facilitating the formation of dual high-valence Cu–O–Mn sites. Notably, optimal Cu3Mn1 simultaneously featured high-valence states of Cu1.98+ and Mn3.22+, as evidenced by the positive correlation between catalytic activity and valence state. Dual high-valence Cu–O–Mn sites within the CuO phase bolstered reactive oxygen species mobility, oxidizability, and replenishment, as well as acid sites, facilitating the Mars-van-Krevelen redox cycles. The resulting enhancement rapidly overcame the rate-limiting step of key intermediate benzene oxidation, endowing higher and sustainable reactivity.

Results show that precipitation‐induced cooling effects on Tmax through cloud effects and evaporative cooling, particularly in arid and semi‐humid regions. In arid regions, precipitation enhances Tmin through increased downward longwave radiation and changes in soil thermodynamics, while in humid regions, rainfall‐induced evaporative cooling suppresses Tmin. Notably, the Tmax warming trend during rainy weathers lacks statistical significance in humid regions, and Tmin consistently warms more during dry conditions.

Significant differences in aerosols number concentration (Na), cloud droplet concentration (Nc), and drizzle droplet concentration (Nd) are observed, with lower number concentrations in the precipitating part for all three. The effective radius (re) of cloud droplets is smaller, while drizzle droplets exhibit a larger re in the precipitating part. In the non‐precipitating part, drizzle droplet re decreases with altitude, while in the precipitating part, it remains constant due to larger droplets falling out. Aerosol size distribution analysis implies that precipitation mainly scavenges aerosols with sizes smaller than 0.3 μm. Cloud particle size distributions are bimodal, with a broader spectrum in the precipitating part, especially in lower layers. Additionally, drizzles contribute approximately 20% to the total liquid water content in the non‐precipitating part, and 70% in the precipitating part.

To stop continued global warming, we understand that we must reach and sustain net‐zero global CO2 emissions, however, there is limited knowledge on how heat extremes might change in net‐zero futures. In this study, we explore possible changes in temperature extreme intensity over the century after net‐zero CO2 emissions using projections from Earth System Models in the Zero Emissions Commitment Model Intercomparison Project (ZECMIP). Specifically, we investigate how regional single‐day temperature extreme intensities scale with global mean surface temperatures changes before and after net‐zero CO2 emissions. We also explore potential hydrological drivers of changes in temperature extreme scaling by performing focused investigations over the Mediterranean and Southern African regions. Our results show substantial reductions in scaling of temperature extreme intensity after reaching net‐zero CO2 emissions over nearly all land regions, however, scaling changes are dependent on the cumulative emissions prior to reaching net‐zero CO2. Temperature extreme scaling reductions after net‐zero CO2 are also regionally dependent, and the regional magnitudes of scaling reductions tend to favor mid‐latitude land in the Northern Hemisphere relative to tropical and Southern Hemispheric land masses. From focused investigations over the Mediterranean and Southern African regions, we find that changes in atmospheric circulation and local precipitation may play a major role in determining the sign and magnitude of changes in temperature extremes after net‐zero CO2 emissions."

 Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis stands as a promising technology for sustainable hydrogen production, although its viability hinges on minimizing platinum (Pt) usage without sacrificing catalytic efficiency. Central to this challenge is enhancing the intrinsic activity of Pt while ensuring the stability of the catalyst. We herein present a Mo2TiC2 MXene-supported Pt nanocluster catalyst (Mo2TiC2-PtNC) that requires a minimal Pt content (36 μg cm−2) to function, yet remains highly active and stable. Operando spectroscopy and theoretical simulation provide evidence for anomalous charge transfer from the MXene substrate to PtNC, thus generating highly efficient electron-rich Pt sites for robust hydrogen evolution. When incorporated into a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer, the catalyst affords more than 8700 h at 200 mA cm−2 under ambient temperature with a decay rate of just 2.2 μV h−1. All the performance metrics of the present Mo2TiC2-PtNC catalysts are on par with or even surpass those of current hydrogen evolution electrocatalysts under identical operation conditions, thereby challenging the monopoly of high-loading Pt/C-20% in the current electrolyzer design.

Here, we developed a 640×512-pixel CMOS-integrated organic neuromorphic imager featuring dual modes: standard (frame-based imaging) and synaptic (neuromorphic imaging). In synaptic mode, the system extracts high-resolution spatiotemporal maps (light distribution and motion trajectories) from final frames, decoding temporal sequences of light events through contrast analysis. The neuromorphic device demonstrates adjustable memory behavior through modulation of charge recombination-trapping dynamics, enabling multi-level memory functionality. We further developed a CMOS-compatible photolithography method, which supports high-resolution and non-destructive patterning of organic neuromorphic devices. The fabricated imager allows in-sensor memorization (>18 min) and real-world spatiotemporal imaging with reduced computation resource, demonstrating its potential for industrial monitoring and motion detection. Integrating static image capture and dynamic visual processing in a single sensor is challenging. The authors experimentally demonstrate a CMOS-integrated organic neuromorphic imager with adjustable memory, capable of high-resolution dual-modal imaging."

 The human genome contains millions of copies of retrotransposons that are silenced but many of these copies have potential to become active if mutated, having phenotypic consequences, including disease. However, it is not thoroughly understood how nucleotide changes in retrotransposons affect their jumping activity. Here, we develop a massively parallel jumping assay (MPJA) that tests the jumping potential of thousands of transposons en masse. We generate a nucleotide variant library of four Alu retrotransposons containing 165,087 different haplotypes and test them for their jumping ability using MPJA. We found 66,821 unique jumping haplotypes, allowing us to pinpoint domains and variants vital for transposition. Mapping these variants to the Alu-RNA secondary structure revealed stem-loop features that contribute to jumping potential. Combined, our work provides a high-throughput assay that assesses the ability of retrotransposons to jump and identifies nucleotide changes that have the potential to reactivate them in the human genome.

 The K29/K48-linked ubiquitination generated by the cooperative catalysis of E3 ligase Ufd4 and Ubr1 is an enhanced protein degradation signal, in which Ufd4 is responsible for introducing K29-linked ubiquitination to K48-linked ubiquitin chains to augment polyubiquitination. How HECT-E3 ligase Ufd4 mediates the ubiquitination event remains unclear. Here, we biochemically determine that Ufd4 preferentially catalyses K29-linked ubiquitination on K48-linked ubiquitin chains to generate K29/K48-branched ubiquitin chains and capture structural snapshots of Ub transfer cascades for Ufd4-mediated ubiquitination. The N-terminal ARM region and HECT domain C-lobe of Ufd4 are identified and characterized as key structural elements that together recruit K48-linked diUb and orient Lys29 of its proximal Ub to the active cysteine of Ufd4 for K29-linked branched ubiquitination.

 The presence of radionuclides in seafood following the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident in March 2011 have led to widespread and persistent concerns over seafood safety. We assess seafood ingestion doses before and after the accident for adults in the Tohoku Region of Northeast Japan. Using a Monte Carlo approach, we evaluate 23 anthropogenic and natural radionuclides alongside realistic seafood consumption rates. In the first year after the accident, the ingestion dose from accident-derived radionuclides was 19 µSv for consumers exposed to the 95th percentile dose, contributing only 2% of the total seafood ingestion dose, which includes natural radionuclides such as 210Po and 210Pb. After the third year, the dose from accident-derived radionuclides was indistinguishable to that from pre-accident background levels. These findings suggest that, with seafood restrictions in place, the impact of accident-related releases on seafood ingestion doses was minor and relatively short-lived compared with that of natural radionuclides.

 Rare earth element exploration requires a quantitative understanding of factors governing their mobilization and economic concentration.

Solubility studies of neodymium phosphate were performed at temperatures ranging from 100 to 600 °C in carbonate-bearing solutions. The thermodynamic data determined for the predominant complex were used to model the separation of neodymium from thorium in a simple flow-through system based on fluid and mineral compositions characteristic of carbonatite deposits. Our data suggest that neodymium transport is controlled by the stability of the carbonate species NdCO3OHo, and at temperatures of 500–600 °C, the concentrations of neodymium in solutions can reach ~1000 ppm.

Sea level rise threatens to diminish these systems unless sediment accretion compensates submergence. To quantify these dynamics for the world’s largest channel-shoal system, the Wadden Sea, an observed geomorphological time series was created and assessed over three decades. We found how (i) accretion-erosion was asymmetric from deep to shallow, (ii) topographic steepening occurred, and (iii) the morphological evolution was systematic across tidal basins. Peak accretion was observed below tidal low and above tidal high water, while the greatest erosion was found at intermediate subtidal elevations. Most intertidal areas accreted faster than sea level rise, and accretion was prominent at the channel-flat and flat-marsh interfaces. The simultaneous deepening of tidal channels leads to topographic steepening. Overall, the current net sediment import of the Wadden Sea is 19.7 Mm³/yr.

 Global food security is increasingly challenged by climate change and unsustainable agriculture, emphasizing the need for strategies to enhance crop productivity. Understanding the interplay between crop health and soil microbiomes is crucial. This study explores the link between crop health, observed via multi-spectral satellite imagery, and fungal soil microbiome taxonomy. We associate the normalized difference vegetation index with fungal microbiomes in wheat, barley, and maize using a two-step machine learning process. The first step adjusts normalized difference vegetation index values for abiotic confounders using a random forest model trained on Lucas 2018 topsoil and ERA5 climate datasets. The second step clusters operational taxonomy unit counts from fungal DNA, revealing significant differences in residual normalized difference vegetation index values. To identify potential bio-fertilizer candidates, we compare the average relative abundance of operational taxonomy unit clusters and construct sparse biological networks. Key findings are: (I) clusters with higher plant pathogenic genera have lower normalized difference vegetation index values; (II) clusters with higher influential scores for multiple beneficial genera have higher normalized difference vegetation index values; (III) lower abundance taxonomy (1-3%) seems to regulate microbial networks; (IV) the influence of beneficial vs. pathogenic taxonomy is relative to their abundance.

 Oxygen isotope values (δ18O) in benthic foraminifera indicate a marked cooling from the early to late Eocene in the higher latitudes where oceanic bottom water forms. This record is widely interpreted as an indication of global surface cooling, leading to the hypothesis of greater climate sensitivity to atmospheric CO2 concentration in warmer than in cooler climate states. Here we extend the coexistence approach using phylogenetic trees to study Eocene climatic change in the Western Interior of North America based on assemblages of small reptiles. Our results capture and elaborate on climatic features previously inferred for the early Eocene, such as drying during the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, but also show that the late Eocene in mid-latitude North America was considerably warmer and wetter than previously thought. Accordingly, the net Eocene cooling trend in benthic foraminiferal δ18O might reflect not global but rather regional, high-latitude phenomena, and hypothesised extreme values of climate sensitivity to CO2 doubling might be revised downward.

 Assimilating crop biophysical traits (e.g., Leaf area index, LAI) derived from remote sensing data into a crop growth model provides an effective way for monitoring spatiotemporal variability of crop biomass and yield. However, traditional complex crop growth models generally require extensive input parameters and computation resources, limiting their applicability for large-area estimation using earth observation data. The Simple Algorithm for Yield Estimation model (SAFY), a semi-physical crop growth model grounded in light use efficiency theory has been widely adopted for satellite-based biomass estimation in major field crops. Despite its utility, SAFY cannot directly simulate sugarcane stalk biomass, a critical metric for sugarcane yield assessment. To address this, we developed SAFY-Sugar, a revised SAFY incorporating a temperature-driven stalk biomass module that partitions daily above-ground biomass into stalk biomass. Multi-temporal LAI (S2-LAI) was first inverted from vegetation indices of Sentinel-2 satellite using a semi-empirical model calibrated with the 250 m GLASS LAI product as reference. The estimated S2-LAI achieved an overall accuracy of 0.50 m2/m2 in RMSE across selected vegetation indices. Two data assimilation strategies to assimilate the S2-LAI into the SAFY or SAFY-Sugar model for above-ground and stalk biomass estimation in fields were tested (1) independently optimizing SAFY and SAFY-Sugar parameters with S2-LAI alone, and (2) pre-optimizing the stalk module using independent farm measurements before assimilation. SAFY employed a fixed biomass allocation coefficient for stalk biomass estimation. Under the first Strategy, SAFY-Sugar demonstrated large improvements in stalk biomass estimation (R2 = 0.94, nRMSE = 26.09 %) compared to SAFY (R2 = 0.92, nRMSE = 32.73 %). The second strategy further enhanced SAFY-Sugar’s accuracy (R2 = 0.98, nRMSE = 14.34 %). For regional application in Chongzuo City (2020 – 2021) using the second strategy, SAFY-Sugar captured spatial yield variability, consistent with the government statistics (nRMSE = 6.61 %). By integrating satellite data assimilation, SAFY-Sugar provides a robust framework for monitoring sugarcane productivity across scales, advancing precision agriculture in sugarcane systems."

 Droughts are some of the most devastating natural extreme events in sub-Saharan with enormous economic impacts on agrarian economies such as Cameroon. However, knowledge and information on their dynamics and drivers in the five agroecological zones (AEZs) of Cameroon is very scanty leading to poor planning and management. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize agricultural droughts based on soil moisture, explored trends and drivers of scale 3 standardized soil moisture index in the five AEZs of Cameroon at high spatial and temporal resolutions for the period 1990–2022. Results show a predominance of moderate to severe droughts in most parts of the MF AEZ, a general increase in the percent of drought area (PDA) in the last four years averaging at 48% and, a significant increase in droughts for over 65% of the country at 5% level of significance. The observed droughts were found to be significantly internally associated with precipitation, evapotranspiration, vapor pressure deficit and minimum temperature but majorly driven by evapotranspiration, precipitation and vapor pressure deficit with a 52% coefficient of determination. This relationship was well aligned with the first Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) mode that for 34.1% explained variance.

 Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellites offer high-resolution multispectral imagery widely used for applications such as vegetation phenology assessment, soil dynamics monitoring, and crop yield estimation. However, optical remote sensing data often encounter information gaps due to satellite orbital cycles and adverse atmospheric conditions, which significantly reduce image availability and complicate accurate, timely monitoring of surface change. Although integrating Landsat and Sentinel-2 can mitigate some of these challenges, the spectral differences between the two datasets necessitate spectral adjustments to minimize discrepancies in surface reflectance. Furthermore, Sentinel-2′s distinct red-edge and narrow near-infrared spectral bands play a vital role in vegetation monitoring, and their absence significantly hinders precise tracking of vegetation growth and detailed analysis. In response to these issues, we propose a deep learning framework incorporating an enhanced attention mechanism and multi-scale connection for precise remote sensing image reconstruction. This framework leverages 30-metre Landsat-8 as input to generate the 10-metre resolution Sentinel-2, harmonizing the spectral differences between the two satellites and utilizing the reconstructed images to interpolate missing pixels. The experimental findings demonstrate that the deep learning framework in this study outperforms other methodologies across various essential quantitative metrics. The integrated enhanced attention mechanism significantly improves the accuracy of image reconstruction and visual quality, particularly in restoring fine details. The assessment of transferability further validates the model’s robustness and applicability across different periods and geographic regions. Moreover, using the reconstructed images to interpolate missing data produces a denser NDVI time series, offering great potential for downstream tasks such as crop growth monitoring, identification of key phenological stages, and enabling more precise monitoring and management in agricultural applications."

Despite some success in crop yield estimation using deep learning models, they are often referred to as “black boxes” due to their lack of interpretability. Meanwhile, most current models are designed to provide yield estimations without assessing the uncertainty and verifying the contribution of components within the models. This work developed a novel deep learning approach to estimate winter wheat yield in the Guanzhong Plain, PR China by using three remotely sensed indices, vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI), leaf area index (LAI), and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) during main growth stages of winter wheat. The attention mechanism (AM) and an interpretable attribution method, backpropagation-based integrated gradients (IG), were incorporated into the deep learning approach to enhance interpretability. Additionally, to address uncertainty limitations the Monte Carlo (MC) dropout was applied to the deep learning approach to assess the uncertainty over time during data accumulation. The proposed approach (AM-CNN-LSTM) combined a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) to capture local dependencies in sequences, the temporal data processing capability of long short-term memory (LSTM), and the interpretability of the AM. The AM-CNN-LSTM model had enhanced precision in yield estimation (R2 = 0.64, RMSE = 498.08 kg/ha) compared with the CNN, AM-CNN, and CNN-LSTM. The attention weights indicated that the most significant variable influencing wheat yield was FPAR, followed by LAI and VTCI. The results of IG showed that the FPAR at the jointing and heading-filling stages, LAI at the heading-filling and milk maturity stages, and VTCI at the jointing stage contributed more to the yield. The MC dropout results showed that the level of model uncertainty decreased steadily as time advanced from late March to late April and stabilized around mid-May."

 One predominant source of microplastics emitted into the atmosphere is tyre- and road wear particles (TRWPs). Only a handful of studies have quantified atmospheric TRWP concentrations. Our objective was to study variations in TRWPs, compared to other primary traffic pollutants, at locations with different traffic conditions.In 2022–2023, three locations with different traffic-flow and speed (a stop-and-go busy road, highway and urban park), were repeatedly visited for 4-hrs resulting in 23 measurement days. Particles were collected on quartz filters using a high-volume sampler with PM10-inlet and analyzed using double-shot pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for the mass of synthetic- and natural rubbers (NR). Concentrations of combustion and brake-wear-related traffic air pollutants were measured, including PM10, black carbon (BC), ultrafine particles (UFP) and trace elements. We calculated spatial contrasts and correlations.We observed relatively low levels of sampling- and analysis rubber marker contamination. Synthetic- and NR levels ranged between 2.9 to 42.5 ng/m3 and 1.6 to 26.8 ng/m3, respectively. Compared to the park, rubber markers were 2.8 to 4.6 times higher at the stop-and-go and 2.0 to 2.7 times higher at the highway. These contrasts were larger than for UFP and PM10, but similar to BC and brake-wear related components. Park synthetic rubber levels were modestly higher than field blanks. Rubber markers were highly correlated (r = 0.66 to 0.98) and weakly correlated with most other air pollutants, except for BC and brake wear-related trace elements (r = 0.36 to 0.77).We found substantially increased atmospheric TRWP levels near major roads compared to a park.

 The Pi convection-cloud chamber can generate steady-state turbulence in both rectangular and cylindrical shapes via Rayleigh-Bénard convection (RBC) by maintaining warm bottom and cold top surfaces. Although most experiments in the Pi chamber were conducted in cylindrical shapes, all previous Pi chamber simulations were conducted in a rectangular shape due to the limitations of those models to discretize a cylindrical domain when using the finite difference method therein. Here, we use OpenFOAM, an open-source finite-volume-based Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software package, to conduct Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) of dry RBC in the Pi chamber at high Rayleigh numbers (108 to 109). Results show that large-scale circulation (LSC) direction varies in the chamber with a constant side wall temperature. Imposing a slight temperature imbalance at the side wall ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 degrees can lock the LSC, aligning better with Pi chamber observations, particularly at higher Rayleigh numbers. In addition, we examine the impact of surface topography on LSC and heat transfer in RBC systems within cylindrical and rectangular shapes under varying conditions. Results show that roughing top/bottom surfaces by adding bars of a few tens millimeters height can strengthen thermal plumes and enhance temperature fluctuations in the chamber. Furthermore, we observe that different bar height configurations lead to notable changes in LSC orientation and thermal stratification, highlighting the complex interactions between surface features and convection patterns. This finding highlights how surface topography and chamber geometry affect Rayleigh-Bénard convection, improving understanding of turbulent heat transfer and atmospheric boundary-layer processes. Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) are also conducted to validate LES results. While LES effectively captures qualitative behaviors seen in DNS, it tends to underestimate velocity variances near walls, illustrating a trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy."

By contrast, the skyrmion formation mechanism in centrosymmetric materials remains elusive. Here, we reveal the intrinsic electronic structure of the centrosymmetric GdRu2Si2by selectively measuring magnetic domains using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We found robust Fermi surface (FS) nesting, consistent with the magnetic modulationq-vector detected by the previous resonant x-ray scattering measurements. The pseudogap opens at the nested FS portions, which vary for different magnetic domains. The anomalous pseudogap disconnects the FS to generate Fermi arcs with twofold symmetry. These results indicate that the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction plays a decisive role in generating the screw spin modulation responsible for the skyrmion formation in GdRu2Si2.

 Physical and chemical properties of particulate matter and concentrations of trace gases were measured at an urban site in Helsinki, Finland, for 5 weeks to investigate the effect of wintertime conditions on pollutants. The measurement took place in a street canyon (traffic supersite) in January–February 2022.

The measurements were made driving the adjacent side streets and the street along the traffic supersite. Source apportionment was performed for the soot particle aerosol mass spectrometer measurements to identify organic factors connected to different particulate sources. Particle number concentration time series and the pollution detection algorithm were used to compare local pollution level differences between the sites.During the campaign three different pollution events were observed with increased pollution concentrations. The increased concentrations during these episodes were due to both trapping of local pollutants near the boundary layer and the long-range and regional transport of pollutants to the Helsinki metropolitan area. Local road vehicle emissions increased the particle number concentrations, especially sub-10 nm particles, and long-range-transported and regionally transported aged particles increased the PM mass and particle size."

Smith,Satellite-derived global-ocean phytoplankton  phenology indices,"The annual widespread growth of phytoplankton blooms across the global ocean has far-reaching impacts on food security, ecosystem health, and climate. This study uses satellite-derived observations to generate long-term, sustained indices of phytoplankton phenology, capturing the timing, variability, and magnitude of blooms across the global ocean. These indices support the effective monitoring and management of marine resources and help assess the impacts of climate change on ocean ecosystems. 
 Phytoplankton bloom phenology is an important indicator for the monitoring and management of marine resources and the assessment of climate change impacts on ocean ecosystems. Despite its relevance, there is no long-term and sustained observational phytoplankton phenological product available for global-ocean implementation. This need is addressed here by providing a phenological data product (including among other seasonal metrics, the bloom initiation, termination, duration, and amplitude timing) using satellite-derived chlorophyll-a data from the Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative. This multi-decadal data product provides the phenology output from three widely used bloom detection methods at three different spatial resolutions (4, 9, and 25 km), allowing for both regional- and global-scale applications. When compared to each other on global scales, there is general agreement between the detection methods and between the different resolutions. Regional differences are evident in coastal domains (particularly for different resolutions) and in regions with strong physical–biogeochemical transitions (notably for different detection methods). This product can be used towards the development of national and global biodiversity assessments, for pelagic ecosystem mapping, and for monitoring change in climate sensitive regions relevant for ecosystem services.

By combining field and satellite observations, we provide annual mass changes for all glaciers in the world, showing significant contributions to global sea level rise. This work underscores the need for ongoing local monitoring and global climate action to mitigate the effects of glacier loss and its broader environmental impacts​. 
 Glaciers, distinct from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, play a crucial role in Earth's climate system by affecting global sea levels, regional freshwater availability, nutrient and energy budgets, and local geohazards. Past assessments of regional to global glacier mass changes were limited in spatial coverage, temporal resolution, and/or temporal coverage. Here, we present a new observation-based dataset of glacier mass changes with global coverage and annual resolution from 1976 to 2024. We use geostatistical modeling for the temporal downscaling of decadal glacier-wide elevation change estimates derived from satellite and airborne geodetic data, with glaciological annual in situ observations. In more detail, we spatially interpolate the annual mass balance anomalies from sparse in situ observations and calibrate them to glacier-wide long-term trends from elevation change observations available for individual glaciers for varying time periods and with global glacier coverage from 2000 to 2019. We then extrapolate the results to yearly time series starting between 1915 and 1976, depending on the regional data availability, and extending to 2024. The time series are calculated separately for each of the world's glaciers and then aggregated to gridded (0.5° latitude and longitude), regional, and global estimates of annual glacier mass changes. Since 1976, Earth's glaciers have lost 9179 ± 621 Gt (187 ± 20 Gt per year) of water, contributing 25.3 ± 1.7 mm (0.5 ± 0.2 mm per year) to the global mean sea level rise. About 41 % (∼ 10 mm) of this loss occurred in the last decade, with 6 % (∼ 1.5 mm) occurring in 2023 alone, the record-breaking year of glacier mass loss. We review the strengths and limitations of our new dataset, validate and discuss related uncertainty estimates in a leave-one-out/block-out cross-validation exercise, and compare our results to earlier assessments. The annual mass change time series for individual glaciers and the derived global gridded annual mass change product are available from the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS) at https://doi.org/10.5904/wgms-amce-2025-02 (Dussaillant et al., 2025)."

Here we present a daily 1 km shortwave albedo product for Antarctic sea ice from 2012 to 2021, based on VIIRS reflectance data. Additionally, we reconstructed the albedo for missing pixels due to cloud cover. This dataset can be used to assess changes in Antarctic sea ice, radiation budget, and the strength of sea ice albedo feedback mechanisms, as well as their potential interconnections. 
 Sea ice albedo is a critical parameter for quantifying the energy budget in the Antarctic region. High spatiotemporal resolution sea ice albedo product is essential for Antarctic climate and environmental research. In this study, based on Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) reflectance data, we use the Multiband Reflectance Iteration (MBRI) algorithm to calculate sea ice albedo. This algorithm fully utilizes multi-band observations from single-angle/date observed information to correct the anisotropy of the sea ice surface. Additionally, spatiotemporal information is utilized to reconstruct albedo under cloudy-sky conditions, while correcting for cloud radiative forcing effects. A new daily seamless Antarctic sea ice albedo product with a 1 km resolution is then generated for the period 2012 to 2021. Monte Carlo simulations show that the average retrieval uncertainty of this product is 0.022, with higher uncertainty in backward observations. MBRI albedo product was validated using in situ measurements from Automatic Weather Stations (AWS). The results show that the bias is 0.02, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.071. After upscaling to 25 km resolution and applying a 5-day temporal aggregation, the RMSE decreased to below 0.055. Compared to existing albedo products, the MBRI product exhibits improved spatial continuity due to the reconstruction of cloudy-sky pixels. Statistical analysis shows that albedo under cloudy-sky conditions is higher than under clear-sky conditions (mean difference: 0.035–0.064). The MBRI albedo product can be used to estimate sea ice albedo feedback, energy balance analysis and sea ice monitoring. The latest version of our albedo (version 2) and uncertainty datasets are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11216156 (Ma et al., 2024) and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15067607 (Ma et al., 2025), respectively."

The model is trained on 3.7 million measurements globally available and provides skilful estimates across all regions. This advancement will help in better assessing future sea level changes and freshwater resources, with significance for both the scientific community and society at large. 
 Knowledge of glacier ice volumes is crucial for constraining future sea level potential, evaluating freshwater resources, and assessing impacts on societies, from regional to global. Motivated by the disparity in existing ice volume estimates, we present IceBoost, a global machine learning framework trained to predict ice thickness at arbitrary coordinates, thereby enabling the generation of spatially distributed thickness maps for individual glaciers. IceBoost is an ensemble of two gradient-boosted trees trained with 3.7 million globally available ice thickness measurements and an array of 39 numerical features. The model error is similar to those of existing models outside polar regions and is up to 30 %–40 % lower at high latitudes. Providing supervision by exposing the model to available glacier thickness measurements reduces the error by a factor of up to 2 to 3. A feature-ranking analysis reveals that geodetic data are the most informative variables, while ice velocity can improve the model performance by 6 % at high latitudes. A major feature of IceBoost is a capability to generalize outside the training domain, i.e. producing meaningful ice thickness maps in all regions of the world, including on the ice sheet peripheries."

This study explores the potential of flexible carbon source regulation to reduce GHG emissions while improving the nutrient removal efficiency under varying influent conditions. A plant-wide model was developed, calibrated with one year of hourly monitoring data, to quantify GHG emissions in a full-scale WWTP. We evaluated three carbon regulation strategies: anaerobic digestion (AD), short fermentation (SF), and adaptive carbon source regulation (ACSR). Results show that AD was most effective in high carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratios, reducing GHG emissions by 29.2%. SF performed best at low C/N ratios, reducing N2O emissions by 56.3%. The ACSR strategy, which dynamically adjusts between AD and SF based on influent C/N, achieved a total GHG reduction of 18.2% compared with the base strategy (conventional activated sludge process with mechanical dewatering and landfill disposal of waste sludge). Seasonal variations significantly impacted emissions (p < 0.001), while C/N ratios, although not statistically significant in isolation, play a crucial role in influencing N2O emissions and sludge production, emphasizing the need for adaptive carbon allocation. This study underscores the viability of plant-wide, data-driven carbon source regulation as an integrated approach to achieving net-zero emissions in WWTPs, effectively addressing diverse GHG emission sources within the system."

According to Köhler theory, aerosol activation into cloud droplets or CCN activity is impacted by aerosol surface tension. However, predicting the surface tension of activating aerosol particles is complicated by the bulk depletion of surfactants, which is sensitive to droplet size. Here, we present a simple surface-bulk partitioning model based on the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, which is capable of predicting bulk depletion and the size-dependent surface tension of microscopic droplets. The present model is validated by comparing our predictions with reported surface tension measurements of microdroplets containing nonionic surfactants and generally agrees with the droplet measurements. More importantly, the model can reproduce the size-dependent surface tension of ∼5–20 μm droplets containing NaCl and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at a given SDS concentration. Predicted Köhler curves of equilibrium supersaturation versus droplet diameter reveal that the models assuming a constant surface tension of pure water (i.e., classical Köhler theory) or bulk solution containing surfactants may potentially underestimate or overestimate CCN activity, respectively, highlighting the essential role of size-dependent surface tension in accurately representing the effect of surface tension on aerosol-cloud interactions."

We conducted a 2-month monitoring campaign in a multilayer residential building, identifying 53 interunit kitchen exhaust transmission events (∼2 per day), causing enhanced exposure of particulate matters (PM), black carbon (BC), NOx, and CO and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in both the kitchen and living room. These events resulted in a 40–80% increase in PM deposition in the respiratory systems for occupants in the living room, especially fine particles depositing in the alveolar region. Evidence indicates that these pollutant events originated from cooking fume transport. The geometric mean diameter of kitchen particles decreased from 76 nm during background periods to 62 nm during transport events, consistent with smaller PM from cooking activities. Furthermore, 30 cooking-related VOCs were identified as transport indicators, including hazardous species such as aldehydes.

Due to their ubiquity, persistence in the environment, and potential for toxicity at low environmental concentrations, it is necessary to have convenient and reliable methods to measure PFAS in natural waters. Passive sampling methods (in situ preconcentration of PFAS) may be suitable for monitoring situations. One passive sampling design successfully employed for other, well studied contaminants (e.g., methylmercury) is the diffusive gradient in thin film sampler (DGT). However, the application of DGT for PFAS requires development and validation. Here, we iterate on previous PFAS-DGT studies by introducing a redesigned diffusive gradient sampler for PFAS in water and show that it reliably measures 25 PFAS in water, consistent with diffusion theory. Diffusion and whole-sampler uptake rates consistently agreed with model predictions within ±50% relative difference, including when tested at cold temperature (5 °C). In field and laboratory deployments, DGT samplers measured PFAS concentrations within ±23% of grab sample results on average in each case─better performance than codeployed microporous polyethylene tube passive samplers. Based on the evidence in this study, the DGT passive sampler is a promising tool for consistently and accurately passively sampling PFAS in natural waters."

However, their combined influence on storm tracks remains to be determined. To answer this question, we defined four phases to represent the different combinations of large‐scale SSTA patterns in the North Pacific and mesoscale SSTA in Kuroshio and Oyashio confluence region (KOCR), based on the standardized mesoscale SSTA index and the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) index. The storm tracks' response mainly exhibits a significant meridional dipolar structure in all phases, primarily driven by the mesoscale SSTA and consistent with previous studies. However, the details of the reaction differ under the modulation of PDO. Our findings also suggest the role of PDO is more pronounced when the variation of mesoscale SSTA is strong. Additionally, the storm tracks show more elongated and asymmetric anomalies in the warm PDO phase than the cold PDO phase. The key mechanism behind this is as follows. It revealed that the baroclinic processes associated with mesoscale SSTA are important in shaping storm tracks. The variation of mesoscale SSTA in KOCR changes the upward transportation of moisture and heat, which may alter diabatic heating. Consequently, differences emerge in the meridional gradient of air temperature, modifying the baroclinicity of the troposphere. Through baroclinic energy conversion, the influence finally impacts the storm tracks. PDO totally modulates these processes. In conclusion, the development of the North Pacific storm tracks are influenced by the combined effects of large‐scale and mesoscale SSTA."

However, simulating deep convection remains challenging for modern numerical weather and climate models due to the complex interactions of processes from microscales to synoptic scales. Recent models with kilometer‐scale horizontal grid spacings (Δx) $({\Delta }x)$ offer notable improvements in simulating deep convection compared to coarser‐resolution models. Still, deficiencies in representing key physical processes, such as entrainment, lead to systematic biases. Additionally, evaluating model outputs using process‐oriented observational data remain difficult. This study presents an ensemble of MCS simulations with Δx ${\Delta }x$ spanning the deep convective gray zone (Δx ${\Delta }x$ from 12 km to 125 m) in the Southern Great Plains of the U.S. and the Amazon Basin. Comparing these simulations with Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) wind profiler observations, we find greater Δx ${\Delta }x$ sensitivity in the Amazon Basin compared to the Great Plains. Convective drafts converge structurally at sub‐kilometer scales, but some deficiencies remain. In both regions, simulated up and downdrafts are too deep and extreme downdrafts are not strong enough. Furthermore, Amazonian updrafts are too strong. Overall, we observe higher Δx ${\Delta }x$ sensitivity in the tropics, including an artificial buildup in vertical kinetic energy at scales of 5Δx $5{\Delta }x$, suggesting a need for Δx≤ ${\Delta }x\le $ 250 m in this region. Nevertheless, bulk convergence—agreement of storm‐average statistics—is achievable with kilometer‐scale simulations within a ± $\pm $10% error margin with Δx= ${\Delta }x=$ 1 km providing a good balance between accuracy and computational cost."

 Dysregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis plays a pivotal role in the accelerated degradation of cartilage, presenting a notable challenge for effective osteoarthritis (OA) treatment and cartilage regeneration. In this study, we introduced an injectable hydrogel based on streamlined-zinc oxide (ZnO), which is responsive to matrix metallopeptidase (MMP), for the delivery of miR-17-5p. This approach aimed to address cartilage damage by regulating ECM homeostasis. The ZnO/miR-17-5p composite functions by releasing zinc ions to attract native bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, thereby fostering ECM synthesis through the proliferation of new chondrocytes. Concurrently, sustained delivery of miR-17-5p targets enzymes responsible for matrix degradation, thereby mitigating the catabolic process. Notably, the unique structure of the streamlined ZnO nanoparticles is distinct from their conventional spherical counterparts, which not only optimizes the rheological and mechanical properties of the hydrogels, but also enhances the efficiency of miR-17-5p transfection. Our male rat model demonstrated that the combination of streamlined ZnO, MMP-responsive hydrogels, and miRNA-based therapy effectively managed the equilibrium between catabolism and anabolism within the ECM, presenting a fresh perspective in the realm of OA treatment.

 Biophysical signals such as motion and optically acquired hemodynamics represent foundational sensing modalities for wearables. Expansion of this toolset is vital for the progression of digital medicine. Current efforts utilize biofluids such as sweat and interstitial fluid with primarily adhesively mounted sensors that are fundamentally limited by epidermal turnover. A class of potential biomarkers that is largely unexplored are gaseous emissions from the body. In this work, we introduce an approach to capture emission of gas from the skin with a leaky cavity designed to allow for diffusion-based ambient gas exchange with the environment. This approach, coupled with differential measurement of ambient and in-cavity gas concentrations, allows for the real-time analysis of sweat rate, VOCs, and CO2 while performing everyday tasks. The resulting biosignals are recorded with temporal resolutions that exceed current methodology, providing unparalleled insight into physiological processes without requiring sensor replacement over weeks at a time.

 The discovery of bifunctional degradation activating compounds (BiDACs) has led to the development of a new class of drugs that promote the clearance of their protein targets. BiDAC-induced ubiquitination is generally believed to direct cytosolic and nuclear proteins to proteolytic destruction by proteasomes. However, pathways that govern the degradation of other classes of BiDAC targets, such as integral membrane and intraorganellar proteins, have not been investigated in depth. In this study we use morphological profiling and CRISPR/Cas9 genetic screens to investigate the mechanisms by which BiDACs induce the degradation of plasma membrane receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) EGFR and Her2. We find that BiDAC-dependent ubiquitination triggers the trafficking of RTKs from the plasma membrane to lysosomes for degradation. Notably, functional proteasomes are required for endocytosis of RTKs upstream of the lysosome. Additionally, our screen uncovers a non-canonical function of the lysosome-associated arginine/lysine transporter PQLC2 in EGFR degradation. Our data show that BiDACs can target proteins to proteolytic machinery other than the proteasome and motivate further investigation of mechanisms that govern the degradation of diverse classes of BiDAC targets.

 Drug design strategies represent a fundamental challenge in chemical biology that could benefit from the development of next-generation high-throughput assays. Here we demonstrate that structural dynamic changes induced by ligand binding can be transmitted to a sensor protein fused to a target protein terminus. Here, NanoLuc luciferase, used as the intact protein or its α-complementation peptide, was fused to seven proteins from distinct enzyme superfamilies resulting in sensitive ligand-dependent bioluminescent outputs. This finding allows a general non-competitive, function-independent, quantitative, isothermal gain-of-signal ligand binding readout. As applied to chemical library high throughput screening, we can observe multivariate pharmacologic outputs including cofactor-induced synergy in ligand binding, as well as an example of allosteric site binding. The structural dynamics response assay format described here can enable the investigation of proteins precluded from study due to cost-prohibitive, insensitive, or technically challenging assays, including from cell lysates containing endogenously expressed gene edited proteins.

Here, the authors demonstrate that such bones grow through a mechanical feedback mechanism that propagates a wave of differentiation and emergent cell motion. 
 Cellular motion is a key feature of tissue morphogenesis and is often driven by migration. However, migration need not explain cell motion in contexts where there is little free space or no obvious substrate, such as those found during organogenesis of mesenchymal organs including the embryonic skull. Through ex vivo imaging, biophysical modeling, and perturbation experiments, we find that mechanical feedback between cell fate and stiffness drives bone expansion and controls bone size in vivo. This mechanical feedback system is sufficient to propagate a wave of differentiation that establishes a collagen gradient which we find sufficient to describe patterns of osteoblast motion. Our work provides a mechanism for coordinated motion that may not rely upon cell migration but on emergent properties of the mesenchymal collective. Identification of such alternative mechanisms of mechanochemical coupling between differentiation and morphogenesis will help in understanding how directed cellular motility arises in complex environments with inhomogeneous material properties. How the bones of the skull vault expand to cover the brain is poorly understood. Here, the authors demonstrate that such bones grow through a mechanical feedback mechanism that propagates a wave of differentiation and emergent cell motion."

 Land use and land cover changes (LULCCs) can influence precipitation via changes in surface energy, water flux, and large-scale atmospheric circulation, with great implications for the sustainable development of nature and society. However, the impacts and mechanisms of these contributors to extreme precipitation changes compared with mean changes still need to be investigated. Here, we used the moisture budget equation to decompose precipitation changes into three primary contributing factors (evapotranspiration, atmospheric mean circulation, and water vapor) based on CMIP6-LUMIP experiments. A global reduction in mean precipitation due to LULCCs can be attributed to relatively equal contributions of changes in evapotranspiration and atmospheric mean circulation over the historical (1995–2014) and future (2080–2099) periods. In contrast, during the top drying month, the precipitation reduction is approximately 2–3 times greater than the multi-year mean change. The dynamic contributor representing the mean circulation change surpasses evapotranspiration as the primary contributor driving the extreme precipitation decrease in the majority of the landscape. The socioeconomic impacts of LULCCs-induced extreme precipitation changes are greater than those of the mean state, especially in the future."

The results indicate that Stacking-EML not only significantly improves prediction accuracy compared to individual models and traditional CMIP6 outputs but also enhances climate projections by integrating multiple ML models, offering more reliable, regionally refined forecasts. Findings show R² improvements to 0.99 for maximum temperature, 0.98 for minimum temperature, and 0.82 for precipitation. Under SSP5-8.5, summer temperatures in southern regions are expected to exceed 45 °C, exacerbating drought conditions due to reduced rainfall.

 The global urgency of more damaging wildfires calls for proactive solutions. Integrating fire-smart fuels management with bioenergy could reduce wildfire risk while providing feedstock for bioenergy. We explore this strategy in off-grid communities in Canada who are heavily dependent on diesel for their energy needs, many of which are home to Indigenous peoples. Combining national remote sensing data and community-based information, we identify 33 diesel-dependent communities at high wildfire risk due to a large accumulation of undisturbed flammable forest. We demonstrate that 30 of these 33 communities could theoretically meet their annual energy needs by harvesting less than 1% of the surrounding biomass, which with thoughtful planning could constitute effective fuel treatments. Given the growing wildfire risk and the need for energy security in Indigenous communities, Indigenous leadership, and collaboration with wildland fire agencies, are essential for developing integrated fuel management strategies and identifying synergies with the bioenergy sector.

 Extreme heat is a global public health concern that is becoming more frequent and severe in recent periods. Translating Earth science data into policy-relevant metrics, such as rest breaks, is challenging but needed to protect outdoor workers from heat stress. Here, we determine rest-break requirements for the farmworkers of the Imperial and Coachella Valleys in southern California, which have a high poverty rate and the highest heat-illness rates in California. We used high-resolution outputs from a validated Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) at 1-km grid resolution that includes irrigation, a key modulator of heat stress in the study region. We calculated exceedances of heat stress indicators under three existing policy guidelines that use wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT), heat index (HI), or dry-bulb temperature (DBT), and translated them into rest breaks needed for farmworker safety. WBGT-based rest minutes are most sensitive to the spatiotemporal variation in heat exposure compared to DBT or HI and vary with acclimatization status, season, and work shifts. Recommended rest breaks to protect farmworkers from heat stress range from 2 to 32 min per work-hour between April and August. Although results are specific to California, our method is adaptable for calculating region-specific rest break requirements worldwide.

 The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission, launched to the International Space Station on June 29, 2018, currently provides high spatial resolution thermal observations in five bands with a revisit time of 1–5 days. The ECO2LSTE product, which provides the land surface temperature (LST) and emissivity (LSE) retrieved using the temperature and emissivity separation (TES) algorithm, serves as an essential ECOSTRESS product for generating the other higher-level products such as evapotranspiration and water use efficiency. Considering the radiometric calibration issues identified in the ECOSTRESS Collection 1 (C1) radiance data, recently the Collection 2 (C2) products have been released to address the cold bias in LST estimates below 300 K. Additionally, following the restoration of the two bands centered at 8.29 and 9.20 μm, the ECOSTRESS TES algorithm was shifted from 3-band to 5-band after May 2023. Consequently, a comprehensive evaluation is necessary to have a better understanding how LST&E estimates from different collections and algorithms perform. In this study, the impact of radiometric recalibration on LST&E estimates was first investigated for both the 3-band and 5-band TES algorithms based on a representative simulation dataset. Subsequently, we evaluated the accuracy of ECOSTRESS LST&E estimates in both collections using globally distributed ground measurements, and a spatial comparison between the C1 and C2 LST estimates was conducted over three selected regions to investigate their discrepancies of temperature spatial distribution. The simulation analysis revealed that the C2 LST was marginally lower than the C1 LST above 320 K but became higher below 320 K, with significant overestimation observed below 270 K. For LSE, the C2 estimates were generally lower than those in C1, particularly in the first three bands. Compared to the 3-band TES, larger differences between the C1 and C2 LST&E estimates were found for the 5-band TES. Based on the site-scale evaluation of LST, the cold bias between 270 and 300 K was effectively corrected in C2, with the bias in this range significantly reduced from approximately −2 K to 0. However, an overestimation exceeding 2 K was found for the C2 LST below 270 K, which may be caused by the overcorrection at low temperatures. LST estimates from both collections performed similarly above 300 K, with a systematically overestimation about 1 K. The spatial evaluation of LST reaffirms the findings from the simulation analysis and site-scale evaluation regarding the differences between C1 and C2 LST estimates. In the site-scale evaluation of LSE, a minor improvement was achieved in C2 over non-gray bodies, but the accuracy decreased over gray bodies. The LSE estimates using the 3-band and 5-band TES algorithms were comparable. Overall, this study provides updated information on the accuracies and differences of ECOSTRESS LST&E estimates from both collections, promoting the informed use of ECO2LSTE products in various downstream research applications with a clearer understanding of their performance."

 Rock glaciers (RGs) are ice and debris landforms shaped by long-term permafrost creep. Their inventory has expanded significantly in the past two decades due to their importance as water resources and indicators of climate change. Previous inventories in the Pyrenees are sparse and lack essential kinematic data, leading to an underestimation of active RGs. This study presents the first kinematic database of Pyrenean RGs, integrating European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) InSAR data with airborne Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) datasets and seven years of Sentinel-1 high-resolution InSAR data processed by the SqueeSAR algorithm. The analysis focuses on three igneous plutons (Panticosa, Cauterets, and Neouvielle) in the central Pyrenees, comparing surface displacement rates from these techniques to previous geodetic measurements. A total of 733 RGs have been mapped in the Pyrenees, covering an area of 58.9 km2. 73 % of the mapped RGs are inactive or relict, showing no ground displacement and being partially vegetated. Only 13 % (96 RGs) remain active, covering less than 10 km2, and are primarily north-facing. An additional 14 % (102 RGs) lack InSAR data but they are considered potentially active based on their orientation, altitude, and remarkable morphological features. The existence of active RGs at relatively low altitudes lowers the permafrost boundary between 2100 and 2600 m on north- and south-facing slopes, respectively. Despite the limitations of InSAR to measure displacements along the north-south axis and the fact that most active RGS are oriented to the north, according to the decomposition of the LOS displacement to vertical and horizontal components and LiDAR data, the ongoing subsidence and decline in horizontal movement related to ice degradation suggest a transition of many RGs from active to relict, marking rapid permafrost degradation. Finally, the EGMS has proven inadequate for detecting slow-moving active RGs in the Pyrenees due to temporal decorrelation caused by prolonged snow cover periods, particularly when compared to the combined use of SqueeSAR and airborne LiDAR datasets. The EGMS detected ground information for only 14 out of 89 active RGs, provided inaccurate kinematic data and underestimated the decomposed vertical and horizontal velocities by up to fourfold."

 Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) is a key indicator of photosynthetic activity and primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems. While moderate-coarse spatial resolution FAPAR products have enabled global vegetation studies, their pixel sizes smooth fine-scale heterogeneity and limit applications needing a detailed spatial characterization. Landsat provides multispectral data at 30 m spatial resolution enabling global and long-term FAPAR estimation at finer spatial detail. But challenges exist in deriving continuous Landsat FAPAR time series due to infrequent clear observations. We propose here a generic two-step method to produce gap-free Landsat FAPAR time series. First, in clear-sky conditions, FAPAR is retrieved from Landsat surface reflectance observations using a random forest (RF) regression model previously trained with the Global land surface satellite (GLASS) V6 FAPAR product. In a second step, a novel Bidirectional Temporal Convolutional Network with Sparrow Search Algorithm and Attention mechanism (SSA-BiTCN-Attention) was used to reconstruct the missing FAPAR values. The temporal information of Landsat clear-sky FAPAR within a five-year window was used for predicting the missing values. The reconstruction model accurately predicted missing FAPAR values across different land cover types with RMSE ranging from 0.08 to 0.12. The validation results showed a good agreement between the estimated Landsat FAPAR and ground measurements from VAlidation of Land European Remote Sensing Instruments (VALERI), ImagineS and Ground Based Observations for Validation (GBOV), with R2 values ranging from 0.82 to 0.92, RMSE values from 0.10 to 0.12, and bias values from 0.02 to 0.05. The Landsat retrievals are consistent with GLASS and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) FAPAR products and improve these two products in terms of accuracy and spatial resolution. As a demonstration case study, we applied our method to generate 30-m, 16-day FAPAR time series from 2013 to 2023 over China. The Landsat gap-free FAPAR product exhibits seamless spatial coverage and temporal continuity across China. This innovative method has the potential to be applied to multiple satellite data and land surface products to generate gap-free high spatio-temporal time series of land surface variables at the global scale, which will contribute in improving environmental modeling, carbon cycling studies, and agricultural applications."

 Using satellite radar interferometry, we investigate surface deformation in the Great Aletsch Glacier region from 2015 to 2021. By applying a statistical blind source separation method on displacement timeseries, our study reveals irreversible trends near large slope instabilities, potentially indicating slope responses to the glacier’s retreat. Moreover, annual cyclic deformation indicates significant pore pressure variations in fractured bedrock slopes resulting from groundwater storage and discharge processes. These spatial variations, assessed with satellite radars, reflect changes in pore pressure and rock mass hydromechanical properties, aligning with continuous ground monitoring data. This study demonstrates the potential of using satellite interferometry to investigate slope-scale mechanical processes driven by seasonal to multiannual environmental factors in complex alpine regions. It is the first timeseries synthetic aperture radar (TS-InSAR) study in a paraglacial environment validated by spatially distributed, high-resolution ground monitoring data. Moreover, it shows the advantages of the TS-InSAR high spatial coverage and its capacity to complement ground monitoring during data interruptions at ground stations. Combining satellite data with ground-based measurements and coherent structural hypotheses opens new possibilities for studying similarly remote and less instrumented regions."

 The European summer of 2022 was exceptionally warm in the historical record (since mid-19th century). We show that it was a record-breaking summer at European scales since at least 1500 due to three large-scale atmospheric heatwaves, all concurring with a prolonged dry period over Europe and an intense marine heatwave over the Mediterranean. We evaluate the role of dynamical (atmospheric circulation) and thermodynamical (regional soil moisture and western Mediterranean sea surface temperatures) drivers. Flow analogues of the June 2022 heatwave are used to reconstruct the expected temperatures under different combinations of these thermodynamical drivers and assess their separate and combined influences on the intensity of the event. Results show a measurable intensification of the heatwave event (of ∼1 °C) by both dry land and warm sea conditions. We also report asymmetric responses to their combined effects: the influence of warm waters on heatwave intensity is larger when accompanied by dry soils than when soils are wet."

 The motivation of this research is to contribute to the knowledge about the relationship between the occurrence of lightning and hydrometeors present in storms, through polarimetric observations with meteorological radar and the application of the semi-supervised methodology of Besic et al. (2016) for the classification of hydrometeors. The objective is to develop a linear regression equation that correlates the mass of hydrometeors with the lightning rate, through the lightning provided by the Earth Networks Total Lightning Network, commonly known as ENTLN, for part of the southeastern region of Brazil. For this, the Z-M relationship between the radar reflectivity and the amount of hydrometeor mass present in the radar volume was used to compare it with the lightning density rate. During the period from 2019 to 2022, it was observed that the reported hail precipitation events coincide with the precipitable graupel indicated through the classification of hydrometeors algorithm. In these events, the trend of ice mass over the hours was similar to that of the observed lightning. The results show a significant correlation between these two parameters for different regions with distinct land cover, urbanization and topography, including ocean. Demonstrating that it is possible to develop empirical equations to relate ice mass to lightning density rates. This approach can contribute to lightning assimilation techniques, aiding in nowcasting."

 From 2019 to 2022, there were a total of 34 sea fog events in the Bohai Sea, among which sea land breezes (SLB) occurred 17 times (accounting for 50 %). The duration of fog in the presence of SLB ranged from 24 to 40 h, while fog without SLB lasted between 3 and 7 h. The SLB circulation significantly increased the duration of sea fog. Therefore it's necessity to study the impacts of SLB on fog formation and dissipation of the Bohai Sea. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model could simulate meteorological elements well, showing good reliability. Sensitivity experiments were carried out using the WRF model on two different types of SLB-fog. The numeral simulation results are showed as follows. Under the influence of land breeze, the vertical cloud liquid water (CLW) content increased 0.016–0.7 g kg−1, the height of the boundary layer reduced 66.7 % ∼ 92.3 %, and temperature inversion layer was formed 0.5 km in the coastal and offshore areas of the Bohai Sea. Thus the sea fog was formed and the coastal fog intensity was enhanced affected by the land breeze. Under the influence of sea breeze, the height of the boundary layer increased 0.5–7 times and the temperature inversion layer disappeared or weakened in coastal cities. The influence of sea breeze on the transportation of CLW content was decreased 0.016–0.358 g kg−1. Under the combined influence of factors such as CLW, temperature inversion, and boundary layer height, the sea breeze caused large-scale dissipation of sea fog in the Bohai Sea or hindered the expansion of the fog area. Numeral simulation of a typical case indicated that the increased CLW content (0.016–0.07 g kg−1) under the influence of land breeze led to the formation of this sea fog. The intensity of the land breeze influenced the size of the fog area. In the near-surface layer of A Platform, the Richardson number (Ri) decreased 0.2–7.2 when affected by the sea breeze, which was conducive to the development of turbulence. The CLW content decreased by up to 0.71 g kg−1. Therefore, the sea fog dissipated over a large area in the Bohai Sea under the influence of sea breeze. These findings suggest that the mesoscale circulation of SLB played an important role when the large-scale meteorological conditions were relatively weak."

 Lightning development involves transient events that produce non-stationary, abrupt changes in lightning structure. The most prominent (and most studied) examples of reactivation of lightning side branches are recoil leaders that are initiated near the tips of previously decayed positive leader channels. This study proposes a numerical model that, among other things, takes into account evolution of channel temperature profile and is aimed at simulation the recoil leader inception. The model is based on the paradigm of reversal point meandering, which is a consequence of the macroscale asymmetry of development of positive and negative lightning poles. Simulation results allow one for the first time to formulate a physically-based and well-founded mechanism of a negative recoil leader initiation. In particular, it is shown that the channel reactivation is provided by the wave of electric field that starts from the branching point and propagates along a previously decayed (but still heated) leader channel when its per-unit-length resistance does not exceed several thousand Ohms per meter. This resistance corresponds to the channel temperature no less than ∼3500 K under equilibrium conditions. It is shown that channel reactivation starts somewhere between the branching point and the previously decayed leader tip, in agreement with observations. Additionally, the plasma chemical aspects of the leader channel reactivation are discussed."

 Understanding the variability of wet and dry spells in the West African Monsoon (WAM) is essential for improving climate prediction and resource management. Using in situ daily rainfall observations from five stations located within the Guinea Coast having at least 99.5 % data record and pass quality control checks. This study examines the characteristics, atmospheric precursors, and large-scale circulation patterns associated with wet and dry spells during the summer monsoon season (1982–2020). Results reveal significant spatial variability, with Port Harcourt recording the highest wet spell frequency (>5 %), longest duration (53.38 days), and largest rainfall contribution (35.83 %). In contrast, Tabligbo experiences the highest dry spell frequency (10.92 %) and longest duration (76.23 days), contributing only 0.46 % to total monsoonal rainfall due to its location in the Dahomey Gap. Composite analysis of 841 wet and 2188 dry spell days shows a dipole-like structure, where wet spells are linked to enhanced southwesterly winds, cyclonic circulation, and increased moisture transport over the Guinea Coast, while dry spells exhibit anomalous westerlies, moisture divergence, and reduced convection. Lead-lag analysis from five days before to six days after spell onset reveals that wet spells are preceded by easterly anomalies at 850 hPa, followed by strengthening southwesterlies at onset, which peak after the onset before weakening. In contrast, dry spells develop under enhanced westerlies, inhibiting convection before onset, with intensified easterlies exporting moisture offshore from the onset. Vertical wind structures further show that wet spells weaken the African Easterly Jet (AEJ) while strengthening the Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ), favoring deep convection, whereas dry spells is associated with deeper and stronger moisture depth that suppress convective development. These findings highlight the role of large-scale circulation in modulating regional wet and dry spells, emphasizing the need for long-term coordinated regional observations to improve monsoon forecasting, climate adaptation, and water resource management."

PINK1 is activated by mitochondrial damage to phosphorylate ubiquitin and Parkin, triggering mitophagy. PINK1 also indirectly phosphorylates Rab GTPases, such as Rab8A. Using an siRNA library targeting human Ser/Thr kinases in HeLa cells, we identified EIF2AK1 [heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) kinase], a branch of the integrated stress response (ISR), as a negative regulator of PINK1. EIF2AK1 knockdown enhances mitochondrial depolarization–induced PINK1 stabilization and phosphorylation of ubiquitin and Rab8A. These results were confirmed in SK-OV-3, U2OS, and ARPE-19 cells. Knockdown of DELE1, an activator of EIF2AK1, produced similar effects. Notably, the ISR inhibitor ISRIB also enhanced PINK1 activation. In human cells with mito-QC mitophagy reporters, EIF2AK1 knockdown or ISRIB treatment increased PINK1-dependent mitophagy without affecting deferiprone-induced mitophagy. These findings suggest that the DELE1-EIF2AK1 ISR pathway is a negative regulator of PINK1-dependent mitophagy.

Selective ablation of DCN glutamatergic neurons effectively eliminated aberrant cerebellar DCN outputs and alleviated dystonia attacks in bothPrrt2-associated and kainic acid–induced dystonia mouse models.

As compared to the single-channel offset pinhole and two-channel split-detector nonconfocal AOSLO designs, by providing multidirectional imaging capabilities, a recent generation of multidetector and (multi-)offset aperture AOSLO modalities has been demonstrated to provide critical information about retinal microstructures. However, increasing detection channels requires expensive optical components and/or critically increases imaging time. To address this issue, we present an innovative combination of machine learning and optics as an integrated technology to compressively capture 12 nonconfocal channel AOSLO images simultaneously. Imaging of healthy participants and diseased subjects using the proposed deep compressed multichannel AOSLO showed enhanced visualization of rods, cones, and mural cells with over an order-of-magnitude improvement in imaging speed as compared to conventional offset aperture imaging. To facilitate the adaptation and integration with other in vivo microscopy systems, we made optical design, acquisition, and computational reconstruction codes open source."

Recent studies have documented the efficient generation of spin torque using spin-orbit interactions (SOIs); however, SOI use relies on the employment of rare metals such as platinum. Here, we demonstrate that a nanometer-thick gradient from silicon to aluminum, which consists of readily available elements from earth resources, can produce a spin torque as large as that of platinum despite the weak SOI of these compositions. The spin torque efficiency can be improved by decreasing the thickness of the gradient, while a sharp interface was not found to increase the spin torque. Moreover, the electric conductivity of the gradient material can be up to twice as large as that of platinum, which provides a way to reduce Joule heating losses in spintronic devices."

Insect muscles display a remarkable functional diversity: they operate at extremely different contraction frequencies (ranging from ~1 to 1000 hertz) and amplitudes during flying, walking, and crawling. This is puzzling because sarcomeres are built from essentially the same actin-myosin components. Here, we address how functionally different sarcomeres are made. We show that the giant protein titin and the regulation of developmental contractility are key for the sarcomere specializations. I-band titin spans and determines the length of the sarcomeric I-band in a muscle type–specific manner. Unexpectedly, I-band titin also rules the length of the force-generating myosin filament using a feedback mechanism that is modulated by myosin contractility. We propose a model of how sarcomere specializations in insects are tuned, provide evidence for this model, and discuss its validity beyond insects."

While traditional Pavlovian conditioning studies have provided valuable insights, the exclusive reliance on electric shock as a threat stimulus has limited our understanding of diverse threats. To address this, we developed a conditioning paradigm using a looming visual stimulus as an unconditioned stimulus (US) in mice and identified a distinct neural circuit for visual threat conditioning. Parabrachial CGRP neurons were necessary for both conditioning and memory retrieval. Upstream neurons in the posterior insular cortex (pIC) responded to looming stimuli, and their projections to the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) induced aversive states and drove conditioning. However, this pIC-to-PBN pathway was not required for foot-shock conditioning. These findings reveal how non-nociceptive visual stimuli can drive aversive states and fear memory formation, expanding our understanding of aversive US processing beyond traditional models."

The electrostatic potential at the surface of the t-hBN substrate provides a simple way to confine excitons in the MoSe2monolayer. The excitons confined within the domains and at the domain walls are spectrally separated because of a pronounced Stark shift. Moreover, the patterned light emission can be dynamically controlled by electrically gating the ferroelectric domains, introducing a functionality beyond other semiconductor moiré superlattices.

Here, PCOS-like mice were generated using prenatal androgenization (PNA) with dihydrotestosterone, followed by a prepubertal high-fat (HF) or standard diet. In ovariectomized mice, PNA impaired uterine closure during the implantation window, disrupted decidualization, and altered extracellular matrix– and inflammation-related gene expression. The effects were aggravated by the HF diet. In naturally mated, ovary-intact mice, PNA and HF diet affected decidual and placental gene expression, suggestive of placental dysfunction and inflammation, and induced fetal growth restriction. This study underlines the role of the uterus in adverse pregnancy outcomes in PCOS and identifies possible underlying mechanisms for future studies.

Here, we uncover a hormonal cross-talk framework that orchestrates the age-related balance between plant growth and herbivore defense. We demonstrate that the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA), synthesized byNicotiana benthamianaphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 6 (NbPAL6), dictates insect resistance in adult plants.NbPAL6expression is driven by the key transcription factor, NbMYB42, which is regulated by two interacting auxin response factors, NbARF18La/b. In juvenile plants, higher auxin levels activateNbmiR160c, a microRNA that simultaneously silencesNbARF18La/b, subsequently reducingNbMYB42expression, lowering SA accumulation, and thus weakening herbivore defense. Excessive SA in juvenile plants enhances defense but antagonizes auxin signaling, impairing early growth. Our findings suggest a seesaw-like model that balances growth and defense depending on the plant’s developmental stage."

This coordination is particularly critical in crowded tissues, such as pseudostratified epithelia (PSE) that are often found as organ precursors. They are composed of elongated epithelial cells with densely packed nuclei aligned along the apicobasal axis. While cell cycle–dependent nuclear movements in PSE are well studied, less is known about how nuclear packing influences tissue morphogenesis. To investigate this, we analyzed nuclear shapes, sizes, and neighborhood statistics in zebrafish neuroepithelia, focusing on the retinal PSE. We found that nuclei exhibit elongated shapes and biaxial nematic-like orientational order but remain positionally disordered. During retinal development, nuclear packing density increases, approaching theoretical limits. This occurs when the tissue transitions to a laminated structure and nuclear shapes are remodeled. Timely neurogenesis is critical as failure to initiate neurogenesis leads to tissue deformations. These findings highlight the influence of nuclear shape and positioning for organ morphogenesis."

Exogenous arachidonic acid supplementation combined with PSMD14 knockdown induced synthetic lethality, which was further confirmed in TNBC organoid (PDO) and TNBC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models. Overall, our findings reveal an oncogenic role of PSMD14 in TNBC progression, which indicates a potential biomarker and ferroptosis-mediated therapeutic strategy for TNBC."

Besides conventional observations, target observations are essential to further improve initial field accuracy and then increasing high‐impact weather event forecasting skills. The identification of the sensitive area, where the additional observations should be deployed, is the key to implementing target observations. In this paper, a sensitive area identification system is established for the FuXi model on the basis of FuXi‐En4DVar, based on the fully nonlinear method of conditional nonlinear optimal perturbation (CNOP). The CNOP represents the optimally growing initial perturbation and can be calculated by using the adjoint of numerical models in numerical forecast models, but in the AI‐based FuXi model, it is solved by directly using the automatic differential algorithm embedded in the FuXi model. Such an approach of calculating CNOP significantly increases the computational efficiency. Applying this system to the forecasts of 11 TCs demonstrates that the additional target observations can significantly improve TC track forecast skills, as compared with the other additional observations. Moreover, a small number of additional target observations can be expected to achieve the forecast skill comparable to, or even surpassing to, that obtained by tens of times more observations. This validation shows the potential of applying dynamical CNOP to AI‐based model for highly effectively identifying the sensitive area for target observations associated with TC forecasting."

Recent observations show KHI forming with misaligned or angled billow segments that develop connecting vortex tubes and knots (T&K); these features promote distinctive, event‐defining instability and mixing characteristics that were not accounted for in prior idealized studies. Though T&K have been shown to increase mixing in KHI events with low Richardson numbers (Ri), their influence in weakly KH‐unstable, less‐idealized environments is unknown. Here we present modeling results of KHI in the stratosphere to assess the impact of T&K dynamics in weakly KH‐unstable environments. Radiosonde wind and temperature profiles from 22 February 2006 near Lamont, Oklahoma, measured vertically offset shear and stability peaks near 16.2 km with a minimum Ri = 0.11. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of this event reveal decreasing shear and increasing stratification, where Ri increases to 0.2 as the shear and stratification peaks move to a common altitude. The resulting KHI exhibit T&K features forming adjacent to, and in superposition with, secondary convective instabilities (CI) rather than superseding them as in prior T&K studies with Ri = 0.05. Newly discovered “crankshaft” instabilities distort the billows and give rise to secondary KHI with delayed, elevated dissipation. KHI that exhibit T&K dynamics are found to accumulate ∼60 ${\sim} 60$% greater mixing than axially uniform KHI with equal or lower mixing efficiency. The substantial increase in mixing suggests significant contributions of T&K dynamics to KHI events throughout the atmosphere that remain unaddressed in general circulation models' turbulence parameterizations."

This theory suggests that CCKWs are enhanced through a positive feedback loop between stratiform heating and temperature. We aimed to minimize contamination from large‐scale environmental influences by employing the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model configured for tropical channel simulations with spectral nudging. We assessed three distinct cumulus parameterization schemes: Grell‐Freitas (GF), Multi‐scale Kain‐Fritsch (MSKF), and New Tiedtke (NTDK). Our analysis revealed that the NTDK scheme simulates the strongest CCKW signal, whereas the GF and MSKF schemes exhibit weaker signals. The vertical‐mode decomposition of diabatic heating and temperature identified two prominent modes corresponding to deep convection and stratiform precipitation. The results demonstrated that NTDK shows the most favorable conditions for CCKW enhancement, characterized by substantial contributions from the second mode of heating and temperature anomalies. These aspects underline the critical role of cumulus parameterization for the enhancement of CCKWs, highlighting the importance of accurately representing stratiform instability to reduce deficiencies in CCKW modeling."

The recent extreme drought years in Germany, which resulted in multi‐sectoral impacts accounting to combined drought and heat damages of 35 billion Euros and large scale forest losses, underline the relevance of studying future changes in SM droughts. To analyze the projected SM drought changes and associated uncertainties in Germany, we utilize a large ensemble of 57 bias‐adjusted and spatially disaggregated regional climate model simulations to run the hydrologic model mHM at a high spatial resolution of approximately 1.2 km. We show that projections of future changes in soil moisture droughts over Germany depend on the emission scenario, the soil depth and the timing during the vegetation growing period. Most robust and widespread increases in soil moisture drought intensities are projected for upper soil layers in the late growing season (July–September) under the high emission scenario. There are greater uncertainties in the changes in soil moisture droughts in the early vegetation growing period (April–June).

Aquifers with variability dominated by seasonal (marked annual cycle) or low‐frequency variations (interannual to decadal variations driven by large‐scale climate dynamics) may encounter different sensitivities to climate change. We investigated this hypothesis by generating groundwater level projections using deep learning models for annual, inertial (low‐frequency dominated) or mixed annual/low‐frequency aquifer types in northern France from 16 CMIP6 climate model inputs in an ensemble approach. Generated projections were then analyzed for trends and changes in variability. Generally, groundwater levels tended to decrease for all types and scenarios across 2030–2100 without any significant differences between emission scenarios. However, when comparing future projections to historical data, groundwater levels appeared slightly higher in the near future (2030–2050), with decreasing intensities in later periods. The variability of projections showed slightly increasing variability for annual types for all scenarios but decreasing variability for mixed and inertial types. As the severity of the scenario increased, more mixed and inertial‐type stations appeared to be affected by decreasing variability. Focusing on low‐frequency confirmed this observation: while a significant amount of stations showed increasing variability for the less severe SSP2‐4.5 scenario, low‐frequency variability eventually showed slight yet statistically significant decreasing trends as the severity of the scenario increased. For the most severe scenario, almost all stations were affected by decreasing low‐frequency variability."

 Experimental stroke models in rodents are essential for mechanistic studies and therapeutic development. However, these models have several limitations negatively impacting their translational relevance. Here we aimed to develop a minimally invasive thrombotic stroke model through magnetic particle delivery that does not require craniotomy, is amenable to reperfusion therapy, can be combined with in vivo imaging modalities, and can be performed in awake mice. We found that the model results in reproducible cortical infarcts within the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory with cytologic and immune changes similar to that observed with more invasive distal MCA occlusion models. Importantly, the injury produced by the model was ameliorated by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration. We also show that MCA occlusion in awake animals results in bigger ischemic lesions independent of day/night cycle. Magnetic particle delivery had no overt effects on physiologic parameters and systemic immune biomarkers.

 Protein synthesis in natural cells involves intricate interactions between chemical environments, protein-protein interactions, and protein machinery. Replicating such interactions in artificial and cell-free environments can control the precision of protein synthesis, elucidate complex cellular mechanisms, create synthetic cells, and discover new therapeutics. Yet, creating artificial synthesis environments, particularly for membrane proteins, is challenging due to the poorly defined chemical-protein-lipid interactions.

It captures the interdependent impact of lipid types, chemical environments, chaperone proteins, and protein structures on membrane protein synthesis. As a result, MEMPLEX creates new artificial environments that successfully synthesize membrane proteins of broad interest but previously intractable. In addition, we identify a quantitative metric, based on the hydrophobicity of the membrane-contacting amino acids, that predicts membrane protein synthesis in artificial environments.

Here, the authors show that anti-Müllerian hormone (Amh)-mediated signaling sustains molecular clock oscillations in the pituitary gland, thereby maintaining circadian homeostasis at both tissue and systemic levels. 
 Circadian clocks temporally orchestrate the behavioural and physiological rhythms. The core molecules establishing the circadian clock are clear; however, the critical signalling pathways that cause or favour the homeostasis are poorly understood. Here, we report that anti-Müllerian hormone (Amh)-mediated signalling plays an important role in sustaining circadian homeostasis in zebrafish. Notably, amh knockout dampens molecular clock oscillations and disrupts both behavioural and hormonal circadian rhythms, which are recapitulated in bmpr2a null mutants. Somatotropes and gonadotropes are identified as Amh-targeted pituitary cell populations. Single-cell transcriptome analysis further reveals a lineage-specific regulation of pituitary clock by Amh. Moreover, Amh-induced effect on clock gene expression can be abolished by blocking Smad1/5/9 phosphorylation and bmpr2a knockout. Mechanistically, Amh binds to its receptors, Bmpr2a/Bmpr1bb, which in turn activate Smad1/5/9 by phosphorylation and promote circadian gene expression. Our findings reveal a key hormone signalling pathway for circadian homeostasis in zebrafish with implications for rhythmic organ functions and circadian health.

 Manipulating floating objects, whether solid or liquid, from microscopic to mesoscopic sizes, is crucial in various microfluidics and microfabrication applications. While capillary menisci naturally self-assemble and transport floating particles, their shapes and sizes are limited by the properties of the fluid and the objects involved. We herein harness the superposition of capillary menisci to curve liquid interfaces controllably. By using 3D-printed spines piercing the interface, we can finely adjust height gradients across the liquid surface to create specific liquid topographies. Thus, our method becomes a powerful tool for manipulating floating objects into programmable paths. Combining experimental demonstrations, numerical simulations, and theoretical modeling, we study the liquid elevation created by specific spine dispositions and the three-dimensional manipulation of submillimetric particles. Multiple examples showcase the method’s potential applications, including sorting and capturing particles, which could pave the way for cleaning fluid interfaces.

 Managing water resources in alpine, cold regions is increasingly complicated by climate change, which alters streamflow patterns and poses significant challenges to resource sustainability. This study addresses the critical issue of understanding how distinct hydrological watersheds respond to these climatic shifts. By examining four watersheds (BRW, the Burqin River Watershed; MRW, the Manas River Watershed; URW, the Urumqi River Watershed, and HRW, the Hotan River Watershed) with varying streamflow recharged characteristics, long-term streamflow was constructed by the SWAT model and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) to evaluate the key climatic drivers of streamflow characteristics. Over the past 60 years, streamflow in typical watersheds has generally increased, with more frequent alternation between wet and dry periods. Notably, abrupt changes predominantly occurred in the 1990s, and these changes have shown a progressive delay as one moves geographically from north to south. Cold-season precipitation provides crucial solid water resources for alpine watersheds, with glacier melt driven by minimum and summer temperatures, while precipitation dominates other recharge systems. Future scenarios predict a significant increase in URW streamflow (approximately 18.3 %-25.8 %), while other watersheds are expected to see more moderate increases (around 4.6 %-12.9 %). Anticipated seasonal shifts include an earlier onset of streamflow advancing from April to March in the BRW, and delayed streamflow shifting to June in the HRW. Under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, the BRW shows a decrease in late summer and early autumn streamflow, while the URW may become increasingly dependent on rainfall, indicating a potential temperature threshold for streamflow changes. The earlier onset of spring snowmelt, combined with increased streamflow and reduced summer precipitation, heightens the risk of spring floods and summer droughts. Building emergency storage and adopting dynamic seasonal water allocation can reduce the impacts of streamflow changes and boost climate resilience."

 Accurately estimating evapotranspiration (ET), gross primary productivity (GPP), and winter wheat yield (WWY) is of great significance for climate change research, agricultural development, and water resources management in the cultivation regions of winter wheat. In this study, the coupling strategy of the Noah-MP land surface model and the multi-pass land data assimilation scheme (MLDAS) has been adopted to simulate the water-carbon fluxes and yield within the winter wheat-covered area in the Haihe River Basin (HRB). Utilizing the crop and irrigation modules embedded within the Noah-MP model, in conjunction with a double-variable assimilation approach encompassing leaf area index (LAI) and surface soil moisture (SSM), this study designed four schemes: Open Loop (OL), Open Loop with Irrigation (OL_IRR), Data Assimilation (DA), and Data Assimilation with Irrigation (DA_IRR). Validation results at both field and regional scales revealed that all schemes possess the capability to reasonably simulate spatiotemporal distributions for water-carbon fluxes (ET and GPP) and WWY to a certain extent. Through integrating multi-source observations, data assimilation schemes (DA and DA_IRR) outperformed open loop schemes (OL and OL_IRR). Notably, DA_IRR exhibited the most significant improvement, with reductions in root mean square deviation (RMSD) relative to the OL scheme as follows: 73.57 % for LAI (compared to a baseline RMSD of 0.88 m2/m2), 41.60 % for SSM (compared to 0.05 m3/m3), 54.99 % for root-zone soil moisture (RZSM) (compared to 0.08 m3/m3), 14.98 % for ET (OL: 1.22 mm/day), 35.42 % for GPP (OL: 4.24 g/m2/day), and 67.23 % for WWY (OL: 518.10 kt). Meanwhile, this study found that while irrigation slightly improves simulation results (e.g., a 21.19 % RMSE reduction for RZSM with OL_IRR), its effect is less significant than data assimilation. This highlights the potential for additional utilization of the integration approach involving the Noah-MP model and the MLDAS methodology to winter wheat cropland ecosystems, as demonstrated in this investigation."

 Accurate geospatial extent data of photovoltaic (PV) power plants is essential for assessing their socioeconomic benefits and environmental impacts. However, existing semantic segmentation models often result in over-smoothed edges and the inaccurate delineation of PV power plants. To address these limitations, we proposed a novel edge-enhanced Segment Anything Model (ESAM) tailored for PV power plant extraction. It is designed as a multi-task network that integrates three key components: semantic segmentation, edge detection, and semantic and edge fusion. The semantic model leverages a modified Segment Anything Model (SAM) foundation model to extract semantic features of PV power plants. An edge module is developed to improve the edge delineation ability of ESAM. Additionally, a learning-based fusion module is designed to combine semantic and edge information to enhance PV power plant identifications. Validation demonstrates that ESAM achieved a high overall accuracy (OA = 98.46 %). Meanwhile, it outperformed three state-of-the-art models by providing higher accuracy metrics and more accurate edges of PV power plants.

 In recent years, research on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) target detection based on deep learning methods has made substantial progress in model accuracy. However, there are still limitations related to model size and computational complexity, which makes it challenging to deploy the model on edge devices, limiting its practical application. To this end, this paper proposes an automatic pruning method for SAR target detection models based on multitask reinforcement learning called SARRLP. First, an automatic grouping strategy (GSP) for a deep learning SAR target-detection model network structure is designed. The network structure of the model is coupled with groups, and the same group has a unified pruning layout. The coupled groups are sorted according to the maximum entropy principle to achieve end-to-end pruning of the SAR target detection model. Second, an automatic pruning strategy search method based on multitask reinforcement learning (RLAS) is designed. This method automatically searches for the best pruning strategy for each network structure, and an entropy-based multitask reward function MOR is constructed to guide RLAS in searching for the optimal pruning strategy considering the edge accuracy, sparsity, and model feature channels entropy. Experimental results based on SSDD and HRSID show that the SARRLP method can achieve automatic optimal pruning detection models. With YOLOv5s as the baseline and a pruning rate of 75%, the accuracy of the SSDD and HRSID datasets is reduced by 0/0.4, and the inference speed increases by 184.4/106.2 images per second."

 Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from hyperspectral imaging is strongly associated with agricultural indices, particularly leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), in crop phenotyping. However, confounding factors such as spectral resolution (SR), canopy structure, and illumination reduce SIF sensitivity and complicate its association with these indices. This study focused on examining the effect of SR and mitigating the influence of canopy structure and illumination to enhance SIF accuracy. This study employed theoretical simulations, experimental validation, and two field experiments comparing devices with varying SRs to extract SIF at 687 nm and 761 nm (SIFRed and SIFNIR). Initially, SCOPE model was used to simulate radiance trends across different SRs. Secondly, narrow-band imager with 7 nm full width at half maximum (FWHM) were then compared with radiance from sub-nanometer and ASD spectrometers (0.3 nm and 3 nm FWHM). Finally, to modify SIF measurements, canopy structure was quantified using fluorescence escape fraction (fesc), while absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) and intensity component from hue-saturation-intensity color model (IHSI) were used to account for illumination. And driver factor for SIF extraction was explored. Results showed a strong relationship (R2 ≥ 0.95) between original simulated radiance from sub-nanometer spectrometers and radiance resampled to 3, 5, and 7 nm FWHM. SIFNIR from the narrow-band imager correlated with the other spectrometers (R ≥ 0.64). While lower SR reduced SIF sensitivity, the narrow-band imager still showed potential for estimating LCC. Modified SIFNIR by fesc, APAR, and IHSI, improved correlations with LCC (R = 0.77, 0.74, and 0.86) compared to unmodified SIFNIR (R = 0.65). Estimation model based on SIF modified by fesc, APAR and IHSI presented RP2 of 0.73, 0.75, 0.84 and outperformed SIF (RP2 = 0.52), and photosynthetically active radiation and APAR showed R of 0.52 and 0.72 with SIFNIR, which indicated that disentangling confounding factors could enhance the sensitivity of SIF and structural effect governed SIF strongly than illumination effect. This study demonstrated the feasibility of narrow-band imagers for capturing spatial–temporal SIF variability by addressing confounding factors and can provide guidance for narrow-band instrument development for SIF extraction."

 Soil salinization is one of the main causes of low yield in cotton fields, leading to soil compaction and significantly affecting crop growth and nutrient absorption. There is an urgent need for rapid, non-destructive, and efficient methods to extract soil salinity spatial distribution information under cover conditions. These methods are essential for optimizing irrigation techniques, controlling salinization, and promoting sustainable agriculture. To address these issues, this study proposes a method combining unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral remote sensing data with a particle swarm optimization Gaussian process regression (PSO-GPR) model. Fractional-order differentiation (FOD) technology was used for spectral preprocessing, combined with the random frog algorithm (RF), uninformative variable elimination (UVE), and bootstrap soft shrinkage (BOSS) selection algorithms to optimize one-dimensional spectral bands. By integrating it with the optimal two-dimensional and three-dimensional indices, a PSO-GPR model will be developed to accurately predict soil salinity during the cotton emergence and squaring periods. The results indicate: (1) SG smoothing and FOD technology effectively enhanced the spectral characteristics of cotton field soils and crop canopies. (2) The soil salinity prediction model constructed using 0.7-order FOD combined with the BOSS algorithm yields the best performance, with an R2 of 0.92, RMSE of 0.15 dS m−1, and RPD of 3.54 on the test set.

 This paper describes a novel approach that uses Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery to identify river sections with persistent, stable, high-flow water. Such sections represent candidate sites for the generation of green electricity through the deployment of hydrokinetic turbines. Canada-wide mapping of potential hydrokinetic turbine sites requires Earth Observation satellite technology. The application of SAR satellites is advantageous because of their capacity to acquire high-quality images independent of weather and light conditions. Our SAR image approach includes two classifiers. The first identifies whitewater river sections in images acquired during summer. The second uses images acquired during winter to identify river ice and open water. Both classifiers are developed using a machine-learning algorithm that identifies classification thresholds in a multidimensional space made up of advanced SAR image parameters. The whitewater classifier makes use of backscatter and image texture parameters to achieve 92.6% accuracy. The ice–water classifier makes use of backscatter in two polarizations and a polarimetric decomposition to achieve 89.0% accuracy. In combination, the classes identified enable the mapping of river sections with persistent, stable, high-flow water, i.e., candidate hydrokinetic turbine sites.

 Droughts are hydrometeorological extreme events influenced by highly intricate land–atmosphere feedback mechanisms and climate variability. Deep learning models have recently succeeded in detecting extreme climate events and promise to uncover and understand droughts further. There are two main challenges of reliability and trustworthiness limiting their applications: miscalibration and inherent uncertainty. However, they remain rarely explored because deep learning models are overparameterized and seldom tractable. To address this shortcoming, we introduce methodologies for model calibration and entropy-based uncertainty quantification for deep learning-based drought detection. The calibration algorithm can deal with calibration errors by reducing distributional shifts and alleviating overconfident predictions. The uncertainty framework, in turn, decomposes and quantifies the total uncertainty according to several components: data uncertainty, procedural variability, parametric variability, and latent variability. Thus, our method identifies uncertain predictions and supports robust evaluations, benefiting the credibility of the decision-making process. Empirical evidence of performance in a wide range of European drought events is given, justifying the effectiveness of our approach. The calibration methodology yields the lowest expected calibration error (0.31%) and the precision of the uncertainty-based decision-making is improved from 72.27% to 74.06% and 76.59%, based on ensemble predictions and rejecting the predictions for the top 20% uncertain negative samples, respectively. In summary, our approach significantly enhances drought detection’s reliability and classification accuracy, constituting a key step toward more trustworthy and actionable climate decision-making."

The chemical composition of the PM10 dataset was analyzed to assess changes in both natural sources and the effects of regulations and mitigation measures on PM10 and its precursors.

 Deposition of reactive nitrogen causes detrimental environmental effects, including biodiversity loss, eutrophication, and soil acidification. Measuring and modelling the biosphere–atmosphere exchange of ammonia, the most abundant reduced nitrogen species, is complex due to its high reactivity and solubility, often leading to systematic discrepancies between model predictions and observations. This study aims to determine whether three state-of-the-art exchange schemes for NH3 can accurately model NH3 exchange in a dune ecosystem (Solleveld) and detect factors causing the uncertainties in these schemes. The selected schemes are DEPAC (DEPosition of Acidifying Compounds) by van Zanten et al. (2010) and the schemes by Massad et al. (2010) and Zhang et al. (2010). Validation against 1 year of gradient flux measurements revealed that the Zhang scheme represented the NH3 deposition at Solleveld best, whereas the DEPAC scheme overestimated the total deposition, while the Massad scheme underestimated the total deposition. Yet none of these schemes captured the emission events at Solleveld, pointing to considerable uncertainty in the compensation point parameterization and possibly in the modelling of NH3 desorption processes from wet surface layers. The sensitivity analysis further reinforced these results, showing how uncertainty in essential model parameters in the external resistance (Rw) and compensation point parameterization propagated into diverging model outcomes. These outcomes underscore the need to improve our mechanistic understanding of surface equilibria represented by compensation points, including the adsorption–desorption mechanism at the external water layer, and specific recommendations are provided for future modelling approaches and measurement setups to support this goal."

The newest and most promising involves nitridation, but available methods for nitridation are not environmentally sustainable processes. Here, we demonstrate that mechanochemical molten-salt-assisted synthesis can be an effective method to produce surface-nitridated ZVI (sN-ZVI). This modification promoted the dechlorination rate of ZVI by up to 82-fold toward chlorinated ethenes and chloroform (CF). Enhanced conductivity of the nitridated shell boosts outward electron transfer from the iron core, while the exposed iron nitrides are efficient in activating the C–Cl bond of both trichloroethene and chloroform and facilitate electron-transfer-mediated C–Cl cleavage with an energy barrier of 0.20 eV, lower than that of iron oxides (0.78 eV). More importantly, sN-ZVI minimizes side hydrogen evolution and promotes deep dechlorination, thus preventing the formation of any toxic chlorinated intermediates, even in the case of highly chlorinated carbons such as tetrachloroethene and chloroform. sN-ZVI maintains its dechlorination performance even after 100 days of water aging, highlighting its great potential for field remediation applications."

In this study, we discovered amide-based precursors from an electrochemical fluorination (ECF) AFFF, specifically, N-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)-perfluoroalkylamides (PFAAAm or AmPr-FAAd), can transform into perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) when AFFF solutions or individual PFAS were exposed to concrete. This transformation was attributed to alkaline hydrolysis driven by leaching of Ca(OH)2 from concrete, which raises the solution pH. In the same experiments, the generation of perfluoroalkyl sulfonamides (FASAs) was also observed, but their precursors remained unidentified. Meanwhile, during the validation of PFAS extraction methods from AFFF-contaminated concrete powder, PFCAs and FASAs were similarly generated during the pre-equilibration step, further confirming the occurrence of hydrolysis. Further investigations using four sulfonamide-based precursors suggested that their rapid decrease in aqueous concentration was likely due to low solubility and sorption to container walls and concrete powder, rather than chemical transformation, which suggests the relatively high stability of these perfluoroalkyl sulfonamide precursors. The exact precursors to FASAs remain unresolved, highlighting the need for research into PFAS behavior in concrete."

Here, we analyze historical data, land surface model warming experiments, and climate projections across three major WUS river basins. We find that runoff loss become less sensitive to warming as snowpack shrinks, stemming from reduced snowmelt‐radiation feedback, a consequence of smaller snow‐cover changes and shifts in snowmelt timing to lower‐energy periods. Near‐linear projected warming with time (IPCC SSP245) exhibit a stable, possibly decelerating decline in runoff ratios. Although decelerating runoff declines do not eliminate broader water‐management challenges under continued warming, our findings complement the view that snowmelt‐radiation feedback drives runoff decline by highlighting the negative feedback from a shrinking snowpack on runoff warming sensitivity. Our findings should facilitate more comprehensive future water supply assessments in snow‐affected regions."

Entrained frost vapourizes to fluidize flows, allowing them to behave similarly to wet debris flows on Earth. The slopes where present‐day flows erode and deposit provide insights into the landforms that many such flows could create. The shallowest slopes eroded by the flows are similar to slopes at existing channel mouths, and the most mobile flows reach final slopes similar to the outer reaches of existing gully aprons. This is consistent with formation of gullies entirely by CO2 frost‐driven flows, assuming their intensity and frequency varies in space and time.

In contrast, a number of AEs radiated even at stresses much less than the previous maximum stress (i.e., breakdown of the memory effect) as a result of a 1‐hr annealing treatment at 1250 K before each reloading cycle. These observations are explained by the accumulation/release of back stress in olivine crystals. Due to sluggish release of back stress in olivine, the stress memory effect could be effective under the pressure‐temperature conditions of subducting slabs."

The region experiences cooling before the 1st min, which then shifts to a warming trend. The hailstorms with different intensity showed discrepant temporal evolutions. Generally, the large hail has lower minimum cloud‐top temperature (CTT), higher maximum cloud‐top height (CTH) and stronger updraft than the small hail. Cloud‐top properties also exhibit variations across different seasons, with winter demonstrating earlier occurrences of minimum CTT and maximum CPS. Spatially, the grid with minimum CTT and maximum CTH firstly moves southeastward and then moves northeastward.

Conversely, the premonsoon phase is marked by a higher concentration of large raindrops, primarily driven by strong aggregation and vigorous convective activity. Our results reveal that mixed‐phase processes dominate the precipitation microphysics in this region with substantial implications for understanding the underlying mechanisms that govern precipitation variability in high‐altitude environments. The interplay between atmospheric dynamics and microphysical processes is crucial in shaping the DSD, highlighting the importance of considering both factors in precipitation modeling.

An alternative approach to examining precipitation involves the use of synoptic air masses, which provide a multivariate perspective. The gridded weather typing classification (GWTC‐2) is a synoptic weather typing and air mass classification scheme that captures the holistic nature of weather at any given time and location. This study examined the association between precipitation and GWTC‐2 air masses (AMs) on regional to global scales—marking the first use of the GWTC‐2 AMs in precipitation studies. Although regional differences exist, land precipitation is better modulated by AMs than oceanic precipitation. There is a noticeably weaker association between AMs and tropical precipitation than extratropical precipitation, with extratropical regions showing up to 60% of summer precipitation variability explained. Regarding individual air mass influences, humid warm AMs show a surprisingly poor correlation with land precipitation, likely because water vapor does not increase linearly with increasing land temperatures. Also, compared to the other two humid AMs, humid cool AMs contribute five times more precipitation in deserts. More interestingly, the frontal AMs, defined to capture migrating extratropical cyclones, are strongly associated with tropical precipitation and capture the West African monsoon remarkably well. The association between GWTC‐2 AMs and precipitation has potential applicability in ensemble precipitation forecasting and downscaling GCM simulations of daily precipitation."

The precise prediction of heavy rainfall hinges upon a comprehensive understanding and accurate representation of UCG dynamics. This study investigates the characteristics of pre‐summer UCG at coastal South China (CSC), and uncovers noteworthy diurnal and land‐sea disparities in UCG at CSC. Convective cells initiated over land tend to grow upscale during the daytime, whereas those triggered over sea surface are more likely to develop at night. Compared with convection initiation, which is closely associated with boundary‐layer convergence, UCG relies upon large‐scale deep vertical motion in the atmosphere. Environmental dynamic conditions play a dominant role in promoting the UCGs at CSC. The key environmental factors include low‐level jet, low‐level vortex/shearline, mid‐level westerly jet, and vertical wind shear. Nocturnal convective cells triggered over the sea surface demonstrate the greatest likelihoods of upscale growth due to the lower prerequisites for additional environmental conditions for their upscale developments. The MCSs stemming from these convective cells generate the lightest rainfall among all MCSs initiated at CSC. Conversely, daytime convective cells initiated over sea surface and nocturnal convections initiated over land, particularly the former, necessitate exceptionally favorable environmental conditions for their developments, and thus exhibit low probability to grow upscale.

Machine learning reveals stable neural markers in mesolimbic, striatal, and cortical regions, plus facial cues, enabling reliable pain detection in naturalistic settings. 
 Pain remains poorly understood in task-free contexts, limiting our understanding of its neurobehavioral basis in naturalistic settings. Here, we use a multimodal, data-driven approach with intracranial electroencephalography, pain self-reports, and facial expression analysis to study acute pain in twelve epilepsy patients under continuous neural and audiovisual monitoring. Using machine learning, we successfully decode individual participants’ high versus low pain states from distributed neural activity, involving mesolimbic regions, striatum, and temporoparietal cortex. Neural representation of pain remains stable for hours and is modulated by pain onset and relief. Objective facial expressions also classify pain states, concordant with neural findings. Importantly, we identify transient periods of momentary pain as a distinct naturalistic acute pain measure, which can be reliably discriminated from affect-neutral periods using neural and facial features.

Here, authors present an antiferroelectric transistor utilizing synergic polarization switching and charge trapping dynamics to perform multiple neuromorphic functions. 
 The growing demand for energy- and area-efficient emulation of biological nervous systems has fueled significant interest in neuromorphic computing. A promising strategy to achieve compact and efficient neuromorphic functionalities lies in the integration of volatile and non-volatile memory functions. However, implementing these functions is challenging due to the fundamentally distinct physical mechanisms. Traditional ferroelectric materials, with their stable polarization, are ideal for emulating biological synaptic functions but their non-volatile nature conflicts with the short-term memory necessary for neuron-like behavior. Here, we report the design for antiferroelectric gating in two-dimensional channel transistors, incorporating antiferroelectricity with charge trapping dynamics. By tuning the area ratio of the Metal-(Anti-)Ferroelectric-Metal-Insulator-Semiconductor (MFMIS) gate stacks, we enable selective reconfiguration of intrinsic volatile antiferroelectric switching and non-volatile switching-assisted charge trapping/de-trapping, thereby achieving both short- and long-term plasticity. This allows the integration of complementary functionalities of artificial neurons and synapses within a single device platform. Additionally, we further demonstrate synaptic and neuronal functions for implementing unsupervised learning rules and spiking behavior in spiking neural networks. This approach holds great potential for advancing both foundational materials design and technology for neuromorphic hardware applications.

This global synthesis refines greenhouse gas estimates for climate policy and reporting. 
 Conserving blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs) has gained international attention in climate change mitigation, reflected in United Nations policies and voluntary carbon-offset projects. These efforts assume significant and uniform losses of soil organic carbon (Corg) throughout the top meter following disturbances, yet this assumption lacks robust empirical support. Here, we synthesized 239 paired observations of intact and disturbed BCEs globally. Soil Corg stock losses in the top meters vary widely: from −68.4% (agricultural conversion, ±13.4%, 95% confidence interval) to +0.8% (harvesting, ±46.2%) in mangroves, −25.9% (climate/hydrological change, ± 30.7%) to +48.6% (grazing, ±78.7%) in saltmarshes, and −34.2% (vegetation cover damage, ±22.4%) to −27.4% (dredging, ±33.6%) in seagrasses. Extensive disturbances deplete Corg down to 50–200 cm, while limited disturbances impact only the top 10–30 cm or resulted in negligible losses. This refinement contributes to improved global inventories of greenhouse gas emissions from BCEs, supporting abatement policy settings for nationally determined contributions commitments.

 Although EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are effective for EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), resistance inevitably develops through diverse mechanisms, including secondary genetic mutations, amplifications and as-yet undefined processes. To comprehensively unravel the mechanisms of EGFR-TKI resistance, we establish a biobank of patient-derived EGFR-mutant lung cancer organoids, encompassing cases previously treated with EGFR-TKIs. Through comprehensive molecular profiling including single-cell analysis, here we identify a subgroup of EGFR-TKI-resistant LUAD organoids that lacks known resistance-related genetic lesions and instead exhibits a basal-shift phenotype characterized by the hybrid expression of LUAD- and squamous cell carcinoma-related genes. Prospective gene engineering demonstrates that NKX2-1 knockout induces the basal-shift transformation along with EGFR-target therapy resistance. Basal-shift LUADs frequently harbor CDKN2A/B loss and are sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Our EGFR-mutant lung cancer organoid library not only offers a valuable resource for lung cancer research but also provides insights into molecular underpinnings of EGFR-TKI resistance, facilitating the development of therapeutic strategies.

 Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw is a rare but serious condition in which the jawbone fails to heal and becomes necrotic, typically after dental surgery in patients treated with bisphosphonates. However, clear evidence guiding how long bisphosphonate treatment should be paused before dental surgery remains limited. Here we show that a longer time since the last dose of intravenous bisphosphonate is associated with a reduced risk of jawbone necrosis. Using a nationwide retrospective cohort of 152,299 older adults diagnosed with osteoporosis, we analyze the relationship between the duration of bisphosphonate discontinuation prior to dental extraction and the occurrence of osteonecrosis of the jaw. We find that the risk is substantially lower when treatment is paused for more than 90 days, and lowest when the pause exceeds one year. The risk reduction appears more consistent with ibandronate, whereas with zoledronate, only pauses longer than one year show a meaningful association. These findings underscore the potential value of personalized prevention strategies based on bisphosphonate type.

 This study investigates the climatological and interdecadal (1980–2024) variations in summer (June–August) circulation over the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East (EMME) using ERA5 global atmospheric reanalysis. The EMME summer climate is governed by the evolution of several key atmospheric circulation features: (1) High mean sea level pressure over the eastern Mediterranean (EM), along with a thermal low over the Arabian Peninsula (AP) and, (2) strong subsidence and downward advection of temperature in mid-troposphere centered over the EM, stretching into northern parts of Africa and AP. Diabatic heating released from ISM rainfall induces equatorially trapped westward-propagating Gill-type Rossby wave structure to its west. The interaction of this structure with the midlatitude westerlies gives rise to the aforementioned circulation features over the EMME. Our analysis reveals a substantial decline in the intensity of these circulation features over the study period, indicating an overall weakening of the summer circulation over the EMME. Further investigation points to a marked reduction in the subtropical westerly jet and the underlying westerlies during summer. This weakening may have contributed to reduced subsidence and a further decline in summer circulation strength over the EMME. Consequently, both Etesian winds over the EM and Shamal winds over the northern AP have shown notable declines in their occurrences. The weakened summer wind system has contributed to an abnormal increase in human-perceived temperatures and reduced dust activity."

 Insect-related dermatitis (IRD) has emerged as a significant public health concern. However, its risk distribution and epidemic dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we project the current and future risk distributions of dermatitis-causing insects (DCIs) across China. The maximum entropy modeling was adopted to project the suitability distribution of eight main DCIs. Our findings reveal a significant concentration of risk distributions for both DCIs and IRD southeast of the Heihe-Tengchong Line in China. Furthermore, our projections indicate that most DCIs are expected to experience an increase in their suitability distribution under future climate change. These shifts are closely related to future changes of temperature and precipitation. Further field validation of key DCIs confirmed that the observed suitable regions would expand northward with growing temperature and precipitation. Collectively, the above results revealed the risk distribution of DCIs and IRD in China, providing valuable references for disease management and prevention of IRD.

 Land Surface Phenology (LSP) has been widely derived from polar-orbiting satellite observations to characterize terrestrial vegetation dynamics. However, the uncertainty of LSP detections over large areas is always a big concern because of cloud contamination in the satellite time series, particularly in persistently cloudy regions. The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R (GOES-R) provides a high likelihood of obtaining cloud-free observations throughout the vegetation growing season due to the high temporal resolution of 10 minutes. Therefore, this study investigated LSP detections at 500 m pixels from VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer), ABI, and fused VIIRS-ABI time series in 2019 over North America between 12°N and 48°N. Specifically, the 3-day composite VIIRS NBAR (Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)-Adjusted Reflectance) EVI2 (two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index) time series was first generated. Similarly, the 3-day composite ABI EVI2 time series was also produced after performing BRDF-adjustment of 10-min GOES-16/17 ABI surface reflectance. The 3-day VIIRS EVI2 time series was then fused with ABI EVI2 observations to generate the synthetic high spatiotemporal VIIRS-ABI EVI2 time series. Further, LSP was separately detected from the VIIRS, ABI, and fused VIIRS-ABI EVI2 time series. Finally, the three LSP detections were analyzed with the variation of cloud cover and ABI view zenith angle (VZA) and validated using the LSP reference produced from the fusion of Harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 (HLS) observations with PhenoCam time series. The results showed that VIIRS-ABI LSP could overcome the limitations in the LSP detections from either VIIRS or ABI alone. The improvement of VIIRS-ABI LSP could be over 15 days relative to ABI LSP in large VZA regions and 5 days relative to VIIRS LSP in regions prone to persist cloud cover. Because of the high complementarity between the polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites, their fusion could significantly improve the generation of global LSP products."

 Water clarity is an important characteristic of water quality and ecosystem health in inland and coastal waters. Secchi disk depth (SDD) is a conventional in situ optical method of measuring this parameter. Assessments of SDD from remotely-sensed ocean color data benefit from wide spatial and temporal coverage but are subject to low accuracy resulting from unstable relationship between water transparency and the color of water surface. A semi-analytical SDD algorithm (hereafter called CB-SDD algorithm) proposed for turbid coastal waters was extensively evaluated in the Chesapeake Bay. The results demonstrate the CB-SDD algorithm performs well for data collected by satellite ocean color sensors over the Chesapeake Bay with lower bias and higher accuracy. Satellite SDD maps from MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS-SNPP were generated using CB-SDD algorithm to analyze spatiotemporal variations of water clarity in the Chesapeake Bay. Spatial distribution of the satellite-derived SDD products illustrates that SDD are shallower in the northern Bay and upstream in its tributaries, while SDD are deeper along the main stem in the middle and lower parts of the Bay. Expected seasonal and interannual variation in SDD in the entire Bay are evident in the satellite results. The assessments of satellite-derived SDD reveal river discharge patterns of seasonal and interannual variations similar to the patterns resulting from in situ SDD measurements. Disagreements between the assessments are insignificant and can be explained by the differences in sampling locations. Our results show that satellite data can be fit-for-purpose for water quality management across the Chesapeake Bay and this satellite method can be considered to extend water quality observations where and when in situ observations are lacking in the Bay. Furthermore, this study contributes to the increasing confidence that with similar analysis of other turbid coastal and inland water bodies, ocean color remote sensing can be a robust tool to understand and manage water quality, globally, including retrospective studies covering the satellite era."

In this study, we analyzed the joint impacts of AO plus EP-El Niño or CP-El Niño on precipitation in South China spanning boreal winter from 1961 to 2019. We found that AO and El Niño regulated precipitation over the target region via independent teleconnection pathways. The positive/negative phase of AO can induce an anomalous cyclone/anticyclone in the Indo-Myanmar by initiating a Rossby wave from the North Atlantic, passing through the Mediterranean, Middle East, and then eastward along the subtropical jet stream to the low latitudes of East Asia. This can enhance/weaken the local Indo-Myanmar Trough, and further contribute to above/below-normal precipitation to 100° E–110° E in South China via a stronger/weaker water vapor transport and ascending/descending motion. Through a Gill-type response and/or weaker-than-normal Walker circulation, El Niño generates an anomalous anticyclone over the northwestern Pacific Ocean; specifically, CP-El Niño forces the anomalous anticyclone in the Philippines, and southerly winds on the western flank of the anticyclone can carry moisture to the area between 110° E and 120° E. However, during EP-El Niño, this anomalous anticyclone is active to the east of 130° E, which is unfavorable for precipitation in South China."

Tests based on self-captured data showcase its excellent accuracy in distinguishing image types and in structure segmentation. With potential applications in astronomical observations, our work pioneers a robust solution for ground-based sky quality assessment, promising advancements in the photometric observation experiments. 
 Infrared thermal cameras offer reliable means of assessing atmospheric conditions by measuring the downward radiance from the sky, facilitating their usage in cloud monitoring endeavors. The precise identification and detection of clouds in images pose great challenges stemming from the indistinct boundaries inherent to cloud formations. Various methodologies for segmentation have been previously suggested. Most of them rely on color as the distinguishing criterion for cloud identification in the visible spectral domain and thus lack the ability to detect cloud structures in gray-scaled images with satisfying accuracy. In this work, we propose a new complete deep-learning framework to perform image classification and segmentation with convolutional neural networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique by conducting a series of tests and validations based on self-captured infrared sky images.  Our findings reveal that the models can effectively differentiate between image types and accurately capture detailed cloud structure information at the pixel level, even when trained with a single binary ground-truth mask per input sample. The classifier model achieves an excellent accuracy of 99 % in image type distinction, while the segmentation model attains a mean pixel accuracy of 95 % in our dataset. We emphasize that our framework exhibits strong viability and can be used for infrared thermal ground-based cloud monitoring operations over extended durations. We expect to take advantage of this framework for astronomical applications by providing cloud cover selection criteria for ground-based photometric observations within the StarDICE experiment."

A model was applied to correct for differences in pollen production between different plants, and modern remote-sensing forest cover was used to validate the reconstructed tree cover. Accurate data on past vegetation are invaluable for the investigation of vegetation–climate dynamics and the validation of vegetation models. 
 With rapid anthropogenic climate change, future vegetation trajectories are uncertain. Climate–vegetation models can be useful for predictions, but they require extensive data on past vegetation for validation and improving systemic understanding. Even though pollen data provide a great source of this information, they are compositionally biased due to differences in taxon-specific relative pollen productivity (RPP) and dispersal.Here, we present a Northern Hemisphere reconstruction of quantitative regional vegetation cover from a sedimentary pollen dataset for the last 14 kyr using the REVEALS model to correct for taxon- and basin-specific biases. For the reconstruction, we expanded on a previously published synthesis of continental RPP values.The datasets include the taxonomic composition and reconstructed tree cover for each original pollen sample. Additional metadata include modeled ages, age model sources, basin locations, types, and sizes.The improvements in tree cover reconstructions with the REVEALS reconstruction using continental RPP values range from 22 % (Asia) to 67 % (Europe) relative to the mean absolute error (MAE) of the pollen-based tree cover. The dataset can be used as a grid with binned and aggregated samples (adjustable script provided on Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13902976, Schild, 2024) or as individual time series if the record's basin size exceeds 50 ha.This alternative quantitative reconstruction of vegetation cover is beneficial for the investigation of past vegetation dynamics and modern model validation when varying spatial and temporal resolutions may be required. By collecting more RPP estimates, especially in North America, and adding more records to existing pollen data syntheses, reconstructions may be improved even further.

Primary measurements from the former include sensible and latent heat flux, while the latter also measures fluxes of momentum and carbon (primarily carbon dioxide, with methane fluxes measured at select (two to date) locations).

This may be partly due to differences in experiment protocols and partly due to systematic model errors. The Tropical Basin Interaction Model Intercomparison Project (TBIMIP) aims to address this problem by designing a set of TBI experiments that will be performed by multiple models. 
 Large-scale interaction between the three tropical ocean basins is an area of intense research that is often conducted through experimentation with numerical models. A common problem is that modeling groups use different experimental setups, which makes it difficult to compare results and delineate the role of model biases from differences in experimental setups. To address this issue, an experimental protocol for examining interaction between the tropical basins is introduced. The Tropical Basin Interaction Model Intercomparison Project (TBIMIP) consists of experiments in which sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are prescribed to follow observed values in selected basins. There are two types of experiments. One type, called standard pacemaker, consists of simulations in which SSTs are restored to observations in selected basins during a historical simulation. The other type, called pacemaker hindcast, consists of seasonal hindcast simulations in which SSTs are restored to observations during 12-month forecast periods. TBIMIP is coordinated by the Climate and Ocean – Variability, Predictability, and Change (CLIVAR) Research Focus on Tropical Basin Interaction.

However, prevailing membrane-based technologies, such as reverse osmosis (RO) and electrodialysis (ED), can hardly handle high concentration differences (ΔC) in a single stage, where multi-stage operation is needed, which increases the operational difficulties and energy input. However, membrane capacitive deionization (MCDI) is theoretically applicable to high ΔC. This study explored the feasibility of employing an MCDI in brine concentrating and proposed several regulating measures on the electrode’s porosity, electrical quantity for charging–discharging, and desorption conditions. Based on the determination of salt and water fluxes, these measures were confirmed to mitigate water transfer across the membrane, thereby facilitating salt transportation for brine concentrating. To address the mass imbalance between adsorbed and desorbed, a novel pre-charge strategy was designed, which enabled successful MCDI continuous operation over 50 cycles. A concentration difference of 161 g/L NaCl was achieved per single stage, which is the highest reported result among RO, ED, and MCDI studies. The concentrating rate was as high as 38.4 g/(m2·h) with a comparative energy consumption at RO and ED. This study demonstrated that MCDI is an optional technology for the future application of brine concentrating in ZLD facilities."

It remains a challenge to develop a rationally designed device with a high proportion of adsorbents for increased performance. Herein, using 3,8-diamino-6-phenylphenanthridine (DPP) and 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol (TP) as monomers, a β-ketoenamine-linked covalent organic framework membrane (TPDPP) was fabricated via interface assembly. TPDPP was further loaded on ultrathin polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using solvent evaporation, resulting in a high proportion of TPDPP functional components in the hybrid membrane (TPDPP@PDMS). This approach was highly feasible for the batch preparation of TPDPP@PDMS with a lamellar homogeneous structure and controllable layers. These TPDPP@PDMS membranes demonstrated outstanding enrichment performance for common antibiotics, particularly sulfonamide antibiotics, with extraction efficiencies 7.73–12.7 times higher than those of TPDPP fibers and 3.91–93.9 times higher than those of commercial fibers. The TPDPP@PDMS membranes reproducibly performed simultaneous SPME in a variety of environmental water samples, simplifying the pretreatment process and saving time. By integration of the membranes with liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry, an ultrasensitive method was established to achieve parallel extraction and highly efficient antibiotic quantification, demonstrating great potential for environmental pollutant monitoring."

This is the case for zooplankton species, which ensure the coupling between primary producers and fishes in pelagic food webs. Here, we measured lifespan, reproduction, and mobility of laboratory-raised water fleas Daphnia magna, a widespread freshwater zooplankton species, in response to continuous broadband noise. Surprisingly, we found a significant increase in survival and fecundity, leading to a higher individual fitness when considering total offspring production and a slight increase in the population growth rate according to the Euler–Lotka equation. Exposed water fleas were found to be slower than control individuals, and we discussed potential links between mobility and fitness. Our results can have implications in aquaculture and for in-lab studies (e.g., in ecotoxicology) where the acoustic environment receives little attention. Chronic broadband noise can be associated with certain human activities, but the consequences for natural Daphnia populations might differ as reduced velocity could have negative outcomes when considering competition and predation. Our work is one of the few showing an effect of noise on individual fitness and suggests that noise should be better accounted for in laboratory studies."

Particularly worrisome is that although studies have reported that NPs can amplify the biotoxicity of environmental pollutants, the specific mechanism remains unclear. Here, we found that NPs, even without significant toxicity (cell survival: 99.11%), amplified the hepatocyte toxicity of Cd2+. Mechanistically, higher Cd2+ uptake (Δ = 23.80%) combined with crucial intracellular desorption behavior of Cd2+ loaded in NPs (desorption rate: 82.70%) were identified as prerequisites for NPs amplifying Cd2+ cytotoxicity. As for toxigenic pathways, the inflammatory response and calcium (Ca) signaling pathway were identified as the primary molecular events leading to the amplification of Cd2+ cytotoxicity. Further phenotypic monitoring revealed that NPs synergized with Cd2+ to induce more severe pyroptosis and apoptosis by activating the inflammatory caspase-1-dependent and Ca2+-mitochondrial-caspase-3 pathways to a greater extent, respectively. This study reveals and proves for the first time the “Trojan horse” effects of NPs, thus elucidating the actual mechanisms by which NPs act as toxicity amplifiers of pollutants, providing significant insights into accurate risk assessment of NPs in composite pollution."

We performed friction experiments on simulated bassanite gouges under various confining pressures and temperatures. At room temperature (RT), stress drops and recurrence intervals of stick‐slip events varied with confining pressures. Under a confining pressure of 200 MPa and 110°C, stress drops and recurrence intervals decreased over time. Microstructures indicate that gouges deformed under RT contain numerous Riedel shears. On the other hand, a sample deformed under the confining pressure of 200 MPa and 110°C had few Riedel shear planes. Above observations indicate that the elevated pore pressure by the dehydration of bassanite gouges reduces the effective pressures controlling slip behaviors and suppresses the development of shear planes. We derived time function of dehydration‐driven pore pressure evolution using Avrami kinetics, which can be expressed by the Weibull distribution function representing the failure probability. Our result shows that the kinetics‐driven pore fluid evolution controlled the stick‐slip behaviors of the bassanite gouges."

These were mostly detected during dawn storm auroral episodes (4/7) and three were found to be colocated with auroral cavities. By applying a growth rate analysis based on JADE‐E electron measurements, we show that the observed waves are driven by the Cyclotron Maser Instability from two free energy sources. The main emission, produced slightly above the electron gyrofrequency fce $\left({f}_{ce}\right)$, is amplified by conics‐type electron distribution functions (EDF) with 2–30 keV electron characteristic energies. Sporadic bursts, produced slightly below fce ${f}_{ce}$, are driven by shell‐type EDF of 0.1–10 keV.

By estimating the relative vorticity associated with WNPTCs, we find that reduced WNPTC activity accounts for about 33% of WNPAC variability from November of the El Niño year to September of the following year. This reduction is primarily driven by decreased relative humidity at 600 hPa, with low‐level vorticity changes playing a minor role.

 Long-term terrestrial ecosystem development is characterized by declining soil phosphorus (P) and a corresponding increase in biological P limitation. The function of P-limited ecosystems relies on efficient use of P by soil microorganisms, but the physiological strategies used by microorganisms to manage P scarcity during ecosystem development are unknown. Here, by applying recent advances in soil metabolomic techniques to samples collected from a ~700,000-year chronosequence of ecosystem development in eastern Australia, we show that soil microbial physiological strategies for P efficiency include a high proportion of non-phosphorous membrane lipids along with substantial intracellular carbon storage. These strategies—which proliferate during primary succession and are maximized in retrogressive, P-depleted ecosystems—uphold microbial carbon limitation, triple modelled P-mineralization potential and can conserve close to double the P contained in the aboveground biomass of vegetation. These findings transform our understanding of terrestrial ecosystems by revealing a strong yet overlooked interplay between the ecophysiology of soil microorganisms and the long-term trajectory of ecosystem development.

When this subglacial water reaches the ocean cavity beneath ice shelves, it mixes with seawater, amplifying melt and in places forming deep channels in the base of the ice. Here we present observations from a hot-water-drilled borehole documenting subglacial water entering the ocean cavity at the grounding zone of Kamb Ice Stream and the Ross Ice Shelf. Our observations show that melt has removed approximately a third of the ice thickness, yet measurements reveal low rates of subglacial discharge in a turbid plume. Sediment cored from the channel floor shows larger discharge events occur and episodically deposit material from distinct geological domains. We quantify subglacial discharge and link our observations to the catchment upstream. We conclude that discrete discharge events are likely to dominate channel melt and sediment transport and result in the extensive ice-shelf features downstream of Kamb Ice Stream. Observations from a borehole in the Kamb Ice Stream suggest that discrete subglacial discharge events dominate channel melt and sediment transport."

Here, the authors report a co-initiating system for fabrication of printable entangled networks. 
 Entanglement significantly enhances the mechanical performance and functionality of both natural and synthetic materials. However, developing straightforward, versatile strategies for creating high-performance entangled polymer materials remains a challenge. Here, a co-initiating-system dual-mechanism strategy is designed for fabricating printable entangled polymer multinetworks. This thermal-light dual-initiation process benefits the synthesis of high-molecular-weight polymers and promotes the rapid formation of multinetworks within hydrogels. The resulting long polymer chains enable hydrogels with higher mechanical performance, lower stress relaxation, and activation energy compared to short polymer chain-contained samples. Such a method proves more effective than traditional self-thickening and strengthening techniques for enhancing hydrogel entanglements and is also compatible with additive manufacturing, enabling the design of complex 2D webs with adaptive mechanical performance and capable of detecting and sensing applications. This work provides an effective strategy for designing high-performance entangled polymer materials, which are set to impact numerous fields, from advanced sensing to material science and beyond. While entangled networks can offer improved mechanical performance in synthetic materials, these can be challenging to achieve in polymer materials.

 Although histone modifications are linked with chromatin activities such as transcription, proofs of their causal importance remain limited. Sequence variants within each histone family expand chromatin diversity and may carry specific modifications, further raising questions about their coordination. Here, we investigate the role of lysine 4 (K4) in two Arabidopsis H3 variants, H3.1 and H3.3. K4 is essential for H3.3 function but not H3.1 in plant development. Mutating K4 in H3.3 drastically reduced H3K4 methylation levels and mimicked the transcriptomic effects of losing SDG2, the major H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) methyltransferase. Moreover, H3.3K4 and SDG2 are required for de novo gene activation and RNA Pol II elongation. H3K4 methylation is preferentially enriched on H3.3, likely due to the coordinated activity of H3.3 deposition and H3K4 methylation. Furthermore, we reveal the diverse impacts of K4 nearby residue mutations on H3K4 methylation and H3.3 function. These findings highlight H3.3 as a critical substrate for H3K4 methylation, which is important for gene expression regulation. Sequence variation between histones expands chromatin diversity.

Here, authors propose entropy regulation with zero Li/Co usage to suppress lattice strain, enhancing structural stability and improving the electrochemical performance. 
 Transition-metal (TM) layered oxides have emerged as the primary cathode choice for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high energy density and sustainable chemistry using non-critical elements. However, their anisotropic lattice strain and stress accumulation during (de)sodiation lead to severe structural degradation, yet an intrinsic strain-depressant approach remains elusive. Herein, we propose entropy regulation with zero Li/Co usage to mitigate harmful lattice displacements and enhance the electrochemical performance of sodium layered cathodes. Our findings demonstrate that high entropy design effectively inhibits TMO6 octahedra distortions upon cycling, as evidenced by hard X-ray absorption spectroscopy, greatly reducing near-surface structural deconstruction and interface side reactions. Furthermore, multicationic interactions driven by configurational entropy thermodynamically mitigate the formation of oxygen defects and strengthen ligand-to-metal coordination. The complementarity inherent in charge compensation within complex systems is unveiled and the restrained lattice parameters deviations without interior volume residuals are successfully achieved. As a result, the multicationic cathode exhibits improved cycling stability and Na+ diffusion kinetics in both half and full cells. The cathode chemistries outlined here broaden the prospects for lattice engineering to alleviate bulk fatigue and open up the possibility to develop an economically viable layered oxides with long durability.

 Strong and lightweight materials are highly desired. Here we report the emergence of a compressive strength exceeding 2 GPa in a directly printed poly(ethylene glycol) micropillar. This strong and highly crosslinked micropillar is not brittle, instead, it behaves like rubber under compression. Experimental results show that the micropillar sustains a strain approaching 70%, absorbs energy up to 310 MJ/m3, and displays an almost 100% recovery after cyclic loading. Simple micro-lattices (e.g., honeycombs) of poly(ethylene glycol) also display high strength at low structural densities. By combining a series of control experiments, computational simulations and in situ characterization, we find that the key to achieving such mechanical performance lies in the fabrication of a highly homogeneous structure with suppressed defect formation. Our discovery unveils a generalizable approach for achieving a performance leap in polymeric materials and provides a complementary approach to enhance the mechanical performance of low-density latticed structures.

 Water plays an essential role in enzyme structure, stability, and the substantial rate enhancement of enzyme catalysis.

By integrating an ultraviolet (UV) photolysis technique with temperature-controlled X-ray crystallography, we track the catalytic pathway of carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) at 1.2 Å resolution. This approach enables us to construct molecular movies of CAII catalysis, encompassing substrate (CO2) binding, conversion from substrate to product (bicarbonate), and product release. In the catalytic pathway, we identify an unexpected configuration in product binding and correlate it with sub-nanosecond rearrangement of active-site water. Based on these experimental observations, we propose a comprehensive mechanism of CAII and describe the detailed structure and dynamics of active-site water in CAII.

 Antarctic ice shelves typically comprise continental meteoric ice, in situ-accumulated meteoric ice, and marine ice accumulated at the shelf base. Using borehole optical televiewer logs from across Larsen C Ice Shelf, Antarctic Peninsula, we identify and report an intermediate ice unit, located between continental and in situ meteoric ice, that is tens of metres thick and formed of layers that progressively increase in dip (by ~60°) with depth. The unit’s stratigraphic position and depth, supported by flowline modelling, indicate formation at the grounding zone. We hypothesise that the unit forms due to changes in the surface slope of feeder glaciers at the grounding zone, resulting in both variable surface accumulation and intense deformation. The top of the unit also marks the depth at which lateral consistency in radar layering is lost from radargrams, which may, to some degree, mark the depth of grounding zone ice across all ice shelves.

 Efficient uranium extraction from seawater has the potential to secure an abundant and reliable supply of nuclear fuel, providing affordable energy with minimized carbon emissions. Among the many extraction methods, the electrochemical route has emerged as a promising choice owing to its fast kinetics and materials regeneration.

Seismic imaging captures multi-scale processes from mesoscale to finescale, allowing us to infer turbulence processes. This study identified hundreds of ~200-m-long high seismic reflection patches, primarily caused by vertical temperature changes, moving at 0.24 ± 0.13 m/s across the deep-reaching front of Bransfield Current, Antarctica. Patch distribution within the main current is uneven, increasing exponentially towards the frontal leading edge. Over 95% of the detected patches are concentrated within 10 km from the frontal leading edge, where elevated Thorpe-scale diffusivity exceeding 10−2 m2/s has been observed hydrographically. These patches may indicate stratified turbulence, including broken internal wave segments, interleaving interfaces, and overturns, which may correspond to wave breaking, frontal instability, and shear instability, respectively. Our findings challenge the recently questioned classical hypothesis that energy cascades directly from internal waves to isotropic turbulence, instead supporting the paradigm of a stratified turbulence stage."

 U-Pb carbonate geochronology can directly constrain the timing and rates of important geological processes. However, the mechanisms and controls on U incorporation, distribution, and retention in carbonate minerals remain unclear, limiting geological interpretations. Here X-ray absorption spectroscopy (µXAS) and in-situ U-Pb carbonate geochronology are combined to temporally track U distribution and redox state in a porphyry-epithermal system. In this setting, multiple generations of carbonate minerals record fluid conditions and processes which control the solubility and deposition of metals, including U. This novel approach provides the first evidence of both oxidized UO22+ and reduced U4+ species in temporally distinct generations of carbonate within a single sample. Preservation of two different U oxidation states during discrete precipitation events requires U retentivity within older domains, demonstrating that the U-Pb carbonate geochronometer is robust under hydrothermal conditions. Furthermore, crystal zones with abundant fluid/vapour inclusions linked to boiling processes coincide with relatively high levels of U and favourable U/Pb. Targeting carbonate domains with these textures may therefore increase success in U-Pb geochronology. U-Pb carbonate dating combined with µXAS can track the temporal evolution of processes critical for metal deposition in long-lived and multistage hydrothermal-magmatic ore deposit settings.

 The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently marked a transformative shift in the realms of 3D representation, efficient rendering, and novel view synthesis. Despite its advancements, the geometric precision, photometric consistency, and the quality of novel view synthesis continue to pose significant challenges in the context of large-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based 3D reconstruction. To tackle these challenges, we propose a geometry-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting Approach, incorporating three novel methods specifically designed for large-scale UAV-based reconstruction. Firstly, recognizing that existing LiDAR-supervised 3DGS methods are primarily utilized for optimizing Gaussian properties derived from Structure from Motion (SfM), we introduce a precise 3DGS initialization method that leverages highly accurate dense LiDAR point clouds precisely registered with imagery. By extracting depth, normal, and curvature information from the dense UAV LiDAR point cloud, we enhance geometric accuracy through geometric supervision in complex large-scale outdoor scenes. Secondly, addressing the limitations of current photometric supervision in 3DGS, which struggles with illumination variations due to the constraints of spherical harmonics (SH) color representation and lighting changes, we propose a spatial–temporal SH method. This innovative method aims to refine photometric consistency by dynamically adapting to varying lighting conditions, thereby improving the overall quality of 3D reconstruction in diverse environmental settings. Through these methods, our approach seeks to advance the capabilities of 3DGS in large-scale UAV-based 3D reconstruction, offering improved geometric accuracy, photometric consistency, and novel view synthesis quality.Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional SLAM-based reconstruction and multi-view reconstruction approaches. In large-scale 3D reconstruction tasks that use both UAV LiDAR point clouds and imagery, our method achieves a 31.25 % improvement in geometric accuracy while consistently surpassing existing methods in the quality metrics of novel view synthesis. Furthermore, our approach attains a PSNR exceeding 30 dB and optimizes photometric consistency, enhancing rendering quality and visual realism."

 Exposure to ultrafine particles (UFP, ≤100 nm) is an emerging health concern linked to premature mortality, with jet fuel combustion identified as a significant source of UFPs near airports. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) adoption has the potential to reduce aviation-related UFPs and may particularly benefit populations who reside nearby. However, assessing aviation-specific impacts on health remains challenging due to the lack of tools capable of addressing: fine-scale exposure evaluation, novel ambient pollutants, and groups with increased exposure or susceptibility.We develop and apply a method to estimate reductions in mortality associated with aviation-related UFP reductions at the Seattle-Tacoma (SEA-TAC) International Airport under SAF adoption scenarios, with a focus on near-airport communities. Using UFP exposure surfaces generated from AERMOD modeling, flight count data, and UFP measurements, we evaluated UFP reductions under various control scenarios. We estimated mortality reductions by combining this with population data, baseline mortality, and a hazard ratio of 1.012 (95 % confidence interval: 1.010, 1.015) per interquartile range increment of 2723 particles/cm3.Our analysis included 412 census tracts representing almost 1.5 million adults. Baseline aviation-related UFP exposures averaged 1145 (SD: 277) particles/cm3. The highest baseline concentrations and subsequent reductions under SAF scenarios were near SEA-TAC. Mortality case reductions averaged between 3.1 (95 % range: 2.5–3.7) for a 5 % UFP reduction to 31.0 (24.6–37.4) for a 50 % reduction, with corresponding mortality rate reductions of 0.2 (0.2–0.3) to 2.1 (1.7–2.5) cases per 100,000 people per year. Mortality rate reductions were larger among populations residing closer to SEA-TAC, including those that were Hispanic or Latino, below-poverty, and did not identify as White.Reducing aviation-related UFPs through SAF adoption could lead to lower mortality, particularly in near-airport communities. This reproducible approach can be adapted to other settings to evaluate health benefits from aviation-related UFP reductions."

Tsiros;Nikolaos D. Proutsos;Stefanos P. Stefanidis,Uncertainties in the estimation of Thornthwaite's Aridity and Moisture Indices in Greece over the last century using ground and gridded datasets,"•Aridity (AI) and Moisture (Im) indices were estimated over Greece. •Ground and gridded (CRU) data were used for three climatic periods since 1900. •Gridded data produced higher AI altering aridity class in many areas to more humid. •Im was more sensitive on the application of the gridded dataset. •Using gridded data in areas with complex topography requires careful consideration. 
 During the last decades several gridded climatic datasets have been developed offering thus long-term, continuous, and spatially uniform records of key hydrometeorological parameters. Few studies, however, have rigorously evaluated the accuracy and reliability of these datasets, especially in regions characterized by complex topography and sparse observational data, such as the Mediterranean. Moreover, even fewer have explored how uncertainties inherent in these datasets affect derived climatic indices. To address this gap, the present study deals with the application of ground station measurements and a gridded dataset (CRU_TS 4.04) to estimate the aridity index (AI) and Thornthwaite's Moisture index (Im) over the Greek peninsula for three different consecutive climatic periods. Ground station data estimations are compared against the outcomes of the respective gridded datasets. Results show that the application of gridded data led to AI values increase in many areas, altering the aridity classification from semi-arid (SA) to sub-humid (SH) or humid (H) categories. Further, the application of gridded data led to both underestimations and overestimations of the Im, depending on the site: more dry conditions along the western coast (in most cases) and the eastern Aegean islands (with significant differences in some of the islands) and more humid conditions over the northwestern mainland and the southern part along with the Aegean islands. These results suggest that while gridded datasets always offer an alternative, careful consideration is required when they are used in regions characterized by complex topography (heterogenous terrain, site continentality and extensive land-sea contrast) and also temporal climatic variability."

Globally, a prevailing greening trend has been observed over the past decades using remote-sensing normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), suggesting increasing vegetation cover and primary productivity. However, NDVI responses to warming differ across regions. Cold, energy-limited alpine and tundra ecosystems tend to respond positively to warming, while arid, water-limited ecosystems may experience reduced NDVI due to higher transpiration rates limiting plant growth. Additionally, CO2 fertilization effect enhances vegetation productivity by improving plant water use efficiency. This study investigates the drivers of temporal trends in annual maximum NDVI (NDVImax) along an elevational gradient in the arid Western Himalaya (Ladakh, India). We hypothesize that NDVImax will be more sensitive to precipitation anomalies at lower elevations, whereas at higher elevations it will be more sensitive to temperature anomalies. Using Landsat satellite data from 2001 to 2022, we related NDVImax temporal anomalies to temperature and precipitation obtained from the ERA5-Land reanalysis dataset, and local snow cover from MODIS. Our results show complex interactions between climate and elevation that influence NDVImax. Contrary to our expectations, precipitation exhibited a strong positive effect on NDVImax across all elevations and seasons, except for autumn at higher elevations. Temperature effects were weaker and varied across seasons and elevations. Higher summer temperatures increased NDVImax at higher elevations but decreased it at lower elevations. We observed a multidecadal greening trend independent of temperature and precipitation, with this greening being more pronounced at lower elevations. This study highlights the importance of context dependency in understanding vegetation dynamics in fragile, low-productivity mountain ecosystems."

Understanding the damage magnitude and preparing for the folly of its occurrence are critical given current geopolitical tensions. We developed and applied a framework to simulate global crop production under a nuclear winter using the Cycles agroecosystem model, incorporating ultraviolet (UV)-B radiation effects on plant growth and adaptive selection of crop maturity types (shorter cycle the lower the temperature). Using maize (Zea maize L.) as a sentinel crop, we found that annual maize production could decline from 7% after a small-scale regional nuclear war with 5 Tg soot injection, to 80% after a global nuclear war with 150 Tg soot injection, with recovery taking from 7 to 12 years. UV-B damage would peak 6–8 years post-war and can further decrease annual maize production by 7%. Over the recovery period, adaptive selection of maize maturity types to track changing temperatures could increase production by 10% compared to a no-adaptation strategy. Seed availability may become a critical adaptation bottleneck; this and prior studies might underestimate food production declines. We propose that adaptation must include the development of Agricultural Resilience Kits consisting of region- and climate-specific seed and technology packages designed to buffer against uncertainty while supply chains recover. These kits would be congenial with the transient conditions during the recovery period, and would also be applicable to other catastrophes affecting food production."

While current seasonal forecasting systems provide monthly precipitation forecasts operationally, their coarse resolution limits their effectiveness in capturing the localized precipitation patterns and snowpack conditions essential for water resource managers in the mountainous regions. Here, analog statistical downscaling is demonstrated as an effective approach to enhance the spatial resolution of operational seasonal forecasts provided by the North American Multi-Model Ensemble. Downscaling was performed by building an analog ‘library’, in which corresponding model forecasts and observed values during the training period were stored. In the testing period, unseen model forecasts referenced the closest historical forecast from the analog library and applied the corresponding observational value for each point. This analysis indicates that downscaled products can capture localized features more accurately than the original coarse resolution forecasts, reducing forecast error across the western United States. Moreover, downscaling individual ensemble members—rather than downscaling the ensemble mean—further reduces forecasting error for their multi-model ensemble mean products. The greatest error reductions in the downscaled product, measured by root mean squared error (RMSE), were observed at low to mid-elevations (500–2000 meters), with 50%–70% improvement relative to the original forecasts. In the higher elevations (2000 meters and above), changes in RMSE relative to the original forecast were limited to 10%–30% improvements. The improvement is more substantial for forecast systems with 10 ensemble members compared to that with 4 members, but this relationship does not hold for the system with 24 ensemble members. These findings show that analog statistical downscaling can effectively address the spatial limitations of seasonal precipitation forecasts with minimal computational cost, providing a valuable framework for enhancing coarse resolution forecasting products while providing insights into the timing of ensemble mean calculations during the downscaling process."

The scientific case for phasing out coal-fired electricity is clear, and many countries are progressing towards this. However, despite widespread concerns about risks and trade-offs, natural gas is often considered a bridge fuel, and there is currently no progress towards phasing down its capacity. Previous work on the political feasibility of coal phase-out only considered limited socio-political factors, missing the importance of governance quality and policies supporting the energy transition. There is even more limited understanding of factors associated with gas phase-down, while Europe and North America fall behind trajectories required to limit warming below 1.5 °C. We use multivariate regression and clustering analyses on over four decades of data to investigate the drivers and synergies of coal and gas transitions. This reveals opportunities to overcome fossil fuel lock-in through renewable energy expansion, energy policy reforms, and power market restructuring. Countries with greater reliance on fossil fuel infrastructure and workforce face additional difficulties in phase out. Social factors such as higher belief in climate change are positively linked with more ambitious coal phase-out efforts. However, disentangling these links for gas remains difficult given the limited historical evidence of phase-down progress. We identify four archetypes (Coal Reliance, Gas Reliance, Limited Policy, and Transition Underway) that illustrate different ways countries have transitioned from coal and gas over time. These provide blueprints for potential future transitions in other countries. Recognizing the diverse social, political, and institutional factors that shape transitions can inform the design of politically relevant future scenarios."

This approach bridges site-level observations with biome-scale model estimates to develop a global understanding. Our findings suggest that in boreal and cold temperate regions, temperature primarily constrains the enhancement of the CO2 fertilization on forest GPP; however, warming and higher atmospheric CO2 levels are projected to alleviate these limitations. In tropical forests, CO2 fertilization strongly enhances GPP, but this benefit will be counterbalanced by the adverse impacts of projected climate warming.

This study investigated the relationship between these accelerated drying phenomena of flash droughts (FDs) and forest fire occurrence across 43 Indian ecoregions from 1979 to 2023, revealing patterns of escalating forest fire risk. We employed a four-criteria methodology based on the evaporative stress ratio (ESR) to identify and characterize FD events. The criteria included temporal duration (minimum 30 d), severity (SESR ⩽ 20th percentile), intensification rate (ΔSESR ⩽ 40th percentile), and mean intensification (ΔSESRz ⩽ 25th percentile). Our analysis uncovered significant regional variations in event frequency, with mountainous regions showing vulnerability—the Karakoram-West Tibetan Plateau alpine steppe experienced 31 rapid drying events, while the Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests recorded only 10 events. The temporal analysis revealed clear seasonal patterns, with June being the primary onset month in 17.8% of ecoregions, followed by January and October, each dominating 14% of regions. Critically, 79.1% of ecoregions showed increasing forest fire trends from 2001 to 2023, with the Orissa semi-evergreen forests displaying significant vulnerability. High-altitude and semi-arid regions showed statistically significant positive correlations between rapid drying frequency and fire incidents (r = 0.68, p = 0.002 in Karakoram-West Tibetan Plateau alpine steppe; r = 0.59, p = 0.004 in Thar desert), suggesting that accelerated moisture depletion creates conditions conducive to fire outbreaks in these vulnerable ecosystems. Most ecoregions experienced these drying events for 1%–2% of the study period, indicating that even brief episodes of rapid desiccation can trigger lasting ecological impacts. These findings highlight the urgent need for integrated drought-fire management strategies that account for the unique challenges posed by rapid onset drying events in different ecological contexts."

While most climate models agree on the externally forced wetting signal in global monsoon precipitation (GMP), the chaotic nature of internal variability introduces substantial uncertainty in future projections, particularly in the near term. In this study, we utilize multi-model simulations and four sets of large-ensemble simulations to investigate the role of internal variability, particularly the interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), in influencing uncertainty in future monsoon precipitation changes. We find that the externally forced wetting trend in GMP surpasses the range of internal variability only after the 2040s under both the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. Prior to this, internal variability contributes over 40% of the uncertainty in GMP projections, with the IPO accounting for nearly half of this internally induced uncertainty. To inform adaptation and mitigation efforts, we further propose near-term storylines of monsoon precipitation changes at both global and regional scales. Specifically, a transition from a negative to a positive phase of the IPO at a rate of +1 SD per decade during 2021–2040 leads to a decrease in GMP by −0.41% (−0.23%) per decade relative to 1995–2014 under the SSP2-4.5 (SSP5-8.5) scenario, while the reverse transition leads to an increase of 1.35% (1.53%) per decade.

Despite their significance, a comprehensive investigation into the effects of parametric uncertainty on their hydrologic predictions across diverse regions and flow characteristics remains lacking. This study contributes by detailing how variations in the response of the Community Water Model (CWatM) can be linked to the uncertainty associated with hydrologic parameters. Relying on the default hydrologic model parameters in CWatM may pose a risk, potentially leading to inaccurate streamflow predictions and improper decision-making in subsequent inferences. To confirm this, we first assess the effectiveness of CWatM in predicting streamflow across 481 basins spanning the Eurasian continent, utilizing the commonly employed default hydrologic parameters. Subsequently, we evaluate CWatM simulations using a comprehensive range of parameter realizations, employing the Latin Hypercube Sampling-based approach, and evaluate the daily performance based on 10 error metrics. Our results confirm the presence of significant variations in CWatM predictions in specific regions and across selected error metrics. In particular, the baseline CWatM exhibits relatively poor streamflow prediction skill in certain Eurasian regions, such as the arid region over Central Asia. In addition, the results show that the complex nonlinear behaviors in streamflow predictions are evident not only due to the overarching uncertainty in hydrologic parameters but also arise from the influence of the most dominant parameters. Ultimately, this exploration of parameter realizations offers insights for enhancing CWatM’s predictive capabilities and refining parameter selection in future studies."

Using forecasts initialised on 1 November 2009, transplanting more realistic cooler conditions in the South Pacific across ensemble members on 1 January 2010 significantly cools the resulting 2010/2011 winter ENSO one year later. The imposed perturbations migrate equatorward via wind–evaporation–sea surface temperature feedback and significantly alter tropical zonal gradients during late spring and summer. This drives the ensemble towards La Niña conditions, in line with observations. Repeating the experiment with warmer South Pacific conditions, results in the reverse signal and warms ENSO one year later. Across the experiments we find an almost four-fold increase in probability of La Niña and a three-fold decrease in probability of El Niño, demonstrating that long lead regional perturbations can systematically tip the climate system between ENSO states. Predicted surface conditions are significantly impacted across many parts of the world and the forecast global annual mean surface temperature for 2010 is significantly cooled, resulting in better agreement with observations.

The data are consistent with satellite-based observations and are made available for use in future geophysical and climate-related research. 
 Repeated absolute gravity measurements, conducted once or twice per year, have proven valuable for quantifying slow vertical land motion with a precision better than 0.4 μGal per year (1 μGal = 10−8 m s−2) after a decade or more. This precision is comparable to vertical velocity estimates derived from continuously operating space-based geodetic techniques such as the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Furthermore, absolute gravimeters are particularly well suited for long-term studies, as their measurements are based on fundamental length and time standards (laser and atomic clock) and remain independent of terrestrial reference frame realizations, unlike GNSS. Consequently, an absolute gravimeter can return years or even decades later and provide relevant measurements, provided the initial gravity data are well documented and the ground gravity marker remains undisturbed. Following this line of thinking, we have compiled and consistently reprocessed absolute gravity measurements collected between 1998 and 2022 in Brest, on the French Atlantic coast, near its century-long tide gauge station. The entire dataset has been reanalyzed in accordance with international recognized standards for instrumental and modelling corrections.

Herein, we demonstrate that lanthanum carbonate exhibits a 1.8-fold higher phosphate adsorption capacity at pH 7 (33.2 mg-P/g) compared to pH 4 (18.5 mg-P/g), attributed to the enhanced formation of LaPO4 nanocrystals. Leveraging in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM), we resolve real-time phosphorus sequestration dynamics, capturing LaPO4 nucleation within minutes, contradicting prior reports that LaPO4 formation is time-intensive. This discrepancy arises because conventional characterization techniques (e.g., X-ray diffraction) overlook transient amorphous LaPO4 intermediates due to insufficient sensitivity, whereas the nanoscale resolution of AFM directly tracks interfacial transformations. A dissolution-nucleation-growth mechanism was then proposed for the interfacial formation of LaPO4. This study revises the mechanistic framework for phosphorus removal and highlights the crucial role of LaPO4 formation in maximizing the utilization efficiency of lanthanum active sites for enhanced phosphate sequestration by La-based materials."

Previous studies reported that the prolonged warm SSTAs in the NEP are usually passively triggered by atmospheric high‐pressure anomalies. In this study, results show that the early winter positive SSTAs can actively reverse the high‐pressure anomalies into low‐pressure anomalies within the whole troposphere through diabatic heating and transient eddy vorticity forcing. However, when the positive SSTAs appear in mid‐winter, the atmospheric preconditioning of warm air temperature anomalies related to the high‐pressure anomalies prevents oceanic thermodynamic and dynamics feedback onto the atmosphere, which results in no reversal of the high‐pressure anomalies. Therefore, the atmospheric state is an important factor in initiating the mid‐latitude oceanic feedback to the atmosphere."

This study further elucidates that the long‐term LTD trend in the CEC exhibits a pronounced seasonal contrast that there is a significant increase from August to October, whereas a decline is observed from May to July. This seasonal reversal in the CEC LTD trend is attributed to the northward migration of an intensified diabatic heating source from May to October under global warming. This result is supported by a linear baroclinic model that incorporates realistic precipitation trends to parameterize diabatic heating over the WNP.

The particle deposition decreased with increasing EPS, because the EPS filled the pore spaces between individual sediment grains, reducing the porosity of the sediment bed. With decreased porosity, newly deposited particles could not settle in between the grains of the bed, so that particles were more exposed to the flow, making resuspension easier and leading to decreased deposition. For the same level of bio‐cohesion, increasing the near‐bed turbulence diminished deposition. For the vegetated channel, as bio‐cohesion increased, particles were easily resuspended around individual stems due to the enhanced exposure effect, expanding the regions where deposition was excluded and leading to a more heterogeneous spatial distribution of deposition. The effect of EPS was negligible for the smallest velocity magnitude, for which all particles deposited, and for largest velocity magnitude, for which most particles were resuspended."

High‐resolution (30 m) wind field structures in the lower boundary layer at the land‐sea interface were derived using the velocity‐azimuth display technique. This approach captures the wind field structure in unprecedented detail at the scale of tens of meters, providing a fine‐scale view of the coastal wind field during typhoon landfall. It was found that stronger winds were predominantly located at the periphery of the scanning area, where the underlying surface is water, whereas weaker winds tended to occur near the radar, where the underlying surface is land. Analysis of vorticity and divergence revealed small‐scale vortex structures, approximately 100 m in size, embedded within the large‐scale circulation of the typhoon. These structures became less distinct as the typhoon center approached. Furthermore, the turbulent energy spectrum derived from the directly observed radial winds followed Kolmogorov's −5/3 law, indicating that the turbulence was generally isotropic. Additionally, the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) calculated from the DWL data showed good agreement with previous tower‐based observations, particularly in terms of the relationship between TKE and wind speed, confirming the reliability of DWL measurements in capturing turbulence characteristics. These results suggest that DWL can serve as an effective alternative for future turbulence observations during typhoon landfall."

By investigating N concentrations and natural N isotopes in soils and plants, we evaluated and compared contributions of soil EIN and EON to plants of six same genera between Alaskan tundra (AT) with lower mean annual temperature (MAT, −6.8°C) and atmospheric N deposition (AND) (AND, 0.4 kg‐N/ha/yr) and northeastern China peatlands (NECP) with higher MAT (−3.3°C) and AND (5.1 kg‐N/ha/yr). Soil EIN was three times less than EON, but it contributed c.a. 54 ± 7% of N among studied plants. In NECP, higher MAT and AND caused more increments (by three times) in soil EON than EIN, but soil EIN's contributions to plants did not differ between AT (52 ± 6%) and NECP (57 ± 7%). We concluded that soil EIN's contributions to boreal plants are underestimated (by 17%) and insensitive to concurring warmer climates and higher N deposition. These findings highlighted the importance of soil EIN nutrition to boreal plants and suggested potentially more EON losses under projected warming climate and increasing N pollution, which are useful for evaluating responses of N dynamics in boreal ecosystems to global changes."

Understanding long‐term changes in forest composition and resilience is crucial for developing effective, evidence‐based restoration strategies. This study presents a 1,600‐year paleoecological reconstruction of forest dynamics in northeastern China, based on sedimentary pollen records from Sihailongwan Maar Lake. The findings reveal that from 480 to 1930 CE, natural factors primarily governed forest dynamics, allowing for a stable adaptation of mixed coniferous and broadleaved species to climate fluctuations. However, since 1930 CE, human activities have become the dominant force, leading to significant shifts in forest structure, reduced coniferous populations, and a substantial decline in ecological resilience. This study provides an ecological baseline based on naturally driven forest dynamics, offering essential guidance for restoring a resilient mixed coniferous‐broadleaved forest structure. Furthermore, these recommendations emphasize the importance of strengthening forest protection, limiting logging, and engaging local communities in conservation efforts. However, as global warming continues to accelerate, the ecological baseline derived from historical dynamics may become less applicable.

Future assessments should integrate socio‐economic and climatic factors, including extreme climate impacts. However, such assessments are lacking. This study developed a novel framework and integrated model to analyze Chl‐a response in Chaohu Lake to climate (e.g., precipitation, temperature, and wind) and socio‐economic (e.g., population, fertilizer application, and livestock farming). The results indicated that by around 2050, the Chl‐a concentration would change by −6.5% to −0.1% compared to around 2020. While socio‐economic and climatic factors significantly altered nitrogen and phosphorus loading, exogenous loading had a minimal effect on Chl‐a due to high endogenous releases. The decrease in Chl‐a is mainly due to the increase in precipitation. Chl‐a reduction was primarily driven by increased precipitation (0.6%–12.9%), leading to −9.4% to −4.4% Chl‐a changes. The runoff increase also provided an opportunity to treat the heavily polluted lake area. Air temperature increases of 5.1%–9.2% resulted in Chl‐a increases of 0.9%–3.1%. On annual scales the effects of precipitation and temperature were mainly due to changes in mean values. The effects of variability were significant at seasonal scales, for example, lower spring temperatures favored a decrease in summer Chl‐a.

Here the authors show in two mouse models that tumor-specific antigen presentation by B cells, rather than antibody secretion, is essential for tumor suppression. 
 B cells engage in anti-tumor immunity but how they contribute to cancer suppression remains unclear. We report that inhibiting plasma cell differentiation either in IgMi mice lacking Igh elements needed for antibody secretion or in mice with B cell-specific knockout of Blimp-1 (Blimp-1 BcKO) promotes rather than inhibits antitumor immunity and increases numbers of activated B cells. Deficiency of Blimp-1 in tumor-infiltrating B cells generates a unique transcription profile associated with expansion of mutated clones targeting cognate tumor cells. Major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) is required for anti-tumor efficacy. Blimp-1-deficient B cells have increased expression of CD80 and CD86 costimulatory molecules that enhance effector T cell function. The Blimp-1 inhibitor valproic acid suppresses tumor growth in a B cell-dependent manner. Thus, inhibition of plasma cell differentiation results in enhanced tumor-specific antigen presentation by B cells and thereby tumor repression, suggesting a potential avenue of immunotherapy against cancer. The contribution of tumor-infiltrating B cells in anti-tumor immunity is not yet fully understood.

 Thermogenic proteins are down-regulated under thermal stress, including PGC1α· However, the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we addressed that chaperone-mediated autophagy could regulate the stability of PGC1α under thermal stress. In mice, knockdown of Lamp2a, one of the two components of CMA, in BAT showed increased PGC1α protein and improved metabolic phenotypes. Combining the proteomics of brown adipose tissue (BAT), structure prediction, co-immunoprecipitation- mass spectrum and biochemical assays, we found that PARK7, a Parkinson’s disease causative protein, could sense the temperature changes and interact with LAMP2A and HSC70, respectively, subsequently manipulate the activity of CMA. Knockout of Park7 specific in BAT promoted BAT whitening, leading to impaired insulin sensitivity and energy expenditure at thermoneutrality. Moreover, inhibiting the activity of CMA by knockdown of LAMP2A reversed the effects induced by Park7 ablation. These findings suggest CMA is required for BAT to sustain thermoneutrality-induced whitening through degradation of PGC1α.

 Transportin 3 (TNPO3) is a nuclear import receptor known for its broad substrate specificity, often recognizing arginine-serine (SR/RS) repeat-rich nuclear localization signals (NLS) in SRSF proteins. While serine phosphorylation or glutamate presence has been associated with these NLSs, recent proteomic studies identified TNPO3 cargoes lacking SR/RS repeats. One such example is the cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRBP), which contains a non-classical RSY-NLS. Using X-ray crystallography, here we investigate the TNPO3-CIRBP interaction and find that tyrosines within the RSY-NLS play a key role in binding, independent of phosphorylation. Surprisingly, serine and tyrosine phosphorylation in CIRBP’s NLS inhibits TNPO3 binding, suggesting a regulatory mechanism for nuclear import. Our study reveals a non-conventional nuclear import mechanism mediated by TNPO3, which may extend to other known or yet undiscovered TNPO3 cargoes.

 Superconducting circuits provide a versatile and controllable platform for studies of fundamental quantum phenomena as well as for quantum technology applications. A conventional technique to read out the state of a quantum circuit or to characterize its properties is based on RF measurement schemes. Here we demonstrate a simple DC measurement of a thermal spectrometer to investigate properties of a superconducting circuit, in this proof-of-concept experiment a coplanar waveguide resonator. A fraction of the microwave photons in the resonator is absorbed by an on-chip bolometer, resulting in a measurable temperature rise. By monitoring the DC signal of the thermometer due to this process, we are able to determine the resonance frequency and the lineshape (quality factor) of the resonator. The demonstrated scheme, which is a simple DC measurement, offers a wide frequency band potentially reaching up to 200 GHz, far exceeding that of the typical RF spectrometer. Moreover, the thermal measurement yields a highly frequency independent reference level of the Lorentzian absorption signal. In the low power regime, the measurement is fully calibration-free.

 TGFβ superfamily proteins can affect cellular differentiation, thermogenesis, and fibrosis in mammalian adipose tissue. Here we describe a role for Growth Differentiation Factor 3 (GDF3) on mature adipocyte biology. We find inducible GDF3 loss of function in obese adult mice leads to reduced lipolysis, improved glucose tolerance, and reduced glycemic variability. The effects on lipolysis are driven by lower levels of β3-adrenergic receptor, decreased cAMP and PKA signaling. GDF3 is an ALK5, ALK7, ACVR2A and ACVR2B agonist and also a BMPR2 antagonist. Unlike ALK7 or activin E knockouts, acute GDF3 loss of function does not affect body weight or energy balance but significantly improves metabolic health. These results suggest that blocking GDF3 can improve metabolic health independent of body weight and food intake, an intriguing new model for developing anti-diabetic therapies. Together these results provide much-needed clarity to both the molecular pathways involved in GDF3 signaling and its physiological effects.

 Understanding climate change impacts in combination with other anthropogenic stressors, such as chemical pollution, is critical to identifying vulnerable marine ecosystems. This paper presents a systematic review and conceptual model mapping evidence of the marine environmental fate and biological effects of persistent organic pollutants with shifting climate drivers. Increasing ice melt, atmospheric deposition, and sediment remobilization are altering persistent organic pollutant dynamics in northern polar environments, but with data gaps elsewhere. While limited to fish and invertebrates, principal biological effect pathways involve reduced survival and perturbed thermal regulation and bioenergetics, notably in some populations residing in more heavily polluted and thermal edge habitats. Associated food web shifts with climate change are also altering persistent organic pollutant bioaccumulation among some marine mammal and seabird populations and assemblages. The evidence suggests potential ecological deterioration in some areas, with many unknowns underscoring the need for advancing experimental and modeling tools to evaluate these complex interactions.

 To achieve carbon neutrality in China, wood vaulting, which involves semi-permanent wood storage, should be integrated with proper thinning of plantation forests to maximize the forest carbon sink.

 Protected areas (PAs) in Amazon forests are vital in preserving tropical forest ecosystems and mitigating forest degradation. However, the increasing frequency and severity of fires in these regions necessitate a comprehensive understanding of post-fire vegetation recovery trajectories, which is essential to evaluate the effectiveness and resilience of PAs in the face of ongoing climate change. Recovery trajectories under natural conditions remain uncertain, as unregulated human settlements often interfere with or influence the recovery process, skewing the actual recovery rates detected by satellite remote sensing. To tackle this issue, we examined 2990 MODIS-derived fire events in eastern Amazon PAs from 2001 to 2020. We assessed the effectiveness of multi-source Earth observation data and the eXtreme Gradient Boost machine learning model to distinguish burned areas undergoing natural recovery (natural recovery areas) from areas that are permanently converted to other uses (permanently converted areas). We then analyzed greenness recovery rates and canopy structure recovery trajectories across all burned areas, natural recovery areas, and permanently converted areas. Greenness recovery rates were derived from Landsat data, while canopy structure recovery was assessed using GEDI lidar-derived metrics and the space-for-time substitution approach. Our model achieved an overall classification accuracy of 87.90 %, accurately differentiating natural recovery areas (n = 1944) from permanently converted areas (n = 1046). The differing patterns of post-fire greenness recovery rates and structure recovery trajectories highlight the importance of this distinction. In natural recovery areas, significant recovery of structural traits such as relative heights (RHs), canopy cover (CC), and plant area index (PAIs), was observed, returning to their pre-disturbance levels over a 20-year period. Notably, metrics related to understory recovery and plant vertical space use, such as PAI values across the entire vertical strata, exhibited stronger recovery rates than height-related metrics like RHs, highlighting their utility in characterizing complex ecosystem recovery processes. These findings demonstrate the potential and necessity of using multi-source Earth observation data to distinguish different post-fire vegetation recovery processes. This distinction improves our understanding of ecological recovery rates and the successional dynamics of post-fire forests under natural conditions, offering new opportunities to explore their biogeographical distribution, recovery rate variabilities, and impacts on carbon sequestration and ecosystem resilience."

 Glaciers in the European Alps are undergoing significant retreat and thickness decrease due to climate change, contributing to sea-level rise and impacting the mountain environment and its biodiversity, tourism and local economy. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry offers cost-effective methods for high-resolution glacier monitoring. However, multi-temporal UAV-based data usually must be improved in terms of consistency due to possible variable survey conditions, requiring precise co-registration. This study presents a novel application of the Iterative Closest Point algorithm of the NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline to co-register Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) from UAV images of Forni Glacier (Italy) collected under different conditions from 2014 to 2022. We co-registered the DEMs generated from Structure-from-Motion/Multi-View Stereo matching within a pairwise structure. This process demonstrated clear improvements in data consistency, with mean and median values tending to zero, RMSEs below 0.50 m, and NMADs below 0.32 m. The comparison of co-registered DEM highlighted glacier thickness losses at the terminus reaching 50 m, with side areas showing smaller reductions of around 25 m between 2014 and 2022."

 Chemical transport models often use moderate spatial resolution to simulate atmospheric pollution, thereby limiting the model's ability to represent variations in urban areas. Additionally, the contributions of individual sources of pollution transported to the urban areas of interest from elsewhere are rarely quantified. In this study, we developed an approach to simulate air quality, focusing on PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter lower than 2.5 μm), and its local and regional sources at high spatial resolution of 1 × 1 km2. The approach is applied in the largest city of Greece, Athens. The PMCAMx chemical transport model is employed in combination with the source apportionment algorithm, PSAT (Particle Source Apportionment Technology), to quantify the concentrations and sources of PM2.5, organic aerosol (OA) and elemental carbon (EC) for a typical summer and winter month. A novel approach is developed, allowing the quantification of the contributions of sources not only inside the simulated urban area but also of the regional sources located outside. Model predictions were combined with population distribution data to provide estimations for human exposure not only to total PM2.5 concentrations but also to specific sources within the city. Residential biomass burning and transportation were found to be the dominant local sources of PM2.5 exposure. The higher resolution (1 × 1 km2) offered a more detailed representation of PM2.5 spatial variability than a coarser one (36 × 36 km2). This underscores the importance of capturing local sources in specific areas of the domain. The proposed approach can be used to provide estimates of human exposure to specific local and regional sources of primary and secondary PM2.5 in an urban area."

 Extratropical cyclones (ECs) are large-scale synoptic weather systems characterised by complex mesoscale precipitation-generating features. Unresolved questions remain regarding how their water budget varies depending on the origin of the rainfall. This study aims to address this gap by examining the variability in moisture uptake patterns across EC precipitation structures. To achieve this, 237 cases were selected during the maximum deep phase over the North Atlantic (NATL). The study utilizes ERA5 downscaled simulations and Lagrangian moisture source diagnostics to identify key moisture parameters. We compare different precipitation-targeting approaches, including the radius, Warm Conveyor Belt (WCB) footprint, and square root spiral contours centred on the EC. The radius approach captures central precipitation and innermost rainbands, while the WCB target better represents the full extent. The NATL region was divided into sectors to facilitate a detailed analysis of geographic influences and dynamic factors, including moisture availability. Using the radius approach, moisture sources in the western/W and northern/N NATL are predominantly aligned along the Gulf Stream. When considering WCB and spiral targets, the 95th percentile moisture uptake pattern expands into the subtropics. Moisture patterns shift southward and intensify for broader targets. In NNATL ECs, the spiral region's moisture source shows peak uptake at ∼3000 km, exceeding the radial target's 1500 km. WNATL ECs exhibit intense moisture uptake, with a southwest (southeast) source extending up to 4500 (4000) km. In eastern/E NATL, EC-relative composites indicate evenly distributed moisture uptake, constrained within a 2000 km radius."

We found that temperatures were higher at night, and weather patterns had a bigger impact during the day, while human activities mattered more at night. This helps us understand and address urban overheating. 
 Synoptic weather patterns (SWPs) and human activities are significant driving factors of the canopy urban heat island effect (CUHI), and the CUHI phenomenon exhibits a pronounced diurnal cycle. However, to date, there has been a significant knowledge gap in understanding how the combination of SWPs and human activities modulates the diurnal cycle of CUHI. This study systematically analyzed the diurnal patterns of CUHI intensity (CUHII) in the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA) by integrating multiple source datasets and utilizing objective classification methods. Among all SWPs, type 2 (dominated by subtropical high pressure) exhibited the strongest CUHII, while type 4 (affected by southwestern moisture and southward cold air) had the lowest. In terms of human activities, landscape percentage (PLAND), largest patch index (LPI), and anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) showed an increasing trend, with higher values in the east and lower values in the west, coinciding with the spatiotemporal patterns of CUHII. These findings collectively confirm the pivotal roles of SWPs and human activities in CUHI phenomena. More importantly, this paper quantifies the contributions of SWPs and human activities to the diurnal cycle of CUHI using a random forest (RF) model. Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) revealed that SWPs had a more pronounced influence on daytime CUHII, whereas human activities dominated nighttime CUHII. During the daytime, the partial dependence plot (PDP) of relative humidity (RH) decreased more pronouncedly, explaining why type 4 contributed more significantly to CUHII during this period. When the wind speed (WS) exceeded a threshold, PDP rapidly increased, which might account for the higher contribution of type 5 to CUHII during this period. During the nighttime, there appeared to be a threshold for PLAND, beyond which its impact on improving CUHII became markedly more prominent. These results indicated that there was a clear diurnal asymmetry in the modulation of CUHI by SWPs and human activities. In conclusion, this study not only provided scientific insight into the complex driving mechanisms of the CUHI diurnal cycle in YRDUA, but also offered a theoretical foundation for evaluating urban overheating issues and developing effective mitigation strategies."

We use machine learning (ML) to establish the TEC (ML-TEC) model related to the solar/geomagnetic activities and seasonal change from the TEC data. Subtracting the ML-TEC from the observed TEC, we find a global SSW-induced enhancement in diurnal/semidiurnal TEC variations. 
 A sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) is a breakdown of the winter stratospheric polar vortex. It has atmospheric effects in both the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere, leading to disturbances in the whole ionosphere. Previous case studies have shown that SSW effects are observed mainly in the low-latitude ionosphere, and each SSW event may have a different effect on the ionosphere due to complex dynamics from solar and geomagnetic activities and seasonal changes. However, the SSW-induced tidal variability in the mid- to high-latitude ionosphere is only identified for several events, and its behaviour is not well understood. Here we analyse major SSW influences on diurnal/semidiurnal variations of the global ionosphere with global maps of total electron content (TEC) from 1998 to 2022. We use machine learning (ML) with neural networks to establish the TEC (ML-TEC) model related to the solar/geomagnetic activities and seasonal changes from the long-term global TEC data. The TEC variations due to SSWs are extracted by subtracting the ML-TEC from the observed TEC. A comprehensive composite analysis of 18 major SSW events shows for the first time a globally SSW-induced enhancement in diurnal/semidiurnal TEC variations. The enhancement is strongest at equatorial ionospheric anomaly (EIA) crests, moderate at midlatitudes, and vague in the high-latitude ionosphere. It also exhibits hemispheric asymmetry and longitudinal differences. While the semidiurnal enhancement starts earlier and peaks at ∼8 d after SSW onset, the diurnal one starts on the SSW onset day and peaks around 20–30 d after SSW onset. The enhancement of both semidiurnal and diurnal TEC variations lasts for about 20–50 d  after SSW onset. The SSW-related E-region dynamo is likely the dominant mechanism, which is not strong enough to produce discernible TEC variations in the high-latitude ionosphere. ML-TEC does not contain the SSW effect and is thus a valuable reference for the ionospheric state without an SSW."

Our findings provide new insights into downburst behavior and offer valuable data for improving models to predict their impacts in a changing climate. 
 Thunderstorm downbursts are windstorms due to intense negatively-buoyant flows produced beneath cumulonimbus clouds. Their study has recently attracted significant scientific and media attention due to the current and projected impacts of climate change. During their vertical descent phase (i.e., the downdraft), followed by a horizontal outflow, downbursts can cause severe damage to both natural ecosystems and built environments. Warm, humid air is lifted upward through natural or forced convective mechanisms, where it condenses into a cumulonimbus cloud. Inside the cloud, the air parcels – now colder and denser than the surrounding environment – sink due to buoyancy. Thermal and dynamic instabilities between the cold air jet and the environment generate a symmetrical vortex, known as the primary vortex (PV), which drives both the downdraft and the subsequent horizontal outflow at the surface. This vortex flow structure can have devastating effects on the ground."

 Polar Mesoscale Cyclones (PMCs), particularly their intense subset known as Polar Lows (PLs), characterized by short lifespans of 3-36 hours and horizontal scales below 1,000 km, pose significant hazards to polar maritime activities due to extreme winds exceeding 15 m s⁻¹ and wave heights surpassing 11 meters.

This paper responds to both interest in exploiting CMIP data standards in a broader range of climate modelling activities and a need to achieve greater clarity about the significance and intention of variables in the CMIP Data Request. As Earth system modelling archives grow in scale and complexity, there are emerging problems associated with weak standardisation at the variable collection level.

By integrating the sea ice thickness data into the model, the spring prediction barrier of Arctic sea ice is optimized significantly. The model achieves better skills than the typical numerical model in predicting September’s sea ice extent seasonally. The sea ice thickness data play a key role in reducing the prediction errors of the Beaufort Sea, the East Siberian Sea and the Laptev Sea. 
 The Arctic sea ice suffers dramatic retreat in summer and fall, which has far-reaching consequences for the global climate and commercial activities. Accurate seasonal sea ice predictions significantly infer climate change and are crucial for planning commercial activities. However, seasonal prediction of the summer sea ice encounters a significant obstacle known as the spring predictability barrier (SPB): predictions made later than the date of melt onset (roughly May) demonstrate good skill in predicting summer sea ice, while predictions made during or earlier than May exhibit considerably lower skill. This study develops a transformer-based deep learning model, SICNetseason (V1.0), to predict the Arctic sea ice concentration on a seasonal scale. Including spring sea ice thickness (SIT) data in the model significantly improves the prediction skill at the SPB point. A 20-year (2000–2019) test demonstrates that the detrended anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) of September sea ice extent (sea ice concentration >15 %) predicted by our model during May and April is improved by 7.7 % and 10.61 %, respectively, compared to the ACC predicted by the state-of-the-art dynamic model SEAS5 from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Compared with the anomaly persistence benchmark, the mentioned improvement is 41.02 % and 36.33 %. Our deep learning model significantly reduces prediction errors in terms of September's sea ice concentration on seasonal scales compared to SEAS5 and the anomaly persistence model (Persistence).

This study aimed to investigate the potential of 6PPD and 6PPD-Q to induce endometrial cell dysfunction through nuclear estrogen receptor (ER) and G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) signaling pathways. Fluorescence competitive binding and reporter gene assays revealed that 6PPD and 6PPD-Q selectively bound to ERα (not ERβ) and activated ER transcriptional activity, with the lowest observed effective concentrations (LOECs) of 500 and 10 nM, respectively. Calcium mobilization assays further demonstrated that both 6PPD and 6PPD-Q activated the GPER nongenomic pathway in a concentration-dependent manner (LOEC = 1 nM). 6PPD-Q exhibited stronger ERα and GPER activation potency than 6PPD, which was explained well by molecular dynamics simulation. 6PPD and 6PPD-Q stimulated endometrial cell proliferation via ERα/GPER signaling pathways, mechanistically linked to Cyclin D1/Ki67 upregulation. Furthermore, 6PPD/6PPD-Q promoted endometrial cell migration through an ERα/GPER-regulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition and inflammatory responses. Notably, the LOECs for these functional disruptions reached nanomolar levels relevant to human exposure. Collectively, we elucidated the molecular initial events and downstream key events of 6PPD/6PPD-Q-induced endometrial cell dysfunction, which implied their threat to the reproductive system and provided novel perspectives for their health risk evaluation."

Quantitative AOPs (qAOPs) further allow estimation of points of departure (PODs) along a cascade of toxicological events and prediction of final adverse outcome(s) based on early key events. The present study developed a zebrafish-based qAOP model for an OECD-endorsed AOP linking aromatase inhibition to reproductive dysfunction (AOPWiki, AOP no. 25). The model was built based on newly generated laboratory data from a prototypical aromatase inhibitor propiconazole (PRO) and further challenged by another chemical tebuconazole (TEB) to evaluate the model’s performance and applicability. We found that female and male zebrafish have different effects to establish AOP after exposure to PRO and qAOP was expanded and applied to cross-species prediction with fathead minnow. During the environmentally relevant concentrations of PRO and TEB for 21 days, aromatase CYP19, vitellogenin, and steroidogenesis were affected significantly, and the reproduction of zebrafish significantly decreased. The present study aimed to expand the mechanism of aromatase and assembled quantitative AOP in zebrafish and further linked with in vitro, which extended aromatase inhibitor-mediated reproductive dysfunction as a demonstrative case of published qAOP model in fathead minnow Pimephales promelas (AOPWiki, AOP no. 25)."

Despite most microplastics suffering from natural aging, little is known about the effect of aging microplastics (A-MPs) on ARGs dissemination. Here, we demonstrated significant suppression of A-MPs on ARGs dissemination in natural rivers. Although ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were effectively enriched on A-MPs, the relative abundance of ARGs and MGEs on A-MPs as well as in receiving water decreased by approximately 21.4% to 42.3% during a period of 30 days of dissemination. Further investigation revealed that •OH was consistently generated on A-MPs with a maximum value of 0.2 μmol/g. Importantly, scavenging of •OH significantly increased the relative abundance of ARGs and MGEs both on A-MPs and in receiving water 1.4–29.1 times, indicating the vital role of •OH in suppressing ARGs dissemination. Microbial analysis revealed that •OH inhibited the potential antibiotic-resistant bacteria in surface biofilms, such as Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter (with a decrease of 68.8% and 89.3%). These results demonstrated that •OH was extensively produced on A-MPs, which greatly reduced both the vertical and horizontal gene transfer of ARGs.

However, the transgenerational inheritance of these cognitive deficits and the underlying epigenetic mechanisms remain poorly understood. The present study investigated the inter- and transgenerational effects of ancestral arsenic exposure on the cognitive performance (latent learning) of zebrafish via maternal and paternal lineages and the underlying biochemical and molecular alterations in the brain, including the DNA methylation patterns of cognition-related genes. Adult male zebrafish exposed to dietary arsenic [30, 60, or 100 μg/g as arsenite for 90 days; F0 generation] were crossed with unexposed (control) females and vice versa to generate F1 progeny of maternal and paternal arsenic exposure, respectively. Subsequently, F1 males and females of the same treatments were crossed to generate the F2 progeny of the respective maternal and paternal lineages of ancestral arsenic exposure. It was found that ancestral arsenic exposure induced cognitive dysfunction in F1 and F2 generations of both maternal and paternal lineages. However, the effects occurred at relatively lower levels of ancestral arsenic exposure (30 and 60 μg/g) in the former treatment relative to those (100 μg/g) in the latter. Inter (F1) and transgenerational (F2) cognitive effects of arsenic were associated with concomitant elevated oxidative stress and dopaminergic dysregulation, including repressed expression of cognition-related genes such as genes involved in dopamine signaling and metabolism (Drd1 and MAO) and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Furthermore, DNA methylation analyses revealed that the downregulation of these genes across three generations (F0 to F2) resulted from the hypermethylation in their promotor regions (Drd1, MAO, BDNF).

However, conventional characterization techniques face challenges in providing high three-dimensional resolution and precise compositional analysis of mixed scales, which hinders in-depth elucidation of the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we combined the exceptional depth resolution of time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and the superior mixed-scale discrimination capability of thermogravimetry-infrared spectroscopy (TG-IR) to analyze Si/Al scaling, a common issue in industrial RO systems. Under acid conditions, ToF-SIMS measurements revealed Al species enrichment on the membrane surface, attributed to the strong affinity between Al3+ and the membrane. The preferential deposition of Al3+ further facilitated the heterogeneous nucleation of polymerized silica through the electrostatic shielding effect, leading to the rapid formation of a thin and dense scaling layer. In contrast, neutral and alkaline conditions produced a slower-developing, uniform, thicker, and loosely structured scaling layer through physical deposition of supersaturated Si/Al complex scales. TG-IR analysis revealed that neutral conditions favored coprecipitated adsorption-bound Si/Al species (6-coordinate Al) and Si/Al polymers (4-coordinate Al), whereas alkaline conditions primarily produced coprecipitated silica and Al(OH)4−. These findings advance the mechanistic understanding of Si/Al scaling and provide a foundation for targeted control strategies in silica-metal combined scaling in RO systems."

Photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) technology has emerged as an effective strategy for pollutant removal, but its application in real tobacco smoke purification and associated health impacts remains underexplored. Herein, we investigated the simultaneous removal of PM and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from tobacco smoke using a PCO purifier. The PCO purifier exhibited superior PM removal, achieving 99% efficiency within 10 min and reducing ultrafine PM concentrations to one-tenth of those observed with high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration. The 63 main VOCs, predominantly oxygenated VOCs, were identified in tobacco smoke with the PCO purifier exhibiting over 99% removal efficiency within 300 min. Furthermore, the PCO purifier demonstrated exceptional stability and long-term durability across varying humidity levels and smoke concentrations. The hazard index (HI) was quantified to evaluate the health risks associated with tobacco smoke. The PCO purifier reduced HI by 95% within 120 min, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating exposure risks. Additionally, the major HI was primarily established from four key indicator compounds (i.e., 2,5-dimethylfuran, 2,3-butanedione, n-nitrosomethylethylamine, and isocyanic acid), which reliably estimated the overall health risks during the purification of tobacco smoke.

However, this remains underexplored, particularly in the South China Sea (SCS), where radioactivity is derived from both the close-in fallout of the Pacific Proving Ground (PPG) and the global fallout. Additionally, this region is quite sensitive to climate change. A coral core collected from Xisha Island, SCS, was initially analyzed for high-radiotoxicity 239,240Pu. Approximately 72–84% of plutonium in coral originated from the close-in fallout of PPG through ocean current compared to the direct global fallout. However, the 239,240Pu concentration still remains in background levels and does not show a significant radiation risk. After 1980, a distinct pattern emerged characterized by a “higher” concentration but a “lower” 240Pu/239Pu atom ratio compared to the levels in the open west Pacific. This is primarily attributed to the seasonal upwelling of subsurface seawater on the continental shelf of SCS, driven by the prevailing southwest monsoon. Significantly elevated 239,240Pu concentrations were observed during typical ENSO years 1983, 1988, and 1997. This is due to the elevated temperature, coral bleaching, and expulsion of symbiotic zooxanthellae. After expulsion, zooxanthellae containing higher 239,240Pu compared to skeleton rapidly die, and their debris directly deposit onto the coral skeleton, in contrast to the metabolic way of 239,240Pu during normal years. This finding offers critical insights into ecosystem protection in SCS amid global changes and the potential threat of nuclear contamination."

However, the direct cause of this inverted land‐sea contrast (ILSC) of HPI is still unclear. We find the ERA5 data generally reproduces the above ILSC pattern, although its heavier HPI centers are generally weaker than CMORPH data. Then we find the distribution of convective precipitation (CP) plays a key role based on ERA5 data. The CP intensity centers match well with that of the hourly total precipitation over land areas, which are generally greater than those over ocean; contrarily, the large‐scale precipitation intensity centers are mainly located in ocean.

In this study, we use the ground‐based observations collected at Davis, Antarctica during the Precipitation over Land and The Southern Ocean field campaign in austral summer of 2019 to assess the capability of the high‐resolution regional Unified Model (UM) to reproduce precipitating clouds off coastal Antarctica. We test the new UM RAL3 (Regional Atmosphere and Land 3) configuration with double‐moment Cloud AeroSol Interacting Microphysics scheme and bimodal cloud fraction scheme, running at the spatial resolution of 1.5‐km. We compare it to the previous RA2M configuration with a single‐moment cloud microphysics scheme and unimodal cloud fraction scheme. The RAL3 exhibits marginally degraded meteorological conditions relative to RA2M compared with observations. For cloud properties, the UM regional models can generally simulate the phase, vertical structure and timing of events during the sublimation and precipitation periods. Nevertheless, overestimated ice water path and potentially underestimated liquid water path (LWP) contribute to positive surface shortwave biases and negative longwave biases. The RA2M simulates more LWP, though we suggest for the wrong reasons due to its ice nucleating parameterization. Our results suggest that the new double‐moment cloud microphysics combined with bimodal cloud fraction parameterizations, while having reduced performance in some respects, has large potential to better represent low‐level mixed phase clouds for this region."

Site‐scale validations showed that ETFYEDVI generated overall good accuracy (R2 = 0.78, bias of −0.1 mm day−1) across forest, grass, crop, and desert sites. Basin‐scale evaluations further demonstrated the stable and small bias (R2 of 0.96, bias of −22.2 mm year−1) in annual ETFYEDVI from southern humid to arid inland basins. This accuracy was comparable or better than those of four global satellite ET products. More importantly, ETFYEDVI produced low and stable accumulative bias under increasing cloud conditions, and characterized the spatiotemporal variability in continental ET even under heavy cloud cover (>90%) conditions.

Reliable estimates of the volcanic eruption response as simulated by climate models are needed to reconstruct past climate variability. Yet, the ability of models to represent the response to both single‐eruption events and a combination of eruptions remains uncertain. We use the Community Earth System Model version 2 along with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 6, known as CESM2(WACCM6), to study the global‐mean surface temperature (GMST) response to idealized single volcano eruptions at the equator, ranging in size from Mt. Pinatubo‐type events to supereruptions. Additionally, we simulate the GMST response to double‐eruption events with eruption separations of a few years. For large idealized eruptions, we demonstrate that double‐eruption events separated by 4 years combine linearly in terms of GMST response. In addition, the temporal development is similar across all single volcanic eruptions injecting at least 400 Tg SO2 $\left({\mathrm{S}\mathrm{O}}_{2}\right)$ into the atmosphere. Because only a few eruptions in the past millennium occurred within 4 years of a previous eruption, we assume that the historical record can be represented as a superposition of single‐eruption events. Hence, we employ a deconvolution method to estimate a nonparametric historical GMST response pulse function for volcanic eruptions, based on climate simulation data from 850 to 1850 taken from a previous study. By applying the estimated GMST response pulse function, we can reconstruct most of the underlying historical GMST signal. Furthermore, the GMST response is significantly perturbed for at least 7 years following eruptions."

 Evidence indicates that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) exist at the centres of most galaxies. Their mass correlates with the galactic bulge mass1, suggesting a coevolution with their host galaxies2, most likely through powerful winds3. X-ray observations have detected highly ionized winds outflowing at sub-relativistic speeds from the accretion disks around SMBHs4,5. However, the limited spectral resolution of present X-ray instruments has left the physical structure and location of the winds poorly understood, hindering accurate estimates of their kinetic power6,7. Here the first X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) observation of the luminous quasar PDS 456 is reported. The high-resolution spectrometer Resolve aboard XRISM enabled the discovery of five discrete velocity components outflowing at 20–30% of the speed of light. This demonstrates that the wind structure is highly inhomogeneous, which probably consists of up to a million clumps. The mass outflow rate is estimated to be 60–300 solar masses per year, with the wind kinetic power exceeding the Eddington luminosity limit. Compared with the galaxy-scale outflows, the kinetic power is more than three orders of magnitude larger, whereas the momentum flux is ten times larger. These estimates disfavour both energy-driven and momentum-driven outflow models. This suggests that such wind activity occurs in less than 10% of the quasar phase and/or that its energy/momentum is not efficiently transferred to the galaxy-scale outflows owing to the clumpiness of the wind and the interstellar medium. Observations of a luminous quasar from the high-resolution spectrometer Resolve aboard XRISM revealed highly inhomogeneous wind structure outflowing from a supermassive black hole, which probably consists of up to a million clumps."

 The pressures humanity has been placing on the environment have put Earth’s stability at risk. The planetary boundaries framework serves as a method to define a ‘safe operating space for humanity’1,2 and has so far been applied mostly to highlight the currently prevailing unsustainable environmental conditions. The ability to evaluate trends over time, however, can help us explore the consequences of alternative policy decisions and identify pathways for living within planetary boundaries3. Here we use the Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment4 to project control variables for eight out of nine planetary boundaries under alternative scenarios to 2050, both with and without strong environmental policy measures. The results show that, with current trends and policies, the situation is projected to worsen to 2050 for all planetary boundaries, except for ozone depletion. Targeted interventions, such as implementing the Paris climate agreement, a shift to a healthier diet, improved food, and water- and nutrient-use efficiency, can effectively reduce the degree of transgression of the planetary boundaries, steering humanity towards a more sustainable trajectory (that is, if they can be implemented based on social and institutional feasibility considerations). However, even in this scenario, several planetary boundaries, including climate change, biogeochemical flows and biodiversity, will remain transgressed in 2050, partly as result of inertia. This means that more-effective policy measures will be needed to ensure we are living well within the planetary boundaries. Current trends imply that we will transgress most of the planetary boundaries by 2050; however, ambitious, urgent and universal action to ameliorate climate change and increase resource efficiency can effectively reduce the degree of transgression."

 Signals from the microenvironment are known to be critical for development, stem cell self-renewal and oncogenic progression. Although some niche-driven signals that promote cancer progression have been identified1–5, concerted efforts to map disease-relevant microenvironmental ligands of cancer stem cell receptors have been lacking. Here, we use temporal single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify molecular cues from the bone marrow stromal niche that engage leukaemia stem-enriched cells (LSCs) during oncogenic progression. We integrate these data with our human LSC RNA-seq and in vivo CRISPR screen of LSC dependencies6 to identify LSC–niche interactions that are essential for leukaemogenesis. These analyses identify the taurine–taurine transporter (TAUT) axis as a critical dependency of aggressive myeloid leukaemias. We find that cysteine dioxygenase type 1 (CDO1)-driven taurine biosynthesis is restricted to osteolineage cells, and increases during myeloid disease progression. Blocking CDO1 expression in osteolineage cells impairs LSC growth and improves survival outcomes. Using TAUT genetic loss-of-function mouse models and patient-derived acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells, we show that TAUT inhibition significantly impairs in vivo myeloid leukaemia progression. Consistent with elevated TAUT expression in venetoclax-resistant AML, TAUT inhibition synergizes with venetoclax to block the growth of primary human AML cells. Mechanistically, our multiomic approaches indicate that the loss of taurine uptake inhibits RAG-GTP dependent mTOR activation and downstream glycolysis. Collectively, our work establishes the temporal landscape of stromal signals during leukaemia progression and identifies taurine as a key regulator of myeloid malignancies. The taurine–taurine transporter axis is a critical dependency of aggressive myeloid leukaemias."

 Electrochemical CO2 reduction into chemicals and fuels holds great promise for renewable energy storage and carbon recycling1–3. Although high-temperature CO2 electroreduction in solid oxide electrolysis cells is industrially relevant, current catalysts have modest energy efficiency and a limited lifetime at high current densities, generally below 70% and 200 h, respectively, at 1 A cm−2 and temperatures of 800 °C or higher4–8. Here we develop an encapsulated Co–Ni alloy catalyst using Sm2O3-doped CeO2 that exhibits an energy efficiency of 90% and a lifetime of more than 2,000 h at 1 A cm−2 for high-temperature CO2-to-CO conversion at 800 °C. Its selectivity towards CO is about 100%, and its single-pass yield reaches 90%. We show that the efficacy of our catalyst arises from its unique encapsulated structure and optimized alloy composition, which simultaneously enable enhanced CO2 adsorption, moderate CO adsorption and suppressed metal agglomeration. This work provides an efficient strategy for the design of catalysts for high-temperature reactions that overcomes the typical trade-off between activity and stability and has potential industrial applications.

Smorra,Proton transport from the antimatter factory of CERN,"The successful transport of a trapped proton cloud from the antimatter factory of CERN using a transportable, superconducting, autonomous and open Penning-trap system that can distribute antiprotons into other experiments is reported. 
 Precision measurements using low-energy antiprotons, exclusively available at the antimatter factory (AMF) of CERN1, offer stringent tests of charge–parity–time (CPT) invariance, which is a fundamental symmetry in the Standard Model of particle physics2. These tests have been realized, for example, in antiprotonic helium3 and antihydrogen4. In our cryogenic Penning-trap experiments5, we measure the magnetic moments6,7 and charge-to-mass ratios of protons and antiprotons and now provide the most precise test of CPT invariance in the baryon sector8. Our experiments are limited by magnetic field fluctuations imposed by the decelerators in the AMF; therefore, we are advancing the relocation of antiprotons to dedicated precision laboratories. Here we present the successful transport of a trapped proton cloud from the AMF using BASE-STEP9—a transportable, superconducting, autonomous and open Penning-trap system that can distribute antiprotons into other experiments. We transferred the trapped protons from our experimental area at the AMF onto a truck and transported them across the Meyrin site of CERN, demonstrating autonomous operation without external power for 4 h and loss-free proton relocation. We thereby confirm the feasibility of transferring particles into low-noise laboratories in the vicinity of the AMF and of using a power generator on the truck10 to reach laboratories throughout Europe. This marks the potential start of a new era in precision antimatter research, enabling low-noise measurements of antiprotons, the charged antimatter ions

Turner,Divergent DNA methylation dynamics in marsupial and eutherian embryos,"A study reports on the DNA methylation dynamics during embryogenesis in marsupials, showing that these differ from those occurring during embryogenesis in eutherian mammals. 
 Based on seminal work in placental species (eutherians)1–10, a paradigm of mammalian development has emerged wherein the genome-wide erasure of parental DNA methylation is required for embryogenesis. Whether such DNA methylation reprogramming is, in fact, conserved in other mammals is unknown. Here, to resolve this point, we generated base-resolution DNA methylation maps in gametes, embryos and adult tissues of a marsupial, the opossum Monodelphis domestica, revealing variations from the eutherian-derived model. The difference in DNA methylation level between oocytes and sperm is less pronounced than that in eutherians. Furthermore, unlike the genome of eutherians, that of the opossum remains hypermethylated during the cleavage stages. In the blastocyst, DNA demethylation is transient and modest in the epiblast. However, it is sustained in the trophectoderm, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved function for DNA hypomethylation in the mammalian placenta. Furthermore, unlike that in eutherians, the inactive X chromosome becomes globally DNA hypomethylated during embryogenesis. We identify gamete differentially methylated regions that exhibit distinct fates in the embryo, with some transient, and others retained and that represent candidate imprinted loci. We also reveal a possible mechanism for imprinted X inactivation, through maternal DNA methylation of the Xist-like noncoding RNA RSX11. We conclude that the evolutionarily divergent eutherians and marsupials use DNA demethylation differently during embryogenesis. A study reports on the DNA methylation dynamics during embryogenesis in marsupials, showing that these differ from those occurring during embryogenesis in eutherian mammals."

Silver,A human-specific enhancer fine-tunes radial glia potency and corticogenesis,"HARE5, a human accelerated region enhancer, modulates cortical development by influencing neural progenitor cell behaviour, leading to an enlarged neocortex with increased functional independence between cortical regions through amplified WNT signalling. 
 Humans have evolved an extraordinarily expanded and complex cerebral cortex associated with developmental and gene regulatory modifications1–3. Human accelerated regions (HARs) are highly conserved DNA sequences with human-specific nucleotide substitutions. Although there are thousands of annotated HARs, their functional contribution to species-specific cortical development remains largely unknown4,5. HARE5 is a HAR transcriptional enhancer of the WNT signalling receptor Frizzled8 that is active during brain development6. Here, using genome-edited mouse (Mus musculus, Mm) and primate models, we demonstrated that human (Homo sapiens, Hs) HARE5 fine-tunes cortical development and connectivity by controlling the proliferative and neurogenic capacities of neural progenitor cells. Hs-HARE5 knock-in mice have significantly enlarged neocortices, containing more excitatory neurons. By measuring neural dynamics in vivo, we showed that these anatomical features result in increased functional independence between cortical regions. We assessed underlying developmental mechanisms using fixed and live imaging, lineage analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing. We discovered that Hs-HARE5 modifies radial glial cell behaviour, with increased self-renewal at early developmental stages, followed by expanded neurogenic potential. Using genome-edited human and chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes, Pt) neural progenitor cells and cortical organoids, we showed that four human-specific variants of Hs-HARE5 drive increased enhancer activity that promotes progenitor proliferation. Finally, we showed that Hs-HARE5 increased progenitor proliferation by amplifying canonical WNT signalling. These findings illustrate how small changes in regulatory DNA can directly affect critical signalling pathways to modulate brain development. Our study uncovered new functions of HARs as key regulatory elements crucial for the expansion and complexity of the human cerebral cortex. HARE5, a human accelerated region enhancer, modulates cortical development by influencing neural progenitor cell behaviour, leading to an enlarged neocortex with increased functional independence between cortical regions through amplified WNT signalling."

 Here we report on the nearly complete and uncrushed 14th specimen of Archaeopteryx. Exceptional preservation and preparation guided by micro-computed tomographic data make this one of the best exemplars of this iconic taxon, preserving important data regarding skeletal transformation and plumage evolution in relation to the acquisition of flight during early avian evolution. The ventrolaterally exposed skull reveals a palatal morphology intermediate between troodontids1 and crownward Cretaceous birds2,3. Modifications of the skull reflect the shift towards a less rigid cranial architecture in archaeopterygids from non-avian theropods. The complete vertebral column reveals paired proatlases and a tail longer than previously recognized. Skin traces on the right major digit of the hand suggest that the minor digit was free and mobile distally, contrary to previous interpretations4. The morphology of the foot pads indicates that they were adapted for non-raptorial terrestrial locomotion. Specialized inner secondary feathers called tertials5,6 are observed on both wings. Humeral tertials are absent in non-avian dinosaurs closely related to birds, suggesting that these feathers evolved for flight, creating a continuous aerodynamic surface. These new findings clarify the mosaic of traits present in Archaeopteryx, refine ecological predictions and elucidate the unique evolutionary history of the Archaeopterygidae, providing clues regarding the ancestral avian condition.

 The known fossil record of crown-group amniotes begins in the late Carboniferous with the sauropsid trackmaker Notalacerta1,2 and the sauropsid body fossil Hylonomus1–4. The earliest body fossils of crown-group tetrapods are mid-Carboniferous, and the oldest trackways are early Carboniferous5–7. This suggests that the tetrapod crown group originated in the earliest Carboniferous (early Tournaisian), with the amniote crown group appearing in the early part of the late Carboniferous. Here we present new trackway data from Australia that challenge this widely accepted timeline. A track-bearing slab from the Snowy Plains Formation of Victoria, Taungurung Country, securely dated to the early Tournaisian8,9, shows footprints from a crown-group amniote with clawed feet, most probably a primitive sauropsid. This pushes back the likely origin of crown-group amniotes by at least 35–40 million years. We also extend the range of Notalacerta into the early Carboniferous. The Australian tracks indicate that the amniote crown-group node cannot be much younger than the Devonian/Carboniferous boundary, and that the tetrapod crown-group node must be located deep within the Devonian; an estimate based on molecular-tree branch lengths suggests an approximate age of early Frasnian for the latter. The implications for the early evolution of tetrapods are profound; all stem-tetrapod and stem-amniote lineages must have originated during the Devonian. It seems that tetrapod evolution proceeded much faster, and the Devonian tetrapod record is much less complete, than has been thought. Analysis of a fossil trackway from the earliest Carboniferous of Australia shows prints of toes with claws, suggesting that the origin of amniotes was at least 35–40 million years earlier than previously thought."

 High-capacity lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) play a critical role as power sources across diverse applications, including portable electronics, electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable-energy-storage systems1. However, there is growing concern about the safety of integrated LIB systems, with reports of up to 9,486 incidents between 2020 and 2024 (ref. 2). To ensure the safe application of commercial LIBs, it is essential to capture internal signals that enable early failure diagnosis and warning. Monitoring non-uniform temperature and strain distributions within the jelly-roll structures of the battery provides a promising approach to achieving this goal3,4. Here we propose a miniaturized and low-power-consumption system capable of accurate sensing and wireless transmission of internal temperature and strain signals inside LIBs, with negligible influence on its performance. The acquisition of internal temperature signals and the area ratio between initial internal-short-circuited regions and battery electrodes enables quantitative analysis of thermal fusing and thermal runaway phenomena, leading to the evaluation of the intensity of battery thermal runaway and recognition of thermal abuse behaviours. This work provides a foundation for designing next-generation smart LIBs with safety warning and failure positioning capabilities.

 The structural evolution of molecular hydrogen H2 under multi-megabar compression and its relation to atomic metallic hydrogen is a key unsolved problem in condensed-matter physics. Although dozens of crystal structures have been proposed by theory1–4, only one, the simple hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) structure of only spherical disordered H2, has been previously confirmed in experiments5. Through advancing nano-focused synchrotron X-ray probes, here we report the observation of the transition from hcp H2 to a post-hcp structure with a six-fold larger supercell at pressures above 212 GPa, indicating the change of spherical H2 to various ordered configurations.

This supercell has not been reported by any previous theoretical study for the post-hcp phase, but is close to a number of theoretical models with mixed-layer structures. The evidence of a structural transition beyond hcp establishes the trend of H2 molecular association towards polymerization at extreme pressures, giving clues about the nature of the molecular-to-atomic transition of metallic hydrogen. Considering the spectroscopic behaviours that show strong vibrational and bending peaks of H2 up to 400 GPa, it would be prudent to speculate the continuation of hydrogen molecular polymerization up to its metallization. The observation of the transition from hcp H2 to a post-hcp structure with a six-fold larger supercell at pressures above 212 GPa is reported, indicating the trend of H2 polymerization through molecular association."

 The mammalian gut harbours trillions of commensal bacteria that interact with their hosts through various bioactive molecules1,2. However, the mutualistic strategies that hosts evolve to benefit from these symbiotic relationships are largely unexplored. Here we report that mouse enterocytes secrete apolipoprotein L9a and b (APOL9a/b) in the presence of microbiota. By integrating flow cytometry sorting of APOL9-binding bacterial taxa with 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing (APOL9-seq), we identify that APOL9a/b, as well as their human equivalent APOL2, coat gut bacteria belonging to the order of Bacteroidales with a high degree of specificity through commensal ceramide-1-phosphate (Cer1P) lipids. Genetic abolition of ceramide-1-phosphate synthesis pathways in gut-dominant symbiote Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron significantly decreases the binding of APOL9a/b to the bacterium. Instead of lysing the bacterial cells, coating of APOL9a/b induces the production of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) from the target bacteria. Subsequently, the Bacteroides-elicited outer membrane vesicles enhance the host’s interferon-γ signalling to promote major histocompatibility complex class II expression in the intestinal epithelial cells. In mice, the loss of Apol9a/b compromises the gut major histocompatibility complex class II-instructed immune barrier function, leading to early mortality from infection by intestinal pathogens. Our data show how a host-elicited factor benefits gut immunological homeostasis by selectively targeting commensal ceramide molecules. APOL9a/b proteins coat mouse intestinal bacteria with high specificity, and genetic abolition of ceramide-1-phosphate synthesis pathways in the symbiote Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron significantly decreases this binding of APOL9a/b to the bacterium."

 Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has transformed cancer therapy1,2. The efficacy of immunotherapy depends on dendritic cell-mediated tumour antigen presentation, T cell priming and activation3,4. However, the relationship between the key transcription factors in dendritic cells and ICB efficacy remains unknown. Here we found that ICB reprograms the interplay between the STAT3 and STAT5 transcriptional pathways in dendritic cells, thereby activating T cell immunity and enabling ICB efficacy. Mechanistically, STAT3 restrained the JAK2 and STAT5 transcriptional pathway, determining the fate of dendritic cell function. As STAT3 is often activated in the tumour microenvironment5, we developed two distinct PROTAC (proteolysis-targeting chimera) degraders of STAT3, SD-36 and SD-2301. STAT3 degraders effectively degraded STAT3 in dendritic cells and reprogrammed the dendritic cell–transcriptional network towards immunogenicity. Furthermore, STAT3 degrader monotherapy was efficacious in treatment of advanced tumours and ICB-resistant tumours without toxicity in mice. Thus, the crosstalk between STAT3 and STAT5 transcriptional pathways determines the dendritic cell phenotype in the tumour microenvironment and STAT3 degraders hold promise for cancer immunotherapy.

 Photonic double-zero-index media, distinguished by concurrently zero-valued permittivity and permeability, exhibit extraordinary properties not found in nature1–8. Notably, the notion of zero index can be substantially expanded by generalizing the constitutive parameters from null scalars to non-reciprocal tensors with non-zero matrix elements but zero determinants9,10. Here we experimentally realize this class of gyromagnetic double-zero-index metamaterials possessing both double-zero-index features and non-reciprocal hallmarks. As an intrinsic property, this metamaterial always emerges at a spin-1/2 Dirac point of a topological phase transition. We discover and demonstrate that a spatiotemporal reflection vortex singularity is always anchored to the Dirac point of the metamaterial, with the vortex charge being determined by the topological invariant leap across the phase transition. This establishes a unique bulk–spatiotemporal vortex correspondence that extends the protected boundary effects into the time domain and characterizes topological phase-transition points, setting it apart from any pre-existing bulk–boundary correspondence. Based on this correspondence, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a mechanism to deterministically generate optical spatiotemporal vortex pulses11,12 with firmly fixed central frequency and momentum, hence showing ultrarobustness. Our findings uncover connections between zero-refractive-index photonics, topological photonics and singular optics, which might enable the manipulation of space-time topological light fields using the inherent topology of extreme-parameter metamaterials.

 Metastasis to the cerebrospinal-fluid-filled leptomeninges, or leptomeningeal metastasis, represents a fatal complication of solid tumours1. Multimodal analyses of clinical specimens reveal substantial inflammatory infiltrate in leptomeningeal metastases with enrichment of IFNγ and resulting downstream signalling. Here, to investigate and overcome this futile anti-tumour response within the leptomeninges, we developed syngeneic lung cancer, breast cancer and melanoma leptomeningeal-metastasis mouse models. We show that transgenic host mice lacking IFNγ or its receptor fail to control the growth of leptomeningeal metastases growth. Leptomeningeal overexpression of Ifng through a targeted adeno-associated-virus-based system controls cancer cell growth independent of adaptive immunity. Using a suite of transgenic hosts, we demonstrate that leptomeningeal T cells generate IFNγ to actively recruit and activate peripheral myeloid cells, generating a diverse spectrum of dendritic cell subsets. Independent of antigen presentation, migratory CCR7+ dendritic cells orchestrate the influx, proliferation and cytotoxic action of natural killer cells to control cancer cell growth in the leptomeninges.

 Episodic memories—high-fidelity memories for events that depend initially on the hippocampus—do not maintain their precision in perpetuity. One benefit of this time-dependent loss of precision is the emergence of event-linked gist memories that may be used to guide future behaviour in new but related situations (that is, generalization)1–3. Models of systems consolidation propose that memory reorganization accompanies this loss of memory precision1,4; however, the locus of this reorganization is unclear. Here we report that time-dependent reorganization of hippocampal engram circuitry is sufficient to explain shifts in memory precision associated with systems consolidation. Using engram labelling tools in mice, we demonstrate that the passage of time rewires hippocampal engram circuits, enabling hippocampal engram neurons to be promiscuously active and guide behaviour in related situations that do not match the original training conditions. Reorganization depends on hippocampal neurogenesis; eliminating hippocampal neurogenesis prevents reorganization and maintains precise, event memories. Conversely, promoting hippocampal neurogenesis accelerates memory reorganization and the emergence of event-linked gist memories in the hippocampus. Our results indicate that systems consolidation models require updating to account for within-hippocampus reorganization that leads to qualitative shifts in memory precision. A study shows that loss of memory precision associated with systems consolidation can be explained by neurogenesis-dependent reorganization of engram circuitry within the hippocampus over time."

 In quantum mechanics, empty space is not void but is characterized by vacuum-field fluctuations, which underlie phenomena such as the Lamb shift1, spontaneous emission, and the Casimir effect2. Due to their quantitatively small relative contributions in free-space atomic physics, they were traditionally overlooked in solid-state systems. Recently, however, the interplay between electronic correlations and quantum electrodynamical effects in low-dimensional systems has become a rapidly advancing area in condensed matter physics3–5, with substantial implications for quantum materials and device engineering. High-mobility two-dimensional electron gases in the quantum Hall regime6 offer an ideal platform to investigate how vacuum electromagnetic fields affect strongly correlated electronic states. Here we demonstrate that adjusting the coupling strength between a two-dimensional electron gas and the vacuum fields of a hovering split-ring resonator leads to a significant reduction in exchange splitting at odd-integer filling factors, along with an enhancement of fractional quantum Hall gaps at filling factors 4/3, 5/3 and 7/5. Theoretical analysis indicates that these effects stem from an effective long-range attractive interaction mediated by virtual cavity photons in regions with strong vacuum electric field gradients. Our findings uncover a new mechanism by which cavity vacuum fields can reshape electronic correlations in quantum Hall systems, establishing a new approach for manipulating correlated quantum phases in low-dimensional materials and paving the way for engineering tailored many-body interactions in compact devices.

 Hilbert space dimension is a key resource for quantum information processing1,2. Not only is a large overall Hilbert space an essential requirement for quantum error correction, but a large local Hilbert space can also be advantageous for realizing gates and algorithms more efficiently3–7. As a result, there has been considerable experimental effort in recent years to develop quantum computing platforms using qudits (d-dimensional quantum systems with d > 2) as the fundamental unit of quantum information8–19. Just as with qubits, quantum error correction of these qudits will be necessary in the long run, but so far, error correction of logical qudits has not been demonstrated experimentally.

 Chromosomal rearrangements and gene fusions are the initial events in the development of many cancers. Astroblastoma (ABM), a brain cancer of unknown cellular origin and challenging to treat, is associated with diverse in-frame gene fusions, including MN1-BEND2 and MN1-CXXC5 (refs. 1,2). However, it remains unclear whether these gene fusions contribute to tumorigenesis. Here we show in mice that these two ABM-associated fusions converge on similar molecular activities and initiate malignancy specifically in ventral telencephalon neural progenitors. BEND2 and CXXC5 recognize similar DNA motifs, which indicates a convergence on downstream gene regulation. Expression of MN1-BEND2 in ventral telencephalon neural progenitors results in aberrant cell proliferation, impaired differentiation, a perivascular occupancy pattern of cells reminiscent of ABM and acquisition of an ABM-associated transcriptional signature. By contrast, MN1-BEND2 expression in dorsal telencephalon neural progenitors leads to extensive cell death. This cell-type-specific malignancy depends on OLIG2 expression. Mechanistically, both ABM-associated fusion proteins (MN1–BEND2 and MN1–CXXC5) induce overlapping transcriptional responses, including the activation of a therapeutically targetable PDGFRα pathway. Collectively, our data suggest that distinct ABM-associated fusions upregulate shared transcriptional networks to disrupt the normal development of ventral telencephalon neural progenitors, which leads to oncogenic transformation. These findings uncover new avenues for targeted ABM treatment.

 The human cerebral cortex is composed of six layers and dozens of areas that are molecularly and structurally distinct1–4. Although single-cell transcriptomic studies have advanced the molecular characterization of human cortical development, a substantial gap exists owing to the loss of spatial context during cell dissociation5–8. Here we used multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH)9, augmented with deep-learning-based nucleus segmentation, to examine the molecular, cellular and cytoarchitectural development of the human fetal cortex with spatially resolved single-cell resolution. Our extensive spatial atlas, encompassing more than 18 million single cells, spans eight cortical areas across seven developmental time points. We uncovered the early establishment of the six-layer structure, identifiable by the laminar distribution of excitatory neuron subtypes, 3 months before the emergence of cytoarchitectural layers. Notably, we discovered two distinct modes of cortical areal specification during mid-gestation: (1) a continuous, gradual transition observed across most cortical areas along the anterior–posterior axis and (2) a discrete, abrupt boundary specifically identified between the primary (V1) and secondary (V2) visual cortices as early as gestational week 20. This sharp binary transition in V1–V2 neuronal subtypes challenges the notion that mid-gestation cortical arealization involves only gradient-like transitions6,10. Furthermore, integrating single-nucleus RNA sequencing with MERFISH revealed an early upregulation of synaptogenesis in V1-specific layer 4 neurons. Collectively, our findings underscore the crucial role of spatial relationships in determining the molecular specification of cortical layers and areas. This study establishes a spatially resolved single-cell analysis paradigm and paves the way for the construction of a comprehensive developmental atlas of the human brain.

 Ultra-long-range genomic contacts, which are key components of neuronal genome architecture1–3, constitute a biochemical enigma. This is because regulatory DNA elements make selective and stable contacts with DNA sequences located hundreds of kilobases away, instead of interacting with proximal sequences occupied by the exact same transcription factors1,4. This is exemplified in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), in which only a fraction of LHX2-, EBF1- and LDB1-bound sites interact with each other, converging into highly selective multi-chromosomal enhancer hubs5. To obtain biochemical insight into this process, here we assembled olfactory receptor (OR) enhancer hubs in vitro with recombinant proteins and enhancer DNA. Cell-free reconstitution of enhancer hubs revealed that OR enhancers form nucleoprotein condensates with unusual, solid-like characteristics. Assembly of these solid condensates is orchestrated by specific DNA motifs enriched in OR enhancers, which are likely to confer distinct homotypic properties on their resident LHX2–EBF1–LDB1 complexes. Single-molecule tracking and pulse-chase experiments in vivo confirmed that LHX2 and EBF1 assemble OR-transcription-competent condensates with solid properties in OSN nuclei, under physiological concentrations of protein. Thus, homophilic nucleoprotein interactions that are influenced by DNA sequence generate new types of biomolecular condensate, which might provide a generalizable explanation for the stability and specificity of long-range genomic contacts across cell types.

 Imposing incommensurable periodicity on the periodic atomic lattice can lead to complex structural phases consisting of locally periodic structure bounded by topological defects1–8. Twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) is an ideal material platform to study the interplay between different atomic periodicities, which can be tuned by twist angles between the layers, leading to moiré-of-moiré lattices9–26. Interlayer and intralayer interactions between two interfaces in TTG transform this moiré-of-moiré lattice into an intricate network of domain structures at small twist angles, which can harbour exotic electronic behaviours9–26. Here we report a complete structural phase diagram of TTG with atomic-scale lattice reconstruction. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) combined with a new interatomic potential simulation27,28, we show several large-scale moiré lattices, including triangular, kagome and a corner-shared hexagram-shaped domain pattern. Each domain is bounded by a 2D network of domain-wall lattices. In the limit of small twist angles, two competing structural orders—rhombohedral and Bernal stackings—with a slight energy difference cause unconventional lattice reconstruction with spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) and nematic instability, highlighting the importance of long-range interlayer interactions across entire van der Waals layers. The diverse tessellation of distinct domains, whose topological network can be tuned by the adjustment of the twist angles, establishes TTG as a platform for exploring the interplay between emerging quantum properties and controllable nontrivial lattices. Examination of a complete structural phase diagram of twisted trilayer graphene shows that several large-scale moiré domain lattices can be formed, the physical properties of which can be tuned by the twist angles between layers."

 When two massive objects (black holes, neutron stars or stars) in our universe fly past each other, their gravitational interactions deflect their trajectories1,2. The gravitational waves emitted in the related bound-orbit system—the binary inspiral—are now routinely detected by gravitational-wave observatories3. Theoretical physics needs to provide high-precision templates to make use of unprecedented sensitivity and precision of the data from upcoming gravitational-wave observatories4. Motivated by this challenge, several analytical and numerical techniques have been developed to approximately solve this gravitational two-body problem. Although numerical relativity is accurate5–7, it is too time-consuming to rapidly produce large numbers of gravitational-wave templates. For this, approximate analytical results are also required8–15. Here we report on a new, highest-precision analytical result for the scattering angle, radiated energy and recoil of a black hole or neutron star scattering encounter at the fifth order in Newton’s gravitational coupling G, assuming a hierarchy in the two masses. This is achieved by modifying state-of-the-art techniques for the scattering of elementary particles in colliders to this classical physics problem in our universe. Our results show that mathematical functions related to Calabi–Yau (CY) manifolds, 2n-dimensional generalizations of tori, appear in the solution to the radiated energy in these scatterings. We anticipate that our analytical results will allow the development of a new generation of gravitational-wave models, for which the transition to the bound-state problem through analytic continuation and strong-field resummation will need to be performed. A new, highest-precision analytical result for solving the gravitational two-body problem of black hole or neutron star scattering reveals the emergence of Calabi–Yau manifolds in the solution to the radiated energy in these encounters."

Margrie;Claudia Clopath;Marcus Stephenson-Jones,Dopaminergic action prediction errors serve as a value-free teaching signal,"Dopaminergic action prediction error signals are used by mice as a value-free teaching signal to reinforce stable sound–action associations in the tail of the striatum. 
 Choice behaviour of animals is characterized by two main tendencies: taking actions that led to rewards and repeating past actions1,2. Theory suggests that these strategies may be reinforced by different types of dopaminergic teaching signals: reward prediction error to reinforce value-based associations and movement-based action prediction errors to reinforce value-free repetitive associations3–6. Here we use an auditory discrimination task in mice to show that movement-related dopamine activity in the tail of the striatum encodes the hypothesized action prediction error signal. Causal manipulations reveal that this prediction error serves as a value-free teaching signal that supports learning by reinforcing repeated associations. Computational modelling and experiments demonstrate that action prediction errors alone cannot support reward-guided learning, but when paired with the reward prediction error circuitry they serve to consolidate stable sound–action associations in a value-free manner. Together we show that there are two types of dopaminergic prediction errors that work in tandem to support learning, each reinforcing different types of association in different striatal areas. Dopaminergic action prediction error signals are used by mice as a value-free teaching signal to reinforce stable sound–action associations in the tail of the striatum."

 Debris disks are exoplanetary systems that contain planets, minor bodies (asteroids, Kuiper belt objects, comets and so on) and micrometre-sized debris dust1. Because water ice is the most common frozen volatile, it plays an essential role in the formation of planets2,3 and minor bodies. Although water ice has been commonly found in Kuiper belt objects and comets in the Solar System4, no definitive evidence for water ice in debris disks has been obtained to date1. Here we report the discovery of water ice in the HD 181327 debris disk using the near-infrared spectrograph onboard the James Webb Space Telescope. We detected the solid-state broad absorption feature of water ice at 3 µm including a distinct Fresnel peak at 3.1 µm, which is indicative of large, crystalline water-ice particles. Gradients in the water-ice feature as a function of stellocentric distance reveal a dynamic environment in which water ice is destroyed and replenished. We estimated the water-ice mass fractions as ranging from 0.1% at approximately 85 au to 21% at approximately 113 au, indicating the presence of a water-ice reservoir in the HD 181327 disk beyond the snow line. The icy bodies that release water ice in HD 181327 are probably the extra-solar counterparts of water-ice-rich Kuiper belt objects in our Solar System.

Johansen,Prefrontal encoding of an internal model for emotional inference,"Neurons in the rodent dorsomedial prefrontal cortex encode a flexible internal model of emotion by linking directly experienced and inferred associations with aversive experiences. 
 A key function of brain systems mediating emotion is to learn to anticipate unpleasant experiences. Although organisms readily associate sensory stimuli with aversive outcomes, higher-order forms of emotional learning and memory require inference to extrapolate the circumstances surrounding directly experienced aversive events to other indirectly related sensory patterns that were not part of the original experience. This type of learning requires internal models of emotion, which flexibly track directly experienced and inferred aversive associations. Although the brain mechanisms of simple forms of aversive learning have been well studied in areas such as the amygdala1–4, whether and how the brain forms and represents internal models of emotionally relevant associations are not known5. Here we report that neurons in the rodent dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) encode a flexible internal model of emotion by linking sensory stimuli in the environment with aversive events, whether they were directly or indirectly associated with that experience. These representations form through a multi-step encoding mechanism involving recruitment and stabilization of dmPFC cells that support inference. Although dmPFC population activity encodes all salient associations, dmPFC neurons projecting to the amygdala specifically represent and are required to express inferred associations. Together, these findings reveal how internal models of emotion are encoded in the dmPFC to regulate subcortical systems for recall of inferred emotional memories.

 The Moon undergoes periodic tidal forcing due to its eccentric and oblique orbit around the Earth1. The response to this tidal interaction drives temporal changes in the lunar gravity field and is sensitive to the satellite’s internal structure2–4. We use data from the NASA GRAIL spacecraft5–9 to recover the time-varying lunar gravity field, including a degree-3 gravitational tidal Love number, k3. Here, we report our estimated value of k3 = 0.0163 ± 0.0007, which is about 72% higher than that expected for a spherically symmetric moon10. Such a large k3 can be explained if the elastic shear modulus of the mantle varies by about 2–3% between the nearside and farside4, providing an observational demonstration of lateral heterogeneities in the deep lunar interior. This asymmetric structure suggests preservation of a predominantly thermal anomaly of roughly 100–200 K in the nearside mantle that formed surface mare regions 3–4 billion years ago11 and could influence the spatial distribution of deep moonquakes12.

Here, the authors investigate the efficacy of adjunctive antibiotic and phage therapy in a human cell model and a murine model of ventilator-associated pneumonia. 
 Bacterial multidrug resistance poses an urgent challenge for the treatment of critically ill patients developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Phage therapy, a potential alternative when conventional antibiotics fail, has been unsuccessful in first clinical trials when used alone. Whether combining antibiotics with phages may enhance effectiveness remains to be tested in experimental models. Here, we use a murine model of Pseudomonas-induced VAP to compare the efficacy of adjunctive phage cocktail for antibiotic therapy to either meropenem or phages alone. Combined treatment in murine VAP results in faster clinical improvement and prevents lung epithelial cell damage. Using human primary epithelial cells to dissect these synergistic effects, we find that adjunctive phage therapy reduces the minimum effective concentration of meropenem and prevents resistance development against both treatments. These findings suggest adjunctive phage therapy represents a promising treatment for MDR-induced VAP, enhancing the effectiveness of both antibiotics and phages while reducing adverse effects.

 Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe neuromuscular disorder caused by DMD gene mutations, leading to the loss of functional dystrophin. While antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated exon skipping offers therapeutic potential, its efficacy in cardiac muscle remains limited. Here, we investigate DG9, a cell-penetrating peptide derived from human polyhomeotic 1 homolog (Hph-1) transcription factor, as an enhancer of phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO)-based therapy targeting exon 44. In a humanized DMD mouse model (hDMDdel45;mdx), DG9-PMO significantly increases exon skipping, restores dystrophin expression, and improves muscle function, particularly in the heart. Mechanistically, DG9-PMO enhances intracellular uptake through multiple endocytic pathways and achieves superior nuclear localization. Compared to the benchmark R6G peptide, DG9-PMO exhibits greater efficacy in cardiac tissue with no detectable toxicity. These findings highlight DG9-PMO as a promising next-generation exon-skipping therapy with potential clinical relevance for improving both skeletal and cardiac outcomes in DMD patients.

 Ferroelectric materials are promising for developing non-volatile memory, neuromorphic computing, and photovoltaic technologies. Taking advantage of variable switching kinetics provides an important strategy for designing multifunctional ferroelectric devices. However, the conventional ferroelectrics due to the unmovable atomic species generally own a single switching kinetics, thus versatile and configurable switching kinetics still remain challenging. In this work, we systematically investigate the switching kinetics of the van der Waals ferroionic CuInP2S6 through polarization-determined ferroelectric photovoltaic behaviors. Based on the time- and field-dependent polarization switching and numerical simulation, we discover three switching modes, including intralayer switching, interlayer switching and intralayer-interlayer coupling switching in CuInP2S6. Through designing the poling voltage amplitude and width, we achieve the configurable kinetic control of polarization switching in CuInP2S6, enabling tunable binary, gradual and accumulative switching with defined poling voltages in a single device.

 Evolution of warming tolerance may help species resist the impacts of climate change but can also lead to negative fitness outcomes. Identifying correlated responses to warming tolerance evolution could identify such negative consequences and help uncover the underlying mechanisms. By assessing the correlated responses of life history and physiological traits to seven generations of artificial selection to increase or decrease the acute upper thermal tolerance limit (CTmax) in zebrafish (Danio rerio), we show that warming-adapted lines have improved cooling tolerance. Furthermore, the absence of difference between selected lines in aerobic metabolic scope, brain heat shock protein levels, fecundity, growth or swimming speed contradicts several hypotheses concerning the mechanisms controlling acute warming tolerance. These results suggest that selection due to acute heating events does not target variation in metabolic rates but can benefit tolerance to cold, making individuals more resilient to extreme temperature events.

In this study, we perform a high-resolution coupled climate simulation to study the future TC seasonal cycle and investigate the mechanisms of possible changes. The model simulation shows that, under the shared socio-economic pathway 5 8.5 scenario, the mean genesis date will shift significantly to later in the season in Northeastern Pacific (ENP) and North Atlantic (NA) but shift to later or earlier depending on the subregions in Northwestern Pacific (WNP).

 Industrial wastewater typically contains high concentrations of contaminants and should be treated before being released into the environment, discharged to a sewer, or recycled for reuse. Large amounts of greenhouse gases are produced during the treatment processes of industrial wastewater, yet are scarcely considered in the emission estimation of the wastewater sector. Here, we present a comprehensive methane (CH4) emission inventory for industrial wastewater treatment in China from 2000 to 2021, employing industry-specific emission factors (EF), contrasting with previous estimations that rely on a uniform EF without differentiating between industries. We demonstrate here that total CH4 emissions from industrial wastewater treatment in China were 2.4 Tg in 2000 and 1.4 Tg in 2021, showing an increasing trend during 2000–2012 and a substantial decline afterward, which is attributed to government-led control measures aimed at promoting cleaner production practices and optimizing industrial structures. Eastern coastal provinces exhibit higher emissions than inland regions, with Shandong, Zhejiang, Henan, and Jiangsu collectively contributing more than 50% of total emissions. We identify the Textile and Light Industry as the pivotal sector for mitigating CH4 emissions from industrial wastewater treatment. This sector is responsible for 82.9% of total CH4 emissions, despite contributing less than 19.0% to the national total value-added industrial output. By 2035, around 48% of CH4 emissions from industrial wastewater treatment could be reduced, primarily driven by stringent mitigation measures in the Textile and Light Industry. Our study reveals a decoupling relationship between CH4 emissions from industrial wastewater treatment and industrial growth and proposes the Textile and Light Industry as a priority sector for CH4 mitigation efforts."

 Depleted components in hotspot magma sources remain enigmatic. Zircon δ18O values (3.97–4.80‰, average 4.38‰) from depleted gabbros in the Comei province (Kerguelen plume) are lower than mantle zircons, correlating negatively with 206Pb/U238ages. Combined with ultradepleted Hf isotopes, this excludes hydrothermal alteration or crustal contamination, instead indicating mixing of heterogeneous mantle magmas with light-oxygen, Hf-depleted components. Elevated Sc/Nb and Y/Nb ratios preclude upper mantle entrainment, while light δ¹⁸O contradicts ancient melting residues. We propose these components originate from recycled high-temperature hydrothermally altered gabbroic oceanic crust, which underwent melt extraction during subduction before incorporation into the plume. Gradual δ¹⁸O increases reflect progressive consumption of these components during melting with ambient mantle. This study highlights recycled gabbroic crust’s role in generating depleted hotspot magmas. Preservation and emergence of low δ¹⁸O and depleted geochemical signatures requires limited mixing with enriched/high-δ¹⁸O materials, as these fragile signatures are easily masked by geochemical overprinting.

 Despite their relative rarity, atmospheric rivers are key contributors to the surface mass balance of Antarctica. However, the future role of atmospheric rivers in modulating Antarctic sea-level contributions is a major area of uncertainty. Here, we leverage high-resolution climate simulations to show that Antarctic atmospheric rivers are highly sensitive to future increases in atmospheric moisture, leading to a doubling of atmospheric river frequencies and 2.5 × increase in precipitation from 2066–2100 under present-day thresholds for atmospheric river detection. However, future precipitation impacts are critically dependent on the detection threshold: accounting for moisture increases in the threshold produces smaller, regional changes in atmospheric river frequency, primarily resulting from an eastward shift in the polar jet maximum wind speeds. Our results underscore the importance of using large ensembles to quantify Antarctic atmospheric river responses to variability in projected moisture, which may not be captured when using only a few ensemble members.

 One of the core applications of satellite-based classification maps is area estimation. Regardless of the algorithms used, maps will always contain errors stemming from imperfect input and training/calibration data, incomplete data coverage, and spectral and/or temporal confusion between land cover and land use classes. Because of omission and commission errors, the pixel-counting area estimator will be a biased estimator for area estimation. Therefore, the remote sensing research and application communities have developed a framework and recommended practices to address this problem. One such approach is a stratified random sampling design, in which classification maps could be used for stratification in the sampling design, and areas are estimated from the sample data, which represent reference data or reference class labels. As such, the quality of the map, i.e., producer's (PA) and user's accuracy (UA), will not affect the bias of the estimator, as the bias depends on the sampling design and the choice of estimator. However, map quality will impact the efficiency of stratification: a more accurate map will require a smaller sample size to reach the target variance of the estimate, or it will yield improved precision if the sample size is fixed. This study aims to provide a quantitative assessment of the impact of map accuracies on area estimation within the stratified random sampling design. The relative bias of the pixel-counting estimator is expressed using class-specific PA and UA, and shown to be PAUA−1. Furthermore, for the case of binary classification, elements of the confusion matrix, as well as the sample size, variance of the area estimator, and relative efficiency of stratification (the ratio of the products of variance and sample size for the two sampling approaches) are expressed using PA and UA. Numerical simulations demonstrate how relative efficiency depends on area estimation objectives, target area proportion, and the map's performance metrics (PA and UA). Such dependence is nonlinear, and the impact of those parameters varies. For example, when the target class is minor or rare (i.e., its true proportion is <<0.5), the impact of PA outweighs that of UA. As the target area proportion increases, the impact of accuracies converges, and UA has a greater impact on efficiency than PA. There are multiple values in the PA/UA space, though constrained, to reach the same objectives, e.g., in terms of relative efficiency, sample size, and target variance. Overall, this study offers map producers a criterion that can be used to benchmark algorithm performance for map generation when area estimation is the primary objective of the classification maps."

 Ocean primary production is a key process that regulates marine ecosystems and the global climate, but its estimation is still affected by multiple uncertainties. Typically, the chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL) is used to characterise this process, as it is considered as a proxy of phytoplankton biomass. To date, the most common observing systems for studying CHL are ocean colour satellites and Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) floats. These are complementary systems: satellite observations provide global coverage but are limited to the ocean surface, while BGC-Argo floats provide punctual observations along the whole water column. Quantitative matching of these two observing systems has been obtained only at regional or single-float scales, while at a global scale the relatively low and irregular BGC-Argo coverage results in large uncertainties. Here, we propose a different method, by comparing satellite and BGC-Argo climatological annual time series within seven different bioregions, each characterised by a homogeneous phytoplankton phenology, allowing us to smooth the uncertainties. By comparing the mean values, amplitudes, and shapes of the two time series, we identify regions (a) where they agree (58%–61% of the ocean surface area); (b) regions undersampled by the BGC-Argo float network (particularly in the Arabian Sea and near the Amazon delta); (c) where the discrepancy may stem from satellite or (d) BGC-Argo performance (mainly found at subtropical and high latitudes, respectively). Caution is required when using BGC-Argo and satellite data in regions b–d, and, for each region, we provide suggestions on which system could be affected by the largest uncertainties."

 Amid climate change and urban expansion, urban floods (UFs) have become a significant concern. Effective UF management requires two key elements: (1) assessing susceptibility to identify flood-prone hotspots and (2) analyzing factor contributions to pinpoint primary drivers. While research on urban flood susceptibility (UFS) is well-established, studies on factor contributions usually limited to the simple application without fully evaluating their alignment with UF characteristics. This study addresses this gap by examining Shenzhen, a rapidly urbanizing city, and applying various regression methods (linear, multiple machine learning (ML), and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)) to evaluate flood-driving factors. Through accuracy assessments and environmental considerations, we identify the most suitable methods for this analysis.

 Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is a key property for soil health. Spectral reflectance such as multispectral and hyperspectral data could provide efficient and cost-effective retrieval of SOC content. However, constrained by the availability of hyperspectral satellite data, current works mostly use a small number of spaceborne hyperspectral imagery for SOC retrieval on a small scale. In this work, the first large-scale hyperspectral imaging reflectance composites were built, and they were used for SOC estimation. Specifically, DESIS satellite images were used to predict SOC over the whole state of Bavaria in Germany (∼ 70,000 km2). We prepare 850 hyperspectral images from the DESIS satellite and build temporal composites from them. For the soil data, data was gathered from LfU(Bavarian State Office for the Environment), LfL(Bavarian State Research Center for Agriculture) and LUCAS 2018 (Land Use and Coverage Area Frame Survey). 828 soil samples were selected after data filtering. For this regression task, different machine learning and deep learning methods were implemented and explored. Moreover, a spectral attention mechanism was added to the model. Besides hyperspectral input, the digital elevation model (DEM) was also included as an auxiliary input as the measured spectrum has inter-variability dependent on the elevation and the generated topographical features are also relevant with SOC distribution. Based on the regression results evaluated by RMSE, R2, and RPIQ, the deep learning models showed much better performance than machine learning methods. Especially when only using hyperspectral data as input, the best result was achieved with RMSE 1.947%, R2 0.626, and RPIQ 1.710 on the test set. After incorporating topographical features, the fused model achieved further improved performance with RMSE 1.752% and R2 0.695 and RPIQ 1.919. From the interpretability analysis for model performance, it was found out that the bands in the range of 530 nm–570 nm, 770 nm–790 nm, and 840 nm - 870 nm are the most relevant bands for SOC estimation. In the end, several SOC maps were generated and analyzed together with soil types. The SOC maps indicate that water-associated areas, such as coastal soils and bogs, tend to have higher SOC, while mountain areas tend to contain lower SOC. Such findings align with SOC distribution across soil types and show the effectiveness of the model."

 Population analysis units (PAUs), as fundamental spatial units accommodating population-related activities, hold significance in constructing spatiotemporal interaction networks to understand intra-unit population distribution and activity patterns as well as inter-unit interactions. However, existing networks are constrained by fixed scales and the absence of temporal dynamics, with insufficient consideration of multi-scale features, thereby limiting their semantic representation and dynamic analysis capabilities. Thus, we proposed a heterogeneous multi-scale PAU interaction network (HMS-PAU-IN) model that integrates spatial, temporal, and semantic representations, enabling HMS-PAU-IN modeling and semantic analysis based on spatiotemporal knowledge graph. In the spatial dimension, spatiotemporal interactions are classified into explicit interactions driven by population flows and potential interactions shaped by spatial relationships. In the temporal dimension, the changes of PAUs are captured through the evolutionary relationships of nodes between different time windows. To validate the model, we developed a population prediction model that integrates the multi-scale features of PAUs and introduced Leiden-IES-PMS, a community detection method based on the Leiden algorithm, which integrates internal and external environmental semantics and adopts a proximity merging strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model and method effectively characterize spatiotemporal interactions among multi-scale PAUs, enhancing the accuracy of population distribution prediction (R2 = 0.77) at the community scale, and improving the interpretability of temporal community analysis at the building scale. This study develops a multi-scale spatiotemporal framework for analyzing population distribution, activity patterns, and community evolution within PAUs, providing actionable insights for urban planning, resource optimization, and sustainable management."

 Satellite platforms have become the principal data source for large-scale rice mapping. Numerous studies investigated the advantages of integrating deep learning models with satellite data for rice mapping, but these studies are typically confined to specific regions and the quality of customized datasets varies. The absence of a global, standardized satellite dataset for rice mapping benchmarking has long resulted in both substantial redundant data processing efforts and challenges in evaluating new algorithms under a unified benchmark. To address these deficiencies, this paper introduces Plot-Rice v1.0, a global heterogeneous rice benchmark dataset based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images, along with an automated framework that integrates SAR temporal features and leverages the foundation image segmentation model SAM-2 to generate plot-level rice samples. This framework effectively addresses the limitation of SAM-2, which supports zero-shot segmentation but lacks classification capabilities. Plot-Rice comprehensively accounts for the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of rice, incorporating plot-level rice labels and corresponding multi-source feature time series from 20 countries globally. In terms of feature composition, Plot-Rice integrates multi-source features, including radar backscattering coefficients, normalized backscattering coefficients, radar vegetation indices, spectral indices, and spectral combinations, constructing time series for 12 months of 2023 to facilitate temporal analysis. Finally, using this dataset, a series of benchmark experiments is conducted, encompassing performance comparisons of models such as U-Net, Res U-Net, Deeplabv3+, and HR-Net under multi-source feature time series, and comparisons of rice distribution extraction performance across diverse countries. Several recommendations are summarized for artificial intelligence (AI) in rice mapping to serve as a reference, contributing to global food security solutions."

 Irrigated dryland in China, largely distributed and expanding in arid and semi-arid regions, always poses challenges to water resource and ecosystems, thus deeply impacts the implementation of SDG 2, 6, 15 and so on. Spatial-temporal patterns of irrigated dryland with high resolution help pinpoint hotspots and key issues worth to concern, however, are still lacking in research. This study developed a zonal-specific methodology to identify irrigated dryland and its changes from 2000 to 2015 at national scale with 30 m resolution. The whole China was divided into five zones based on cropping patterns. Key phases of remote sensing data and environmental factors were combined to generate zonal-specific methodologies for the identification of irrigated dryland. Meanwhile changes of features were employed to identify changes of irrigated dryland. Results show that the ratio of vegetation indices to environmental factors exhibits stronger stability in the classification of each zone. That being said, these of slope and texture varied from zone to zone. Moreover, using difference data between two periods for change information extraction demonstrated high accuracy. This method not only avoids the error accumulation caused by overlaying the direct classification results of two periods but also addresses the issue of insufficient classification accuracy due to the shortage of samples and data in historical periods. The average overall accuracy (the kappa coefficient) on generated maps of irrigated dryland in 2000 and 2015 are 88.28% (0.758) and 87.65% (0.744). The irrigated dryland had been increased by 8.84% from 2000 to 2015 and their distribution became denser and shifted towards north of China. With the advancement of economy and technology, the influence of human factors on the distribution of irrigated drylands has gradually intensified. The stable development of irrigated drylands ensures China’s food security and contributes to global food security. Meanwhile, it poses significant challenges to water resources and the ecological environment. This research developed methodologies to obtain accurate irrigated dryland data and its change information, supporting to identify the interaction between SDG 2, SDG 6, and SDG 15, especially in arid and semi-arid regions with vulnerable ecosystem in the world."

Leveraging the multienzyme-like activity of MCMSFT to achieve oxygen generation, hydroxyl radical production, and glutathione depletion promotes hypoxia relief and triggers apoptosis/ferroptosis. Notably, MCMSFT-mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) facilitates direct tumor thermal ablation and offers exogenous heat to accelerate nanocatalytic reactions.

Simultaneously, metformin administration and hypoxia amelioration down-regulate programmed death ligand 1 alleviating immune evasion.

Specifically, LiF modifies particle shape and breaks large pores into smaller ones, while Hf4+addresses the chemical mismatches between grains and grain boundaries.

Tremor synchronization in space seems to be limited by the activity of small, nearby crustal and intraslab earthquakes. This observation can be explained by a competition between the self-synchronization of fault segments and perturbation by regional earthquakes. Our results imply previously unrecognized interactions across subduction systems, in which earthquake activity far from the fault influences whether it breaks in small or large segments."

In terrestrial vertebrates, inhaled odorants diffuse through olfactory epithelial mucus (OEM) before activating olfactory receptors (ORs) on olfactory sensory neurons and initiating adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP)–mediated signaling. Impaired OEM secretion is associated with impaired olfactory sensitivity in humans and mice, but it remains unclear whether OEM directly improves sensitivity and whether specific active factors exist. Here, using a cAMP imaging–based heterologous OR expression assay, we demonstrate that fibronectin from human OEM increases the sensitivity of OR response to odorant. Fibronectin application partially restores electrical olfactory response of the mouse olfactory epithelium after OEM removal. In humans, OEM fibronectin levels are significantly decreased in patients with idiopathic olfactory disorder. These findings shed light on the role of OEM fibronectin in olfaction and may lead to sensitivity-enhancing additives for odorant sensors and treatments for hyposmia."

In this work, we explore the idea of using simulated “swarms” of simple agents to generate new designs for architected materials in a decentralized, bioinspired manner. Individual agents choose their own actions based solely on information in their immediate environment, with no centralized control. The structures that these processes produce are the result of the collective action of the individual agents, rather than a predetermined design. We build an integrated platform for determining “rule-structure-property” relationships, analogous to process-structure-property relationships in materials science. The platform simulates agent behaviors to show how different rules and different environments result in different structures. We then three-dimensional print these and perform finite element analysis to experimentally and numerically characterize mechanical properties, including tensile strength and energy dissipation."

Hammer,Crustal to mantle melt storage during the evolution of Hawaiian volcanoes,"As the Pacific Plate migrates over the mantle plume below Hawaiʻi, magma flux decreases, resulting in changes in eruptive volume, style, and composition. It is thought that melt storage becomes deeper and ephemeral with the transition from highly voluminous tholeiitic (shield stage) to the less voluminous alkaline (post-shield and rejuvenation stages) magmatism. To quantitatively test this, we applied high-precision fluid inclusion barometry via Raman spectroscopy to samples from representative volcanoes of different evolutionary stages. This suggests an evolution from shield-stage shallow magma storage (~1 to 2 kilometers) for Kīlauea to a post-shield stage that includes crustal magma storage within the volcanic edifice (~2 kilometers) and deeper storage below the Moho (~20 to 27 kilometers) for Haleakalā. The rejuvenation stage (Diamond Head) displays mantle-dominated storage (~22 to 30 kilometers). High melt fluxes likely form stable conduits from the mantle to a shallow reservoir in the shield volcanoes.

The detector demonstrates an excellent zero-bias responsivity of 0.62 ampere per watt (A/W), a low-noise equivalent power of 19.6 picowatt per square root of hertz (pW/Hz1/2), and a fast response time of 4.5 nanosecond (ns) at 0.1 terahertz (THz). The metal doping effect and asymmetric terahertz heating play vital roles in the hot-carrier PTE response at the metal-semimetal interfaces. Moreover, scanning photocurrent mapping shows that the short-wave zero-bias photoresponse is closely localized to the metal-semimetal interfaces, further revealing the metal doping effect. The bias-dependent photocurrent indicates that the short-wave photoresponse still originates from the PTE effect and the photovoltaic response is negligible.

Previous observations of symmetric snapping have been limited to high loading rates. In this work, we present a universal strategy to achieve symmetric snapping under quasi-static conditions by designing magnetization (M)–interface patterns that effectively suppress asymmetric modes. A simplified theoretical model demonstrates that this behavior results from the interplay between pitchfork and saddle-node bifurcations, with predictions validated through simulations and experiments using hard magnetic elastomers. Resisting forces generated by multiple M-interfaces counteract asymmetric snapping, enabling distinct symmetric configurations. Extending this approach to higher-order symmetric snapping, we uncover a quasi-linear scaling law between critical fields and snapping order. These findings establish a robust framework for designing snapping systems with enhanced control and predictability, as demonstrated by a mechanical-magnetic snapping switch, paving the way for advanced applications in precision engineering and magnetic-mechanical actuation."

However, conventional strain is below 0.5%, limiting exploration of unique properties under substantial strain. In addition, while uniaxial strain modifies magnetic interactions anisotropically, its influence on skyrmions is underexplored.

Characterization of these tumors by RNA sequencing revealed a tumor immune phenotype, where potent IFN-I signaling concomitant with diminished type 2 inflammation failed to confer durable tumor control.

Of the 75 resolved coronae, gravity indicates buoyant mantle material beneath 52. We predict a range of plume-lithosphere interactions and activity stages across these coronae.

AurkA in mitotic RGPs shows dynamic pericentrosomal distribution that transiently colocalizes with cortical Par-3 preferentially on the posterior side. AurkA is both necessary and sufficient to increase cytoplasmic while decreasing cortical Par-3, disrupts Par-3 cortical asymmetry, and perturbs polarized Dld endosome dynamics.

 This study introduces the SAMURAI-S, a novel measurement system that incorporates a state-of-the-art sonic anemometer combined with a multi-rotor drone in a sling load configuration, designed to overcome the limitations of traditional mast-based observations in terms of spatial flexibility. This system enables the direct measurement of 3D wind vectors while hovering, providing a significant advantage in manoeuvrability and positional accuracy over fixed mast setups. The capabilities of the system were quantified through a series of 10 to 28 min flights, conducting close comparisons of turbulence measurements at altitudes of 30 and 60 m against data from a 60 m  tower equipped with research-grade sonic anemometers.

This dataset included terrace data and soil and water conservation measure factor values, covering the period from 2000 to 2020. The terraces are categorized into level terrace, slope terrace, zig terrace, and slope-separated terrace. The results showed that the average overall accuracy of the terrace was 91.90 % and the average F1 score was 76.75 %. 
 Terrace, as one of the most widely distributed and heavily invested soil and water conservation (SWC) measures in China, currently lacks a comprehensive database with spatiotemporal distribution and diverse classification types. This absence significantly hampers accurate soil erosion assessment and SWC planning in China. To address this gap, we proposed a two-stage mapping framework for the different terrace measures classification to produce a new dataset named the Soil and Water Conservation Terrace Measures Dataset (SWCTMD) using time-series Landsat satellite imagery and digital elevation model data. This dataset, spanning from 2000 to 2020, incorporated a fine classification system, providing both terrace data and SWC measure factor. The terraces were classified into four types according to their features: level terrace, slope terrace, zig terrace, and slope-separated terrace. The results showed that the average overall accuracy (OA) of the terrace was 91.90 % and the average F1 score was 76.75 %. For different terrace types, the average OA was 83.50 % and the average F1 score was 52.14 %. Comparative analysis highlighted the superiority and robustness of the SWCTMD compared to existing products. This dataset revealed that terraces in China are predominantly concentrated in the Loess Plateau, Southwest and Southeast regions. From 2000 to 2020, the total terrace areas increased by 96,038.16 km2, with the largest increase occurring in slope terraces. While terrace expansion was concentrated in the Loess Plateau, and southwest and southeast of China, decreases were concentrated around urban areas. Notably, terraces reduced soil erosion of cropland by about 818 million tons in 2020. The SWCTMD enhances the accuracy of soil erosion simulations and enables long-term analysis of soil erosion trends. Moreover, the dataset offers valuable applications in earth system modelling and contributes to research on land resource management, food security, biodiversity, and water cycle.

The dataset includes icebergs larger than 0.04 km², with details on their locations, sizes, and shapes. It shows significant changes in iceberg number and area, mainly driven by major ice shelf calving events – especially in the Weddell Sea. This resource fills key gaps in understanding iceberg impacts on the ocean and climate. 
 The distribution of Antarctic icebergs is crucial for understanding their impact on the Southern Ocean's atmosphere and physical environment, as well as their role in global climate change. Recent advancements in iceberg databases, based on remote sensing imagery and altimetry data, have led to products like the BYU/NIC iceberg database, the Altiberg database, and high-resolution SAR-based iceberg distribution data. However, no unified database exists that integrates various iceberg scales and covers the entire Southern Ocean. Our research presents a comprehensive circum-Antarctic iceberg dataset, developed using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, covering the Southern Ocean south of 55°S. A semi‐automated classification method that integrates incremental random forest classification with manual correction was applied to extract icebergs larger than 0.04 km² , resulting in a dataset for each October from 2018 to 2023. The resulting dataset not only records the geographic coordinates and geometric attributes (area, perimeter, long axis, and short axis) of the icebergs but also provides uncertainty estimates for area and mass. The dataset reveals significant interannual variability in iceberg number and total area-the number of icebergs increased from 33,823 in 2018 to approximately 51,332 in 2021, corresponding to major ice shelf calving events (e.g., the A68a iceberg in the Weddell Sea), followed by a decline in 2022. The annual average total iceberg area is 44,518 ± 4800 km², and the average mass is 8,779 ± 3,029 Gt. Validation using test set samples and a rolling cross-validation of interannual variability shows that the integrates incremental random forest classification achieves accuracy, recall, and F1 scores exceeding 0.90, and after manual correction, all performance metrics should be even better. Comparisons with existing iceberg products (including the BYU/NIC iceberg database and the Altiberg database) indicate a high consistency in spatial distribution, while our dataset demonstrates clear advantages in terms of spatial coverage, iceberg detection scale, and identification capabilities in regions with dense sea ice. This dataset serves as a novel data resource for investigating the impact of Antarctic icebergs on the Southern Ocean, the mass balance of ice sheets, the mechanisms underlying ice shelf collapse, and the response mechanisms of iceberg disintegration to climate change."

Natali,Fusing Regional and Global Datasets to Develop a Composite Land Cover Product Across High Latitudes,"Arctic warming is causing permafrost to thaw, affecting ecosystems and climate. Since land cover, especially vegetation, shapes how permafrost responds, accurate maps are crucial. Using machine learning, we combined existing global and regional datasets to create a hybrid detailed 1-km map of Arctic-Boreal land cover, improving the representation of forests, shrubs, and wetlands across the circumpolar. 
 Rapid warming across the Arctic is the primary driver of widespread permafrost thaw, with far-reaching consequences for local ecosystem resilience, the regional carbon budget, and the global climate system. Because permafrost characteristics and vulnerability are tightly linked to land cover, particularly vegetation type and surface properties, understanding these dynamics requires accurate and detailed land cover information. Spatial variation in vegetation cover influences energy balance, snow insulation, and soil moisture, factors that directly affect permafrost stability. Consequently, high-resolution land cover products are essential for assessing the ecological impacts of permafrost thaw and for improving the representation of permafrost-related processes in predictive models. However, many global land cover datasets fail to capture the spatial heterogeneity and fine-scale ecological features that influence permafrost dynamics, while more detailed regional products often lack coverage across broader, continental extents. This gap presents a challenge for large-scale assessments of permafrost vulnerability under accelerating climate change."

RTSs are key features of abrupt permafrost thaw accelerated by climate change. Using satellite images and field data, we identified and classified over 6000 RTSs. This dataset helps scientists better understand how warming is changing Arctic landscapes and provides a trusted reference for training artificial intelligence to detect these landforms in the future. 
 Permafrost thaw disrupts ecosystems, hydrology, and biogeochemical cycles, reinforcing climate change through a positive permafrost-carbon feedback loop. Thaw can be gradual, deepening the active layer, or abrupt, triggering thermokarst, thermo-erosion, or thermodenudation. Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTSs) are a key manifestation of abrupt permafrost thaw. Yet, their distribution, scale, and environmental controls in the West Siberian Arctic remain poorly understood, further complicated by their rapid evolution. This study presents an extensive update of the West Siberian RTS inventory through manual mapping using high-resolution, multi-source, multi-year recent (2016-2023) satellite basemaps (ESRI, Google Earth, and Yandex Maps). We developed an RTS classification capturing key environmental parameters, including morphology, spatial organization, terrain position, and associated relief-forming concurrent processes. The dataset comprises 6168 classified RTS landforms, integrating newly mapped sites with previously reported occurrences to provide a comprehensive view of a 445226 km2 region covering the Yamal, Gydan, and Tazovsky peninsulas. The collected data underwent manual filtering and verification, leveraging local field experience and observations from key sites to reduce uncertainty and minimize false positives. Accuracy analysis, performed by comparing the dataset with various field datasets collected across the peninsulas, confirmed high accuracy (>90%) for RTS identification. The dataset likely underestimated the distribution of small RTSs due to the resolution limitations of remote sensing data, hence generally providing a conservative estimate. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for diverse research fields, including ecology, biogeochemistry, geomorphology, climatology, permafrost science, and natural hazard assessment. Additionally, it provides a crucial reference dataset for machine learning applications, enhancing upcoming remote sensing classification and predictive modeling approaches. "

 The formation of aerosol particles in the atmosphere impacts air quality and climate change, but many of the organic molecules involved remain unknown. Machine learning could aid in identifying these compounds through accelerated analysis of molecular properties and detection characteristics.

To tackle this challenge, we propose a similarity analysis that connects atmospheric compounds to existing large molecular datasets used for machine learning development. We find a small overlap between atmospheric and non-atmospheric molecules using standard molecular representations in machine learning applications. The identified out-of-domain character of atmospheric compounds is related to their distinct functional groups and atomic composition. Our investigation underscores the need for collaborative efforts to gather and share more molecular-level atmospheric chemistry data.

While the intestinal tract is a critical site for MP interactions in soil organisms, current research predominantly focuses on overall physiological responses, overlooking organ-specific toxic mechanisms. To address this gap, we exposed earthworms (Eisenia fetida) to polyethylene (PE) and biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) MPs sourced from agricultural films at an environmentally realistic concentration of 1.0 g/kg. Incorporating natural earthworm mobility, we designed two exposure scenarios: migration from clean to contaminated soil (scenario A) and vice versa (scenario B). Machine learning-driven image analysis and phenotypic profiling revealed that PE induced more severe intestinal lesions than PLA, adversely affecting intestinal immune functions. Furthermore, PE resulted in greater oxidative damage and significantly activated immune proteins such as melanin and antimicrobial peptides through reprograming immune-related gene and protein pathways. Conversely, PLA predominantly disrupted intestinal digestive and absorptive functions, though the gut microbial community partially mitigated damage through structural and compositional adaptation. Compared with scenario A, earthworms in scenario B exhibited reduced tissue damage, enhanced digestive enzyme activity, and upregulated energy-related metabolites and cell proliferation genes, indicating partial recovery from MP-induced intestinal dysfunction. These findings elucidate the distinct toxicity mechanisms of conventional and biodegradable agricultural MPs on soil organisms, while the scenario-based approach advances risk assessment by aligning experimental design with real-world ecological behaviors."

Utilizing data from detailed observational monitoring campaigns, conducted over 21 weeks, we explore the influence of cleaning activities in two normally occupied, single-family houses. To study emissions and chemistry, we quantified more than 200 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using a proton-transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer and 52 semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) using a semivolatile thermal-desorption gas chromatograph. During regular professional home cleaning, we observed postcleaning concentration enhancements in ∼60% of measured VOCs and ∼80% of measured SVOCs. Most of these concentration enhancements were not clearly linked to either primary emission from cleaning products or secondary formation through reactive chemistry. Instead, we infer that shifts in the sorptive properties of indoor surfaces account for most of these observations. Cleaning-associated enhancements mostly ebbed within a few hours, with some VOCs and lower-volatility SVOCs persisting more than 5 h, longer than would be expected for removal of inert species by ventilation. The use of carpet cleaner was associated with direct emission of 2-butoxyethanol, which persisted at elevated concentrations for days after the initial event.

This study introduces mechanochemical depassivation to revitalize passivated ZVI and restore its reactivity. The method is exemplified through mechanical milling to depassivate ZVI with different passivation layers formed in solutions containing Cr(VI), Ni(II), and/or trichloroethylene, as well as in a complex water matrix. The results demonstrate rapid restoration of ZVI reactivity within 10 min of milling, achieving a 7-fold increase in contaminant removal capacity after eight cycles. The method universally outperforms acid pickling and ultrasonication across all of the tested passivation scenarios. Mechanistic analysis attributes its efficacy to the ductile–brittle disparity between the metallic iron and the passivation layers: brittle passivation layers fragment under mechanical stress, while ductile iron resists structural damage. Discrete element method simulations provide further mechanical insights into the milling dynamics and identify the contact frequency as the key factor determining depassivation efficiency.

Here, we examine the processes determining the moment when sea ice locally disappears each spring, defined as the retreat date, using satellite observations over 1994–2020. We find that climatological retreat date is driven by sea ice melt in most of the seasonal ice zone and strongly constrained by the seasonal maximum ice thickness. Ice removal due to drifting ice export predominantly drives retreat only in coastal polynyas. At interannual timescales, retreat date anomalies are also preconditioned by prior maximum ice thickness, which affects melt‐driven spring ice loss through the ice‐albedo feedback, though this effect appears limited to specific regions. Winds emerge as a primary driver of interannual variability in the retreat date, influencing both drift‐ and melt‐related spring ice removal processes."

Correlations and mean differences between these 30‐km ICESat‐2 and SWOT height segments are 0.91 (−0.02 ± 0.08 m) in the Beaufort and 0.65 (0.01 ± 0.09 m) in the Weddell. Differences in freeboards using minimum height as a reference sea surface are 0.04 ± 0.08 m and −0.01 ± 0.09 m; minimum heights are localized within the same lead features of the two segments. The SWOT wide‐swath radar altimeter can, for the first time, provide two‐dimensional mappings of the spatial variability of freeboard and ice thickness — crucial information that will enhance our understanding of the physical mechanisms driving the decline of sea ice covers."

River wave movements are described theoretically by routing equations or tracked using in‐situ gauge measurements of stage over time at a given location. However, the sparse distribution of gauges makes it challenging to show how stage evolves with along‐river distance as waves propagate downstream. Here we use novel measurements of water surface elevation from the Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite to detect and analyze flow wave paths, presenting examples of the first direct observations of continuous downstream changes in river height at a given time within a flow wave. By removing long‐scale river elevation profiles, we develop “spatial hydrographs” as analogs to in‐situ time series and demonstrate their value for analyzing wave characteristics, including measuring length, estimating celerity, and partitioning event flow from baseflow.

Such temperature overshoots affect the future hydrological cycle, with implications for land water availability. However, the hydrological response to such temperature overshoots is not well understood. Here, we investigate regional and seasonal changes of precipitation minus evaporation (P − E) in an ensemble of Earth system model simulations of temperature overshoot. Most climate models broadly show P − E reversibility after overshoot. However, models exhibiting an irreversible shift of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) during the temperature overshoot experience reduced wet‐season and enhanced dry‐season land water availability in tropical regions, which has long‐lasting effects on the amplitude of P − E seasonality after the overshoot, constituting irreversible changes on human timescales. While some regions may experience alleviating seasonal hydrological conditions, others are subject to more intense seasonality. Half a century of CO2‐stabilization after the temperature overshoot only halves the legacy effects of the overshoot on land water availability on over 23% of the world population in 12% of the global land area, covering regions of various hydrological regimes. Based on the model ensemble presented here, a strong irreversible shift of the ITCZ after an overshoot is a low‐probability but high‐impact outcome that would entail long‐lasting hydrological changes with consequences for ecosystems and human societies."

Yet, these wetlands are being increasingly converted to aquaculture ponds, which could trigger a pulse emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from existing carbon stocks, a loss of opportunity for future carbon sequestration from mangroves, and an additional GHG emission incurred from pond establishment and operation. In this study, we determined the magnitude, temporal variations and environmental drivers of ecosystem‐scale carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and water vapor fluxes from the subtropical brackish fishponds using the eddy covariance technique, and assessed the net carbon impact arising from the conversion of mangroves to fishponds under three conservation scenarios. Our results showed that the brackish fishponds were significant sources of carbon and water, with a mean annual emission of 687.6 ± 83.1 gC m−2 for CO2, 101.5 ± 2.7 gC m−2 for CH4, and 2422.5 ± 48.0 mm for water vapor. Fishpond CH4 and water vapor fluxes exhibited distinct seasonal patterns with higher fluxes in summer. CO2, CH4, and water vapor fluxes were driven predominantly by shortwave radiation, air temperature, and wind speed, respectively. At the current deforestation rate, the global carbon impact arising from mangrove conversion to fishponds could reach 109 Gt CO2‐equivalent by 2100. Halting global mangrove conversion to aquaculture ponds by 2030 could reduce the net carbon impact by 90.2 Gt CO2‐equivalents by 2100. Thus, preserving coastal wetlands from conversion to aquaculture ponds is among the most effective nature‐based climate solutions."

Given the complex geopolitical, economic, and strategic considerations among countries, global cooperation in SAI deployment will be challenging. Unilateral SAI deployment has thus been highlighted as an important research topic, although it has been explored very little in scenario design and ESM studies. Inspired by a novel game theory model and a newly developed framework for identifying geopolitically plausible SAI initiator(s), this paper builds a framework for integrating unilateral SAI scenario design, geopolitical game theory, ESM simulation, and climate analyses into a single decision loop. We design and simulate a geopolitically plausible scenario of the initiation of unilateral SAI using the Community Earth System Model, and explore two independent plausible unilateral SAI reaction scenarios following the climate storylines under the initiator scenario. Our work demonstrates an approach to explore the complex feedbacks between unilateral SAI deployment scenarios and the simulation of the subsequent climate storylines."

Whilst event attribution studies tend to focus on the change in probability or magnitude of the extreme temperatures themselves, we provide context to these studies by examining whether there are human induced trends in the atmospheric circulation that might affect the likelihood of similar extreme circulation patterns and associated heat waves occurring in the future. We examine trends and variability in summer jet latitude, blocking frequency and overall circulation pattern over the Scandinavian sector in a variety of reanalyses and climate model ensembles. Both the number of blocked days, and the average jet location for summer 2018 were unprecedented in the reanalyses, and rare in climate model simulations. We found no robust evidence of past or future externally forced changes in summer blocking frequency over Scandinavia in model simulations, whilst trends in circulation analogs were also largely insignificant. Trends in jet latitude were dependent on the time period examined, models included and other analysis choices. Overall, we found no robust evidence for systematic trends in average or extreme years toward Summer 2018‐like conditions for any of the three indices, nor in the frequency of co‐occurring extreme northward jet latitude and high blocking frequency. We conclude that Summer 2018s circulation can likely be explained by internal atmospheric variability."

Using the Aggregating Grid Event (AGE) method, the Rainfall‐Runoff‐Inundation (RRI) model, and the Peaks‐Over‐Threshold (POT) approach, it incorporates 2,160‐year precipitation data from a 5‐km dynamically downscaled ensemble (d4PDF DDSJP) across three climate stages (historical, +2°C, +4°C). The AGE method identified critical precipitation events for the flood quantile estimations and the POT method was employed to estimate 100‐year discharge (Q100) for over 2.2 million river grid cells. Key findings include: (a) Nationwide, 100‐year discharge (Q100) is projected to increase 1.16 times (+2°C) and 1.37 times (+4°C), with equivalent return periods reduced to 45 years (+2°C) and 23 years (+4°C). Northern regions (Hokkaido and Tohoku) are particularly climate‐sensitive, exceeding national averages in Q100 increases. (b) Small river basins and transition zones from plains to mountains exhibit higher increase ratios, necessitating targeted flood prevention measures. (c) Flash flood risks are expected to rise, with most national basins seeing flashiness increases of over 10% (+2°C) and 20% (+4°C). Southern Japan faces further flash flood intensification, while Northern Japan under +4°C stage anticipates emerging challenges related to flash floods. The study underscores the urgency of adaptive flood management strategies to mitigate increasing risks, offering a foundation for informed policymaking and public‐engaged mitigation.

This limitation places a major constraint on our capacity to understand how vegetation fire may change under future scenarios of climate change and socio‐economic development. Here, we address this challenge by presenting a novel integration of two process‐based models. The first is the Wildfire Human Agency Model (WHAM!), which draws on agent‐based approaches to represent anthropogenic fire use and management. The second is JULES‐INFERNO, a fire‐enabled dynamic global vegetation model, which takes a physically grounded approach to the representation of vegetation‐fire dynamics. The combined model enables a coupled socio‐ecological simulation of historical burned area. We calibrate the combined model using GFED5 burned area data and perform an independent evaluation using MODIS‐based fire radiative power observations. Results suggest that as much as half of all global burned area is generated by managed anthropogenic fires—typically small fires that are lit for, and then spread according to, land user objectives. Furthermore, we demonstrate that including representation of managed anthropogenic fires in a coupled socio‐ecological simulation improves understanding of the drivers of unmanaged wildfires. For example, we show how vegetation flammability and landscape fragmentation control inter‐annual variability and longer‐term change in unmanaged fires. Overall, findings presented here indicate that both socio‐economic and climate change will be vital in determining the future trajectory of fire on Earth."

Moreover, with the progress of urbanization, changes in land cover have led to increasingly unavoidable changes in terrestrial carbon storage. However, there is still a lack of research on the impact of land cover change on global terrestrial carbon storage under the latest IPCC scenarios. Therefore, this study utilizes the InVEST model to examine the impact of future land dynamics on global terrestrial carbon storage under various SSP‐RCP scenarios from 2015 to 2100. The results reveal significant regional differences and trends. For instance, under the SSP4‐3.4 scenario, global terrestrial carbon storage loss could reach up to 30.2 PgC due to land conversions, such as the transformation of tropical rainforests into bioenergy crops in Indonesia. The social cost of offsetting terrestrial carbon loss could range from trillions to tens of trillions of dollars in various scenarios. Additionally, our analysis indicates that urban expansion generally reduces carbon storage, but strategic urban planning can mitigate this impact. In ecological protected areas and biodiversity hotspots, we observed a polarized trend: areas with increasing carbon storage are experiencing growth at a faster rate than historically, while areas with decreasing carbon storage are facing accelerated losses. This disparity underscores the necessity for targeted conservation efforts. In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of sound land management and policy interventions in mitigating terrestrial carbon storage losses, protecting ecologically sensitive areas, and achieving climate goals."

This study quantified these changes using a customized hydrological water year index, which correlated better with surface water storage in the basins than other drought/wetness indicators. Application of the index revealed heightened hydrological extremes and whiplash events post‐2015 in all Western U.S. basins, with nearly 72% of stations facing critically dry conditions in 2021 and over 54% experiencing extreme wet conditions in 2023. Future projections indicate a decline of 8.5%–13.2% in non‐extreme water year types across major basins, accompanied by increases in both extreme wet and dry water year types. Our findings suggest that similar levels of multi‐year drought duration and water deficits will likely occur regardless of future warming scenarios.

 Ku70 and Ku80 form Ku, a ring-shaped complex that initiates the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway.1 Ku binds to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) ends and recruits other NHEJ factors (e.g., LIG4, DNA-PKcs). While Ku can bind to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)2 and trap mutated-DNA-PKcs on ribosomal RNA (rRNA),3,4 the physiological role on Ku-RNA interaction in otherwise wildtype cells remains unclear. Intriguingly, Ku is dispensable for murine development5,6 but essential in human cells.7 Despite similar genome sizes, human cells express ~100-fold more Ku than mouse cells, implying functions beyond NHEJ - possibly through a dose-sensitive interaction with dsRNA, which binds Ku 10~100 times weaker than dsDNA.2,8 Investigating Ku’s essentiality in human cells, we found that Ku-depletion - unlike LIG4 - induces profound interferon (IFN) and NF-kB signaling via dsRNA-sensor MDA5/RIG-I and MAVS. Prolonged Ku-degradation further activates other dsRNA sensors, especially PKR (suppressing translation) and OAS/RNaseL (cleaving rRNA), leading to growth arrest and cell death. MAVS, RIG-I, or MDA5 knockouts suppressed IFN signaling and, like PKR knockouts, all partially rescued Ku-depleted human cells. Ku-irCLIP analyses revealed Ku binding to diverse dsRNA, predominantly stem-loops in primate-specific antisense Alu elements9 in introns and 3’-UTRs. Ku expression rose sharply in higher primates, correlating tightly with Alu-expansion (r = 0.94/0.95). Thus, Ku plays a vital role in accommodating Alu-expansion in primates by limiting dsRNA-induced innate immunity, explaining both Ku’s elevated expression and its essentiality in human cells."

 In the future, monsoon rainfall over densely populated South Asia is expected to increase, even as monsoon circulation weakens1–3. By contrast, past warm intervals were marked by both increased rainfall and a strengthening of monsoon circulation4–6, posing a challenge to understanding the response of the South Asian summer monsoon to warming. Here we show consistent South Asian summer monsoon changes in the mid-Pliocene, Last Interglacial, mid-Holocene and future scenarios, characterized by an overall increase in monsoon rainfall, a weakening of the monsoon trough-like circulation over the Bay of Bengal and a strengthening of the monsoon circulation over the northern Arabian Sea, as revealed by a compilation of proxy records and climate simulations. Increased monsoon rainfall is thermodynamically dominated by atmospheric moisture following the rich-get-richer paradigm, and dynamically dominated by the monsoon circulation driven by the enhanced land warming in subtropical western Eurasia and northern Africa. The coherent response of monsoon dynamics across warm climates reconciles past strengthening with future weakening, reinforcing confidence in future projections. Further prediction of South Asian summer monsoon circulation and rainfall by physics-based regression models using past information agrees well with climate model projections, with spatial correlation coefficients of approximately 0.8 and 0.7 under the high-emissions scenario. These findings underscore the promising potential of past analogues, bolstered by palaeoclimate reconstruction, in improving future South Asian summer monsoon projections.

Here we show that radiotherapy induces the expression of the EGFR ligand amphiregulin in tumour cells, which reprogrammes EGFR-expressing myeloid cells toward an immunosuppressive phenotype and reduces phagocytosis. This stimulates distant metastasis growth in human patients and in pre-clinical mouse tumour models.

 Moiré superlattices in van der Waals materials have emerged as a promising platform for studying the correlated states in condensed matter physics. These correlated states have substantial effects on the emission coherence, an important parameter for quantum light applications. However, the effect of correlated states on the excitonic emission coherence is largely unexplored. Here, we show that the coherence of moiré interlayer exciton emission in tungsten diselenide (WSe2)/molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) heterobilayers is sensitive to the correlated insulating states in this material. We demonstrate that the emission linewidth of interlayer exciton shows a dip at a particular power range, which we attributed to the excitonic (bosonic) interaction. Moreover, such linewidth minima also appear in the doping dependence of the photoluminescence spectrum at the integer electronic filling factor, fel = 1, demonstrating the effect of the electronic (fermionic) correlated insulating state on the interlayer exciton emission coherence. Our results demonstrate the richness of exciton-exciton and exciton-electron interactions in moiré semiconductors and pave the way for engineering emission coherence by controlling such interactions.

The long-term outcomes of these patients are unknown, as is the clinical utility of measuring circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Follow-up was evaluated in patients enrolled in a phase II trial (NCT04082572) that evaluated the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in patients with localized dMMR/MSI-H tumors. The primary outcomes of this trial have previously been reported. 3-year EFS and OS rates were 80% (95% CI: 66% – 93%) and 94% (95% CI: 86% – 100%). Patients without detectable ctDNA after pembrolizumab had higher 3-year EFS and OS rates than patients with detectable ctDNA after pembrolizumab (3-year EFS 92% vs 20%; p < 0.001, 3-year OS 100% vs 80%; p < 0.001). Patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) who had undetectable ctDNA after pembrolizumab were more likely to have pCR compared to those with detectable ctDNA after pembrolizumab (91% vs 0%; p = 0.03). Patients with CRC who were managed non-operatively and had undetectable ctDNA after pembrolizumab had a higher 2-year EFS rate than patients with detectable ctDNA after pembrolizumab (100% vs 33%; p = 0.03).

 Oxidation of alkenes with O3 and photoexcited nitroarenes represents one of the most attractive organic chemical transformations for the synthesis of oxygen-enriched molecules. However, known achievements are mainly limited to carbon chain-shortened oxidation and carbon chain-retained oxidation of alkenes.

This study shows by sequentially swelling hydrogels the mechanic properties can be properly balanced. 
 Nature suggests concepts for materials with efficient mechanical energy storage and release, i.e., resilience, involving small energy dissipation upon mechanical loading and unloading, such as in resilin and elastin. These materials facilitate burst-like movements involving high stiffness and low strain and high reversibility. Synthetic hydrogels that allow highly reversible mechanical energy storage have remained a challenge, despite mimicking biological soft tissues. Here we show a synthetic concept using fixed hydrogel polymer compositions based on sequentially swollen and sequentially photopolymerized gelation steps for hierarchical networks. The sequential swellings facilitate the balance of properties between resilience and dissipation upon controlling of the chain extension. At low hierarchical levels, we show resilience with small hysteresis with increased stiffness and resilient energy storage, whereas at high hierarchical levels, a transition is shown to a dissipative and considerably reinforced state. The generality of this approach is shown using several photopolymerizable monomers.

 This work reports the successful production of rare earth (RE) metal using Na-RE-F. Presently, RE metals are primarily produced using RE-fluoride due to its higher air and moisture stability compared to RE-chloride. However, its preparation requires the use of corrosive and hazardous chemicals, such as hydrofluoric acid (HF) or ammonium bifluoride (NH4HF2). The present study demonstrates that Na-RE-F is an alternative salt to the typically used RE-fluoride. The Na-RE-F for this work is produced via a scalable hydrometallurgical approach using three different RE salts as feedstock, including acetate, nitrate, and chloride. HF is neither used nor generated during the salt preparation process. Furthermore, the Na-RE-F powder dries in air (without dry HF), and only water evolves during the drying process. Analyses of the Na-RE-F show that NaF liberates as a flux during the heating process, which lowers the salt reduction temperature to <900 °C, thus minimizing or eliminating the need for additional flux. Calciothermic reduction of the Na-RE-F salt is successfully employed to obtain RE metal. This work represents a safer, greener, and more widely deployable approach for producing the RE metals needed for permanent magnets which support the transition to a cleaner society through the decarbonization of the transportation industry.

 Carbon storage in soils is important in regulating atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). However, the sensitivity of the soil-carbon turnover time (τsoil) to temperature and hydrology forcing is not fully understood. Here, we use radiocarbon dating of plant-derived lipids in conjunction with reconstructions of temperature and rainfall from an eastern Mediterranean sediment core receiving terrigenous material from the Nile River watershed to investigate τsoilin subtropical and tropical areas during the last 18,000 years. We find that τsoil was reduced by an order of magnitude over the last deglaciation and that temperature was the major driver of these changes while the impact of hydroclimate was relatively small. We conclude that increased CO2 efflux from soils into the atmosphere constituted a positive feedback to global warming. However, simulated glacial-to-interglacial changes in a dynamic global vegetation model underestimate our data-based reconstructions of soil-carbon turnover times suggesting that this climate feedback is underestimated.

 DDX3X is an X-linked RNA helicase that escapes X chromosome inactivation and is expressed at higher levels in female brains. Mutations in DDX3X are associated with intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and are predominantly identified in females (DDX3X syndrome). Using cellular and mouse models, we show that Ddx3x mediates sexual dimorphisms in brain development at a molecular, cellular, and behavioral level. During cortical neuronal development, Ddx3x sustains a female-biased signature of enhanced ribosomal biogenesis and mRNA metabolism. Compared to male neurons, female neurons display larger nucleoli, higher expression of a set of ribosomal proteins, and a higher cytoplasm-to-nucleus ratio of ribosomal RNA. All these sex dimorphisms are obliterated by Ddx3x loss. Ddx3x regulates dendritic arborization complexity in a sex- and dose-dependent manner in both female and male neurons. Ddx3x modulates the development of dendritic spines but only in female neurons. Further, ablating Ddx3x conditionally in forebrain neurons is sufficient to yield sex-specific changes in developmental outcomes and motor function. Together, these findings pose Ddx3x as a mediator of sexual differentiation during neurodevelopment and open new avenues to understand sex differences in health and disease.

Our findings reveal a 20–60% increase in the 10 and 90 percentiles detrended lake surface temperature in the last 50 years relative to the first 30 years. Heatwave and cold-spell intensities, measured via annual degree days, showed strong coherence with the Arctic Oscillation (period: 2.5 years), Southern Oscillation Index (4 years), and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (6.5 years), indicating significant links between lake surface temperature extremes and both interannual and decadal climate teleconnections.

 North Sea human-made, offshore structures (e.g. oil/gas platforms, offshore wind farms) provide a hard substrate habitat for benthic marine species which can spread between sites during their larval stage. Here, we aim to address how the installation of additional human-made structures, like new wind farms, or decommissioning of existing ones, like oil and gas platforms at the end of service, contribute to changes in larval connectivity. We use particle tracking model simulations to assess the ecological connectivity of benthic species in the northern North Sea during two contrasting years to highlight seasonal to annual variability. The methodology of releasing an extensive set of particles over a wide area produces our Retrospective Particle Tracks dataset. The sets of simulations can be interrogated to understand if additional human-made structures placed in any locations in the northern North Sea could potentially affect the ecological connectivity. Network metrics were used to identify connectivity between sites. Clustering of existing structures identifies a region that acts as an interchange between other structures which may otherwise only be connected during intermittent periods. The addition of new human-made structures located in areas with stronger residual current flow would enhance the connectivity.

 Estuarine and coastal areas are important sources of methane emitted to the atmosphere through diffusion or ebullition. These processes can be triggered by pressure changes and water column mixing, which can be induced by ships. However, the contribution of ship-triggered emissions is unknown and missing in current emission inventories. Here we show evidence of extensive ship-induced methane emissions and an estimated methane flux (11.1 mmol m−2 day−1) from Neva Bay shipping lane. The flux is 10–1000 times higher than reported global estuarine/coastal fluxes, and of similar magnitude as aquatic methane emission hotspots. Our results indicate that ship-induced pressure changes (30–60 mbar) trigger methane emission, comparable with observed emissions induced by tidal pressure changes. The ship-triggered methane emissions corresponded to a 22% increase of emitted carbon dioxide equivalents, compared to the combustion related exhausts.

Here we introduce a limited area artificial intelligence-based weather forecasting model with 3 km and 1 h resolutions, utilizing parallel global-local structures to capture multiscale meteorological features. The model is trained on high-resolution regional analysis data, and utilizes the global artificial intelligence-based model forecasts for the lateral boundary condition during prediction, and operates much faster than the dynamical forecast model. In two selected limited areas, it outperforms dynamical forecast models in surface wind speed forecasting but underperforms in surface temperature and pressure. Skills in surface temperature and pressure can be further improved comparable to the dynamical forecast model by providing better lateral boundary conditions.

 The Indian Ocean Dipole exhibits large variations in its evolution depending on the presence of El Niño, with notable changes in intensity, duration, and peak phase. Here, using a simple Indian Ocean Dipole model and observational-reanalysis datasets, we revealed that Indian Ocean Dipole events co-evolving with El Niño exhibit an early-summer growth-disruption, which results from a sudden decrease in Indian Ocean Dipole sensitivity to El Niño in May and June, despite the steadily increasing El Niño’s amplitude. In May and June, as the Intertropical Convergence Zone migrates northward with the onset of South Asian monsoon, El Niño-induced low-level cyclonic circulation causes Ekman upwelling over the western Indian Ocean, which stalls Indian Ocean Dipole development. Moist linear baroclinic model experiments verified that the Intertropical Convergence Zone modulates El Niño–Southern Oscillation’s impact on Indian Ocean Dipole seasonally. This study underscores the importance of understanding sub-seasonal dynamics of Indian Ocean Dipole evolution. The Indian Ocean Dipole events co-evolving with El Niño-Southern Oscillation typically have a double peak and a brief pause in early summer due to a sudden decrease in Dipole sensitivity in May and June, attributed to northward rainfall migration, according to analysis of an Indian Ocean Dipole model with observational-reanalysis datasets."

 Countries increasingly rely on metal ores for the energy transition but face potential supply constraints. Here we combine multi-region input–output analysis with corporate ownership data from 2000 to 2022 for ten widely used metals, and visualize the results using Sankey diagrams for 159 countries plus four world regions. We find no association between a country’s wealth and the share of its locally extracted ores under domestic control, highlighting the highly globalized nature of the mining sector. Similarly, overseas mine ownership does not translate into direct material flows back to the controlling region, indicating that market forces can overshadow corporate influence. Despite no measurable trade shifts, foreign ownership remains a potential lever for supply chain disruptions. By integrating corporate control into criticality assessments, policymakers can identify future vulnerabilities and strengthen resource security. Enhanced data transparency is also essential for building resilient supply chains.

 In February 2022, eastern Australia experienced an extreme flood due to a combination of intense rainfall and close to saturation initial soil water conditions. It resulted in record-breaking water levels and flood volumes, leading to Australia’s largest total insurance claim for a single flood event. Here we analyse the physical factors underlying this event and compare them with a large dataset of floods in Australia dating back to 1950. Our findings show that February 2022 had the largest impact on design flood volumes with a 1% annual exceedance probability, which are expected to increase by 16% on average across the affected region.

 The Land Surface Temperature (LST) is well suited to monitor biosphere–atmosphere interactions in forests, as it depends on water availability and atmospheric/meteorological conditions above and below the canopy. Satellite-based LST has proven integral in observing evapotranspiration, estimating surface heat fluxes and characterising vegetation properties. Since the radiative regime of forests is complex, driven by canopy structure, components radiation properties and their arrangement, forest radiative temperatures are subject to strong angular effects. However, this depends on the scale of observation, where scattering mechanisms from canopy – to satellite – scales influence anisotropy with varying orders of magnitude. Given the heterogeneous and complex nature of forests, multi-angular data collection is particularly difficult, necessitating instrumentation distant enough from the canopy to obtain significant canopy brightness temperature and concurrent observations to exclude turbulence/atmospheric effects. Accordingly, current research and understanding on forest anisotropy at varying scales (from local validation level to satellite footprint) remain insufficient to provide practical solutions for addressing angular effects for upcoming thermal satellite sensors and associated validation schemes. This study presents a novel method founded in the optical remote sensing domain to explore the use of microcanopies that represent forests at different scales in the footprint of a multi-angular goniometer observing system. Both Geometric Optical (GO) and volumetric scattering dominated canopies are constructed to simulate impacts of anisotropy in heterogeneous and homogeneous canopies, and observed using a thermal infrared radiometer. Results show that heterogeneous canopies dominated by GO scattering are subject to much higher magnitudes of anisotropy, reaching maximum temperature differences of 3 °C off-nadir. Magnitudes of anisotropy are higher in sparse forests, where the gap fraction and crown arrangement (inducing sunlit/shaded portions of soil and vegetation) drive larger off-nadir differences. In dense forests, anisotropy is driven by viewing the maximum portion of sunlit vegetation (hotspot), where the soil is mostly obscured. Canopy structural metrics such as the fractional cover and gap fraction were found to have significant correlation with off-nadir differences. In more homogeneous canopies, anisotropy reaches a lower magnitude with temperature differences up to 1 °C, driven largely by volumetric scattering and components radiation properties. Optimal placement of instrumentation at the canopy-scale (more heterogeneous behaviour due to proximity to the canopy and small pixel size) used to validate satellite observations (more homogeneous behaviour due to larger pixel size) was found to be in cases of viewing maximum sunlit vegetation, for dense canopies. Given upcoming high spatial resolution sensors and associated validation schemes needed to benchmark LST and downstream products such as evapotranspiration, a better understanding of anisotropy over forests is critical to provide accurate, long-term and multi-sensor products."

 3D Transformers have achieved great success in point cloud understanding and representation. However, there is still considerable scope for further development in effective and efficient Transformers for large-scale LiDAR point cloud scene segmentation. This paper proposes a novel 3D Transformer framework, named 3D Learnable Supertoken Transformer (3DLST). The key contributions are summarized as follows. Firstly, we introduce the first Dynamic Supertoken Optimization (DSO) block for efficient token clustering and aggregating, where the learnable supertoken definition avoids the time-consuming pre-processing of traditional superpoint generation. Since the learnable supertokens can be dynamically optimized by multi-level deep features during network learning, they are tailored to the semantic homogeneity-aware token clustering. Secondly, an efficient Cross-Attention-guided Upsampling (CAU) block is proposed for token reconstruction from optimized supertokens. Thirdly, the 3DLST is equipped with a novel W-net architecture instead of the common U-net design, which is more suitable for Transformer-based feature learning. The SOTA performance on challenging LiDAR datasets (airborne MultiSpectral LiDAR (MS-LiDAR) (89.3% of the average F1 score) and DALES (80.2% of mIoU)) demonstrate the superiority of 3DLST. Furthermore, 3DLST also achieves satisfactory results in terms of algorithm efficiency, which is up to 5× faster than previous best-performing methods."

 Utilizing the Asian-Pacific oscillation (APO) index on a daily scale to gain a comprehensive understanding of summer daily rainfall variations and their underlying physical mechanisms is helpful to improve the accuracy of daily rainfall pattern predictions in central-northern China. To address this, we utilized observational 24-h accumulated rainfall data from China and the reanalysis products from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) and investigated the relationship between daily APO, atmospheric circulation, and rainfall in central-northern China on the daily timescale. It delves into the evolution of the daily APO index (DAI) and its connection to atmospheric circulation and rainfall. Corresponding to instances of daily extremely high and low APO, there is a notable intensification in the sea-land thermal contrast and the associated southerly winds, which leads to abundant water vapor and widespread rainfall anomalies in central-northern China. The daily APO signal emerges as an indicator of rainfall events in this region, detectable up to seven days in advance. These findings are in favor of understanding the mechanism for East Asian monsoon and associated rainfall in central-northern China on the daily timescale."

 Based on the results of numerical simulations, a possible mechanism for the occurrence of a rapid increase in lightning frequency preceding a downburst was investigated according to cloud microphysical processes in mixed-phase areas. To elucidate the mechanism, idealized experiments were conducted targeting multi-cell convective clouds using a meteorological model coupled with a bulk lightning model, which explicitly calculates riming, charge separation via riming electrification, and lightning discharge. The model well reproduced a rapid increase in the lightning flash rate in multi-cell convective clouds approximately 15 min before a downburst. In a convective cell during increasing flash rate, solid hydrometeors were supplied to the convective area and riming electrification occurred actively. In contrast, in a convective cell that caused a downburst, riming occurred actively because of the supply of a large amount of supercooled water from the lower layers. A convective cell suitable for riming electrification or graupel growth by riming occurred when the convection was or was not tilted, respectively. The transition from tilted convection suitable for riming electrification to upright convection suitable for active riming growth is critical for the occurrence of the rapid increase of lightning preceding downbursts."

In this work, we describe a 617–kilo–base pairs integrated giant viral element in the model green algaChlamydomonas reinhardtii. We resolved the integrated viral genome using long-read sequencing, identified a putative polintovirus-like integrase, and show that viral particles accumulate primarily during the stationary growth phase. A diverse array of viral-encoded selfish genetic elements is expressed during viral activity, including several Fanzor nuclease–encoding transposable elements. In addition, we show that field isolates ofChlamydomonasspp. harbor signatures of endogenous giant viruses related to theC. reinhardtiivirus that exhibit similar infection dynamics, suggesting that giant virus latency is prevalent in natural host communities.

We also find deeply divergent lineages north and south of the American ice sheets that genetically influenced populations across Beringia and into Eurasia. As climate warmed and horses entered the ice-free corridor connecting Beringia and midcontinental America, restricted mobility and food availability impeded population growth.

While issuers must provide post-issuance impact reports to inform investors about the allocation of proceeds, these reports lack standardization and often contain unverifiable claims, limiting independent assessment. We examined a dataset of 1600 corporate green bonds (CGBs) and found that only a small fraction provided project-level data. For these 32 bonds and their 192 projects, representing issuers with the highest level of disclosure, we applied a LCA-based methodology to verify the reliability of the environmental impact claims of the issuers. In about 73% of cases, reported avoided climate change (CC) impacts exceed LCA-based estimates, highlighting the lack of methodological consistency in post-issuance reporting. Applying a cost-effectiveness perspective, we estimate that one million euro invested in a CGB from our sample can avoid the annual CC impact of 44–48 European citizens, but effectiveness varies significantly across projects. Expanding the analysis beyond CC to other environmental impact categories reveals significant uncertainties and potential violations of the do no significant harm (DNSH) principle of the EU Taxonomy. This study demonstrates how LCA can enhance transparency by benchmarking green bond impact claims, comparing climate cost-effectiveness across investments, and ensuring compliance with DNSH through standardized metrics. However, the lack of mandatory project-level data disclosure, which is not requested by the existing green bond standards significantly limits the potential of such analyses. Strengthening project-level reporting, integrating LCA methodologies, and enforcing third-party verification would improve transparency, comparability, and credibility in CGB markets."

However, there is growing evidence of their ineffectiveness and the social-ecological concerns they raise, including emergent systemic risks. This paper presents a social-ecological systems approach, offering a model that acts as a boundary object to integrate knowledge, foster stakeholder collaboration to tackle community vulnerability, and facilitate policy experimentation—key elements for advancing adaptive management. Employing systems thinking and system dynamics-based modelling can bridge the divide between science and policy, especially in areas characterized by data limitations and uncertainties like the BRB. This study adopts a nested approach encompassing three scales: macro (basin-level hydro-geomorphology), meso (flood control policies and infrastructure at administrative levels), and micro (village-level socio-economic conditions). The constructed boundary object promotes cross-scale learning and policy experimentation. Model scenarios of policy alternatives demonstrate that an integrated strategy—leveraging land covered with coarse sediment, innovating land use, and redesigning floodplains—significantly enhances effective land use and minimizes embankment failures. The findings emphasize the reinforcing dynamics between embankment degradation and community protests, highlight the limitations of compensation mechanisms, and reveal the erosion of adaptive capacity under the current control-based policy regime. A crucial insight from this study is that flood management strategies must evolve continually, reflecting scientific advancements, assessing policy impacts, and addressing local adaptation needs. Furthermore, a greater focus on riparian land use within development strategies is essential. The model scenarios advocate transitioning from traditional flood control to a landscape design harmonizing cropping practices and floodplain development with river morphology dynamics. While rooted in the Indian BRB context, the modelling framework provides a basis for adaptive water governance in other sediment-rich, politically sensitive, and hydrologically dynamic transboundary basins."

The current landscape of biodiversity assessments typically requires time-intensive and costly field surveys that rarely match the pace of monitoring needs. Automated biodiversity monitoring could increase the speed and accuracy at which information on species and ecosystems is gathered, and thus improve the data used in conservation decision making. However, the extent of existing monitoring with these ‘digital assets’ is not well characterized, limiting how and where current data can be used and our understanding of where key gaps remain. Here, we catalog existing digital assets for monitoring living organisms globally, finding that they predominantly come from satellite data (68%) and monitor plants at coarse taxonomic resolutions. Additionally, the spatial coverage is biased towards regions in North America and Europe, and data availability frequently lags well behind its collection. We also developed a framework to describe key steps in creating digital assets that can be used to identify bottlenecks in their production, and suggest strategies to address barriers. In particular, investing in developing data processing algorithms, building and automating workflows, and increasing accessibility of existing data could help rapidly increase the availability of digital assets for biodiversity monitoring. Accelerating and expanding development of automated biodiversity assessments should pay broad dividends for managing and conserving biodiversity globally."

Existing studies often rely on correlation analysis and occasionally use causal inference, but they tend to overlook the intraseasonal scales of monsoon variability and their impact on vegetation water content. Traditional methods struggle to reveal these dependencies due to the tight coupling between SM and VPD, making it difficult to isolate their individual effects. This study fills this gap by analyzing the interactions between SM, vegetation water content, and VPD at the two dominant intraseasonal modes of the Southwest Monsoon, i.e. the 10–20 d and 30–60 d timescales, using multi-satellite observations from 1998 to 2018. We found a counterintuitive phase relationship in central India’s core monsoon zone, where vegetation optical depth (VOD), a measure of vegetation water content, is out of phase with SM but in phase with VPD. Our analysis indicates that VPD enhances vegetation’s water uptake, increasing VOD when SM is not limiting, extending even into monsoon breaks. The delayed impact of prior rainfall contributes to the soil-water availability during the break and subsequently, to the out-of-phase relationship between SM and VOD. While both intraseasonal variability modes are evident in SM, VPD, and VOD, the out-of-phase relationship between SM and VOD and the in-phase relationship between VPD and VOD are more pronounced at the 30–60 d scale. Given that intraseasonal variability is a key characteristic of the monsoon, shaping its seasonal totals and impacts, the findings from this study offer crucial insights into vegetation responses to climate variability in the Indian subcontinent.

The frequency and intensity of unprecedented rainfall events have increased in recent years, underscoring the urgent need to revise design storms and depth-duration frequency (DDF) curves to better adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change. This study used a serial type of stochastic rainfall generator (SRG) that is capable of simulating daily rainfall series by embedding unprecedented events to study extreme precipitation scenarios under the changing climate. By perturbing values of power law tuning parameters in the SRG model, we developed thirty-six precipitation scenarios, some of which directly correlate with the current climate change scenario, while others represent very extreme conditions. High-performance computing is employed to run the computationally intensive SRG for simulating thirty-six scenarios across the entire Indian region. These simulated scenarios were analyzed to prepare rainfall return level maps and DDF curves. The findings reveal substantial increases in rainfall return levels across all frequencies when unprecedented events are considered, with pronounced impacts in coastal, northeastern, and Himalayan regions. The spatial pattern of simulated extreme precipitation was consistent across all generated scenarios from SRG irrespective of the return periods. Minimal spatial uncertainty in return level estimates across climate zones is observed which confirms the robustness of the SRG model and spatial clusters of extreme rainfall are identified irrespective of SRG being a point model. The analysis in this study based on SRG simulated climate change scenarios offers crucial insights for revising design storms and for devising climate resilience and flood management strategies."

In this study, a systematic investigation involving a life cycle approach, structure analysis, sensitivity analysis and the individual fixed regression was conducted on the structure, changing trends and driving factors of carbon footprint in Chinese sugarcane industry from 2012 to 2021. Results showed that the national average value of carbon footprint per unit area was 7.8317 t CO2e ha−1, whereas the average carbon footprint of yield and output were 0.1029 t CO2e t−1 and 0.2311 kg CO2e yuan−1, respectively. Notably, significant differences were observed in the carbon footprint of each main production region. Due to regional natural resource conditions, variations in industrial structure and differences in cultivation technology, Guangdong had the highest average carbon footprint per unit area (8.8213 t CO2e ha−1), while Hainan exhibited the lowest carbon footprint per unit area (7.0263 t CO2e ha−1), which was 79.65% of that in Guangdong. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that when the major carbon source varies ±40%, the indirect sensitivity coefficient was 0.9775. Interestingly, Yunnan displayed the highest direct sensitivity (0.9802), while the weakest direct sensitivity (0.6098) was observed in Guangxi. At both natural and social levels, the main drivers of carbon footprint in sugarcane were fertilizer, agricultural film, sugarcane machinery and the disposable income of rural residents. From all the above, optimizing cultivation practices and machinery use, reducing fertilizer and agricultural film inputs while maintaining high yield and high sugar production and low-carbon utilization of straw represent the three directions for low-carbon sugarcane production in the future."

Advocates endorse the combined goals of universal, affordable access to electricity, and the use of clean, renewable sources of energy. In the Global South and particularly Africa, international organizations are promoting these rapid green energy transitions with financing and encouraging private sector investment and innovation. What remains unclear is how rapid green energy transitions are experienced by citizens, especially the poor in the Global South. Are the transitions just or equitably shared across populations? Kenya is an important country for assessing this question. Kenya is expected to achieve SDG 7, ‘sustainable energy access for all’, by 2030, one of the few African countries to reach this milestone. Kenya’s achievements, however, mask significant tensions surrounding its rapid energy transition. This paper reveals a mismatch between national and global narratives about access to electricity compared to local-level citizen experiences. The paper argues that the current transition aims for but is not achieving distributional justice. While there are many valuable lessons to take from Kenya’s experience, there are also significant concerns as the poor are carrying a heavy burden of the transition. Our analysis is based on focus groups, qualitative interviews, and survey data. The paper concludes by reflecting on the lessons from this critical case about the relationship between the global promotion of just energy transitions and African citizen needs."

Managing temperate forests to achieve these benefits sustainably is challenging given the legacy of past human impacts, the complexity of forest development, and increasing but unpredictable disturbances. These intricacies prompted debate about the most effective management of temperate forests to achieve climate mitigation while sustaining forest productivity, regeneration, and diversity. Most research focused on management impacts under relatively stable environmental conditions, whereas forests are facing increasingly frequent and more severe climatic and biotic disturbances. Here, we used a regionally calibrated forest growth model to simulate the effects of forest management on carbon, biodiversity, and wood production under prevalent natural disturbances in the northeastern US. We developed scenarios combining forest management and disturbance regimes based on assumptions of species-specific tree regeneration and mortality rates. We compared passive management with no cutting that prioritizes maintaining existing forest trees with two common regional harvest practices: exploitative timber harvest that prioritizes short-term wood production and regenerative timber harvest that prioritizes regenerating biodiverse native forest tree seedlings. In the absence of natural disturbance, no cutting provides 41% higher forest carbon storage and 50% higher tree structural diversity after 100 years than exploitative or regenerative practices. The presence of drought, windstorm, pest, and disease disturbances altered these outcomes. Regenerative forest management provides 25% higher forest carbon storage and 26% higher tree structural diversity after 100 years than no cutting. Our results demonstrate that wood products and their carbon storage and fossil emission avoidance are important for determining the total climate benefits of forest management under natural disturbances. Our findings highlight that natural disturbance regimes should be considered when selecting management to promote multiple forest benefits, suggesting the need for tailored as opposed to one-size-fits-all policies to sustainably manage temperate forests worldwide."

Currently, the FDRS is based upon the Canadian system, which is driven by only weather parameters. However, fires in Indonesia are primarily caused by human activities with most of them occurring on peatlands. Thus, it is necessary to integrate these factors in the development of the next generation FDRS to increase the precision and accuracy in assessing levels of fire danger in various Indonesian regions. This study presents a proof of concept for a new FDRS, applied in forest and peatland in Ogan Komering Ilir (OKI) District, South Sumatra Province, based on three parameters: weather, anthropogenic factors and presence or absence of peat. The anthropogenic and peatland FDRS (AP-FDRS) map was produced using a spatial logistic regression method for incorporating anthropogenic and peat models, using the fire weather index (FWI) model from forest and land fire early warning system together with an overlay method to produce a composite map of forest and peatland fire. In this study, 2 d in 2020 were selected as sample dates: one with hotspot occurrences (23 August 2020) and one without hotspots (28 December 2020). On 23 August 2020, the AP-FDRS map was dominated by high (54%) and extreme (46%) fire hazard levels after combining high FWI values with extreme AP risks in the OKI District. In contrast, on 28 December 2020, although the FWI indicated low fire risk, the integration with AP factors resulted in an AP-FDRS map dominated by medium (34%) and high (60%) fire hazard levels. These results highlight that weather factors alone are not sufficient to predict fire hazard risks in Indonesia. Therefore, the AP-FDRS provides more detailed and accurate predictions compared to current FWI based systems."

The Mekong River basin is one of the world’s most significant agricultural regions, sustaining millions through rice production and export. However, rapid hydrological changes from hydropower development, altered flow regimes, and climate variability threaten the flood pulses essential for rice cultivation. Using a multivariate autoregressive state space analysis, we examined how hydrological variability influences rice production across four lower Mekong basin countries: Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Our study integrated high-resolution hydrologic and agricultural data spanning decades to assess the effects of flood magnitude, duration, and saline intrusion on rice yields. We found significant spatial tradeoffs, particularly in areas affected by flooding and salinity. In Viet Nam, large flood pulses mitigate saline intrusion and expand arable land but reduce cultivation efficiency likely due to fertilizer runoff. In Cambodia, where saline intrusion is minimal, excessive flooding lead to field inundation and reduced arable land, decreasing yields. Our findings reveal the complex interactions between hydrology, land use, and agricultural productivity, emphasizing the need for coordinated transboundary water management. By identifying key tradeoffs, this research informs decision-makers on optimizing agricultural strategies to ensure food system resilience amid changing hydrological and climatic conditions."

To address this, we explored three different models for predicting air temperature in dynamic outdoor settings using wrist-mounted wearable sensors. Data was collected for 22 d between 2020 and 2024 in Sydney, Australia. Each experiment involved 6–15 participants walking through different built environments. When air temperature and relative humidity measured by wrist-mounted sensors were compared to reference sensors, we found that wrist-mounted wearables cannot directly measure air temperature due to the influence of skin temperature. However, we can use their data to train a prediction model for air temperature. We explored three prediction methods: a steady-state heat transfer model of human skin, multi-linear regression, and random forest machine learning (ML). Results showed that the heat transfer model relied heavily on climatic parameters which could not be measured by wrist-mounted sensors, limiting the applicability of this method. The linear regression model (developed solely based on wrist-mounted data) neglected the non-linear correlation between wrist air temperature and wrist skin temperature. The ML approach, however, was capable of capturing non-linear, multi-dimensional relationships and demonstrated the best predictive performance. ML tested on out-of-sample data achieved a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.97 (in contrast with 0.60 and 0.88 for heat transfer and linear regression) between predicted and observed air temperature, with mean absolute error of <1 °C (in contrast with 4.43 and 1.81 °C). This performance is equivalent to the accuracy of many common air temperature sensors. This prediction model can be an effective method for providing high-resolution air temperature data in cities with temperate climates, such as Sydney, while informing future work in other climate backgrounds."

It has been conceived for subsequent elemental composition analysis (from Na to Pb) by particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE), but optical techniques may also be applied to measure black and brown carbon. Its use combined with other high-temporal-resolution instrumentation can provide complete chemical speciation of aerosols on an hourly basis. 
 The joint use of hourly resolution sampling and analyses with accelerated ion beams such as with the particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) technique has allowed the measurement of hourly temporal patterns of particulate matter (PM) composition at many sites in different parts of the world. The demand within the scientific community for this type of analysis has been continuously increasing in recent years, but hourly resolution samplers suitable for PIXE analysis have been discontinued and/or suffer from some technical limitations. In this framework, a new hourly sampler, STRAS (Size- and Time-Resolved Aerosol Sampler), was developed for the collection of PM10, PM2.5 or PM1. It allows automatic sequential sampling of up to 168 hourly samples (1 week), and it is mechanically robust, compact and easily transportable. To increase PIXE sensitivity, each sample is concentrated on a small surface area on a polycarbonate membrane. Comparison between the elemental concentrations retrieved by STRAS samples and samples collected using a standard sequential sampler operated in parallel shows very good agreement; indeed, if both the samplers use the same kind of membrane, the concentrations of all detected elements are in agreement within 10 %."

Evans,Comparison of methods for resolving the contributions of local emissions to measured concentrations,"We tested a variety of scientific measurements and algorithms for distinguishing the amounts of air pollution that were emitted by a nearby polluter from background pollution that was already in the air. The results show that machine learning and other statistical algorithms produced accurate estimates of this background pollution. These findings help scientists and regulators to understand where pollution comes from and to improve measurements of pollution from sources like traffic. 
 To accurately study the characteristics of an air pollution emitter, it is necessary to isolate the contribution of that emitter to total measured pollution concentrations. A variety of published methods exist to complete this task, like placing measurements upwind the emitter, employing a distant background measurement station, or algorithmic methods that extract a background from the time series of measured concentrations (e.g. wavelet decomposition). In this study, we measured nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at four sites spanning Toronto, Ontario, Canada. We first characterized the spatial variability of background concentrations across the city and then tested the accuracy of seven different algorithmic methods of estimating true measured upwind-of-emitter backgrounds near Toronto's Highway 401 by using the data collected at a downwind site. These methods included time-series and regression methods, including machine learning (XGBoost). We observed background concentrations had notable spatial variability, except for PM2.5. When predicting backgrounds upwind the highway, we found a distant measurement station provided an accurate background only during some times of day and was least accurate during rush hours. When testing algorithmic predictions of upwind-of-highway backgrounds, we found that regression models surpassed the performance of time-series methods, with best predictions having R2 exceeding 0.8 for all four pollutants. Despite the better performance of regression models, time-series methods still provided reasonable estimates. We also found that emitter-specific covariates (e.g. traffic counts, on-site dispersion modelling) did not play an important role in regressions, suggesting backgrounds can be well characterized by time of day, meteorology, and distant measurement stations. Based on our results, we provide ranked recommendations for choosing background estimation methods. We suggest future air pollution research characterizing individual emitters includes careful consideration of how background concentrations are estimated."

We suggest better monitoring, technology, and collaboration to improve understanding of ocean changes. These efforts will help predict climate impacts and support marine conservation and sustainable resource use. 
 The Indonesian Seas and Surroundings (ISS) play an important role in global ocean circulation by connecting the Pacific and Indian Oceans via the global thermohaline circulation. This region regulates the exchange of water mass, heat, salinity, and biogeochemical elements, further influencing the global climate and carbon cycle. Consequently, extensive observations and surveys, particularly the in-situ measurements, have been conducted over the past two centuries. This study analyzed over 461,865 oceanographic casts from multiple international repositories, with 360,409 casts, or 21.97 % rejection, after rigorous quality control. The findings indicate that data collection was sparse and temporally limited before the early 19th century, with a marked increase beginning from the mid-20th century. Spatially, observations are heavily concentrated along major international shipping routes, including the Makassar Strait, Malacca Strait, and South China Seas, while vast areas, such as the Halmahera Sea, Timor Sea, Java Sea, and Sulawesi Sea, remain poorly detected. Temperature and salinity are the most collected data, whereas deep-sea observations, particularly below 800 meters, are critically lacking, with limited measurements of essential ocean variables such as dissolved oxygen, nutrients, and currents. Additionally, coastal regions exhibit substantial data deficiencies. Given the region's complex ocean-atmosphere interactions and unique topographic features, the current observational coverage remains insufficient to resolve the uncertainties in Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) variability, ocean heat transport, and monsoon forecasting. This study proposes to address the gaps by deploying autonomous monitoring technologies (Argo floats, gliders, moored buoys) in deep-sea and coastal regions, expanding regional observational networks, and enhancing executable data-sharing mechanisms.

A common set of emissions, environmental conditions, and observation datasets is proposed (where possible) to enhance the MME comparability. A novel harmonized simulation approach between atmospheric, land, oceanic, and multimedia models is proposed to account for the short- and long-term changes in secondary Hg exchanges and to achieve mechanistic consistency of Hg levels across environmental matrices.

Roberts,Resolution dependence of interlinked Southern Ocean biases in global coupled HadGEM3 models,"The Southern Ocean is a key region of the world ocean in the context of climate change studies. We show that the Met Office Hadley Centre coupled model with intermediate ocean resolution struggles to accurately simulate the Southern Ocean. Increasing the frictional drag that the seafloor exerts on ocean currents and introducing a representation of unresolved ocean eddies both appear to reduce the large-scale biases in this model. 
 The early spinup of the HadGEM3 coupled model displays large-scale biases in the Southern Ocean at an eddy-permitting ocean resolution: the subpolar gyres and Antarctic Slope Current (ASC) are too active, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) transport is too weak, and there are large-scale water mass biases on the Antarctic shelf and in the open ocean. Most of the biases persist for at least 100 years of the model spinup. This set of biases is largely absent with a non-eddying ocean model and reduced with an eddy-rich ocean model. We show that damping the gyres and the ASC in the eddy-permitting model, either by introducing a parameterization of baroclinic instability or by changing the lateral momentum boundary condition to increase bathymetric drag, acts to alleviate all the biases. This suggests that the fundamental issue in the eddy-permitting model may be to do with unresolved eddy processes and/or the representation of bathymetric drag on the flow. We investigate the structure of the biases in more detail and show that the eddy-permitting model has steep isopycnals near the Antarctic shelf slope, consistently with a strong ASC and reduced transport of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) onto the shelf. However, across the region of the ACC jets, the eddy-permitting model has shallower isopycnal slopes than the other models, consistently with a weaker ACC transport and warm near-surface biases in the open ocean."

Here we show an adaptive water system federated averaging (AWSFA) framework based on federated learning (FL), where the model does not access the data but uses parameters trained by the raw data. The study collected data from six WWTPs between 2018 and 2024, and developed 10 machine learning models for each effluent indicator, with the best performance bidirectional long-term memory network (BM) as Baseline. Compared to direct training and classical federated averaging (FedAvg), AWSFA reduces the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of BM significantly. Analysis of input dimensions, data set size, and interpretability reveals that the performance improvement is not driven by the complexity of algorithm design but by data sharing via parameter sharing. By simulation of possible disturbances in water quality, the model remained robust when 50% of key features were missing. The study provides the way forward for data sharing and privacy preservation of water systems and offers theoretical support for the digital transformation of WWTPs in the era of big data and big model."

Salt pollution in lakes and rivers is well characterized. Lacking are broad insights for seasonal ponds. As critical habitats for many endemic species, these small and often poorly flushed surface waters are especially vulnerable to accumulating high levels of salts and other pollutants. Here, we measured salinity in 165 seasonal ponds, characterizing salt pollution patterns across space, through time, and over depth within ponds. We found that 70% of ponds within 37 m of a road contained salinity levels exceeding Canadian federal guidelines. 54% of ponds within 25 m exceeded less conservative US federal guidelines. Within ponds, the water column was stratified due to the combined density effects of salt and temperature. Bottom waters of polluted ponds were about 57% saltier than near-surface waters, though many were much saltier than this. Compared to lakes and rivers, far more seasonal ponds appear to be compromised by deicing salt, and overall, the concentration of salt appears to be substantially higher. Among aquatic habitats, seasonal ponds are experiencing the most severe impacts of freshwater salinization, with consequent impacts on sensitive aquatic organisms."

Therefore, elucidating the mechanisms of PFOS-induced damage and identifying effective protective strategies are of critical importance. In this study, an untargeted metabolomic analysis revealed that PFOS exposure significantly disrupted metabolic homeostasis in oocytes. Using public databases to predict potential target proteins of PFOS and performing KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, we identified the tryptophan metabolism pathway as a key target of PFOS. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated specific binding between PFOS and proteins involved in the tryptophan metabolism pathway, leading to dynamic structural alterations in these proteins. Furthermore, supplementation with tryptophan was shown to significantly enhance mitochondrial function in oocytes, regulate the glutathione (GSH)/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratio, reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and alleviate oxidative stress, thereby mitigating the decline in oocyte quality caused by PFOS exposure.

A more comprehensive study is needed to improve understanding of hailstorms in this region, and may also provide new insights into the requirements for hailstorms worldwide. This study uses simulations of five recent hailstorms created with the Weather Research and Forecasting Model to evaluate the pre‐storm environments, and five additional simulations help differentiate these environments from those associated with storms that lacked hailfall. Compared to other regions experiencing hailstorms, the mT environments exhibit moderate CAPE, much less deep‐layer shear, and much higher low‐level specific humidity. These environmental conditions typically result in ordinary single‐cell, pulse‐type storms. The introduction of a new variable, NetCAPE (the net value of CAPE after accounting for precipitation loading and any CIN at lower levels), demonstrates potential in distinguishing hail from no‐hail events in the mT. The median NetCAPE for the five hail events is over 40% greater within various depths of the hail growth zone, and when combined with lower near‐surface relative humidity and melting level heights, differentiates most hail from no‐hail cases."

Here, we analyzed global AET trends from 2001 to 2019 and assessed the relative contributions of six key influencing factors. Our findings reveal that AET exhibits a significant positive trend across 31.6% of the global land surface, predominantly in the Amazon Plain and the Loess Plateau of China, whereas a significant negative trend is observed over 5.2% of the land area, concentrated in eastern Brazil and southern Africa. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) showed the strongest partial correlation with AET, influencing 26.6% of the global land area. Multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis indicates that precipitation exerts the greatest influence on AET in 39.9% of the world, followed by wind speed (WS) at 37.9%, while soil moisture (SM) is the dominant factor in only 0.2% of the global land area. Notably, WS drives 23.5% of the observed AET trends, whereas precipitation contributes most to trends in just 8.6% of the land area. Among the factors evaluated, NDVI emerges as the primary driver of AET changes, followed by precipitation, while surface net solar radiation (SNSR) has the weakest influence.

At minimum, effective station‐keeping of HABs requires opposing winds at two different altitudes. Wind diversity trends in the lower stratosphere are highly dependent on geographic area, altitude range, and time of year. To investigate historical wind diversity trends, we analyzed over 1.25 million radiosonde sounding launches from the Western Hemisphere between 2012 and 2023. Radiosondes provide higher vertical resolution than standard reanalysis forecasts, which often underestimate wind diversity due to smoothing during the global assimilation process. Overall, our analysis reveals that higher opposing winds probabilities tend to follow the summer months for each hemisphere, respectively, with the exception being the tropics, which typically have strong opposing wind probabilities year round. Similarly, the summer months also tend to have a higher probability of calm (“light‐and‐variable”) winds, although in a smaller latitudinal and altitude bands than opposing winds. Transition months, typically in the spring and fall, have the highest variation in opposing wind probabilities from decadal means, while the summer and winter months have more predictable regional trends.

Delta experienced rapid intensification (RI) before abruptly weakening before making landfall. Two sampling periods by reconnaissance aircraft provided observations during RI and the subsequent rapid weakening, giving an opportunity to study the downdraft evolution and compare these two periods. Across both sampling periods, the vertical wind shear increased, causing the vortex to tilt and exposing Delta's inner core to the surrounding environment. The increased shear provided a pathway for downdraft ventilation, the transport of low‐equivalent potential temperature θe $\left({\theta }_{e}\right)$ air aloft into the boundary layer via downdrafts. Aircraft Doppler radar measured intense, deep downdrafts toward the end of the RI period; however, minimal downdraft ventilation was observed. After peak intensity, during the weakening period, downdraft ventilation was more prevalent with moderate to intense downdrafts and low‐θe ${\theta }_{e}$ air concentrated on the left‐of‐tilt side of the storm. The observations show that as Delta weakened, the inner core became diluted with low‐θe ${\theta }_{e}$ air from downdraft ventilation and the convection was limited to the downtilt and left‐of‐tilt regions of the storm. These findings are consistent with previous idealized and real‐case modeling studies that have shown downdraft ventilation weakens tropical cyclones and degrades their structure. Additionally, the location of the downdraft ventilation observations relative to the vortex tilt and shear directions agree with previous modeling studies. More broadly, observations of the downdraft structure and diagnostics of downdraft ventilation may provide cues of subsequent intensity change in sheared storms."

However, the lack of robust, spatially explicit estimates of C stocks in BCEs presents a major challenge to incorporating them into national and global C accounting and climate mitigation strategies. For the first time, we develop spatially explicit estimates of both soil and living biomass C stocks in BCEs across China by integrating open‐access remote sensing, climate, and soil property data with 2,899 site measurements using a data‐driven method. Our C stock estimates reveal that mean C stocks in BCEs significantly decrease with increasing latitude. We estimate the total C storage within China's BCEs at 121.1 ± 48.4 Tg C, with soil accounting for 90% of the total C storage. Tidal marshes and flats contribute a total of 64.7 ± 8.7 Tg C, while mangroves store a much smaller amount (4.4 ± 1.4 Tg C) due to their limited spatial extent. Seagrasses store a total of 52.0 ± 38.3 Tg C, which is significantly larger than previous estimates. These findings underscore the significant potential of BCEs protection and restoration for China's climate mitigation efforts. Our spatially explicit C stock estimates for China's BCEs provide essential data for national and global C accounting and can serve as baselines for quantifying the impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities on BCEs C stocks.

Private finance channeled through carbon credits is one way to fund that mitigation, but market‐based approaches to forest carbon projects have been fraught to date. Public skepticism of forest carbon markets signals a need to closely scrutinize the system for certifying carbon credits. We rigorously reviewed and scored new and existing protocols for the voluntary and North American compliance carbon markets. We included protocols for forest projects engaging in improved forest management, afforestation/reforestation, and avoided planned forest conversion. Most protocols score poorly overall, and none were assessed as robust. Only one new protocol that had yet to issue credits at the time of our evaluation was assessed as satisfactory, owing to improvements in the approach to additionality demonstration. We conclude that existing protocols do not ensure carbon credits are consistently real, high‐quality, and accurately represent 1 tonne of avoided, reduced, or removed emissions. We offer recommendations for how protocols can be strengthened using existing data and new tools to promote reliably high‐quality credits. Continuing to rely on the status quo without such investments is a serious risk to climate change mitigation, and in our estimation, these proposed improvements would increase the likelihood that forests carbon projects can deliver their promised climate mitigation benefits."

 Low-cost ruthenium-based catalysts with high activity have emerged as promising alternatives to iridium-based counterparts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE), but the poor stability under high current density remains as a key challenge. Here, we utilize the synergistic complementary strategy of introducing earth-abundant Mn and Nb dopants in ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) for Nb0.1Mn0.1Ru0.8O2 nanoparticle electrocatalyst that exhibits a low overpotential of 209 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and good stability of > 400 h at 0.2 A cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4. Significantly, a PEMWE device fabricated with Nb0.1Mn0.1Ru0.8O2 anode can operate continuously at least for 1000 h at 0.5 A cm−2 with 59 μV h−1 decay rate. Operando Raman spectroscopy analysis, differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy measurements, X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that OER reaction on Nb0.1Mn0.1Ru0.8O2 primarily follows the adsorbate evolution mechanism with much favorable energy barrier accompanied by a locally passivated lattice oxygen mechanism (AEM-LPLOM) and the co-existed Nb and Mn in RuO2 crystal lattice could not only stabilize the lattice oxygen, but also relieve the valence state fluctuation of Ru site to stabilize the catalyst during the reaction.

Here the authors show that the thermal properties of the skin are reactive to diet and that skin is a target for dietary fat delivery. 
 Skin is a regulatory hub for energy expenditure and metabolism, and alteration of lipid metabolism enzymes in skin impacts thermogenesis and obesogenesis in mice. Here we show that thermal properties of skin are highly reactive to diet: within three days, a high fat diet reduces heat transfer through skin. In contrast, a dietary manipulation that prevents obesity accelerates energy loss through skins. We find that skin is the largest target for dietary fat delivery, and that dietary triglyceride is assimilated by epidermis and dermal white adipose tissue, persisting for weeks after feeding. With caloric-restriction, mouse skins thin and assimilation of circulating lipids decreases. Using multi-modal lipid profiling, keratinocytes and sebocytes are implicated in lipid changes, which correlate with thermal function. We propose that skin should be routinely included in physiological studies of lipid metabolism, given the size of the skin lipid reservoir and its adaptable functionality. The mechanisms underlying the regulation of the skin thermal barrier are poorly understood.

 Microbial synthesis of chemicals using renewable feedstocks has gained interest due to its sustainability. The class of β,γ-diols has unique chemical and physical properties, making them valuable for diverse applications. Here, we report a biosynthetic platform in Escherichia coli for the synthesis of branched-chain β,γ-diols from renewable feedstocks. Firstly, we identify an acetohydroxyacid synthase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to catalyze the condensation of branched-chain aldehydes with pyruvate, forming α-hydroxyketones. Next, de novo production of branched-chain β,γ-diols (4-methylpentane-2,3-diol, 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol and 4-methylhexane-2,3-diol) is realized from branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) metabolism. After systematic optimization of the BCAA pathway, we have achieved high-specificity production of 4-methylpentane-2,3-diol from glucose, achieving 129.8 mM (15.3 g/L) 4-methylpentane-2,3-diol with 72% of the theoretical yield. In summary, our work demonstrates the synthesis of structurally diverse branched-chain β,γ-diols, highlighting its potential as a versatile carbon elongation system for other β,γ-diol productions.

 Statistical characterisations of traits evolving on phylogenies combine the contributions of unique and shared influences on those traits, potentially confusing the interpretation of historical events of macroevolution. The Fabric model, introduced in 2022, identifies historical events of directional shifts in traits (e.g. becoming larger/smaller, faster/slower over evolutionary time) and of changes in macroevolutionary ‘evolvability’ or the realised historical ability of a trait to explore its trait-space. Here we extend the model to accommodate situations in which the trait is correlated with one or more covarying traits. The Fabric-regression model identifies a unique component of variance in the trait that is free of influences from correlated traits, while simultaneously estimating directional and evolvability effects. We show in a dataset of 1504 Mammalian species that inferences about historical directional shifts in brain size and in its evolvability, having accounted for body size, differ qualitatively from inferences about brain size alone, including finding many new effects not visible in the whole trait. A class of fundamental macroevolutionary questions awaits testing on the variation uniquely attributable to traits, and the ability to accommodate statistically one or more covariates opens the possibility of bringing the formal methods of causal inference to phylogenetic-comparative studies.

However, groundwater irrigation rates in the Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna delta exceed monsoonal recharge rates, reduce available surface freshwater and increase the risk of saltwater intrusion. 
 Southern Asia benefits from groundwater pumping for dry-season irrigation by increasing both crop productivity and monsoon aquifer recharge rates in the region. On the basis of a data-driven integrated modelling system, we provide numerical evidence that the impacts of unsustainable groundwater-fed irrigation on surface freshwater availability go beyond what was previously understood. Our results confirm findings from previous studies showing increased groundwater recharge rates during wet seasons over 2002–2021, but these rates are insufficient for aquifers to recover, gradually depleting groundwater across the Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna delta. The main findings are that this increased recharge causes a drop in surface runoff and baseflow generation during the monsoons, resulting in lower flood risk (a beneficial outcome), but also less surface freshwater available for farming, which may trigger additional groundwater demand. The drop in coastal flood risk induced by inland groundwater-fed irrigation exceeds the increase caused by sea level rise by about five- to tenfold. Reduced runoff may also increase seawater intrusion, driven by less freshwater to push ocean water away, further increasing freshwater scarcity. This is particularly concerning, since the region has been under rising sea levels and sinking lands. Our findings over this delta have global implications, as humans and climate are increasingly pressuring coastal and deltaic ecosystems worldwide. Dry-season groundwater irrigation in southern Asia increases annual agricultural productivity while monsoon rains recharge aquifers. However, groundwater irrigation rates in the Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna delta exceed monsoonal recharge rates, reduce available surface freshwater and increase the risk of saltwater intrusion."

 Semi-/intermediate volatile organic compounds (S/IVOCs) are important precursors for secondary organic aerosols (SOA) and ozone formation. Vehicle emissions from real-world vehicle fleets are significant anthropogenic source, but their emission profiles and chemical fingerprints remain inadequately characterized. Here, we combined tunnel observation with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry to investigate vehicular S/IVOCs emissions. We identified 256 vehicle-related compounds with fleet-average emission factors (EFs) of 16.4 ± 12.1 mg·km−1·veh−1, comprising 67.2% VOCs, 24.3% IVOCs, and 8.5% SVOCs. VOCs accounted for the majority of ozone formation potential (OFP, 84.8%), whereas VOCs, IVOCs, and SVOCs contributed to SOA formation potential at different times. Importantly, our speciated-based SOA estimation enhanced SOA production estimates by 44.1–76.9% compared to traditional approach.

 Oceanic submesoscale processes are believed to play a pivotal role in influencing phytoplankton growth and distribution, essentially influencing oceanic primary productivity and carbon cycling. However, our understanding of how phytoplankton respond to these dynamics remains fragmentary. Here, by combining surface drifter data and satellite observations, we show a rich geographic variability in the response of phytoplankton to submesoscale ageostrophic events over the global ocean. Substantial phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll enrichments are observed during submesoscale processes in mid-high latitude regions and coastal upwelling systems. However, negligible phytoplankton biomass increases with notable chlorophyll increases are observed in the tropical ocean and subtropical gyres, suggesting that phytoplankton are likely undergoing physiological adjustments. Globally, about half of the chlorophyll growth driven by strong submesoscale ageostrophic events is due to physiological adjustments rather than biomass enrichment, calling for a reevaluation of the effects of submesoscale processes on oceanic productivity and carbon cycling.

 The weathering and erosion of emerged land profoundly influences the Earth system, including the composition of the atmosphere and the type of nutrients delivered to the oceans. The emergence of land allowed for the formation of lakes and continental shelves, important habitats for the origin and evolution of life. Recent studies indicate a difference in silicon isotopes between Archean granitoids and their modern counterparts, which is explained by the incorporation of seawater-derived silica in the melting sources of the former. We show that this signature changed rapidly around 3.6 billion years ago, and that this shift is likely linked to an increase in the dissolved silicon flux from terrestrial weathering. Modeling suggests that the amount of oceanic silicon derived from terrigenous sources increased from near zero to around 32 ± 15% between 3.8 and 3.6 billion years ago. This indicates that, from this point onward, continental weathering feedbacks were established, and mass flux from land became an important source in the chemical budget of seawater, changes that likely exerted positive effects on the evolution of life.

 Drought prediction is vital for sustaining water security in regions highly exposed to climate change.

This index integrates temperature and vegetation signals while accounting for variations across space and time. It substantially improves prediction accuracy compared to previous methods. We used recent climate projections under three socioeconomic scenarios to estimate future drought patterns. Results show spatial shifts and intensification of drought conditions in parts of the region by the end of the century under high-emission conditions. Our method also detects localized drought hotspots that broader indices may miss, offering valuable insights for targeted and adaptive water resource planning. Drought conditions could intensify by 25–35% in the future in the Middle East under a high-emissions scenario, with the most affected regions concentrated in central and southern areas, according to a drought index based on ensemble machine learning methods and climate model simulations."

 The Campi Flegrei caldera has been experiencing volcanic unrest since 2005, rising concern in the population and in local and national authorities. On May 20, 2024, the largest local earthquake ever instrumentally recorded up to that time produced substantial damage, forcing the evacuation of tens of buildings west of the epicenter. At Campi Flegrei, M > 4 earthquakes are rare and their analysis is crucial to understand the unrest dynamics and the relation between rupture and ground shaking pattern, which is essential to mitigate the damage of future earthquakes. We analyse seismic waveforms at local to regional distances to reconstruct the source geometry and kinematics. We estimate millimetric to submillimetric coseismic surface subsidence – below the sensitivity of any standard geodetic technique – which, compared to the general uplift, highlights the crucial role of deep pressurized fluids in earthquakes’ generation. Our results also indicate that rupture directivity and local amplification determined the damage distribution.

 The Light Use Efficiency (LUE) model, epitomized by the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model, is extensively applied in the quantitative estimation and analysis of vegetation Net Primary Productivity (NPP). However, the classic CASA model is marked by significant complexity: the estimation of environmental stress, in particular, necessitates multi-source observation data and model parameters, adding to the complexity and uncertainty of the model’s operation. Additionally, the saturation effect of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a key variable in the CASA model, weakens the accuracy of CASA’s NPP predictions in densely vegetated areas. To address these limitations, this study introduces the Exponential-CASA (EXP-CASA) model. The EXP-CASA model effectively improves the CASA model with RMSE decreasing by 37.5% by using novel functions for estimating the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) and environmental stress, utilizing long-term observational data from FLUXNET and MODIS surface reflectance data. In a comparative analysis of NPP estimation accuracy, EXP-CASA (R2=0.68, RMSE=1.1gC⋅m−2⋅d−1) performs better than the NPP product from GLASS (R2=0.61, RMSE=1.2gC⋅m−2⋅d−1). Additionally, this research assesses the EXP-CASA model’s adaptability to various vegetation indices, evaluates the sensitivity and stability of its parameters over time, and compares its accuracy against other leading NPP estimation products across different seasons, latitudinal zones, ecological types, and temporal sequences. The findings reveal that the EXP-CASA model exhibits strong adaptability to diverse vegetation indices and stability of model parameters over time series. Importantly, EXP-CASA displays superior sensitivity to NPP anomalies at flux sites and more accurately simulates short-term NPP fluctuations than GLASS-NPP and captures periodic trends. By introducing a novel estimation approach that optimizes model construction, the EXP-CASA model remarkably improves the accuracy of NPP estimations, paving the way for global-scale, consistent, and continuous assessment of vegetation NPP. It presents an effective approach for evaluating the saturation effect of vegetation indices and the influence of category independence on NPP estimation."

 Invasions by Spartina species have posed serious threats to coastal ecosystems worldwide. Since the introduction of Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) in China in 1979, it has expanded across 68,000 ha of coastal wetlands by 2020. In 2022, the Chinese government issued the “Special Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Spartina alterniflora (2022–2025)”, aiming for nationwide eradication by 2025. As local and provincial removal efforts progress, timely information on removal status and timing is crucial for tracking the project's progress, assessing the effectiveness of control measures, and facilitating in-depth research on S. alterniflora re-establishment mechanism. Frequent cloud cover hinders the application of optical satellite imagery in timely monitoring of S. alterniflora removal in coastal areas. The all-weather Sentinel-1 SAR sensor overcomes this limitation, offering frequent acquisitions suitable for accurate mapping of S. alterniflora removal. In this study, we present the SAR Time Series Change and change Time Detection (STS-CTD) model, a deep learning framework designed to detect S. alterniflora removal events using Sentinel-1 time series imagery, providing information on where and when S. alterniflora was removed. The model integrates Transformer encoder, multi-kernel Conv1D decoder, and Band Dropout training strategy to learn the abrupt changes in time series backscatters and radar indices caused by plant removal. We applied the model within the boundaries of national-scale S. alterniflora map and generated the first S. alterniflora removal maps across China's coastline during 2021 to 2023. Our key findings include: (1) The resultant S. alterniflora removal map achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 97.95 % and an F1-score of 98.39 % for removal identification, and the removal timing estimation exhibited a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 6.77 days and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 14.68 days; (2) the multi-kernel Conv1D and Band Dropout strategy considerably improved the model performance compared to models using only Transformer encoder and conventional Dropout; (3) the STS-CTD model outperformed state-of-the-art time series analysis models, including Bi-LSTM, Bi-GRU, TCN, and InceptionTime; (4) the model demonstrated strong temporal transferability, showing promise for application in future years; (5) it effectively mitigated noise from SAR imaging and tidal inundation, though continuous inundation and incomplete removal reduced accuracy in certain areas.

 Landslide susceptibility assessment (LSA) plays a vital role in disaster prevention and mitigation. Recently, numerous data-driven LSA approaches have emerged. Nonetheless, most of them neglected the rapid oscillations within the landslide-prone environment, primarily due to significant changes in external triggers such as rainfall, which would render landslides susceptible to varying causations over time. Thus, conducting dynamic landslide susceptibility mapping (D-LSM) and revealing the underlying trends in landslide causes, become increasingly important for effective landslide hazard assessment. This study decomposed the entire D-LSM task into yearly LSA subtasks, and innovatively meta-learned intermediate representations that can be well-generalized and fine-tuned in a fast-adaptation manner. Then, to interpret the model predictions and characterize the variations in landslide causation, Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was utilized for feature permutation year by year. In addition, MT-InSAR techniques were applied to enhance and validate the D-LSM results. The study area was Lantau Island, Hong Kong, where the yearly LSA was executed from 1992 to 2019. The performance comparison results show that the proposed method outperformed the other approaches with regard to accuracy (3 %–7 %), precision (2 %–9 %), recall (3 %–5 %), and F1-score (2 %–7 %), even when adopting a fast adaptation strategy using only 5 samples and 5 gradient descent updates. This validates the applicability of meta-learning for identifying commonalities across multi-temporal LSA tasks. The overall model interpretation results indicate that slope and extreme rainfall were the primary contributors to landslide occurrences in Hong Kong. The feature permutation results over the 30 years reveal a variation in landslide causation, particularly a dramatic shift in the ranking of some contributing factors under extreme weather conditions. Remarkably, the importance of AERD (Annual Extreme Rainfall Days), a factor indicating extreme rainfall intensity, was deeply affected by global climate change and the government's Landslide Prevention and Mitigation Programme (LPMitP)."

 Identifying where maritime activities take place, and quantifying their potential impact on marine biodiversity, is important for the sustainable management of marine areas, spatial planning and marine conservation. Detection and monitoring of small vessels, such as pleasure crafts, has been challenging due to limited data availability with adequate temporal and spatial resolution. Here, we develop an analysis framework to detect and quantify small vessels, using openly available Sentinel-2 optical imagery, and the YOLO-family object detection models. We also show how existing spatial datasets can be used to improve the quality of the model output.We chose five distinct marine areas along the Finnish coast in the northern Baltic Sea and manually annotated 8,768 vessels for training and validating object detection models. The top-performing model, based on F1-score, achieved a test set F1-score of 0.863 and an mAP50 of 0.888. This model was then used to quantify pleasure crafts in the southern part of Finland from May to September 2022, using all available Sentinel-2 images with sufficient image quality. Detected recreational traffic was primarily concentrated on boating lanes and close to marinas, with weekend traffic averaging approximately twice the volume of weekday traffic.The developed approach can be used to identify areas with high boat traffic, thus supporting sustainable spatial planning, ecological impact avoidance, and serving as an indicator of recreational popularity of marine areas. Additionally, it provides a basis for assessing the potential impacts of pleasure crafts on marine biodiversity. By leveraging openly available satellite images with frequent revisits, the approach offers broad geographical coverage and high spatial accuracy, making it scalable for estimating boat traffic across large areas, even globally."

 With regard to climate change and population growth, irrigated croplands need to be accurately delineated for sustainable water resource management. Owing to the lack of extensive training samples and the limitations of coarse spatiotemporal resolution data in complex agricultural regions, China’s irrigated croplands are difficult to map with a unified spatiotemporal framework. This study presents an innovative method for mapping irrigated and rainfed croplands in mainland China with a local adaptive random forest classifier on the Google Earth Engine platform. Based on the dynamic threshold extraction of multiple peak vegetation index values and a rigorous multi-dataset integration strategy, the annual sample sets of irrigated and rainfed croplands are generated automatically. After constructing 147 multi-feature variables sensitive to irrigation activities, China’s annual irrigated croplands dataset (CAICD) is developed, with 30-m spatial resolution for the 1990–2022 period. The results show the following:(1) CAICD has higher accuracy and a more realistic spatial distribution of irrigated croplands compared with existing datasets, with an average overall accuracy of 0.80. (2) The most sensitive classification features for irrigation signals are spectral indices and original bands, with regional differences influenced by climate characteristics (precipitation and evapotranspiration) and terrain features. (3) Over the past three decades, China’s irrigated croplands have expanded overall and Xinjiang has exhibited the most significant increase and the highest growth rate of irrigated area in mainland China, with an annual expansion of 103 thousand hectares.

 The aboveground dry biomass (AGDB), leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll density (CHD), and plant water content (PWC) are important growth physiological parameters that can reflect the growth status of winter wheat. Monitoring the growth physiological parameters of winter wheat by constructing vegetation index is a common method that can quickly obtain the growth physiological parameters of winter wheat. In order to further improve the accuracy of using vegetation index method to monitor the growth physiological parameters of winter wheat, this study proposed a new method based on the genetic algorithm that can quickly construct multi-band vegetation index. The main results were as follows: Compared with the traditional random bands combination to construct the vegetation index, the results of using the rapid method proposed in this study to construct the vegetation index were reliable, and can greatly reduce the time required to construct the vegetation index, which only took about 17.7044 s on average. In the four arithmetic operations used, the priority should be given to Subtraction(Sub.) and Division(Div.), combined with Addition(Add.) and Multiplication(Mul.) operations to construct multi-band vegetation index can achieve good monitoring results. In this study, AGDB, LAI, CHD, and PWC reached the highest accuracy when using ’Sub.-Add.-Sub.-Sub., ’Div.-Div.-Mul.-Mul.’, ’Sub.-Add.-Sub.-Add.’, and ’Div.-Sub.-Div.-Add.’ to construct the five-band vegetation index, respectively, with validation R2 (R2v) of 0.6104, 0.6849, 0.7019, and 0.8960, and validation RMSE (RMSEv) of 0.4508, 2.1025, 1.1473, and 3.4683.

 Mercury (Hg) is a pollutant that adversely affects all regions worldwide. This study investigates how Gaseous Elemental Mercury (GEM), the predominant form of Hg, has changed over the Southern African Highveld Priority Area (SAHPA) since 2009. The SAHPA is one of the regions of interest regarding South African air quality, given its frequent and recurrent occurrence of pollutant concentrations exceeding the country's prescribed thresholds. The present study measured GEM concentrations and other South African criteria pollutants and meteorological parameters between 2016 and 2023 at Elandsfontein, an industrially/anthropogenically influenced monitoring site on the SAHPA. Following quality control procedures, major jumps and shifts were noticed in some of the data for 2016 and 2019, as well as all of the 2017 and 2018 data, these data were excluded from the analysis. The mean hourly GEM concentrations during the monitoring period at Elandsfontein ranged from 0.10 to 71.22 ng/m3 with a mean concentration of 1.74 ± 1.62 ng/m3. The observed mean GEM concentrations exhibit characteristic seasonal patterns, with the highest levels in winter (1.94 ± 2.00 ng/m3), spring (1.83 ± 1.85 ng/m3), autumn (1.79 ± 1.1.55 ng/m3), and summer (1.48 ± 1.08 ng/m3). The diurnal variation of GEM at Elandsfontein shows a distinct pattern, with concentrations peaking before sunrise and dipping in the late afternoon. High GEM concentrations (>6 ng/m3) are linked to air masses from the western interior, indicating significant local emissions. Pollution events peak between July and October 2016–2023, likely due to increased domestic fuel combustion and biomass burning during the dry season, contributing to elevated atmospheric pollutant levels. An Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) analysis showed that eastern air masses were predominantly ‘clean’ and ocean-derived, emphasising the significant influence of local and regional emissions of GEM surrounding the site. These findings highlight the complex interaction of meteorology and pollutant emissions in shaping GEM levels. Further research is needed to understand better how GEM variations are influenced by interactions with other pollutants, meteorology, halogens, and ozone, particularly in the southern hemisphere."

Half of the operons inEscherichia colihave been reported to also contain internal promoters. We studied their role during genome-wide stresses targeting key transcription regulators, RNA polymerase (RNAP) and gyrase. Our results suggest that operons’ responses are influenced by stress-related changes in premature elongation terminations and internal promoters’ activity. Globally, this causes the responses of genes in the same operon to differ with the distance between them in a wave-like pattern. Meanwhile, premature terminations are affected by positive supercoiling buildup, collisions between elongating and promoter-bound RNAPs, and local regulatory elements. We report similar findings inE. coliunder other stresses and in evolutionarily distant bacteriaBacillus subtilis,Corynebacterium glutamicum, andHelicobacter pylori. Our results suggest that the strength, number, and positioning of operons’ internal promoters might have evolved to compensate for premature terminations, providing distal genes similar response strengths."

Genetic variants affectingPPP1R3Bexpression are associated with several metabolic traits and liver disease, but the precise mechanisms are not fully understood. We studied the effects of bothPpp1r3boverexpression and deletion in mice and cell models and found that both changes inPpp1r3bexpression result in dysregulated metabolism and liver damage, with overexpression increasing liver glycogen stores, while deletion resulted in higher liver lipid accumulation. These patterns were confirmed in humans where variants increasingPPP1R3Bexpression had lower liver fat and decreased plasma lipids, whereas putative loss-of-function variants were associated with increased liver fat and elevated plasma lipids. These findings support that PPP1R3B is a crucial regulator of hepatic metabolism beyond glycogen synthesis and that genetic variants affectingPPP1R3Bexpression levels influence if hepatic energy is stored as glycogen or triglycerides."

However, detailed mechanistic information regarding rhenium redox transitions in anoxic systems is scarce. Here, we performed a comprehensive laboratory study of rhenium redox transitions on variably oxidized magnetite nanoparticle surfaces. Through high-end spectroscopic and microscopic tools, we propose an abiotic transition pathway in which aqueous iron(II) ions in the presence of pure or preoxidized magnetite serve as an electron source to reduce rhenium(VII) to individual rhenium(IV) atoms or small polynuclear species on nanoparticle surfaces. Notably, iron(II) ions recharged preoxidized magnetite nanoparticles exhibit a maghemite core and a magnetite shell, challenging the traditional core-shell magnetite-maghemite model.

Variations in the location of internal tide dissipation can modify the climatic state of oceanic circulation. Mesoscale eddies and internal tides are two prominent peaks in the ocean energy spectrum, which overlap in spatial scale despite contrasting temporal scales. How eddies affect the dissipation of internal tides remains unclear. Using high-resolution simulations and Argo observations, we show that strong oceanic eddies, such as Agulhas rings, can dissipate internal tides in regions where they intersect, making these eddies hotspots for internal tide dissipation. The Agulhas rings facilitate the transfer of internal tide energy from stable low wave numbers to less stable high wave numbers and subsequently trap these high wave numbers, thereby enhancing their dissipation. Observations from Argo floats reveal elevated dissipation in regions where Agulhas rings and internal tides converge, corroborating the simulations."

Ozone effects dominated changes in ocean circulation during 1950–2000, but not this century, implying that past trends cannot serve as proxies for future changes. Despite substantial future circulation changes induced by climate change, their effect on the CO2sink decreases over the 21st century because of compensating factors.

This multidecadal sea level variability, largely arising from fluctuations in the buoyancy-driven Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), substantially modulates the frequency of flood occurrences along the USNEC and serves as a source of multiyear predictability. Using an initialized dynamical downscaling decadal prediction system with a1/12° ocean resolution, we demonstrate that flood frequency along the USNEC can be predicted on multiyear to decadal timescales. The long-term increasing trend in flood frequency, mainly driven by increasing greenhouse gases and associated radiative forcing changes, can be predicted a decade ahead. Furthermore, detrended flood frequency along the USNEC exhibits prediction skill for up to 3 years, as verified by TG observation. This multiyear prediction skill is achieved using prediction models that are initialized from our best estimate of observed AMOC."

The celluloepidemiology approach was uniquely capable to differentiate health care worker groups with different SARS-CoV-2 exposures from each other.

First-principles calculations reveal that the introduction of Sb not only triggers a topological phase transition but also changes the integral of the Berry curvature at the shifted Fermi level, which leads to the reversal of the anomalous Hall resistance polarity for Sb fractionsx> 0.67. Moreover, it also induces the opposite spin splitting of the valence bands compared to the Sb-free host, and the resulting clockwise/counterclockwise spin chirality gives rise to a tunable unidirectional second-harmonic anomalous Hall response.

We demonstrate that warming projections conditioned on the entire instrumental annual surface temperature record are of sufficiently high quality and should be considered as long-term predictions rather than merely as projections. We support this view by considering the skill of predicted 20- and 50-year lead temperature changes under the Shared Economic Pathway (SSP)1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 emission scenarios in climates of different sensitivities. Using climate model simulations, we show that adjusting raw multimodel projections of future warming with the Kriging for Climate Change (KCC) method eliminates most biases and reduces the uncertainty of warming projections irrespective of the sensitivity of the climate being considered. Simpler methods, or using only the more recent part of the temperature record, provide less effective constraints.

Transient photoreduction of the cryptochrome flavin chromophore initiated signaling via a poorly understood mechanism. By serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX), we show that the photoreduction mechanism ofChlamydomonas reinhardtiicryptochrome involves three loci [carboxyl-terminal region, a transient protonation pathway, and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)–binding site] acting in unison to accomplish three effects: radical pair stabilization, protonation of FAD radical, and formation of the signaling state. Using 19 time-resolved SFX snapshots between 10 nanoseconds and 233 milliseconds, we found that light-driven FAD•–/tyrosyl-373 radical pair (RP) formation primes α22 unfolding. Electron transfer–dependent protonation of aspartate-321 by tyrosine-373 is the epicenter of unfolding by disrupting salt bridges between α22 and the photolyase homology region. Before helix unfolding, another pathway opens transiently for FAD•–protonation and RP stabilization.

This systemic mechanism relies on the recognition, transport, and internalization of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Our aim was to identify cell surface proteins that bind extracellular dsRNA and mediate its internalization inDrosophilacells. We used coimmunoprecipitation coupled with proteomics analysis and found that silencing heat shock cognate protein 70-4 (Hsc70-4), a constitutively expressed heat shock protein, impairs dsRNA internalization. Unexpectedly, despite lacking a predicted transmembrane domain, Hsc70-4 localizes to the cell membrane via lipid interactions. Antibody blocking experiments revealed an extracellular domain on Hsc70-4 that is essential for dsRNA internalization. Intriguingly, this dsRNA-specific binding capacity of Hsc70-4 functions independently of its chaperone activity. These findings not only highlight Hsc70-4 as a previously uncharacterized and essential component in the dsRNA internalization process but also offer promising insights for advancing RNA interference–based technologies to combat pests and vector-borne diseases."

Gene-encoded circular single-stranded DNA (Css DNA) has been developed as a switchable vector to enrich regulatory components beyond protein/RNA-based systems in mammalian cells. However, the previous Css DNA regulator suffered from constrained regulatory sequence flexibility, disability of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) signals, and lack of endogenous orthogonal regulation. Here, we address these challenges by engineering a “bridge” design into the Css DNA regulator. These bridges function as sequence-programmable switches to control gene expression, responding to endogenous molecular signals (such as ATP, APE1, and RNase H) and enabling trans-regulation within or between Css DNAs. We exploit the orthogonality of Css DNA regulator to construct the three-input three-output genetic circuits.

We used satellite altimetry to estimate river discharge for over 8700 stations worldwide, filling gaps in existing records. Our data set, SAEM, supports a better understanding of water systems, helping to manage water resources more effectively, especially in regions with limited monitoring infrastructure. 
 River discharge is a crucial measurement, indicating the volume of water flowing through a river cross-section at any given time. However, the existing network of river discharge gauges faces significant issues, largely due to the declining number of active gauges and temporal gaps. Remote sensing, especially radar-based techniques, offers an effective means to this issue. This study introduces the Satellite Altimetry-based Extension of the global-scale in situ river discharge Measurements (SAEM) data set, which utilizes multiple satellite altimetry missions and estimates discharge using the existing worldwide networks of national and international gauges. In SAEM, we have explored 47 000 gauges and estimated height-based discharge for 8730 of them, which is approximately 3 times the number of gauges of the largest existing remote-sensing-based data set. These gauges cover approximately 88 % of the total gauged discharge volume. The height-based discharge estimates in SAEM demonstrate a median Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) of 0.48, outperforming current global data sets. In addition to the river discharge time series, the SAEM data set comprises three more products, each contributing a unique facet to better usage of our data.

In addition to each station's coordinates, this catalog provides information on satellite altimetry missions, distance to the discharge gauge, and relevant quality flags.

These water level time series are sourced from both existing Level-3 water level time series and newly generated ones within this study.

 This study presents a comprehensive approach for reconstructing a high-quality, continuous monthly sea level time series at the Ieodo Ocean Research Station (IORS) from 1993 to 2023 using advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models. After applying quality control to the in-situ KIOST data, including inverse barometric effect correction, 3σ filtering, and a 75 % data coverage threshold, we validated trends using nearby PSMSL tide gauges and four ocean reanalysis datasets (CMEMS, GLORYS, ORAS5, HYCOM). The trend analysis showed a higher rate of sea level rise from in-situ data (4.94 mm/yr, Oct 2003–Dec 2023) compared to satellite and model-based estimates (e.g., CMEMS: 3.53 mm/yr, Jan 1993–Dec 2023), suggesting localized sea level rise in the East China Sea. Initial gap-filling used statistical models such as harmonic regression and regression-based climatology. A blended approach combining climatology and trend components achieved the best accuracy (RMSE ~0.056 m, R2 = 0.688). We then implemented various AI/ML models through an Iterative Imputer framework. Ensemble models (e.g., XGBoost) performed perfectly after 2003 but did not generalize well before 2004. Deep learning models like LSTM and GRU effectively captured seasonal and nonlinear patterns post-2003, with LSTM achieving RMSE = 0.023 m and R2 = 0.95. Time series models Prophet and SARIMA-SIN successfully reconstructed the full time series, with SARIMA-SIN estimating the highest trend (5.61 mm/yr). Multiple linear regression using reanalysis data served as a baseline, but AI/ML models outperformed it in both accuracy and generalization.

We combined long-term tide gauge records and satellite data to create a new global sea level record from 1950 to 2022. Our results reveal how natural climate patterns, including El Niño, La Niña, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, influence rapid present-day sea level change. The data product enhances understanding of climate–sea level interactions. 
 Rapidly rising sea level is one of the major adverse consequences of anthropogenic climate change. Sea level rise poses an existential threat to coastal populations, particularly for urban settlements with accelerating growth rates. Contemporary empirical sea level reconstructions have been used to conflate short-term (~3 decades) satellite altimetry geocentric sea level data and long-term (50 years or longer) tide gauge records to better estimate reliable sea level rise towards multi-decadal to centennial time scales. However, adequate separations and quantifications of low-frequency climate patterns and sea level trends globally at regional scales remain elusive. Here, we propose a new sea level reconstruction framework that incorporates Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) into the contemporary Cyclostationary EOF with Reduced Space Optimal Interpolation (CSEOF-OI) algorithm to better reconstruct sea level fields. Using 225 selected long-term gap-filled tide gauge records with vertical land motion adjusted and satellite altimetry, our global reconstructed monthly sea level time series, January 1950– January 2022, exhibit distinct delineations between modeled climate patterns and sea level trends at regional scales. The separated sea level patterns include trends, modulated annual cycles, the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The third principal component of the reconstructed sea level exhibits a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.87 with the Niño 3.4 ENSO index, and the fourth principal component correlates at 0.75 with the PDO index, indicating excellent agreement. The global mean sea level trend, accounting for the predominant climate periodicities, is 1.9 ± 0.2 mm yr⁻¹ (95 % confidence), and the estimate during the satellite altimetry era (January 1993–December 2021) is 3.2 ± 0.3 mm yr⁻¹ (95 % confidence). Compared with previous studies, we conclude that our 72-year sea-level reconstruction allows us to better separate the ENSO and PDO climate patterns, as well as the sea level they induced. Finally, we show that the short-term (5-year) rates of ENSO and PDO patterns significantly affect sea level both on a global and regional scale, altering global mean sea level trends by up to 1.1 ± 0.5 mm yr¹ (January 2011–January 2016). Over the past seven decades, the climate pattens exerted a minor impact on sea level trends, but substantially modulated apparent regional sea level accelerations, particularly in the western Pacific (e.g., 0.09 ± 0.05 mm yr⁻² at the Kuroshio Current), and in the east and central equatorial Pacific Ocean (e.g., −0.04 ± 0.03 mm yr⁻² near Costa Rica).

These compounds were analyzed using nontargeted methods, and their chemical formulas and structures were determined through tandem mass spectrometry combined with a novel fragmental chain characterization (FCC) algorithm. This FCC algorithm significantly improved annotation rates, achieving a four-fold increase compared to traditional mass spectral matching strategies. Transformation linkages were identified between precursor compounds and DBPs, based on their shared fragmental chains. Using this advanced nontargeted analysis approach, we identified organofluorine precursors as key contributors to the formation of toxic DBPs in chlorinated water. These findings were validated using chemical standards, including fluoroquinolone antibiotics (e.g., enrofloxacin and difloxacin) and fluorosteroids (e.g., fluocinolone acetonide and triamcinolone). Fluoroquinolone-derived DBPs were found to be 2.5 times more toxic after chlorination, exceeding the 1.5 times overall toxicity increase observed in actual water samples. Fluorosteroids showed smaller toxicity increases (1.3–1.5 times), but their conversion rates in real water were 1.7–2.3 times higher than in laboratory conditions.

Previous studies have demonstrated that a few milligrams per liter of powdered activated carbon (PAC) can dramatically accelerate this process, but catalytic efficiency varies widely across different PAC types. In this study, various chemical and physical modifications were applied to coal- and straw-based PAC to enhance their catalytic efficiency and identify the key characteristics decisively influencing catalysis. The results showed that chemical treatments with HNO3 or NaOH had no notable impact on the PAC-catalyzed Mn(II) oxidation. In contrast, physical modifications, steam-reactivation, and ultrasonication substantially enhanced PAC’s catalytic performance, increasing Mn(II) oxidation rates by 50–300%. Characterization revealed that alterations in surface functional groups, induced by chemical treatments, had no noticeable impact on the Mn(II) oxidation. Instead, enhancements in pore structure achieved through physical modifications remarkably accelerated the Mn(II) oxidation process. The specific surface area of PAC exhibited a strong positive correlation with both the Mn(II) oxidation and chlorine decay rates. Mn(II) oxidation by chlorine retained by PAC (not chlorine in water) demonstrated the occurrence of Mn(II) and chlorine reactions in PAC pores.

Nevertheless, their water permeance is constrained by the substrate-induced funnel effect. For years, researchers have been investigating how substrates impact membrane water permeance. However, these studies generally rely on a trial-and-error approach to find the optimal substrate porosity, which is often time-consuming and offers limited insights. To establish a more intuitive framework for membrane design, we introduced a novel zone-of-influence (ZOI)-based approach for the first time. We first analyze the distinctively different funnel behaviors for thin and thick films through numerical simulations. Thin films, characterized by small ratios of film thickness over substrate pore size (i.e., aspect ratio θ ≤ 0.5), show a highly localized influence of substrate pores and present a more severe funnel effect than thick films with θ ≫ 1. This analysis leads to the concept of ZOI–a region of polyamide over a single substrate pore with water permeation efficiency exceeding a predefined threshold value. A linear relationship between ZOI and θ was observed, which enables an intuitive design to achieve a target water permeance by simply overlapping ZOIs of multiple pores, making it far more efficient than the traditional trial-and-error approach. We further developed an analytical model based on the superposition principle to unravel the fundamental structure-performance relationship between water permeation efficiency, aspect ratio and substrate porosity. This study provides convenient design tools for optimizing ultrathin membrane structure, offering critical guidance and deep insights for the advancement of high-performance membranes."

While plant uptake mechanisms for QACs remain poorly characterized, this study identifies organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) as a potential mediator of QAC absorption in Arabidopsis. Root uptake experiments demonstrated reduced QAC accumulation under treatments with metabolic and OCT inhibitors. Transcriptional upregulation of AtOCT1 in QAC-exposed wild-type plants, along with functional validation through yeast heterologous expression systems, implicated this transporter in cationic pollutant absorption. Comparative analysis revealed 12%–42% lower root QAC concentrations in AtOCT1 mutants compared to wild-type plants, while overexpression lines exhibited 9.4%–43% increases in accumulation alongside enhanced sensitivity. Molecular docking simulations demonstrated stronger binding affinities between AtOCT1 and QACs compared to its native substrate L-carnitine, with microscale thermophoresis confirming direct interactions. Quantitative structure–activity relationship analysis identified electronic energy, molecular weight, and polarizability as critical determinants of AtOCT1-mediated transport efficiency. These findings establish the biological and structural role of AtOCT1 in cationic pollutant uptake, advancing mechanistic understanding of transporter-mediated plant accumulation of ionizable organic pollutants."

Here, we first analyzed the constituents of e-cigarette liquid (e-liquid) and e-liquid vaping-produced aerosols (e-aerosols) by gas chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC/Q-TOF MS) and inductively coupled plasma-MS (ICP-MS), and our result indicated that the components of e-aerosols differed from those of e-liquid. However, there is insufficient evidence on the toxicity of e-aerosols; therefore, an animal study was conducted accordingly. Mice were exposed to e-aerosols for 30, 60, or 90 days within a whole-body exposure chamber equipped with an air quality monitor. Compared with the control, weakened lung function and fiber deposition in murine lungs were observed following e-cigarette exposure. Microcomputed tomography (Micro-CT) images suggested fibrosis-like lesions in the lungs. Mechanistically, the expression of the core circadian rhythm gene, per1, was significantly inhibited by e-aerosols, which is negatively correlated with interleukin-6 (IL6) expression and resulted in continuous IL6+ macrophage infiltration in the lungs during both daytime and night. Eventually, the knockout of il6 expression could completely resist e-aerosol-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice.

We theoretically compared two failure criteria, Mohr‐Coulomb (MC) and Modified Cam‐Clay criteria (MCC), to assess fault rupture during CO2 storage. Both criteria characterize fault behavior in a specific stress regime but differ in reducing the complexity of fault rupture to a few key mechanisms. Using a coupled hydromechanical model, we demonstrate that the choice of a failure criterion and the physics of fault weakening associated with these criteria strongly condition fault response to a given fluid injection. MC mainly relates rupture to friction, while MCC relates rupture to fault poro‐plasticity. Our findings highlight that the selection of a failure criterion, being inherently subjective, can significantly alter the predicted fault behavior during CO2 storage, thereby impacting the reliability of geomechanical risk assessments."

Nearly 78.0% of ARs are associated with strong or super EECs, indicating that stronger ARs may lead to more explosive development of EECs. The composite analyses of ARs suggest that the AR is typically located in southwest of the cyclone center, in front of the cold front, with mean value of AR top pressure of approximately 693.51 hPa.

Initial conditions for the simulations are based on a case study from high‐altitude aircraft observations of a narrow layer of abundant small ice crystals just after a homogeneous freezing ice nucleation event. Analysis of high‐resolution radiosonde observations shows that the TTL is a region where strong wind shear (often 10–20×10−3 $20\times 1{0}^{-3}$ s−1 ${\mathrm{s}}^{-1}$) prevails. We find that the strong TTL wind shear alters the structure of TTL cirrus, accelerates the reduction in ice concentration, and shortens the cloud lifetimes. The typically thin laminar structure of the clouds indicated by lidar observations is likely a direct result of the strong wind shear in the TTL. Gravity‐wave temperature fluctuations further accelerate the reduction in ice concentration as the clouds evolve. The simulations show that TTL cirrus lifetimes decrease with decreasing initial ice concentration, decreasing initial supersaturation and increasing turbulent diffusivity. Based on simulations with observed TTL wind shear, wave properties, and initial cloud properties, we show that TTL cirrus lifetimes are typically less than 1 day. Clouds produced by heterogeneous nucleation, with lower initial ice concentration and supersaturation, will have even shorter lifetimes. Persistence of TTL cirrus for multiple days would require sustained upward vertical wind with an amplitude of at least ≃ $\simeq $0.2 cm s−1 ${\mathrm{s}}^{-1}$."

As climate warming and sea ice decline continue, understanding how Arctic ARs evolve is essential. While studies suggest an increase in Arctic ARs and storms, a comprehensive understanding of their changing behavior, seasonal patterns, and sea ice impacts remains incomplete. This study investigates the changing dynamics of Arctic ARs in response to a warming climate, examining the drivers of these changes and their impact on sea ice. Using the Community Earth System Model, Version 2 (CESM2), we find CESM2 effectively simulates Arctic ARs compared to ERA5. To analyze ARs under different climate conditions, we apply three detection methods: using present climate thresholds, scaling thresholds with projected future moisture changes, and calculating unique thresholds for each decade. Our results show increased AR frequency and intensity in the future, with changes strongly influenced by the chosen AR definition. Depending on the method, we find that AR frequency increases range from 30%–50% up to 400%, or even show decreases in some regions. During fall and winter, the North Atlantic experiences increased AR frequency, while more intense ARs occur in the North Pacific during summer. We also explore the effects of future ARs on sea ice, finding a net increase in sea ice loss, particularly in winter and spring.

Modeling studies investigating the effects of INPs and/or CCN on deep convection typically retain a volume‐dependent raindrop freezing relation. The resulting neglect of aerosol accumulation in raindrops via drop collisions has likely produced unrealistic storm responses to INPs in past studies. To address this deficiency, a new immersion freezing algorithm was developed and embedded in a bulk microphysics scheme that freezes both cloud drops and raindrops using the same immersion freezing INP (IF‐INP) activity spectrum based on measurements. Multiple idealized simulations of a single case of deep convection observed during the Clouds, Aerosols, and Complex Terrain Interactions (CACTI) field campaign were conducted, with microphysical differences produced by independently altering IF‐INP temperature dependencies and CCN number concentrations from their observed values. Surface precipitation in all simulations resulted almost exclusively from riming graupel that melted upon descending to the surface. Rainfall and cold pools were substantially and systematically weakened with increased CCN due to decreased graupel riming rates but were relatively insensitive to variations in the magnitude and slope of IF‐INP spectra due to compensating depletion of supercooled liquid water. These compensating processes were a consequence of the accumulation of IF‐INPs in raindrops, encouraging caution in studying IF‐INP effects upon thunderstorms using traditional volume‐dependent drop freezing relationships."

Achieving this goal presents a challenge, especially given (a) adjustment costs, which penalize a swift transition away from fossil fuels owing to, for example, skilled labor scarcity, and (b) climate uncertainty that complicates the link between emissions reductions and global warming. This paper presents a modeling framework that explores optimal decarbonization investment strategies with adjustment costs and climate uncertainty. The findings show that climate uncertainty impacts investment in three ways: (a) the cost of policy increases, especially when adjustment costs are present; (b) abatement investment is front‐loaded relative to a scenario without uncertainty; and (c) the sectors with the largest changes in investment are those that are “hard‐to‐abate”, such as heavy industry and agriculture, each of which have high investment costs and annual emission rates. The longer learning about climate uncertainty is delayed, the more these impacts are amplified. Each of these effects can be traced back to the carbon price distribution inheriting a “heavy tail” when climate uncertainty is present. The paper highlights how climate uncertainty and adjustment costs combined lead to heightened urgency for near‐term investments in decarbonization."

 Social touch is critical for communication to impart emotions and intentions. However, certain autistic individuals experience aversion to social touch. Here, we used Neuropixels probes to record neural responses to social vs. non-social interactions in somatosensory cortex, tail of striatum, and basolateral amygdala. We find that wild type mice show aversion to repeated presentations of an inanimate object but not of another mouse. Cortical neurons are modulated especially by touch context (social vs. object), while striatal neurons change their preference depending on whether mice could choose or not to interact. In contrast, Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice, a model of autism, find social and non-social interactions equally aversive, especially at close proximity, and their cortical/striatal neurons are less able to discriminate social valence. A linear model shows that the encoding of certain avoidance/aversive behaviors in cortical neuron activity differed between genotypes. Thus, a reduced capacity to represent social stimuli at the circuit level may underlie social avoidance in autism. Some autistic individuals experience aversion to social touch.

 Kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment for end-stage renal disease and is limited by donor organ availability. Normothermic Machine Perfusion (NMP) might facilitate safe transplantation of marginal organs. NKP1 is a single centre, phase 1, 36-patient, three-stage cohort study investigating the safety and feasibility of up to 24 hours of renal NMP prior to transplantation. 30-day graft survival (primary endpoint) was 100%. Secondary objectives were assessment of the effect of NMP on post-transplant clinical outcomes and ischaemia-reperfusion injury, identification of predictive biomarkers, and characterisation of the performance of the preservation system. Clinical outcomes were comparable to a matched control cohort with 12-month estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 46.3 vs 49.5 mL/min/1.73m2 (p = 0.44) despite much longer total preservation times (15.7 vs 8.9 hours controls, p < 0.0001). We saw strong correlations between biomarkers measured ex-situ and post-transplant outcomes, including graft function at one year (correlation between GST-Pi delta and 12-month eGFR, R = 0.54, p = 0.001). Renal NMP is useful for optimising logistics and as an organ assessment technique, and has potential to expand the donor pool. Trial registration number: ISRCTN13292277.

 Due to their importance in monitoring and modelling Earth's climate, the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) designates leaf area index (LAI) and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) as essential climate variables (ECVs). The Simplified Level 2 Biophysical Processor (SL2P) has proven particularly popular for decametric (i.e. 10 m to 100 m) retrieval of these ECVs. Comprehensive validation has shown that due to simplifying assumptions in the underlying radiative transfer models (RTMs), biases persist in SL2P retrievals. To avoid RTM assumptions altogether, an empirical data-driven approach might be considered. Yet, such a strategy has historically been prevented by the limited quantity and quality of available in situ reference measurements, as well as the large number of training samples traditionally required by machine learning regression algorithms. New opportunities are now offered by recently established continental-scale environmental monitoring networks, advances in automated data processing and uncertainty evaluation, and machine learning regression algorithms that require many fewer training samples. The Ground Reference Observations Underlying Novel Decametric Vegetation Data Products from Earth Observation (GROUNDED EO) project was initiated to take advantage of these opportunities. We describe the empirical data-driven LAI and FAPAR retrieval approach adopted within the project, involving i) generation of a database containing over 16,000 fiducial reference measurements covering 81 National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS), and Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) sites between 2013 and 2022, ii) development of an empirical data-driven algorithm for Sentinel-2 LAI and FAPAR retrieval based on Gaussian processes, and iii) evaluation of GROUNDED EO retrievals through intercomparison with the current state-of-the-art in decametric retrieval (i.e. SL2P, and a modified version of SL2P developed by the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing – SL2P-CCRS), as well as validation against unseen fiducial reference measurements. In the majority of cases (and despite not making use of ancillary data such as land cover), the empirical data-driven GROUNDED EO retrievals were subject to reduced bias than those from SL2P and SL2P-CCRS, as well as increased fulfilment of user requirements (i.e. 74% of LAI and 69% of FAPAR retrievals overall). Consequently, the approach has potential to reduce uncertainty in key inputs for climate monitoring and modelling, agricultural and forest management, and biodiversity assessment."

 Land surface temperature (LST) plays an important role in Earth energy balance and water/carbon cycle processes and is recognized as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) and an Essential Agricultural Variable (EAV). LST products that are issued from satellite observations mostly depict landscape-scale temperature due to their generally large footprint. This means that a pixel-based temperature integrates over various components, whereas temperature individual components are better suited for the purpose of evapotranspiration estimation, crop growth assessment, drought monitoring, etc. Thus, disentangling soil and vegetation temperatures is a real matter of concern. Moreover, most satellite-based LSTs are contaminated by directional effects due to the inherent anisotropy properties of most terrestrial targets. The characteristics of directional effects are closely linked to the properties of the target and controlled by the view and solar geometry. A singular angular signature is obtained in the hotspot geometry, i.e., when the sun, the satellite and the target are aligned. The hotspot phenomenon highlights the temperature differences between sunlit and shaded areas. However, due to the lack of adequate multi-angle observations and inaccurate portrayal or neglect of solar influence, the hotspot effect is often overlooked and has become a barrier for better inversion results at satellite scale. Therefore, hotspot effect needs to be better characterized, which here is achieved with a three-component model that distinguishes vegetation, sunlit and shaded soil temperature components and accounts for vegetation structure. Our work combines thermal infrared (TIR) observations from the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) onboard the LEO (Low Earth Orbit) Sentinel-3, and two sensors onboard GEO (geostationary) satellites, i.e. the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) and Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI). Based on inversion with a Bayesian method and prior information associated with component temperature differences as constrained, the findings include: 1) Satellite observations throughout East Asia around noon indicate that for every 10 degrees change in angular distance from the sun, LST will on average vary by 0.6 K; 2) As a better constraint, the hotspot effect can benefit from multi-angle TIR observations to improve the retrieval of LST components, thereby reducing the root mean squared error (RMSE) from approximately 3.5 K, 5.8 K, and 4.1 K to 2.8 K, 3.5 K, and 3.1 K, at DM, EVO and KAL sites, respectively; 3) Based on a dataset simulated with a three-dimensional radiative transfer model, a significant inversion error may result if the hotspot is ignored for an angular distance between the viewing and solar directions that is smaller than 30°. Overall, considering the hotspot effect has the potential to reduce inversion noise and to separate the temperature difference between sunlit and shaded areas in a pixel, paving the way for producing stable temperature component products."

 In spite of the efforts made for canopy water content (CWC) mapping in the community, including vegetation water proxy from microwave-based vegetation optical depth (VOD) as well as optical-based indices, there is still no operational CWC product from optical satellites up to now. To fill this gap, this study proposes a unified algorithm for CWC mapping at both decametric and coarse spatial resolution from several widely used optical satellites. Based on machine learning trained on radiative transfer model simulations, we comprehensively parameterized the distribution of the canopy and vegetation input variables (i.e., leaf traits and soil background) of the PROSAIL model, by relying on the largest open integrated global plant and soil spectral databases. We investigated the impact of diverse band combinations as well as the inclusion of optical indices for CWC estimation using RTMs. The performances of this algorithm were first evaluated at decametric resolution based on ground measurements distributed over five ground campaigns corresponding to diverse climate and biome types. The retrieved CWC from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 exhibits satisfactory performance, with coefficient R of 0.81 and RMSE of 0.046 g/cm2. We then evaluated CWC at 500 m resolution from MODIS by comparing it with Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 aggregated values over a globally distributed selection of LANDVAL sites, representative of the existing biome types combined with a range of precipitation, soil moisture and vegetation density conditions. The MODIS CWC global maps show reasonable seasonal and spatial patterns compared to multi-frequencies microwave-based VOD, and improvements compared to the conventionally and extensively used optical indices such as NDWI. The CWC product developed in this study is expected to provide new insights for global or regional vegetation water variations monitoring from optical satellites, with the strength of high spatial resolution compared to the microwave passive VOD (i.e., 20-500 m vs 22.5 km). These two products could be further combined for more accurate global vegetation water and biomass mapping in the future to improve our understanding of carbon uptake and hydrological applications."

 This study examines the mean annual cycles of monthly cumulated fog-water amounts (CFW) in the central Mediterranean Iberian Peninsula (MIP), highlighting the interplay between meteorological conditions, topography, and geographic location. Seasonal asymmetry in fog-water collection is evident, with summer exhibiting higher fog collection frequency but lower water volumes. In contrast, non-summer seasons feature lower frequency but higher intensity fog events.Tropospheric circulation anomalies at mid- and low-tropospheric levels reveal that fog-water collection is influenced by moisture transport from the Mediterranean, particularly during high fog-collection months. Positive specific humidity anomalies near coastal areas, driven by southeasterly wind anomalies, are crucial for frequent fog formation, while broader, less concentrated anomalies characterize higher-intensity fog events. These findings align with prior research emphasizing the role of cyclonic conditions and maritime moisture advection in enhancing fog-water collection yields.Additionally, seasonal variations in tropospheric circulation anomalies are linked to large-scale teleconnection patterns such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Arctic Oscillation (AO), and Eastern Atlantic-Western Russia (EAWR) patterns. These modulate moisture advection, precipitation anomalies, and low-level winds that drive fog formation and collection. In summer, subtropical high-pressure weakening contributes to increased fog-water cumulates, while winter anomalies highlight the impact of quasi-stationary cyclonic circulations and autumn anomalies, positive NAO/AO phases.These results underscore the climatic importance of fog-water collection for water resource management in drought-prone regions and provide a foundation for future climate monitoring and prediction under anthropogenic radiative forcing. The study's insights have practical implications for enhancing water availability through fog collection in Mediterranean ecosystems."

 Reliable and accurate estimation of large-scale evapotranspiration (ET) is fundamental for research in Earth System Science, however, large-scale ET estimation remains a challenge. Bias correction of the land surface model (LSM) simulated ET is a popular approach for providing large-scale, long-term estimations. Previous correction methods often ignore stochastic errors, making them unsuitable for complex conditions. Therefore, this study evaluated the performance of the Community Land Model 5.0 (CLM 5.0) in simulating ET based on the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) product and in situ observations across mainland China, analyzed the main factors influencing model performance, developed a time-variant bias correction strategy using the random forest (RF) method. Results show that precipitation is crucial in influencing the performance and uncertainty of CLM 5.0 simulations since it determines whether ET is limited by energy or water. The CLM 5.0 performed worse but with lower uncertainty in water-limited regions due to soil water stress, while it performed better but with higher uncertainty in energy-limited regions. Future research should focus on refining the depth limits of dry surface layer (DSL) parameterization to improve model performance in water-limited regions. Furthermore, the CLM 5.0 overestimated ET in the Northern China (NC) region but underestimated ET in the other seven regions. The overestimation is attributed to the model's overestimation of leaf area index and the underestimation of GLEAM data in farmland. After bias correction, the national average correlation coefficients (R) increased by 0.102, root mean square errors (RMSE) decreased by 0.178 mm/d, absolute mean bias (BIAS) values decreased by 0.006 mm/d, Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) values increased by 0.154, and uncertainty coefficients with 95 % confidence level (U95%) decreased by 0.195 mm/d. The performance of bias corrected simulations is significantly improved. The trends of both overestimation and underestimation of ET simulations by CLM 5.0 at a regional scale have also been alleviated. The time-invariant bias correction strategy proposed in this study demonstrates more reliable performance compared to the previous studies that applied monthly scaling factors. This advancement is essential for estimating more reliable large-scale ET under complex conditions."

 Severe thunderstorm gales are the predominant meteorological phenomena associated with convective storms. Accurately estimating the extreme wind speed of thunderstorm gales (ESTG) is crucial for both forecasting services and disaster investigations related to severe convective weather. This paper proposes a method for estimating the ESTG based on dual-polarization weather radar hydrometeors classification products (EESonHC). This method utilizes changes in hydrometeors, combines these changes with the atmospheric vertical momentum equation, and estimates the ESTG by approximating the average vertical acceleration of storm cells. Experimental tests were conducted using cases of thunderstorm gales in both strong and weak wind shear environments, demonstrating that this estimation method achieves an accuracy rate as high as 75 % for extreme thunderstorm gales exceeding 25 m/s, with an average error in estimated wind speed of approximately 0.5 m/s. The primary issues include: 1. When multiple storm cells are in close vicinity, accurately isolating the vertical motion acceleration pairs for each individual cell becomes challenging, thereby complicating wind speed estimation; 2. Overestimating ice-phase hydrometeors in HCL could lead to underestimating wind speed or make it impossible to estimate accurately."

However, the roles of auxin and the immune signaling factor, reactive oxygen species (ROS), in resistance to the brown planthopper (BPH), a notorious rice-specific piercing–sucking insect that causes severe yield losses, remain unclear. We revealed that moderate naphthalene acetic acid treatment activates rice resistance to BPH, BPH infestation induces ROS accumulation, and increase in ROS content promotes BPH resistance. Underlying these phenomena, the auxin receptors OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 positively, whereas the posttranscriptional regulator OsmiR393 negatively, regulate BPH resistance.

 Antibodies targeting the highly conserved prehairpin intermediate (PHI) of class I viral membrane-fusion proteins are generally weakly neutralizing and are not considered viable therapeutic agents. We previously demonstrated that antibodies targeting the gp41 N-heptad repeat (NHR), which is transiently exposed in the HIV-1 PHI, exhibit enhanced broad neutralization in cells expressing the Fc receptor, FcγRI. To enhance neutralization in cells lacking FcγRI, we here develop a bispecific antibody (bsAb) by fusing an NHR-targeting antibody to an antibody against CD4, the HIV-1 receptor on T cells. The bsAb provides a 5000-fold neutralization enhancement and shows unprecedented neutralization breadth compared to existing broadly neutralizing antibodies. Importantly, the bsAb reduces viral load in HIV-1-infected humanized male mice, and viral envelope sequencing under bsAb pressure revealed an NHR mutation that potentially impairs viral fitness. These findings validate the NHR as a potential HIV-1 therapeutic target, setting the stage for a new class of broadly neutralizing antibodies.

 Microscopic colitis (MC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the large intestine and a common cause of chronic diarrhea in older adults. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of colonic mucosal tissue to build a cellular and molecular model for MC. Our results show that in MC, there is a substantial expansion of tissue CD8+ T cells, likely arising from local expansion following T cell receptor engagement. Within the T cell compartment, MC is characterized by a shift in CD8 tissue-resident memory T cells towards a highly cytotoxic and inflammatory phenotype and expansion of CD4+ T regulatory cells. These results provide insight into inflammatory cytokines shaping MC pathogenesis and highlight notable similarities and differences with other immune-mediated intestinal diseases, including a common upregulation of IL26 and an MC-specific upregulation of IL10.

Here, the authors use optical neuroimaging in mice and humans to show that electroconvulsive therapy elicits a second brain event after seizure—spreading depolarization—a previously hidden phenomenon that may help to understand and optimize this treatment. 
 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a fast-acting, highly effective, and safe treatment for medication-resistant depression. Historically, the clinical benefits of ECT have been attributed to generating a controlled seizure; however, the underlying neurobiology is understudied and unresolved. Using optical neuroimaging of neural activity and hemodynamics in a mouse model of ECT, we demonstrated that a second brain event follows seizure: cortical spreading depolarization (CSD). We found that ECT pulse parameters and electrode configuration directly shaped the wave dynamics of seizure and subsequent CSD. To translate these findings to human patients, we used non-invasive diffuse optical monitoring of cerebral blood flow and oxygenation during routine ECT treatments. We observed that human brains reliably generate hyperemic waves after ECT seizure which are highly consistent with CSD. These results challenge a long-held assumption that seizure is the primary outcome of ECT and point to new opportunities for optimizing ECT stimulation parameters and treatment outcomes. The underlying mechanism of electroconvulsive therapy remains not fully understood. Here, the authors use optical neuroimaging in mice and humans to show that electroconvulsive therapy elicits a second brain event after seizure—spreading depolarization—a previously hidden phenomenon that may help to understand and optimize this treatment."

 Factors governing the clinical trajectory of Plasmodium falciparum infection remain an important area of investigation. Here we present transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic analyses comparing clinical subtypes of severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria to matched controls with uncomplicated disease in 79 children from Mali. MMP8, IL1R2, and ARG1 transcription is higher across cerebral malaria, severe malarial anemia, and concurrent cerebral malaria and severe malarial anemia, indicating a shared inflammatory signature. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 is the most upregulated protein in cerebral malaria, which along with elevated MMP8 and MMP9 transcription, underscores the importance of the metalloproteinase pathway in central nervous system pathophysiology. L-arginine metabolites are decreased in cerebral malaria, which coupled with increased ARG1 transcription suggests a putative mechanism impairing cerebral vasodilation. Using multi-omics approaches, we thus describe the inflammatory cascade in severe malaria syndromes, and identify potential therapeutic targets and biological markers.

 Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β cells results in type 1 diabetes (T1D), with pancreatic immune infiltrate representing a key feature in this process. However, characterization of the immunological processes occurring in human pancreatic lymphatic tissues is lacking. Here, we conduct a comprehensive study of immune cells from pancreatic, mesenteric, and splenic lymphatic tissues of non-diabetic control (ND), β cell autoantibody-positive non-diabetic (AAb+), and T1D donors using flow cytometry and CITEseq. Compared to ND pancreas-draining lymph nodes (pLN), AAb+ and T1D donor pLNs display decreased CD4+ Treg and increased stem-like CD8+ T cell signatures, while only T1D donor pLNs exhibit naive T cell and NK cell differentiation. Mesenteric LNs have modulations only in CD4+ Tregs and naive cells, while splenocytes lack these perturbations.

Zn2+ cations with different local environments are present on the ZnO-ZrO2 surface, including Zn1 single atoms exclusively with a Zn-O-Zr local structure and Znn clusters with both Zn-O-Zr and Zn-O-Zn local structures. The -Zr-O-Zr- structure bonded to the Znn clusters is more easily to be reduced than that bonded to the Zn1 single atoms. The Zn1-single atom (-Zr-O-Zn-O-Zr-) is the active site for catalyzing the CO2 hydrogenation to methanol reaction, whereas the Znn cluster bonded to an in situ formed -Zr-Vo-Zr- structure (-Zn-O-Zn(-O-Zr-Vo-Zr-)-O-Zr-) is the active site for catalyzing the CO hydrogenation to methanol reaction.

 Megacities, with their unique land cover and high pollutant emissions, may influence the outer rainband of approaching typhoons. Here we demonstrate, through numerical simulations and sensitivity experiments, that the Pearl River Delta megacity enhanced convection and precipitation during Typhoon Nida in 2016 offering insights into how urbanization influences precipitation processes. We find that the impact of urban land and anthropogenic heat is more pronounced than that of anthropogenic aerosols. Urban land cover and anthropogenic heat enhance, respectively, surface friction and exacerbate the heat island, driving low-level convergence and enhancing the warm-rain process. In contrast, aerosols primarily enhance the cloud-condensation nuclei concentration and strengthen ice-phase processes. This study underscores the critical importance of accounting for both urban land effects and human activities (anthropogenic heat and aerosol emissions) in understanding and predicting the impact of megacities on urban precipitation.

 Landslides are one of the major geohazards causing significant economic damage and loss of life, with impacts expected to increase due to climate change. Landslide inventory maps (LIMs) are essential for risk management and reduction, but they usually remain an overlooked issue, especially over very large areas, i.e. at a regional or national level. Nowadays, extensive interferometric satellite radar data with wide area coverage are profitably available, but their potential can be not fully exploited due to the challenge of managing them. In this context, we used space-borne advanced Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data at a national scale, in order to create a useful database of active slope instability movement areas to rely on where the landslide inventory map is missing or largely incomplete. Specifically, we provide insights into a new approach, proposing a national-scale method that combines Machine Learning (ML) and clustering tools, which are crucial to manage a huge amount of data. The proposed methodology has been applied to Great Britain. The use of a ML algorithm, specifically Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) for noise filtering, has allowed the InSAR dataset to be reduced from approximately 6.5 million points to about 3.8 million points per component. Thus, implementing ML along with Slope Units for geomorphological reliability, and tools for identifying and classifying active deformation areas yields an InSAR landslide inventory map. Through this process, 336,557 Slope Units have been classified; of these, 5% show discrepancies between landslide inventory and InSAR data. Identifying these areas, along with those classified as landslides by both datasets, is crucial for risk management as it highlights areas that require closer inspections."

 Elucidating the sources and formation mechanisms of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is essential to access its impact on air quality and climate, yet the seasonal variations of SOA formation from ambient air remain poorly constrained. In this study, in-situ SOA formation from ambient air at a suburban site in Nanjing in the Yangtze River Delta of eastern China during summer and winter was investigated using an oxidation flow reactor (OFR), with equivalent photochemical age in the OFR ranging from several hours to 3 weeks. Substantially distinct SOA mass enhancements and precursor characteristics were observed during these two seasons. In summer, the average OH exposure-dependent OA enhancements were ∼0.77–2.64 μg m−3, much higher than ∼0.24 μg m−3 in winter. The known SOA precursors contributed approximately 31 % and 18 % of the measured SOA during summer daytime and nighttime and 25 % and 89 % during winter daytime and nighttime, respectively. In summer, biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) contributed to approximately 56 % of the estimated SOA during the daytime while aromatics accounted for 76 % at night. By contrast, C6-C9 aromatics were the dominant SOA precursors during the daytime and nighttime in winter. The unexplained SOA may be attributed to the unmeasured semi-volatile and intermediate volatile organic compounds (S/IVOCs) and precursors emitted from volatile chemical products (VCPs).

 Anthropogenic influence have led to an increase in the frequency of compound dry and hot events (CDHEs) globally under the background of global warming. However, there is limited research on the extent of anthropogenic influence on the spatial extent of CDHEs. Our analysis, focusing on the changes in the affected area of CDHEs across the global land during the warm season from 1961 to 2013, indicates an increasing trend in both hemispheres and six continents, with the most obviously increases observed in the Northern Hemisphere (15.8 %/53 yr), Asia (16 %/53 yr), and Africa (14 %/53 yr). Using the optimal fingerprinting method for detection and attribution analysis, we found that the anthropogenic signal was robustly detected in all regions except Oceania. The greenhouse gases emission played a major role in the observed increasing trends in all regions except Oceania. Furthermore, we conducted an event attribution analysis for the 2022–like CDHEs areas in the Northern Hemisphere, finding that nearly 95 %, 91 %, and 89 % of the trends in the Northern Hemisphere, Asia, and Europe, respectively, could be attributed to anthropogenic climate change. Using the attribution result, we constrained projections of spatial extent of CDHEs under the SSP2–4.5 and SSP5–8.5 emission scenarios. The constrained projections show a smaller increasing magnitude compared to the raw projections (except for Asia), with the largest differences observed in South America in the Southern Hemisphere. By 2100, the CDHEs areas in the Northern Hemisphere are projected to reach 43 % and 68 % under the SSP2–4.5 and SSP5–8.5 scenarios, respectively. Asia faces the most widespread impact from CHDEs, with more than 93 % under the SSP5–8.5 scenario and 56 % under the SSP2–4.5 scenario.

 Cold air outbreaks (CAOs) are phenomena that occur across high latitudes during winter months and favor the development of extensive boundary layer clouds. As the boundary layer evolves, changes in cloud morphology often result in a stratocumulus to cumulus transition (SCT). The onset of precipitation is considered to be a key factor that leads to the break-up of the stratocumulus deck. In this modeling study we investigate the additional role that aerosols have on the SCT within a CAO event in the North Atlantic, by using prognostic fields for both aerosols and cloud droplet number concentrations (Nd). By using two chemical/aerosol schemes we assess and quantify the impact of aerosols on the SCT evolution. Our results indicate that the aerosol load and its chemical composition affect the timing of precipitation initiation and its magnitude and thus the break-up. However, the two schemes reveal contradictory results, which are mainly associated with different aerosol size and chemical composition partitioning between modes and bins. The simulations with the aerosol scheme, which considers the modal approach, show that the reduction of Nd across the SCT is driven by changes in the cloud liquid water content, the sulfate availability, and the fine sea-spray availability in the cumulus region, which suppresses sulfate activation. The Nd decreases mostly follow the decrease in accumulation-mode aerosols. For the scheme that considers the sectional approach, both the stratiform and the cumulus clouds appear sensitive to new particles formation and their competition for water. However, in the cumulus region, the higher updrafts and the greater availability of fine sea salt particles become critical for the activation of small particles. New particle formation and background sulfate concentrations are critical in this pristine environment, while sea salt particles have a significant impact on SCT in both sets of simulations."

We evaluate emissions for 15 scenarios based on different combinations of key emission control measures. We use Goddard Earth Observing System -Chem Adjoint v35n for pollutant concentration modeling. We estimate PM2.5 and ozone-attributable premature mortalities following global burden of disease 2019 methodology, and an epidemiologically-derived concentration-response model for NO2-attributable new paediatric asthma cases. Implementing all measures identified in this study is projected to avoid 1.9 million (95% confidence interval 1.3 million-2.4 million) premature deaths and 1.4 million (95% confidence interval 0.7 million-1.7 million) new cases of paediatric asthma cumulatively from 2023 to 2040. These health benefits differ by region and age group. Adults aged 65 and older account for 70% of global avoidable years of life lost, and children under 5 represent 50% of global avoidable new paediatric asthma cases. In countries without Euro 6/VI-equivalent standards, implementing such standards could achieve 56% and 63% of the total benefits of all identified measures combined for avoidable premature deaths and new paediatric asthma cases respectively. Regional disparities in road transport-attributable air pollution and health burdens are projected to widen without additional policies. Less developed countries are projected to experience more adverse impacts. Developing countries and urban areas show substantial potential in reducing new paediatric asthma cases.

Hilmar Gudmundsson;Jan De Rydt,Coupling framework (1.0) for the Úa (2023b) ice sheet model and the FESOM-1.4 z-coordinate ocean model in an Antarctic domain,"The new coupled ice sheet–ocean model addresses challenges related to horizontal resolution through advanced mesh flexibility, enabled by the use of unstructured grids. We describe the new model, verify its functioning in an idealised setting and demonstrate its advantages in a global-ocean–Antarctic ice sheet domain. The results of this study comprise an important step towards improving predictions of the Antarctic contribution to sea level rise over centennial timescales. 
 The rate at which the Antarctic ice sheet loses mass is to a large degree controlled by ice–ocean interactions underneath small ice shelves, with the most sensitive regions concentrated in even smaller areas near grounding lines and local pinning points. Sufficient horizontal resolution is key to resolving critical ice–ocean processes in these regions but difficult to afford in large-scale models used to predict the coupled response of the entire Antarctic ice sheet and the global ocean to climate change. In this study we describe the implementation of a framework that couples the ice sheet flow model Úa with the Finite Element Sea Ice Ocean Model (FESOM-1.4) in a configuration using depth-dependent vertical coordinates. The novelty of this approach is the use of horizontally unstructured grids in both model components, allowing us to resolve critical processes directly, while keeping computational demands within the range of feasibility. We use the Marine Ice Sheet Ocean Model Intercomparison Project (MISOMIP) framework to verify that ice retreat and readvance are reliably simulated, and inaccuracies in mass, heat and salt conservation are small compared to the forcing signal. Further, we demonstrate the capabilities of our approach for a global ocean–Antarctic ice sheet domain. In a 39-year hindcast simulation (1979–2018) we resolve retreat behaviour of Pine Island Glacier, a known challenge for coarser-resolution models. We conclude that Úa–FESOM is well suited to improve predictions of the Antarctic ice sheet evolution over centennial timescales."

Our model is designed to learn from observational data, with a particular emphasis on understanding the influence of vegetation on water movement. By closely aligning with real-world observations, our model offers new possibilities for enhancing our understanding of the water cycle and its interactions with vegetation. 
 The proposed hybrid hydrological model with vegetation (H2MV) uses dynamic meteorology and static features as input to a long short-term memory (LSTM) to model uncertain parameters of process formulations that govern water fluxes and states. In the hydrological model, vegetation states are represented by the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), and soil storage capacity (SMmax), which depends on effective rooting depth besides soil properties. SMmax and fAPAR are both learned and predicted by the neural networks directly. These parameters have an explicit role to model soil moisture (SM) storage and the partitioning of evapotranspiration (ET). The model is optimized concurrently against global observations and observation-based data of terrestrial water storage (TWS) anomalies, fAPAR, snow water equivalent (SWE), ET, and gridded runoff in a 10-fold cross-validation (CV) setup. To this end, we infer where the model is under-constrained such that different processes could explain the observational constraints in the model due to equifinality. The model reproduces the observed patterns of global hydrological components and fAPAR, while emergent patterns of runoff ratio, evaporative fraction, and the ratio of transpiration to ET are consistent with our current understanding. Despite robustly predicted temporal patterns of TWS anomalies, we found that the mean soil moisture state is not well constrained, causing uncertainty in mean TWS. This emphasizes the importance of SMmax and the necessity for associated enhanced constraints. The proposed model is open-source and has a highly flexible and modular structure to facilitate future integration of carbon and energy cycles, advancing toward a hybrid land surface model."

However, the complex international trade of raw wood materials and HWPs and the associated biogenic carbon conversion along the global supply chain are not properly accounted for in the existing HWP carbon accounting schemes, precluding effective climate policy design. To address the gap, we developed a generalizable Trade-Linked Approach to account for trade and the associated carbon stocks and emissions. In the case study for China-made HWPs in 1990–2020, trade partners supplied 22% (1425 MtCO2e, or 389 MtC) of raw materials and consumed 13% (691 MtCO2e, or 189 MtC) of the HWPs, with the latter double that of the FAOSTAT statistics that were used in the existing studies. In the same period, the trade partners contributed 13% (570 MtCO2e) of the total HWP carbon stocks. The HWPs consumed overseas provided a 43 MtCO2e yr–1 carbon sink (15% of the total) from 2016 to 2020, which is close to the “forest and land use carbon credits” transacted in global voluntary carbon markets in 2020. In addition to adequately allocating carbon removals to each country, we appeal for a global HWP-associated carbon payment scheme to incentivize HWP-based mitigation activities along the supply chain."

Enhancing sediment oxidation can inhibit Mn release, but the mechanisms of Mn speciation under varying oxidative conditions remain unclear. This study examined sediment exposure to oxygenated water layers at controlled dissolved oxygen levels (0, 2, 5, 7 mg L–1) through laboratory simulations. Results showed Mn release is negatively correlated with DO (R2 = 0.93, p = 0.034), with oxygen driving reactions between dissolved organic matter (C2 and C3 components) and forming functional groups (−OH, −COOH) that remove Mn through adsorption or complexation (C2: R2 = 0.57, p < 0.001; C3: R2 = 0.53, p < 0.001).

Substantial data support an AOP related to estrogen receptor (ER) antagonism, leading to decreased fecundity in fish. In this study, data were generated for an ER agonism AOP leading to reduced fecundity in avian species (AOP537). Chicken embryos and the chicken leghorn male hepatoma cell line, LMH, were used to elucidate key events associated with estrogen signaling following exposure to 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and bisphenol A (BPA). Embryos were exposed via egg injection. Viability and hepatic estrogen-responsive gene expression data were collected at midincubation (embryonic day [ED] 11). Changes in plasma vitellogenin (VTG), gonad morphology and growth were evaluated prior to pipping (ED20). Both chemicals dysregulated estrogen-responsive genes in hepatic tissue and increased plasma VTG concentrations. In LMH spheroids, EE2 and BPA altered estrogen-responsive genes and VTG concentrations at 24 and 48 h, respectively. Gonadal histology revealed oocyte-type cells and loss of testicular cords in male embryos exposed to EE2 and BPA. Overall, EE2 and BPA upregulated VTG mRNA expression, increased plasma VTG, and caused impairments in gonadal development. These results contribute avian-specific evidence to support an endocrine disruption AOP describing the relationship between disrupted VTG synthesis and impaired reproduction."

 Five years before the 2022 multi-country mpox outbreak, Nigeria and Cameroon reported their first cases in over three decades.1,2 While Nigeria's outbreak is recognized as an ongoing human epidemic, the drivers of Cameroon's resurgence remain unclear.3,4 The rate of zoonoses remains uncertain in both countries, and gaps in genomic data obscure the timing, zoonotic and geographic origin of mpox virus (MPXV) emergence in humans. To address these uncertainties, we generated 118 MPXV genomes from Nigeria and Cameroon from 2018-2023. Our findings show that, in contrast to Nigeria, cases in Cameroon are the result of repeated zoonoses, with two distinct zoonotic lineages circulating across the Nigeria-Cameroon border. Our findings suggest that shared animal populations in the cross-border forest ecosystems drive virus emergence and spread. Accordingly, we identify the closest zoonotic outgroup to the Nigerian human epidemic lineage (hMPXV-1) in a southern Nigerian border state. We estimate that the shared ancestor of the zoonotic outgroup and hMPXV-1 circulated in animals in southern Nigeria in late 2013. We estimate that hMPXV-1 emerged in humans in August 2014 in the southern Rivers State and circulated undetected for three years. Rivers State acted as the main source of viral spread across the human epidemic. Our study sheds light on MPXV's recent establishment in the human population and highlights the risk of persistent zoonotic emergence of MPXV in the complex border regions of Cameroon and Nigeria."

 Spatially-resolved transcriptomics (SRT) technologies now allow exploration of gene expression with spatial context. Recent advances achieving subcellular resolution provide richer data but also introduce challenges, such as aggregating subcellular spots into individual cells, which is a task distinct from traditional deconvolution. Existing methods often grid SRT data into predefined squares, which is unrealistic for accurately capturing cellular boundaries. We propose a method, STP, that integrates subcellular SRT data with nuclei-stained images to partition individual cells. STP first segments nuclei and maps their masks onto the SRT data, then uses a simulated-annealing-inspired approach to expand nuclear boundaries to the full cellular level. Evaluated on subcellular SRT datasets from Drosophila embryos at multiple developmental stages and from mouse embryos with a large field-of-view, STP demonstrated accurate single-cell partitioning, unveiling significant spatial tissue patterns and identifying undetected cell types beyond previous methods.

Here, the authors reconstruct ancestral karyotypes of Camelinodae and Brassicodae, identify cascading fusions, and highlight their stable inheritance and role in evolutionary relationships. 
 The ancestral crucifer karyotype and 22 conserved genomic blocks (CGBs) facilitate phylogenomic analyses in the Brassicaceae. Chromosomal rearrangements reshuffled CGBs of ancestral chromosomes during karyotype evolution. Here, we identify eight protochromosomes representing the common ancestral karyotype (ACBK) of the two Brassicoideae supertribes: Camelinodae (Lineage I) and Brassicodae (Lineage II). The characterization of multiple cascading fusion events allows us to infer evolutionary relationships based on these events. In the Camelinodae, the ACBK first evolved into the AKI genome, which remained conserved in the Cardamineae, whereas it was altered to tAKI by a reciprocal translocation that preceded the diversification of most Camelinodae tribes. The identified fusion breakpoints largely overlap with CGB boundaries, suggesting that CGBs are mainly disrupted by chromosome fusions. Our results demonstrate the stable inheritance of chromosome fusions and their importance for reconstructing evolutionary relationships. The chromosomal breakpoint approach provides a basis for ancestral state reconstruction based on chromosome-level genome assemblies.

 Basal cell adenoma (BCA) and basal cell adenocarcinoma (BCAC) of the salivary gland are rare tumours that can be difficult to distinguish from each other and other salivary gland tumour subtypes. Using next-generation sequencing, we identify a recurrent FBXW11 missense mutation (p.F517S) in BCA that is mutually exclusive with the previously reported CTNNB1 p.I35T gain-of-function (GoF) mutation with these mutations collectively accounting for 94% of BCAs. In vitro, mutant FBXW11 is characterised by defective binding to β-catenin and higher protein levels within the nucleus. This is consistent with the increased nuclear expression of β-catenin and activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. The genomic profiles of BCAC are distinct from BCA, with hotspot DICER1 and HRAS mutations and putative driver mutations affecting PI3K/AKT and NF-κB signalling pathway genes.

 Lipase represents one of the most important industrial biocatalysts, with a global market value of $590.5 million by 2020. However, their catalytic efficiency is often hindered by a closed “lid” conformation. Here, we present an aggregation-induced conformation locking strategy that enables the facile synthesis of highly activated lipase hybrid biocatalysts. Lipase is self-activated into an open-lid conformation via solvent-mediated aggregation, followed by conformational locking within a two-dimensional metal-organic framework (MOF). The resulting MOF biocatalyst provides high accessibility to the locked lipase aggregates through its long-range ordered pore channels, achieving a hydrolytic efficiency 5.30 times greater than that of native lipase. To the best of our knowledge, this represents a record-high activation efficiency for ester hydrolysis among the reported lipase-based hybrid biocatalysts to date. We also demonstrate its feasibility to catalytically accelerate transesterification and esterification reactions, showing up to as 6.64 times higher yield than native lipase and impressive recyclability.

 Exceeding 1.5 °C of global warming above pre-industrial levels has become a distinct possibility, yet the consequences of such an overshoot for mountain glaciers and their contribution to raising sea levels and impacting water availability are not well understood. Here we show that exceeding and then returning to below 1.5 °C will have irreversible consequences for glacier mass and runoff over centuries. Global climate and glacier simulations project that a 3.0 °C peak-and-decline scenario will lead to 11% more global glacier mass loss by 2500 compared with limiting warming to 1.5 °C without overshooting. In basins where glaciers regrow after peak temperature, glacier runoff reduces further than if the glaciers stabilize, a phenomenon we call ‘trough water’. Half the studied glaciated basins show reduced glacier runoff with overshoot compared with without for decades to centuries after peak warming.

 The benefits and risks of forests to human health are widely recognized. Yet, variation across forest types and their ecological characteristics driving health effects remain underexplored. Based on a continental-scale, interdisciplinary empirical database from 164 European forest stands, we constructed a Bayesian Belief Network to quantify seven causal pathways relating distinct forest types to physical and mental health. These forest–health pathways included mental well-being via visual or auditory stimuli, thermal comfort, polyphenol content of medicinal plants, mushrooms and nutrition, air quality, and ticks and Lyme disease. Results show that forests consistently provide net health benefits regardless of their ecological characteristics. Forest canopy density and tree species diversity emerge as key drivers, but their effect size and directionality are strongly pathway-dependent. Changes in forest canopy density can generate trade-offs. For example, forests optimized for heat buffering and air pollution mitigation may compromise medicinal plant yield and enhance Lyme disease prevalence. Tree diversity effects were weaker but more uniformly positive. Therefore, forest management should account for such trade-offs to tailor forest biodiversity and functioning to local public health priorities.

Although previous studies have examined their relationships across various timescales, their connection at the orbital timescale remains underexplored. Through a series of simulations, we demonstrate that Australian Summer Monsoon (AUSM) precipitation varies out of phase with East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) precipitation at the precession timescale due to local insolation changes. At the same timescale, the relationship between AUSM circulation and East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) circulation is weak. This weak linkage arises from the precession-induced inter-hemispheric insolation gradient, which diminishes cross-equatorial flow and consequently weakens the dynamical links between AUSM and EAWM circulations."

 Cold events occur in North America (NA) frequently, which pose a significant threat to extensive damage to traffic and agriculture. Research on cold events in NA has mainly focused on the individual impacts of the sea surface temperature (SST) variabilities in the North Pacific and the North Atlantic, with less analysis of their synergistic effect. Here we utilize observational data and numerical experiments to show that the positive North Pacific Victoria mode (VM) and the negative North Tropical Atlantic (NTA) SST exert significant synergistic effects on the winter–spring cold events in eastern NA via Rossby waves propagation. Specifically, the VM-related negative western North Pacific (WNP) SST anomalies are linked to upper-tropospheric wind convergence anomalies in situ, which excite a Rossby wave train from the WNP to the North Atlantic and thus strengthen the high-level negative geopotential height anomalies (GHAs) over eastern NA and the positive air-ocean feedback over the North Atlantic. As a result, the negative GHAs strengthened by the positive VM and negative NTA SST cause increased extreme cold events. Further results reveal that the negative GHAs and cold events in eastern NA during the co-occurrence of the positive VM and negative NTA SST events are more than three times stronger than those for the two kinds of single events. This study suggests that the synergistic effect of the positive VM and negative NTA SST anomalies could advance our comprehensive understanding of the combined effect of the inter-basin SST anomalies on the mid-to-high-latitude climate."

 Intense winds associated with tropical cyclones (TCs) generate surface ocean cooling in their wakes, which can persist for several weeks in their aftermath. While multi-decadal observations of the sea surface have shown a substantial warming of the ocean, long-term changes in cold wake recovery time remain largely unknown. Here we find a trend toward faster recovery of TC cold wakes in the Atlantic main development region (MDR) since 2001. This is due primarily to a decrease in the strength of the North Atlantic trade winds, which reduces evaporative cooling of the ocean. The faster damping of TC cold wakes has led to a significant increase in the intensification of subsequent TCs that encounter lingering wakes from prior TCs, with a magnitude that is about 9% of that from long-term warming of the ocean. Finally, earth system model simulations indicate that the observed decrease in the cold wake recovery time will likely continue into the future."

 Accurate identification of subsidence funnels is essential for assessing surface deformation in mining areas, preventing disasters, and optimizing resource management. However, recognizing subsidence funnels of varying sizes in large-scale interferograms poses significant challenges, particularly for small-sized funnels. Their indistinct features and susceptibility to background noise interference often result in suboptimal detection accuracy. To address these challenges, this study proposes a deep learning network based on the YOLO architecture—SFD-YOLO (Sinking Funnel Detection-YOLO). The model incorporates the DWR-C2f module, which enhances multi-scale feature extraction and significantly improves the detection of small-sized subsidence funnels. Additionally, the innovative Inner-WIoU regression loss function improves the localization accuracy of detection boxes while also alleviates the imbalance between hard and easy samples. Experimental results demonstrate that the fully trained SFD-YOLO model achieves an mAP50 accuracy of 92.00% while maintaining high efficiency, significantly outperforming other advanced methods. Applying the SFD-YOLO model to interferograms across China detected a total of 3,842 subsidence funnels, with Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, and Anhui identified as the four provinces with the highest funnel number. Overall, subsidence funnels are predominantly distributed in northern and northwestern China.

 On 8 August 2022, a quasi-stationary mesoscale convective system (MCS) produced prolonged extreme rainfall (> 100 mm h−1) over the Seoul metropolitan area, Republic of Korea. These organized convective systems, primarily composed of convective components with interspersed stratiform elements, are characterized by the successive local generations of convective cells. This study analyzes data from multiple observational platforms to understand the formation of the MCS and its microphysical evolution. The convective cells were initiated just off the west coast near Seoul, along the boundary between warm and cold air masses. Low-level convergence and favorable environmental conditions, including low lifting condensation level, level of free convection, and large convective available potential energy, facilitated the triggering of these cells. As the cells moved inland, they intensified rapidly due to the land-sea surface-friction contrast. Radar data show that as the MCS matured, reflectivity increased and the differential reflectivity decreased downward above the melting level, indicating the growth of ice crystals and graupels. The evolution of microphysical structure led to increases in both the mean diameter (Dm) and the number concentration (NT) of raindrops. This observation also suggests that the rainfall intensity was more closely related to the increase in NT than Dm during the period of heavy downpours. This study improves our understanding of the mesoscale processes related to extreme rainfall in Korea, critical for forecasting local heavy rainfall."

The aim is to assess (i) their historical evolution, (ii) their institutional arrangements and governance characteristics, and (iii) their numbers, surface, and land uses. To carry out this analysis, we used secondary data from official statistics, surveys, scientific and grey literature, legislation, and bylaws for each country and each region. The results show that CLOIs emerged in the Middle Ages and went through key changes in the 19th century, primarily due to Napoleon’s influence in reorganising public administration structures, and post-World War II centralization processes, especially in eastern European countries. In total, we accounted for between 5785 and 11 063 CLOIs, distributed across 32 types in the 6 countries; among which, CLOIs with full property rights and membership based on farmstead ownership are the most frequent. The main land use for Alpine CLOIs is forest followed by pasturelands. CLOIs holding agricultural land, such as cropland, was instead reported for only one country and was negligible.

We aimed to investigate the association between greenness and PD prevalence in China. This cross-sectional study utilized data from the 2020 wave of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), involving a sample of 17 029 individuals. PD diagnoses were ascertained through medical professionals and records in questionnaires. To assess greenness exposure, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated as annual population-weighted for 2020 (NDVI2020) and a two-year average population-weighted for the period of 2019 and 2020 (NDVI2019−2020), respectively. Logistic regression models were employed to analyze the association between greenness and PD prevalence at city scale, and stratified analyses were further performed to identify potential modifiers of the association between greenness and PD prevalence. In the fully-adjusted models, a 0.1 increase in NDVI2020 was associated with 14.0% [odds ratio (OR) 0.860, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.750, 0.987] lower odds of prevalent PD. Similarly, a 0.1 increase in NDVI2019−2020 was associated with 13.9% (OR 0.861, 95% CI: 0.744, 0.997) reduction in the odds of prevalent PD. This conclusion remained robust in the sensitivity analyses. Moreover, significant protective effects of greenness on PD prevalence were identified among females, the elderly, those living alone, and those with healthier habits. This national cross-sectional study found that exposure to higher greenness was associated with reduced odds of prevalent PD. Greenness may serve as a readily accessible environmental intervention for lowering prevalent PD in the future."

In contrast, this study seeks to provide a statistical analysis of the resilience mechanisms that human societies have historically employed to adapt to and mitigate adverse environmental conditions. Agricultural development, as a crucial component of social resilience, has played a pivotal role in enabling societies to absorb climate-induced subsistence pressures. We systematically examine how introducing American crops mitigated the relationship between climatic extremes—specifically floods and droughts—and Malthusian catastrophes such as famines and wars during the Ming and Qing Dynasties in China. By collecting and analyzing records of four high-yield American crops—maize, peanuts, sweet potatoes, and potatoes—from 3071 local chronicles across 236 prefectures, we employ the spatial Durbin model to evaluate both the direct and spillover effects of these crops during hydroclimatic extremes quantitatively to see how they contributed to social resilience. Our statistical results indicate that introducing these American crops had significant mitigating effects on Malthusian catastrophes during climate extremes, with varying impacts among the different crops. Maize and peanuts were particularly effective in reducing wars during floods, while peanuts, sweet potatoes, and potatoes tended to alleviate famines during droughts. Regional comparison reveals that these catastrophe-mitigating effects were more pronounced in the south-western mountainous zone and that spatial spillover effects were more significant in the central-eastern rice cultivation zone. These findings underscore the importance of agricultural development in enhancing social resilience to climatic extremes. By highlighting the regionally varying catastrophe-mitigating effects of specific crops, our study provides valuable insights into the adaptive capacities of human societies to climate variability. This contributes to a more nuanced and context-sensitive understanding of the human-environment nexus."

This study found that the interannual variations of the warm extremes over the Indochina Peninsula during boreal summer can be affected by the IOT. When the positive IOT events occur, two cross-equatorial airflows are induced over the eastern and western tropical Indian Ocean, reinforcing the anomalous warm-humid westerly wind over the northern Indian Ocean. The water vapor convergence is strengthened and the anomalous middle-lower level negative geopotential height is formed over the Indochina Peninsula, leading to the local enhanced ascending motion and surplus precipitation, strongly supported by both observations and numerical simulation. These circulation anomalies favor the reduction of the local surface temperatures through increasing the cloud cover and hindering the downward solar radiation, further declining the warm extremes days. Improving to understand the warm extreme variations over the Indochina Peninsula and its impact factors is of great significance for local industrial development, agricultural production and human health."

Leveraging machine learning tools to forecast algal blooms is crucial and promising for bloom management in various water systems. Notably, previous findings are site-specific, especially regarding the impacts of forecasting periods and important input features. However, there is a significant research gap in the application of machine learning for predicting algal blooms in the Great Lakes, the world’s largest freshwater system. Thus, based on the measurements of 16 water quality parameters from 2012 to 2022, the author established the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model to forecast chlorophyll a (Chl a, a proxy for algal biomass) concentration for 1–7 d in Lake Erie. The XGBoost model performance is quite satisfactory, with the lowest MSE of 10.94 and the highest R2 of 0.99 for the 1 d forecast and an MSE of 83.90 and an R2 of 0.90 for the 7 d forecast. Once trained, the model takes only a few seconds to run on an Intel Core i7 personal laptop. Based on Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) feature importance, water depth (Depth) and water temperature (Temp), are more important input features for the 7 d forecasting model than the well-recognized phosphorus and nitrogen nutrients, including particulate organic nitrogen (PON), soluble reactive phosphorous (SRP), nitrate + nitrite (NN), and total phosphorous (TP). Achieving relatively high accuracy for the 7 d forecast, with an R2 of 0.83 and an MSE of 144.40, is possible by using only the top six most important input features: initial Chl a, Depth, Temp, PON, SRP, and NN, based on SHAP feature importance results. These findings highlight the accuracy and efficiency of the developed XGBoost model to predict Chl a in the world’s largest freshwater system. The model can enhance algal bloom monitoring efficiency through early detection and key predictive features, supporting an early warning system for timely interventions, while also informing policy decisions and optimizing resource allocation."

Using longitudinal mosquito trapping surveys in 24 informal settlements between 2018 and 2024 (totalling 1534 successful trap sets in Makassar and 1216 in Suva), we fitted causal models to infer the relationships between climatic, environmental and socioeconomic drivers and the abundance of two dominant mosquito species: Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus. Water supply and access, and variation in temperature and precipitation were key drivers of mosquito abundance in both informal settlement locations, but the direction of effects differed between vector species. Piped water supply in a settlement reduced the abundance of the dengue vector, Ae. aegypti but increased the abundance of Cx. quinquefasciatus. Higher temperature and precipitation were associated with more Ae. aegypti in both geographic locations.

The most accurate classifier achieved an out-of-sample prediction accuracy of 85.81%, outperforming the fire weather index and methodologies of random forests and logistic regression. Key drivers of ignition were identified as higher lightning frequency, elevated temperatures, and lower fuel moisture content.

All 12 members of the 12 km ensemble were corrected using quantile mapping and a change-preserving variant. Both methods effectively reduce biases in multiple statistics while maintaining projected climatic changes. We provide guidance on using the bias-corrected datasets for climate change impact assessment. 
 The United Kingdom Climate Projections 2018 (UKCP18) regional climate model (RCM) 12 km regional perturbed physics ensemble (UKCP18-RCM-PPE) is one of the three strands of the latest set of UK national climate projections produced by the UK Met Office. It has been widely adopted in climate impact assessment. In this study, we report biases in the raw UKCP18-RCM simulations that are significant and are likely to deteriorate impact assessments if they are not adjusted. Two methods were used to bias-correct UKCP18-RCM: non-parametric quantile mapping using empirical quantiles and a variant developed for the third phase of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) designed to preserve the climate change signal. Specifically, daily temperature and precipitation simulations for 1981 to 2080 were adjusted for the 12 ensemble members. Potential evapotranspiration was also estimated over the same period using the Penman–Monteith formulation and then bias-corrected using the latter method. Both methods successfully corrected biases in a range of daily temperature, precipitation, and potential evapotranspiration metrics and reduced biases in multi-day precipitation metrics to a lesser degree. An exploratory analysis of the projected future changes confirms the expectation of wetter, warmer winters and hotter, drier summers and shows uneven changes in different parts of the distributions of both temperature and precipitation. Both bias-correction methods preserved the climate change signal almost equally well, as well as the spread among the projected changes. The change factor method was used as a benchmark for precipitation, and we show that it fails to capture changes in a range of variables, making it inadequate for most impact assessments. By comparing the differences between the two bias-correction methods and within the 12 ensemble members, we show that the uncertainty in future precipitation and temperature changes stemming from the climate model parameterization far outweighs the uncertainty introduced by selecting one of these two bias-correction methods. We conclude by providing guidance on the use of the bias-corrected datasets. The datasets bias-adjusted with ISIMIP3BA are publicly available in the following repositories: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6337381 for precipitation and temperature (Reyniers et al., 2022a) and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6320707 for potential evapotranspiration (Reyniers et al., 2022b).

Outperforming the Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW), it achieves higher spatial accuracy (R²>0.85) and makes up for the lack of spatial information of large livestock such as camels in GLW. The results enabled precise spatial characterization of pastoral patterns. 
 Accurate quantification of the geospatial distribution of livestock in pastoral regions is important for assessing and maintaining grassland ecological security and sustainable development. Statistical livestock data based on static and macro-level administrative units cannot characterize the fine-scale distribution of livestock across mobile geographic spaces. This study proposed a livestock spatial mapping framework that combined livestock inventory statistics of soum/banner counties with multi-source data (e.g., land cover, population, topography, and climate, etc.) using the Random Forest model (RF). A series of high-resolution gridded spatial distribution datasets of total livestock, sheep & goats, and large livestock (cattle, horses, and camels) densities at five-year intervals were obtained for the Mongolian Plateau from 2000 to 2020. The fitting accuracy of this dataset with statistical data (R²>0.85) is significantly better than that of the existing Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW) series dataset, and the spatial distribution is more accurate and detailed. At the same time, it also compensates for the lack of spatial information of large livestock such as camels in the GLW. This approach enables coarse-grained administrative division data transforming into high-resolution spatial gridded data, by solving the key problems of low spatial resolution, missing local details, and the spatial fusion of different data sources. Based on the acquired high-precision spatial distribution data of livestock density, it can be fused and analyzed with other geographic environment data, which is of great value for the ecological environment protection of grassland in nomadic grassland areas.

This study presents a particle-swarm-optimizer-based toolbox for marine ecosystem models, compatible with the Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models, thus enhancing its reusability. Applied to the Sylt ecosystem, the toolbox effectively (1) identified multiple parameter sets that matched observations well, providing different insights into ecosystem dynamics, and (2) optimized model complexity. 
 Mathematical models are an invaluable tool for understanding marine ecosystems. The performance of these models is often highly dependent on their parameters. Traditionally, refining these models has involved a time-consuming trial-and-error approach to identify model parameter values that are able to reproduce observations well. However, as ecosystem models become more complex, this approach becomes impractical. With advances in computing power, optimization techniques have emerged as a viable alternative. Nevertheless, these techniques often exhibit model-specific customization, which limits their broader application. In this study, we present a parameterization toolbox based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, implemented within the Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models (FABM). This implementation encapsulates the optimizer – that is, the toolbox itself – as a reusable component, enabling its integration across multiple models within the framework and thus making it more accessible to the community. The effectiveness of the PSO toolbox is showcased through its application in a 1D physical–biogeochemical model (GOTM–ECOSMO E2E), which successfully parameterized the Sylt–Rømø Bight ecosystem. The toolbox was able to define optimal values for most of the tuned parameters and to suggest potential ranges for poorly constrained parameters. In addition, the toolbox uncovers a number of parameter sets with notable differences in some parameter values but leading to only minor variations in biomass and fluxes. Furthermore, by experimenting with optimization models of varying complexity, the toolbox was able to define an optimal model for the Sylt–Rømø Bight."

This study investigated the bioconcentration factors (BCFs) of 18 emerging and legacy PFASs using zebrafish in a flow-through exposure system and constructed a robust BCF prediction model to address the data gaps associated with numerous novel PFASs. Experimental results indicated that perfluoro(3,5,7,9,11-pentaoxadodecanoic) acid (PFO5DoDA) and perfluoro-2,5-dimethyl-3,6-dioxanonanoic acid (C9 HFPO-TA) exhibited higher bioaccumulation potential than perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). A multimodal feature-fused directed message passing neural network (FF-DMPNN) model was constructed, integrating molecular graph representations, physicochemical descriptors, and bioassay data reflecting absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion characteristics. The FF-DMPNN model demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to conventional machine learning approaches by providing a more complete representation of molecular structures and physicochemical properties, achieving higher accuracy (R2 = 0.742) and robustness in predicting BCF values for PFASs. Application of the model to a comprehensive PFAS database identified 2.45% of chemicals as bioaccumulative, highlighting the need for regulatory attention. Overall, this study provides critical insights into the bioconcentration risks associated with PFASs and offers a reliable framework for prioritizing regulatory actions for these emerging contaminants, addressing a pressing need for their effective environmental management."

The presence of OPEs in human blood suggests direct interactions with hematological components, which may compromise hemostatic balance and lead to adverse health outcomes. Despite the critical role of hemostatic balance in maintaining blood stability, the effects of OPEs on this system remain poorly understood. This investigation was undertaken to delineate the effects and potential mechanisms of OPEs that modulate hemostasis, utilizing in silico approach and high-throughput in vitro investigation. We analyzed 85 environmentally prevalent OPEs for their structural descriptors and affinity for proteins essential to hemostatic function. The multiple linear regression implicated aryl-OPEs, distinguished by their benzene ring scaffold, as potent disruptors of hemostatic balance. This analysis result was rigorously validated through the in vitro hemostatic balance assays. Further investigation through network toxicology, artificial intelligence (α-Fold) algorithms, and an agonist cotreatment assay revealed proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) as a key mediator of aryl-OPEs induced hemostatic disruption. By integrating in vitro experimental insights with in vivo exposure data, we concluded that specific aryl-OPEs, such as bisphenol a bis (diphenyl phosphate) (BDP) and cresyl diphenyl phosphate (CDP), pose a moderate risk to the hemostatic balance of the general population.

Polyaromatic hydrocarbon (∑PAH) concentrations range from 41.1 to 1455.3 ng/L in water and 14.5 to 63.2 μg/kg in sediments, topsoil, and ash. Water primarily contains phenanthrene and trace levels of pyrene and fluorene, while solid samples exhibit elevated levels of naphthalene and phenanthrene, along with trace amounts of acenaphthene, anthracene, and fluorene. Runoff and terrain slope patterns derived from topographical analyses of the Chena River watershed might explain some of these elevated PAH levels, which surpass those found in other wildfire-affected watersheds worldwide. These findings underscore the risks to aquatic ecosystems, as PAHs are toxic, bioaccumulative, and can lead to the formation of harmful disinfection byproducts. Thus, the increasing frequency of wildfires in Alaska poses a significant threat to local communities relying on wildfire-impacted freshwater  for fishing and drinking."

Welte,Physiological Stress Response to Sulfide Exposure of Freshwater Anaerobic Methanotrophic Archaea,"Freshwater wetlands and coastal sediments are becoming hotspots for the emission of the greenhouse gas methane. Eutrophication-induced deposition of organic matter leads to elevated methanogenesis and sulfate reduction, thereby increasing the concentrations of methane and toxic sulfide, respectively. However, the effects of sulfide stress on the anaerobic methanotrophic biofilter have not been well explored. Here, we show how an enrichment culture dominated by the freshwater anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaeon “Candidatus (Ca.) Methanoperedens” responds to short-term and long-term exposure to sulfide in a bioreactor. The methane-oxidizing activity decreased to 45% and 20% but partially recovered to 70% and 30% within 5 days after short- and long-term sulfide exposure, respectively. Metagenomics indicated that “Ca. Methanoperedens” remained dominant in the enrichment throughout the entire experiment. The first short-term sulfide pulse led to increased expression of genes encoding for sulfide detoxification by low abundant community members, whereas long-term exposure resulted in upregulation of “Ca. Methanoperedens” genes encoding sulfite reductases of group III (Dsr-LP). “Ca. Methanoperedens” consumed polyhydroxyalkanoates during long-term sulfide exposure, possibly to aid in stress adaptation. Together, these results provide a valuable baseline for understanding fundamental ecophysiological adaptations to methane cycling in sulfate- and nitrate-rich aquatic ecosystems."

However, its hepatotoxic mechanisms remain insufficiently studied and systematically evaluated. This study integrated network toxicology, transcriptomics, and metabolomics to investigate its toxicity mechanisms. ADMETlab 3.0 was used to predict physicochemical properties and multiorgan toxicity. The targets related to 6PPDQ and liver injury were obtained from public databases, and a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to identify key targets. Meanwhile, molecular docking was performed to assess 6PPDQ’s binding affinity to core proteins. Transcriptomics and differential gene expression analysis were performed on the livers of Kunming mice exposed to 4 mg/kg 6PPDQ to explore transcriptomic alterations, while metabolomic profiling identified disrupted metabolic pathways. Network toxicology results reveal that 6PPDQ primarily induces hepatotoxicity through apoptosis, inflammation, and lipid metabolic disturbances. Key targets, including P53, Mapk1, Mapk14, Casp8, Traf6, Ripk1, and Tnf, are identified, with strong binding affinities suggesting direct interactions. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses further confirms disruptions in TNF, NF-kappa B, oxidative phosphorylation, autophagy pathways, and glycerolipid metabolism. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive mechanistic framework for 6PPDQ-induced liver injury in mice and provides a new perspective for subsequent studies on the mechanism of 6PPDQ hepatotoxicity."

More recently, symptom-based drug monitoring has gained traction with the expansion of wastewater monitoring systems worldwide. However, its integration into predictive models to support public health management and its comparative value relative to viral surveillance remain underexplored. Here, we monitored ibuprofen and acetaminophen in wastewater in Beijing, China, during the COVID-19 surge and postpandemic phases. By combining antipyretic concentrations with known human excretion rates, we estimated the number of individuals with fever and incorporated this into the SEIR model (Ip-Is-Ia) that includes asymptomatic infections. Notably, there is a systematic lead of the antipyretic-based incidence compared to the SARS-CoV-2-derived incidence, indicating that the antipyretic signal leads throughout the surge period. In the postpandemic scenario with alternating prevalence of COVID-19 and influenza, the antipyretic levels reflected the population-wide infection dynamics for both diseases. As fever is an important physiological response to infection, discrepancies between antipyretic usage and molecular biosurveillance data may serve as early signals of emerging fever-inducing “Disease X”. This study highlights the potential of integrating antipyretic biomarkers into WBE to improve the early detection of outbreaks and support public health preparedness."

Traill;Tyler Rohr;Elizabeth Shadwick;Christina Schallenberg;Michael Ellwood;Andrew Bowie,Coupling Between the Subantarctic Seasonal Iron Cycle and Productivity at the Southern Ocean Time Series (SOTS),"In the Subantarctic Southern Ocean, primary productivity is predominantly limited by seasonal changes in light and iron (Fe) availability, shaping the phytoplankton community and impacting the magnitude of the biological carbon pump. However, quantifying the seasonal iron cycle is challenging, as observations of bioavailable, dissolved iron (DFe) from individual campaigns rarely span a full seasonal cycle. Here, we present a composite seasonal cycle constructed from 27 years of DFe observations at the subantarctic Southern Ocean Time Series (SOTS) south of Australia. Iron measurements are paired with time series data to explain the iron cycle contextualized to broader Southern Ocean biogeochemistry. Three distinct phases were revealed with clear coupling between iron and productivity in the first two phases. In the first phase, light limitation initially controls spring to summer primary production with shoaling of the mixed layer, accounting for around half of annual net community production (ANCP). In the second phase and remaining half of ANCP, rapid biomass increases and near‐complete drawdown of DFe drive iron limitation, evidenced by maximum fluorescence‐to‐chlorophyll ratios. A subset of this period covering a third of ANCP exhibits a mean Fe:C uptake ratio of 31.08 ± 8.88 μmol:mol. During the third phase, iron is weakly coupled to productivity as the system transitions to net heterotrophy and biomass declines despite increased Fe supply associated with the east Australian current system. Together, 27 years of continuous monitoring draws a comprehensive picture of how and when iron fuels subantarctic productivity, providing a critical baseline for model validation and continued monitoring in a rapidly changing climate."

To understand this variability, we analyzed a prominent sequence of repeating earthquakes from the latest catalog in Japan, activated following the 2011 earthquake (Mw 9.0). Waveform analysis of 53 events (2003–2023) revealed variations in magnitude from Mw 3.2 to 4.0. Their moment‐rate functions suggest they were not mere repetitions, but rather represented a more generalized form of recurrence. Their ruptures were consistently initiated in the same patch, and most events exhibited double ruptures after the Tohoku earthquake, transitioning to single ruptures over time, in a surprisingly systematic manner. A comparison with 40 smaller events (Mw 2–2.5) showed no obvious relationship between initial momentum and final magnitude.

However, the physical process of dehydration embrittlement remains unclear due to the complex and poorly constrained interactions between reaction progress, fluid pressure evolution, and deformation. Here we aim to quantify these interactions during antigorite dehydration with 2D hydro‐mechanical‐chemical numerical modeling and explore whether the reaction causes stress perturbations potentially leading to earthquakes. Negative total volume change during the reaction acts toward the relaxation of fluid overpressures, decreasing the chance of embrittlement. The reaction zone is the least likely to fracture due to reaction‐induced weakening and the locally larger increase of total pressure compared to fluid pressure. However, weakening also generates fluid overpressure zones and may induce strain localization/runaway processes potentially leading to brittle failure. Our results also imply that antigorite dehydration could be both the cause and effect of fast deformation in subducted slabs."

The network's skill depends mainly on low‐level wind in East Antarctica and atmospheric moisture in West Antarctica, suggesting that dynamic processes are comparatively more important in driving East Antarctic top snowfall days.

Here, the authors use the natural reactive oxygen species gradient in the tumour microenvironment to target delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing plasmids using reactive oxygen species responsive nanomotors for metabolic disruption and immunotherapy. 
 While gene-editing-based tumor therapy holds promise, conventional passive-diffusion vectors face limited penetration in dense solid tumors. Here, we developed a ROS-driven gene editing nanomotor (RDN@PL), which takes hemin as the core and encapsulates CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids targeting LDHA (A glycolysis key enzyme). In tumor microenvironments, RDN@PL consumes extracellular ROS to fuel self-diffusiophoresis, achieving higher intratumoral accumulation than passive particles. Upon internalization, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) degrades RDN@PL, releasing CO and plasmids. LDHA knockout suppresses glycolysis while CO elevates mitochondrial ROS, which triggers apoptosis by disrupting metabolism and enhancing immunity. Simultaneously, extracellular ROS depletion by non-internalized nanomotors reverses immunogenic cell death (ICD) inhibition, enhancing CD8+ T cell infiltration in tumor. The Janus nanomotor enables extracellular ROS scavenging and intracellular ROS increment via HO-1-responsive cargo release and gene editing. This multi-level intervention strategy demonstrates 93.9 % tumor growth suppression in solid tumor models, providing a blueprint for engineering intelligent nanovesicles in precision oncology.

Here, the authors report a radical-mediated synthesis of alkyl fluorides via decarboxylative-desulfonylative gem-difunctionalization under photochemical conditions. 
 Fluorine-containing compounds hold pivotal importance in life sciences. Recent decades have witnessed significant research efforts toward developing practical fluorination methods. Radical-mediated decarboxylative fluorination has proven to be a robust approach for incorporating diverse monofluoroalkyl groups. Here we show a radical-mediated modular synthesis of alkyl fluorides through a decarboxylative-desulfonylative gem-difunctionalization under mild photochemical conditions. The multi-component reaction proceeds in a controlled sequence of radical decarboxylation and heteroaryl migration, governed by radical polarity and kinetic effects, resulting in a wide range of valuable alkyl fluorides. Two C-C bonds and one C-F bond are concurrently formed throughout the process. Both styrenes and aliphatic alkenes serve as suitable substrates for this transformation. Furthermore, this method can be applied to the incorporation of a monofluoroalkyl moiety into complex alkene molecules at a late stage.

 Forecasting catastrophic failures that threaten life and property remains a formidable challenge. A major hurdle lies in the intermittent rupture dynamics of heterogeneous materials. This erratic pattern challenges conventional time-to-failure predictive models, which typically assume a smooth, monotonic power law acceleration. Here, we propose a unified failure model based on a log-periodic power law that encapsulates the intermittent acceleration-deceleration sequences within a single framework. We validate this unified model using a global dataset of 109 historical geohazard events including landslides, rockbursts, glacier breakoffs, and volcanic eruptions, spanning a century and across seven continents. We show that our model significantly outperforms the conventional approach, offering a robust and versatile framework for describing the complex rupture behavior of diverse geomaterials such as rock, soil, and ice at the site scale. This unified perspective not only broadens the model’s applicability across diverse geohazards but also highlights its potential to enhance early warning systems.

 The response of the hyperarid Pacific coast of South America to greenhouse warming remains highly uncertain but has profound implications for the future habitability of the region. Here, we present the first paleobotanical study documenting the Peruvian Desert’s response to the Late Miocene greenhouse climate, when radiative forcing was comparable to 21st century projections. Fossil leaves, wood, and pollen from the Pisco Formation lagerstätte indicate a diverse dry forest biome where an absolute desert is observed today. Rainfall at 8–6 Ma is estimated to have been three times higher than today, possibly due to a warmer Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean or to more frequent El Niño events. Our results suggest that the impacts of tropical climate dynamical changes on ecosystems of the Pacific South American coast under greenhouse warming conditions may outweigh those of heat and evaporation, potentially enabling vegetation expansion, biome transformations, and enhanced habitability in this region.

 Mass loss from ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica has quadrupled since the 1990s and now represents the dominant source of global mean sea-level rise from the cryosphere. This has raised concerns about their future stability and focussed attention on the global mean temperature thresholds that might trigger more rapid retreat or even collapse, with renewed calls to meet the more ambitious target of the Paris Climate Agreement and limit warming to +1.5 °C above pre-industrial. Here we synthesise multiple lines of evidence to show that +1.5 °C is too high and that even current climate forcing (+1.2 °C), if sustained, is likely to generate several metres of sea-level rise over the coming centuries, causing extensive loss and damage to coastal populations and challenging the implementation of adaptation measures. To avoid this requires a global mean temperature that is cooler than present and which we hypothesise to be closer to +1 °C above pre-industrial, possibly even lower, but further work is urgently required to more precisely determine a ‘safe limit’ for ice sheets.

 In this study, 8 nitro-PAHs (nPAHs) and 10 oxy-PAHs (oPAHs) were analyzed in the PM 2.5 samples collected from four sites of Northeast Asia during the winter season to evaluate their spatial distribution. The total mean concentrations of nPAHs and oPAHs were extremely high in Ulaanbaatar (UB) as 318.80 ± 176.35 ng/m3. In Beijing (BJ), Seoul (SE), and Seosan (SS), the concentrations were similar at 25.59 ± 13.25 ng/m3, 15.51 ± 3.12 ng/m3, and 25.14 ± 21.98 ng/m3, respectively. oPAHs concentrations were higher than nPAHs at all sampling sites, being 107 times higher in UB and approximately 22 times higher at the other three sites. The distribution of individual compounds were similar in BJ, SE, and SS, while, UB showed distinct characteristics. To assess which factor is more significant between the primary emission and secondary formation of nPAHs and oPAHs, correlation and PMF analyses with the other air pollutants were conducted. Although the main factor for determining of nPAHs and oPAHs was different by location, secondary formation (54.5 %) and vehicle exhaust (34.3 %) were the main factors to occur nPAHs in the atmosphere, while oPAHs were mainly determined by solid coal combustion (44.2 %) and vehicle exhaust (39.1 %). In particular, secondary formation by heterogeneous reaction appeared to be a significant factor for nPAHs in SE. In the Monte Carlo simulations for Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk (ILCR) assessment, males had higher average ILCR values than females, especially in the 0–1 age group. Excluding the male 0–1 age group in UB, all other groups were found to be within acceptable levels (ILCR <1.0 E−6) of carcinogenic risk.

 Assessing particle exposure in the human respiratory tract (HRT) is critical for understanding its health risks. Hygroscopicity is a key characteristic that influences particle deposition by changing particle size in the human respiratory tract. In this study, the daily deposited particle doses and rates of submicron particles in different regions of the HRT, as well as the total HRT considering hygroscopic growth, were comprehensively evaluated using the Multiple-Path Particle Dosimetry model (MPPD) and size-resolved particle hygroscopicity measurements obtained with the Volatility Hygroscopicity Tandem Differential Mobility Analyzer (VH–TDMA) in urban Beijing. Taking particle hygroscopicity into account, the deposition fractions (DFs) of particles smaller than 300 nm were 25.4 % lower than those of dry particles, while the DFs of particles larger than 300 nm increased by 23.0 %. The results indicated that the daily deposited particle number dose (DPNd), mass dose (DPMd) and surface area dose (DPSd) were predominantly deposited in the pulmonary (P) region, accounting for 53 %, 47 %, and 54 % of total respiratory tract deposition, respectively.

In contrast, accumulation mode particles were the primary contributors to both DPMd and DPSd.

 Typhoon-induced heavy rainfall can lead to severe flooding, causing significant damage to social systems. Although machine learning (ML) offers an efficient approach for typhoon rainfall forecasting, individual models often exhibit considerable uncertainty. To address this, this study proposes a robust typhoon rainfall forecasting model based on Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) with four ML models including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), K-Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) across 0–6 h lead time. The model incorporates three types of features within the typhoon impact area (radius of 400 km): typhoon characteristics, grid spatial attributes and meteorological characteristics. Typhoon characteristics of each grid are dynamically weighted to reflect the weakening typhoon impacts with increasing distance from the typhoon center. Based on these features, multiple scenarios consisting of two experiments (Input Unchanged (IU) and Rolling Forecast (RO)) paired with various input designs (ALL: all features, SHAP3: 3 most critical variables, and LAG4: 4 lagged rainfall) are designed to explore the performance of all models. Case study of 28 typhoons affecting Guangdong Province from 2020 to 2023 clearly demonstrated that the weighted typhoon wind speed contributed the most in typhoon rainfall forecasting, and the BMA approach significantly enhanced the forecast accuracy. Leveraging sufficient effective information as model inputs could significantly improve the predictive performance of individual models in long-term forecasting. This method could provide flexible and suitable scenario options for data-rich and data-scarce regions, supporting early disaster warning during typhoon-prone seasons."

 Styrene is emitted by anthropogenic sources and biomass burning and is highly reactive towards atmospheric oxidants. While it has the highest nitrate radical (NO3) reactivity among aromatic hydrocarbons, the NO3 oxidation of styrene and formation mechanisms of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) have not been investigated. In this study, we conduct chamber experiments with styrene concentrations ranging from 9.5 to 155.2 ppb. The resulting SOA yields range from 14.0 % to 22.1 % with aerosol mass loadings of 5.9–147.6 µg m−3 after wall loss corrections. The chemical composition of SOA is characterized by online measurements, revealing that dimeric organic nitrates (ONs) constitute 90.9 % of the total signal of particle-phase products. C16H16N2O8 and C8H9NO4 are identified as the major particle-phase products, which constitute 88.3 % and 4.1 %, respectively, of the measured signal. We propose formation mechanisms for the ON products, including the common RO2+ RO2 / HO2 pathway and other radical chain termination reactions such as RO + R and R + R. We also investigate the hydrolysis of particulate ONs. The hydrolysis lifetime for ONs is determined to be less than 30 min. This short hydrolysis lifetime can be attributed to the stabilization of the carbocation by delocalized π orbitals of the benzene-related skeleton of aromatic ONs. This work provides the first fundamental laboratory data to evaluate SOA production from styrene + NO3 chemistry. Additionally, the formation mechanisms of aromatic ONs are reported for the first time, highlighting that compounds previously identified as nitroaromatics in ambient field campaigns could also be attributed to aromatic ONs."

These variations, influenced by geographic, topographic and meteorological factors, reveal the water cycle's heterogeneity. 
 Hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes are widely used as tracers of the water cycle, and surface water is an integral part of the water cycle. Compared with other waterbodies, surface water is more susceptible to different natural and anthropogenic factors, and an accurate understanding of surface water changes is of great significance in ensuring regional water security, maintaining ecological balance, and promoting sustainable economic and social development. The spatial and temporal distributions of global surface water stable isotope data are extremely uneven on a global scale due to factors such as observation conditions and instrumental analysis. For this reason, we have compiled and analysed the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope data in surface water from 22 389 sampling stations worldwide from 1956 to 2023, with 102 511 data records. The results indicate the following: (1) global surface water stable isotopes are gradually depleted from the Equator to the poles and from the coast to the interior. However, there are significant differences in the spatial and temporal distributions of surface water isotopes in different regions.

 High-resolution urban climate modeling has faced substantial challenges due to the absence of a globally consistent, spatially continuous, and accurate dataset to represent the spatial heterogeneity of urban surfaces and their biophysical properties. This deficiency has long obstructed the development of urban-resolving Earth system models (ESMs) and ultra-high-resolution urban climate modeling, over large domains. Here, we present U-Surf, a first-of-its-kind 1 km resolution present-day (circa 2020) global continuous urban surface parameter dataset.

Generated using a systematically unified workflow, U-Surf ensures internal consistency among key parameters, making it the first globally coherent urban canopy surface dataset. U-Surf significantly improves the representation of the urban land heterogeneity both within and across cities globally; provides essential, high-fidelity surface biophysical constraints to urban-resolving ESMs; enables detailed city-to-city comparisons across the globe; and supports next-generation kilometer-resolution Earth system modeling across scales. U-Surf parameters can be easily converted or adapted to various types of UCMs, such as those embedded in weather and regional climate models, as well as air quality models. The fundamental urban surface constraints provided by U-Surf can also be used as features for machine learning models and can have other broad-scale applications for socioeconomic, public health, and urban planning contexts. We expect U-Surf to advance the research frontier of urban system science, climate-sensitive urban design, and coupled human–Earth systems in the future.

This paper provides a new Vs profile database for Piedmont (northwest Italy), integrating geological modelling and geophysical data and supporting similar studies in other regions. 
 Ground response analyses using a statistically representative sample of soil and rock profiles are typically used to estimate earthquake ground motions and, in turn, the seismic hazard of a particular area of study. With this aim shear-wave velocity (Vs) properties of the profiles are of paramount importance given that uncertainty in this parameter plays a major role in ground motion prediction and in its variability. Usually, stochastic procedures are adopted to model this uncertainty, and several stochastic approaches have been developed. These approaches should, however, be calibrated on detailed geological–geomorphological information and specific Vs profile databases. Within this context, the present paper aims to provide a new extensive database of Vs profiles over the Piedmont region (northwest Italy). These data are obtained through a specific workflow developed for their evaluation at the regional scale, merging the information of specific geological–geomorphological modelling and a devoted geophysical data collection.

Leaf reflectance spectroscopy offers a promising avenue to advance ecological and of robust hyperspectral models for predicting leaf photosynthetic capacity and associated traits from reflectance data has been hindered by limited data availability across species and environments. Here we introduce the Global Spectra-Trait Initiative (GSTI), a collaborative repository of paired leaf hyperspectral and gas exchange measurements from diverse ecosystems. The GSTI repository currently encompasses over 7500 observations from 397 species and 41 sites gathered from 36 published and unpublished studies, thereby offering a key resource for developing and validating hyperspectral models of leaf photosynthetic agricultural research by complementing traditional, time-consuming gas exchange measurements. However, the development capacity. The GSTI database is developed on GitHub (https://github.com/plantphys/gsti) and published to ESS-dive https://data.ess-dive.lbl.gov/datasets/doi:10.15485/2530733, Lamour et al., 2025). It includes gas exchange data, derived photosynthetic parameters, and key leaf traits often associated with traditional gas exchange measurements such as leaf mass per area and leaf elemental composition. By providing a standardized repository for data sharing and analysis, we present a critical step towards creating hyperspectral models for predicting photosynthetic traits and associated leaf traits for terrestrial plants."

Our study compiles over 500 years of historical data to identify patterns and vulnerabilities, providing key insights for improving natural risk prevention and management. This dataset helps decision-makers understand hazard risks and develop better mitigation strategies. Our approach serves as a model for other regions to enhance long-term natural risk resilience. 
 In the context of escalating climate change impacts and the heightened frequency of natural hazards, the imperative for robust multi-risk assessment and proactive mitigation strategies has become increasingly evident. Tenerife, situated in the Atlantic archipelago, encapsulates the challenges faced by communities globally, prompting a paradigm shift towards anticipatory risk management. This study presents a pioneering effort to establish a multi-hazard database for regions susceptible to be impacted by multiple natural hazards, using Tenerife (Canary Islands) as a case study, to provide a foundation for more accurate risk assessments and informed decision-making. Our methodology involved the systematic collection and analysis of over 500 years of historical data (https://doi.org/10.20350/digitalCSIC/17088) on volcanic activity, earthquakes, floods, landslides, and extreme weather events, allowing us to identify patterns, vulnerabilities, and effective resilience measures. In this sense, our holistic approach aims to empower stakeholders with a nuanced understanding of natural processes. The database reveals key patterns in hazard occurrence and impacts, such as the frequent and damaging floods linked to heavy rainfall and ravine overflows. It also highlights the increasing frequency and severity of these events in recent decades, underscoring the urgent need for improved management practices. Other hazards, like rock falls and landslides, though less common, pose significant risks in areas affected by human activities. Key recommendations include the implementation of flood prevention measures such as ravine cleaning, water retention areas, and reforestation, as well as enhanced geotechnical studies and slope stabilization efforts to mitigate landslide risks. The approach outlined here is not only applicable to Tenerife but serves as a scalable model for other regions facing complex natural hazard scenarios. By leveraging historical insights alongside contemporary methodologies, this contribution aims to strengthen natural risk resilience and inform future risk mitigation strategies."

When measuring the particle sizes, however, sometimes the sampling lines that transfer the aerosol to the measurement device distort the size distribution, making the measurement unreliable. We propose a method to correct for the distortions and estimate the true particle sizes, improving measurement accuracy. 
 The particle number (PN) emissions of both light- and heavy-duty vehicles are nowadays regulated and are typically measured from a full dilution tunnel with constant volume sampling (CVS). PN measurements for research and development purposes, though, are often taken from the raw exhaust to avoid the high setup costs of CVS. There is, however, a risk with these and any other kind of PN measurements with high number concentrations, which is that physical processes such as coagulation and diffusion losses inside sampling lines can alter, sometimes dramatically, the particle size distribution and bias its measurement. In this paper, we propose a method in the Bayesian framework for inverse problems to estimate the initial, unaltered particle size distribution based on the distorted measurements. The proposed method takes into account particle morphology and van der Waals and viscous forces in the coagulation model  and  allows the incorporation of prior information on the particle size distribution and, most importantly, a systematic quantification of uncertainty. We analyze raw exhaust PN measurements of a fuel-operated auxiliary heater and find that while a typical sampling line can reduce the PN by more than 50 %, the initial particle size distribution can be feasibly estimated with reasonable computational demands. The proposed method should give more freedom for designing the measurement setup and also aid in the comparison of results obtained at different sampling locations, such as CVS and tailpipe."

Here, we measured the concentrations of DDTs in the blubber of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) (n = 128) collected from the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) during 2003–2020 and studied by an in vitro assay that used the S. chinensis skin fibroblasts to answer questions about the cytotoxicity mechanism and risks of DDTs. DDT levels in humpback dolphins exceed those reported in other marine mammal studies. As the fraction of DDEs within ∑DDTs increased, ∑DDT levels rose from 2004 to 2010, followed by a gradual decline from 2010 to 2020. Fibroblasts were treated with p,p′-DDT and their metabolites (p,p′-DDE and p,p′-DDD) and evaluated for cytotoxicity, metabolic efficiency, and oxidative stress response. In vitro cytotoxicity testing revealed that accumulation of DDTs is likely to pose adverse effects at the cellular level in 90% of the studied dolphins as their tissue concentrations exceeded EC50 values. Analyses of DDTs and their metabolites DDDs and DDEs in the cells and media indicated that a substantial amount of p,p′-DDT is metabolized into other products besides p,p′-DDE and p,p′-DDD. Furthermore, analyses of antioxidant capacity, oxidative damage, and expression of related genes indicated that p,p′-DDT exposure induced oxidative stress likely through the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway. This study deepens our understanding of the adverse effects of DDTs on dolphin health at cellular levels while also highlighting the ongoing threat that persistent environmental contaminants pose to the conservation of cetaceans."

Previously, it was believed that naturally abundant Mn oxides originated through biotically mediated processes. However, we have revealed the significance of photochemically induced abiotic oxidation of Mn2+(aq) to Mn(IV) oxides. This study further elucidates the photochemically induced co-oxidation of aqueous Mn2+ and cobalt (Co2+), which leads to the predominant formation of Mn(IV)–Co(III) oxide nanosheets. Both pair distribution function analysis and X-ray absorption spectra provide evidence that Co2+ is mainly oxidized to Co(III) within the plane of the Mn oxide structure, where it forms double-edge-sharing arrangements. Additionally, the initial concentration of Co2+ greatly influences the extent of Co incorporation within the final Mn–Co oxides and Mn oxidation states. Increased Co incorporation correlates with a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies within the Mn oxide structures, which reduces their band gap and significantly influences the reactivity of Mn oxides, governing their ability to participate in pollutant degradation and redox transformations. This study advances our understanding of the mechanism of formation of Co-incorporated Mn oxides in the natural environment and provides insights into their occurrence in the natural environment and their applications in environmental processes."

Riverine Sr isotopes play a crucial role in identifying the link between continental weathering and the nearby ocean. This study reported spatial variations of Sr data from LCR during the flood season, and Sr isotopes were coupled with hydrochemical data based on a Bayesian model to assess solute sources. Results showed that carbonate weathering was the predominant contributor to riverine dissolved Sr (contribution ratio ∼35%). Besides, halite dissolution, silicate weathering, and groundwater contributed 28, 16, and 12% of dissolved Sr, respectively. The chemical weathering rate of LCR was relatively high, and the level of CO2 consumption doubled within a decade, indicating potential regional climate change. Flux estimations revealed that 42.9 tons of 87Sr were introduced to the Mekong River annually, eventually reaching the Pacific Ocean. Silicate-derived Sr accounted for 38% of this flux, exerting a significant influence on seawater Sr-isotopic composition. Dam construction and a warming climate with accelerated snow melting (headwater area) and increased precipitation may enhance the suitability of chemical weathering.

However, the fate of BPAF in soil is still obscure. Here, we used [ring-U-14C]-labeled BPAF to investigate its fate in three agricultural soils for 240 days, based on a four-compartment fate model. BPAF dissipated in the soils with a half-life of 35–110 days, accompanied by low mineralization (8.5–11.3% of the initial radioactivity). The main fate of BPAF in the soils was formation of nonextractable residues (NERs) (44.2–65.3%), mostly (>90%) via physicochemical sequestration (31.2–42.7%) and ester bonds (10.0–22.6%). Notably, the sequestered free BPAF in the NERs increased the half-life by 1.4–2.5 times. Six transformation products (TPs) were identified, including BPAF mono- and dimethyl ethers, monosulfate ester, and three single-ring monophenolic compounds. BPAF monomethyl ether was the predominant extractable TP, while the polar TPs were the predominant physico-chemically sequestered and ester-linked TPs in the NERs. Three transformation pathways for BPAF in the soils are proposed, including type II ipso-substitution, O-methylation, and sulfate conjugation.

This study developed a novel urea electro-assisted forward osmosis (UEFO) system to recover urea from source-separated urine, aiming to enhance urea recovery efficiency and suppress urea hydrolysis through the synergistic interaction between the electric field and FO. The UEFO leveraged the application of an electric field to facilitate ion migration and in situ OH– generation, enabling dynamic regulation of the osmotic pressure difference. This enhanced the urea recovery and stabilized alkaline conditions. Compared with the open-circuit system, the UEFO significantly improved urea recovery efficiency and transport kinetics. Meanwhile, the UEFO significantly enhanced the alkalinity of the feed solution through the in situ OH– generation, thereby reducing urease activity by 34.73%. Additionally, partial least squares path modeling revealed that the electric field was the critical driving factor for urea recovery in the UEFO. Contribution distribution revealed that the electric field contributed 59.41% to urea recovery and 79.29% to hydrolysis inhibition, highlighting its key role as the core driving force in UEFO. Mechanistic exploration revealed that the electric field dynamically regulated the osmotic pressure difference across the FO membrane by modulating ion migration and the chemical environment, thereby promoting efficient urea migration and inhibiting its hydrolysis. Furthermore, an economic assessment demonstrated that the use of UEFO could generate a net profit of $0.34 per ton of urine treated, achieving a positive economic return.

Characterizations and theoretical calculations unveiled that the urea-nonstoichiometric modulation method optimized the specific surface area and geometrical structure of perovskite, promoted the formation of La defects and oxygen vacancies (OVs), enhanced lattice oxygen activation and migration, and also facilitated the coadsorption of NO and O2 and increased the d-band center of the perovskite. The synergistic activation of lattice oxygen and molecular oxygen along with the low-temperature oxidation mechanisms of NO was finally revealed: the comodulation strategy caused stretching and distortion of the 2U-L0.8MO lattice, making its lattice oxygen susceptible to activation, thereby oxidizing adsorbed NO to NO2 and simultaneously generating OVs. Afterward, O2 would be captured by the abundant OVs on the 2U-L0.8MO surface and converted to superoxide O2–, which could not only directly oxidize NO but also transform into single 1O2 on the adjacent Mn4+ site for the targeted oxidation of NO.

Microbial community analyses, including taxonomic profiling and metagenomic analysis, demonstrated that Ti-based pre-coagulation reduced the dominance of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS)-secreting genera, such as Sphingopyxis, while promoting Terrimonas and Paenarthrobacter, with acid-tolerance traits and reduced EPS production.

Here we present an innovative method for assessing single and compound extremes using a high‐resolution regional model of the Northeastern Pacific Ocean. We use an unsupervised clustering approach to identify regions with similar habitat characteristics near the seafloor, define extreme thresholds seasonally using a fixed baseline (1996–2020) within each cluster, and quantify the fraction of ocean waters that exceed these thresholds for both single and compound stressors. Compound extremes (most commonly of O2 ${\mathrm{O}}_{2}$ and acidification) are rare but show an increasing trend in some clusters.

We have therefore adapted Google's GraphCast framework for limited‐area, storm‐scale domains, then trained on archived forecasts from the Warn‐on‐Forecast System (WoFS), a convection‐allowing ensemble with 5‐min forecast output. We evaluate the WoFSCast predictions using object‐based verification, grid‐based verification, spatial storm structure assessments, and spectra analysis. The WoFSCast closely emulates the WoFS environment fields, matches 70%–80% of WoFS storms out to 2‐hr forecast times, and suffers only modest blurring.

This led to progressive depletion of soil moisture to a critical threshold that shifted the originally weak response of air temperature into hypersensitive mode. The resulting rapid rise of air temperature amplified atmospheric evaporative demand to an unprecedentedly high level, which in turn exacerbated the drying‐out of soil and vegetation.

 Close-in companion stars are expected to adversely influence the formation and orbital stability of circumstellar (S-type) planets by tidally truncating protoplanetary discs1–4, impeding mutual accretion of planetesimals5–8 and narrowing dynamically stable regions9. This explains the observed dearth of S-type planets in tight binary star systems10–13. ν Octantis, whose stellar components have a mean separation of 2.6 au, has long been suspected of hosting a circum-primary planet in a retrograde and exceptionally wide orbit that resides midway between the stars14–20. Strong theoretical grounds against its formation and the absence of observational precedents, however, have challenged the reality of the planet. Here we present new radial velocity measurements that consolidate the planet hypothesis. Stable fits to all radial velocity data require the planetary orbit to be retrograde and practically coplanar. We also report the critical discovery from adaptive optics imaging that the companion star is a white dwarf. Our exploration of credible primordial binary orbital settings shows that the minimum separation between the stars was 1.3 au initially, which overlaps the current planetary orbit and makes any scenarios in which the circum-primary planetary orbit formed coevally with the young stars hardly conceivable. The retrograde planet must have originated from a circumbinary orbit or a second-generation protoplanetary disc, showing the role of binary stellar evolution in the formation and evolution of planetary systems.

 Current approaches used to track stem cell clones through differentiation require genetic engineering1,2 or rely on sparse somatic DNA variants3,4, which limits their wide application. Here we discover that DNA methylation of a subset of CpG sites reflects cellular differentiation, whereas another subset undergoes stochastic epimutations and can serve as digital barcodes of clonal identity. We demonstrate that targeted single-cell profiling of DNA methylation5 at single-CpG resolution can accurately extract both layers of information. To that end, we develop EPI-Clone, a method for transgene-free lineage tracing at scale. Applied to mouse and human haematopoiesis, we capture hundreds of clonal differentiation trajectories across tens of individuals and 230,358 single cells. In mouse ageing, we demonstrate that myeloid bias and low output of old haematopoietic stem cells6 are restricted to a small number of expanded clones, whereas many functionally young-like clones persist in old age. In human ageing, clones with and without known driver mutations of clonal haematopoieis7 are part of a spectrum of age-related clonal expansions that display similar lineage biases.

 Spatial RNA organization has a pivotal role in diverse cellular processes and diseases1–4. However, functional implications of the spatial transcriptome remain largely unexplored due to limited technologies for perturbing endogenous RNA within specific subcellular regions1,5. Here we present CRISPR-mediated transcriptome organization (CRISPR-TO), a system that harnesses RNA-guided, nuclease-dead dCas13 for programmable control of endogenous RNA localization in live cells. CRISPR-TO enables targeted localization of endogenous RNAs to diverse subcellular compartments, including the outer mitochondrial membrane, p-bodies, stress granules, telomeres and nuclear stress bodies, across various cell types. It allows for inducible and reversible bidirectional RNA transport along microtubules via motor proteins, facilitating real-time manipulation and monitoring of RNA localization dynamics in living cells. In primary cortical neurons, we demonstrate that repositioned mRNAs undergo local translation along neurites and at neurite tips, and co-transport with ribosomes, with β-actin mRNA localization enhancing the formation of dynamic filopodial protrusions and inhibiting axonal regeneration. CRISPR-TO-enabled screening in primary neurons identifies Stmn2 mRNA localization as a driver of neurite outgrowth. By enabling large-scale perturbation of the spatial transcriptome, CRISPR-TO bridges a critical gap left by sequencing and imaging technologies, offering a versatile platform for high-throughput functional interrogation of RNA localization in living cells and organisms.

 Bar structures are present in about half of local disk galaxies1 and play pivotal roles in secular galaxy evolution. Bars impose a non-axisymmetric perturbation on the rotating disk and transport gas inwards to feed the central starburst and, possibly, the activity of the nuclear supermassive black hole2. They are believed to be long-lived structures3,4 and are now identified at redshift z > 2 (refs. 5,6). However, little is known about the onset and effects of bars in the early cosmic epoch because the spectroscopy of distant bars at sufficient resolution is prohibitively expensive. Here we report on a kinematic study of a galactic bar at redshift 2.467, 2.6 billion years after the Big Bang. We observed the carbon monoxide and atomic carbon emission lines of the dusty star-forming galaxy J0107a and found the bar of J0107a has gas distribution and motion in a pattern identical to local bars7–9. At the same time, the bar drives large-scale non-circular motions that dominate over disk rotation, funnelling molecular gas into its centre at a rate of approximately 600 solar masses per year. Our results show that bar-driven dynamical processes and secular evolution were already at play 11.1 billion years ago, powering active star formation amid the gas-rich and far-infrared luminous growth phase in a massive disk galaxy.

 Quasars, powered by gas accretion onto supermassive black holes1,2, rank among the most energetic objects in the Universe3,4. Although they are thought to be ignited by galaxy mergers5–11 and affect the surrounding gas12–15, observational constraints on both processes remain scarce16–18. Here we describe a major merging system at redshift z ≈ 2.7 and demonstrate that radiation from the quasar in one galaxy directly alters the gas properties in the other galaxy. Our findings reveal that the galaxies, with centroids separated by only a few kiloparsecs and approaching each other at a speed of approximately 550 km s−1, are massive, are forming stars and contain a substantial molecular mass. Yet, dusty molecular gas seen in absorption against the quasar nucleus is highly excited and confined within cloudlets with densities of approximately 105 to 106 cm−3 and sizes of less than 0.02 pc, several orders of magnitude more compact than those observed in intervening (non-quasar) environments. This is also approximately 105 times smaller than currently resolvable through molecular-line emission at high redshifts. We infer that, wherever it is exposed to the quasar radiation, the molecular gas is disrupted, leaving behind surviving dense clouds too small to give birth to new stars. Our results not only underscore the role of major galaxy mergers in triggering quasar activity but also reveal localized negative feedback as a profound alteration of the internal gas structure, which probably hampers star formation. We demonstrate that in a major merging system, radiation from the quasar in one galaxy directly alters the gas properties in the companion galaxy."

 Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain cancer and shows minimal response to therapies. The immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment in glioblastoma contributes to the limited therapeutic response. Astrocytes are abundant in the central nervous system and have important immunoregulatory roles. However, little is known about their role in the immune response to glioblastoma1. Here we used single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing of clinical glioblastoma samples and samples from preclinical models, multiplexed immunofluorescence, in vivo CRISPR-based cell-specific genetic perturbations and in vitro mouse and human experimental systems to address this gap in knowledge. We identified an astrocyte subset that limits tumour immunity by inducing T cell apoptosis through the death receptor ligand TRAIL. Moreover, we identified that IL-11 produced by tumour cells is a driver of STAT3-dependent TRAIL expression in astrocytes. Astrocyte signalling through STAT3 and TRAIL expression were associated with a shorter time to recurrence and overall decreased survival in patients with glioblastoma. Genetic inactivation of the IL-11 receptor or TRAIL in astrocytes extended survival in mouse models of glioblastoma and enhanced T cell and macrophage responses. Finally, treatment with an oncolytic HSV-1 virus engineered to express a TRAIL-blocking single-chain antibody in the tumour microenvironment extended survival and enhanced tumour-specific immunity in preclinical models of glioblastoma. In summary, we establish that IL-11–STAT3-driven astrocytes suppress glioblastoma-specific protective immunity by inducing TRAIL-dependent T cell apoptosis, and engineered therapeutic viruses can be used to target this mechanism of astrocyte-driven tumour immunoevasion. A population of TRAIL-positive astrocytes in glioblastoma contributes to an immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment and this mechanism can be targeted with an engineered oncolytic virus to improve outcomes."

 Skeletal editing comprises the structural reorganization of compounds. Such editing can be achieved through atom swapping, atom insertion, atom deletion or reorganization of the compound’s backbone structure1,2. Conducted at a late stage in drug development campaigns, skeletal editing enables diversification of an existing pharmacophore, enhancing the efficiency of drug development. Instead of constructing a heteroarene classically from basic building blocks, structural variants are readily accessible directly starting from a lead compound or approved pharmacophore. Here we present C to N atom swapping in indoles at the C2 position to give indazoles through oxidative cleavage of the indole heteroarene core and subsequent ring closure. Reactions proceed through ring-opened oximes as intermediates. These ring deconstructed intermediates can also be diverted into benzimidazoles resulting in an overall C to N atom swapping with concomitant skeletal reorganization. The same structural diverting strategies are equally well applicable to benzofurans leading to either benzisoxazoles or benzoxazoles.

Here we report that human SLC35B1 does not bind nucleotide sugars but indeed executes strict ATP/ADP exchange with uptake kinetics consistent with the import of ATP into crude ER microsomes. A CRISPR–Cas9 cell-line knockout demonstrated that SLC35B1 clusters with the most essential SLC transporters for cell growth, consistent with its proposed physiological function. We have further determined seven cryogenic electron microscopy structures of human SLC35B1 in complex with an Fv fragment and either bound to an ATP analogue or ADP in all major conformations of the transport cycle. We observed that nucleotides were vertically repositioned up to approximately 6.5 Å during translocation while retaining key interactions with a flexible substrate-binding site. We conclude that SLC35B1 operates by a stepwise ATP translocation mechanism, which is a previously undescribed model for substrate translocation by an SLC transporter. SLC35B1, initially thought to be a nucleotide sugar transporter, is an essential ATP/ADP exchanger that imports ATP into the endoplasmic reticulum through a unique stepwise translocation mechanism."

 Cell heterogeneity is a universal feature of life. Although biological processes affected by cell-to-cell variation are manifold, from developmental plasticity to tumour heterogeneity and differential drug responses, the sources of cell heterogeneity remain largely unclear1,2. Mutational and epigenetic signatures from cancer (epi)genomics are powerful for deducing processes that shaped cancer genome evolution3–5. However, retrospective analyses face difficulties in resolving how cellular heterogeneity emerges and is propagated to subsequent cell generations. Here, we used multigenerational single-cell tracking based on endogenously labelled proteins and custom-designed computational tools to elucidate how oncogenic perturbations induce sister cell asymmetry and phenotypic heterogeneity. Dual CRISPR-based genome editing enabled simultaneous tracking of DNA replication patterns and heritable endogenous DNA lesions. Cell lineage trees of up to four generations were tracked in asynchronously growing cells, and time-resolved lineage analyses were combined with end-point measurements of cell cycle and DNA damage markers through iterative staining. Besides revealing replication and repair dynamics, damage inheritance and emergence of sister cell heterogeneity across multiple cell generations, through combination with single-cell transcriptomics, we delineate how common oncogenic events trigger multiple routes towards polyploidization with distinct outcomes for genome integrity. Our study provides a framework to dissect phenotypic plasticity at the single-cell level and sheds light onto cellular processes that may resemble early events during cancer development.

 The isotopic composition of lavas associated with mantle plumes has previously been interpreted in the light of core–mantle interaction, suggesting that mantle plumes may transport core material to Earth’s surface1–5. However, a definitive fingerprint of Earth’s core in the mantle remains unconfirmed. Precious metals, such as ruthenium (Ru), are highly concentrated in the metallic core but extremely depleted in the silicate mantle. Recently discovered mass-independent Ru isotope variations (ε100Ru) in ancient rocks show that the Ru isotope composition of accreted material changed during later stages of Earth’s growth6, indicating that the core and mantle must have different Ru isotope compositions. This illustrates the potential of Ru isotopes as a new tracer for core–mantle interaction. Here we report Ru isotope anomalies for ocean island basalts. Basalts from Hawaii have higher ε100Ru than the ambient mantle. Combined with unradiogenic tungsten (W) isotope ratios, this is diagnostic of a core contribution to their mantle sources. The combined Ru and W isotope systematics of Hawaiian basalts are best explained by simple core entrainment but addition of core-derived oxide minerals at the core–mantle boundary is a possibility.

 Every generation, the human genome is shuffled during meiosis and a single fertilized egg gives rise to all of the cells of the body1. Meiotic errors leading to chromosomal abnormalities are known causes of pregnancy loss2,3, but genetic aetiologies of euploid pregnancy loss remain largely unexplained4. Here we characterize sequence diversity in early pregnancy loss through whole-genome sequencing of 1,007 fetal samples and 934 parental samples from 467 trios affected by pregnancy loss (fetus, mother and father). Sequenced parental genomes enabled us to determine both the parental and meiotic origins of chromosomal abnormalities, detected in half of our set. It further enabled us to assess de novo mutations on both homologous chromosomes from parents transmitting extra chromosomes, and date them, revealing that 6.6% of maternal mutations occurred before sister chromatid formation in fetal oocytes. We find a similar number of de novo mutations in the trios affected by pregnancy loss as in 9,651 adult trios, but three times the number of pathogenic small (<50 bp) sequence variant genotypes in the loss cases compared with adults. Overall, our findings indicate that around 1 in 136 pregnancies is lost due to a pathogenic small sequence variant genotype in the fetus.

 To grow at distant sites, metastatic cells must overcome major challenges posed by the unique cellular and metabolic composition of secondary organs1. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease that metastasizes to the liver and lungs. Despite evidence of metabolic reprogramming away from the primary site, the key drivers that dictate the ability of PDAC cells to colonize the liver or lungs and survive there remain undefined. Here we identified PCSK9 as predictive of liver versus lung colonization by integrating metastatic tropism data of human PDAC cell lines2, in vivo metastasis modelling in mice and gene expression correlation analysis. PCSK9 negatively regulates low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol import and, accordingly, PCSK9-low PDAC cells preferentially colonize LDL-rich liver tissue. LDL-cholesterol taken up by liver-avid PCSK9-low cells supports activation of pro-growth mTORC1 activation at the lysosome, and through conversion into the signalling oxysterol, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, reprogrammes the microenvironment to release nutrients from neighbouring hepatocytes. Conversely, PCSK9-high, lung-avid PDAC cells rely on transcriptional upregulation of the distal cholesterol synthesis pathway to generate intermediates—7-dehydrocholesterol and 7-dehydrodesmosterol—with protective action against ferroptosis, a vulnerability in the oxygen-rich microenvironment of the lung. Increasing the amount of PCSK9 redirected liver-avid cells to the lung whereas ablating PCSK9 drove lung-avid cells to the liver, thereby establishing PCSK9 as necessary and sufficient for secondary organ site preference. Our studies reveal PCSK9-driven differential utilization of the distal cholesterol synthesis pathway as a key and potentially actionable driver of metastatic growth in PDAC.

 The amputation of a salamander limb triggers anterior and posterior connective tissue cells to form distinct signalling centres that together fuel regeneration1. Anterior and posterior identities are established during development and are thought to persist for the whole life in the form of positional memory2. However, the molecular basis of positional memory and whether positional memory can be altered remain unknown. Here, we identify a positive-feedback loop that is responsible for posterior identity in the limb of an axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum). Posterior cells express residual Hand2 transcription factor from development, and this primes them to form a Shh signalling centre after limb amputation. During regeneration, Shh signalling is also upstream of Hand2 expression. After regeneration, Shh is shut down but Hand2 is sustained, safeguarding posterior memory. We used this regeneration circuitry to convert anterior cells to a posterior-cell memory state. Transient exposure of anterior cells to Shh during regeneration kick-started an ectopic Hand2–Shh loop, leading to stable Hand2 expression and lasting competence to express Shh. Our results implicate positive-feedback in the stability of positional memory and reveal that positional memory is reprogrammed more easily in one direction (anterior to posterior) than in the other. Modifying positional memory in regenerative cells changes their signalling outputs, which has implications for tissue engineering.

 Unique phosphorylation ‘barcodes’ installed in different regions of an active seven-transmembrane receptor by different G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases (GRKs) have been proposed to promote distinct cellular outcomes1, but it is unclear whether or how arrestins differentially engage these barcodes. Here, to address this, we developed an antigen-binding fragment (Fab7) that recognizes both active arrestin2 (β-arrestin1) and arrestin3 (β-arrestin2) without interacting with bound receptor polypeptides. We used Fab7 to determine the structures of both arrestins in complex with atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3) phosphorylated in different regions of its C-terminal tail by either GRK2 or GRK5 (ref. 2). The GRK2-phosphorylated ACKR3 resulted in more heterogeneous ‘tail-mode’ assemblies, whereas phosphorylation by GRK5 resulted in more rigid ‘ACKR3-adjacent’ assemblies. Unexpectedly, the finger loops of both arrestins engaged the micelle surface rather than the receptor intracellular pocket, with arrestin3 being more dynamic, partly because of its lack of a membrane-anchoring motif. Thus, both the region of the barcode and the arrestin isoform involved can alter the structure and dynamics of GPCR–arrestin complexes, providing a possible mechanistic basis for unique downstream cellular effects, such as the efficiency of chemokine scavenging and the robustness of arrestin binding in ACKR3. Different phosphorylation patterns created by GRK2 and GRK5 on the C-terminal tail of ACKR3 lead to distinct structural arrangements and dynamics of G-protein-coupled receptor–arrestin complexes, potentially explaining diverse cellular outcomes."

 The decline in malaria deaths has recently stalled owing to several factors, including the widespread resistance of Anopheles vectors to the insecticides used in long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs)1,2. One way to mitigate insecticide resistance is to directly kill parasites during their mosquito-stage of development by incorporating antiparasitic compounds into LLINs. This strategy can prevent onward parasite transmission even when insecticides lose efficacy3,4. Here, we performed an in vivo screen of compounds against the mosquito stages of Plasmodium falciparum development. Of the 81 compounds tested, which spanned 28 distinct modes of action, 22 were active against early parasite stages in the mosquito midgut lumen, which in turn prevented establishment of infection. Medicinal chemistry was then used to improve antiparasitic activity of the top hits from the screen. We generated several endochin-like quinolones (ELQs) that inhibited the P. falciparum cytochrome bc1 complex (CytB). Two lead compounds that targeted separate sites in CytB (Qo and Qi) showed potent, long-lasting and stable activity when incorporated and/or extruded into bed net-like polyethylene films. ELQ activity was fully preserved in insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, and parasites resistant to these compounds had impaired development at the mosquito stage. These data demonstrate the promise of incorporating ELQ compounds into LLINs to counteract insecticide resistance and to reduce malaria transmission.

 The galaxy correlation function serves as a fundamental tool for studying cosmology, galaxy formation and the nature of dark matter. It is well established that more massive, redder and more compact galaxies tend to have stronger clustering in space1,2. These results can be understood in terms of galaxy formation in cold dark matter (CDM) halos of different mass and assembly history. Here we report an unexpectedly strong large-scale clustering for isolated, diffuse and blue dwarf galaxies, comparable to that seen for massive galaxy groups but much stronger than that expected from their halo mass. Our analysis indicates that the strong clustering aligns with the halo assembly bias seen in simulations3 with the standard ΛCDM cosmology only if more diffuse dwarfs formed in low-mass halos of older ages. This pattern is not reproduced by existing models of galaxy evolution in a ΛCDM framework4–6, and our finding provides clues for the search of more viable models. Our results can be explained well by assuming self-interacting dark matter7, suggesting that such a scenario should be considered seriously.

 The earliest record of tooth antecedents and the tissue dentine1,2, an early-vertebrate novelty, has been controversially represented by fragmentary Cambrian fossils identified as Anatolepis heintzi3–5. Anatolepis exoskeletons have the characteristic tubules of dentine that prompted their interpretation as the first precursors of teeth3, known as odontodes. Debates over whether Anatolepis is a legitimate vertebrate6–8 have arisen because of limitations in imaging and the lack of comparative exoskeletal tissues. Here, to resolve this controversy and understand the origin of dental tissues, we synchrotron-scanned diverse extinct and extant vertebrate and invertebrate exoskeletons. We find that the tubules of Anatolepis have been misidentified as dentine tubules and instead represent aglaspidid arthropod sensory sensilla structures9,10. Synchrotron scanning reveals that deep ultrastructural similarities between odontodes and sensory structures also extend to definitive vertebrate tissues. External odontodes of the Ordovician vertebrate Eriptychius11–13 feature large dentine tubules1 that are morphologically convergent with invertebrate sensilla. Immunofluorescence analysis shows that the external odontodes of extant chondrichthyans and teleosts retain extensive innervation suggestive of a sensory function akin to teeth14–16. These patterns of convergence and innervation reveal that dentine evolved as a sensory tissue in the exoskeleton of early vertebrates, a function retained in modern vertebrate teeth16. Middle-Ordovician fossils now represent the oldest known evidence for vertebrate dental tissues.

 One-carbon homologs are structurally-related and functionally-identical organic molecules, whose chain-lengths differ by a single methylene (–CH2–) unit1. Across many classes of molecule–including pharmaceutical agents, natural products, agrochemicals, fragrances and petroleum products–the physicochemical characteristics displayed by members of a homologous series subtly differ from one compound to another, which can impart remarkable differences to their function2. The efficient generation of homologs is, therefore, an important strategy in molecular discovery programs3,4.

Amongst applications of this process to several structurally and functionally complex molecules, we demonstrate how this practical transformation generates previously unexplored homologs of Cyclosporine-A9.

 Pyrite formation and burial in anoxic ocean environments helps to regulate the acid–base balance of the oceans. Despite its potential importance, the impact of this anoxic alkalinity production on the global carbon cycle and Earth’s long-term climate regulation has been largely overlooked. Here, using a coupled carbon–sulfur cycle model, we show that pyrite burial could drive 5–46 Tmol yr−1 of alkalinity production—up to about six times the modern background volcanic carbon flux—throughout the Phanerozoic eon. During periods of widespread oceanic anoxia (known as oceanic anoxic events), alkalinity production via pyrite burial is amplified and so becomes an important stabilizing mechanism for the climate system, counterbalancing carbon emissions from contemporaneous large igneous province volcanism. Our results indicate that the anoxia–alkalinity feedback was engaged during several of the most severe oceanic anoxic events from large igneous provinces during the past 300 Myr, and thus played a role in limiting the overall impacts of these events on the biosphere and climate. We conclude that ocean deoxygenation may provide an important negative feedback on ocean–atmosphere CO2 partitioning, helping to buffer the impacts of CO2 emission on the Earth system.

Here, the authors show that the muscle-derived factor CLCF1, which declines with age but is restored by exercise, mediates musculoskeletal benefits in aged mice. 
 Skeletal muscle undergoes many alterations with aging. However, the impact of aging on muscle’s ability to secrete myokines and its subsequent effects on the body remain largely unexplored. Here, we identify myokines that have the potential to ameliorate age-related muscle and bone decline. Notably, circulating levels of cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 (CLCF1) decrease with age, while exercise significantly upregulates CLCF1 levels in both humans and rodents. Restoring CLCF1 levels in aged male mice improves their physical performance, glucose tolerance, and mitochondrial activity. Furthermore, CLCF1 protects against age-induced bone loss by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and promoting osteoblast differentiation in aged male mice. These improvements mirror some of the effects of exercise training. Conversely, blocking CLCF1 activity significantly abolishes these beneficial effects, confirming the crucial role of CLCF1 in mediating the positive effects of exercise on muscle and bone health in male mice. These findings collectively suggest that CLCF1 may contribute to the regulation of age-associated musculoskeletal deterioration, and warrant further investigation into its potential role as a modulator of musculoskeletal health during aging. Aging impairs muscle and bone health, and exercise is known to mitigate this decline, partly through secreted factors.

 Advancements in the field of implantable neurotechnologies have enabled the integration of hundreds of microelectrodes on ultra-thin and flexible substrates. Besides implantable components, also connectors, headstages and cables have to comply with the high-count demand, resulting in a complex and compact chain with reduced line spacing and smaller safety margins. Here, we show that epicortical recordings acquired from anesthetized rat brains with a state-of-art neural acquisition system are undoubtedly compromised by crosstalk, with signal coherence maps exhibiting a strong dependency to the routing layout. A crosstalk back-correction algorithm is developed, allowing to infer on how signals would look like under a zero-crosstalk scenario. We found that signal coherence between closely routed channels effectively drops after correction, corroborating crosstalk contamination.

 Maladaptive proximal tubular (PT) epithelial cells have been implicated in progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), however the complexity of epithelial cell states within the fibrotic niche remains incompletely understood. Hence, we integrated snRNA and ATAC-seq with high-plex single-cell molecular imaging to generate a spatially-revolved multiomic atlas of human kidney disease. We demonstrate that in injured kidneys, a subset of HAVCR1+VCAM1+ PT cells acquired an inflammatory phenotype, upregulating genes encoding chemokines, pro-fibrotic and senescence-associated proteins and adhesion molecules including ICAM1. Spatial transcriptomic and multiplex-immunofluorescence determined that specifically these VCAM1+ICAM1+ inflammatory PT cells localised to the fibrotic niche. Ligand-receptor analysis highlighted paracrine signaling from inflammatory PT cells mediating leucocyte recruitment and myofibroblast activation. Loss of HNF4α and activation of NF-κβ and AP-1 transcription factors epigenetically imprinted the inflammatory phenotype. Targeting inflammatory tubular cells by administering an AP-1 inhibitor or senolytic agent ameliorated inflammation and fibrosis in murine models of kidney injury, hence these cells may be a tractable target in CKD.

The results provide potential for heatwave predictability. 
 Terrestrial heatwaves are prolonged hot weather events often resulting in widespread socioeconomic impacts. Predicting heatwaves remains challenging, partly due to limited understanding of the events’ spatial evolution and underlying mechanisms. Heatwaves were mainly examined at fixed stations, with little attention given to the fact that the center of a heatwave can move a long distance. Here, we examine the spatial propagation of terrestrial heatwaves using a complex network algorithm, and find four preferred propagation pathways of terrestrial heatwaves in the northern hemisphere. Along each preferred pathway, heatwaves evolve in two ways: propagating along the pathway or being stationary. We show that the propagating heatwave pathways are consistent with the movement of Rossby wave trains, and that both are guided by enhanced Rossby wave flux activities. The detected propagation pathways are found to provide prior knowledge for occurrences of downstream heatwaves that can be used for identifying associated precursor signals. The results shed light on the mechanisms responsible for preferred propagating heatwave pathways and provide potential predictability of terrestrial heatwaves.

 Despite critical roles in diseases, human pathways acting on strictly nuclear non-coding RNAs have been refractory to forward genetics. To enable their forward genetic discovery, we developed a single-cell approach that “Mirrors” activities of nuclear pathways with cytoplasmic fluorescence. Application of Mirror to two nuclear pathways targeting MALAT1’s 3′ end, the pathway of its maturation and the other, the degradation pathway blocked by the triple-helical Element for Nuclear Expression (ENE), identified nearly all components of three complexes: Ribonuclease P and the RNA Exosome, including nuclear DIS3, EXOSC10, and C1D, as well as the Nuclear Exosome Targeting (NEXT) complex. Additionally, Mirror identified DEAD-box helicase DDX59 associated with the genetic disorder Oral-Facial-Digital syndrome (OFD), yet lacking known substrates or roles in nuclear RNA degradation. Knockout of DDX59 exhibits stabilization of the full-length MALAT1 with a stability-compromised ENE and increases levels of 3′-extended forms of small nuclear RNAs. It also exhibits extensive retention of minor introns, including in OFD-associated genes, suggesting a mechanism for DDX59 association with OFD.

 Osteoarthritis is a common degenerative joint disease, in which mechanical overloading disrupts subchondral bone remodeling before cartilage degeneration and the osteocytes in the subchondral bone are mainly responsible for mechanosensing. However, their functional role in the early osteoarthritis is still unclear. Here we show that mechanical stress induces osteocytes in subchondral bone to secrete extracellular vesicles that accelerate cartilage metabolic dysregulation in patients with both sexes and male mice. The miR-23b-3p in extracellular vesicles promotes cartilage catabolism and inhibits anabolism by targeting OTUD4, disrupting mitophagy in chondrocytes. Inhibiting miR-23b-3p in osteocytes or chondrocytes reduces cartilage degeneration and osteoarthritis progression in male mice. Together, our findings highlight that osteocyte-derived extracellular vesicles mediate communication with chondrocytes and suggest miR-23b-3p as a potential therapeutic target for osteoarthritis. Here, the authors show that mechanical loading promotes subchondral bone osteocytes to secrete extracellular vesicles containing miR-23b-3p, which accelerates osteoarthritis progression by inhibiting mitophagy and disrupting cartilage metabolism."

 Denisova Cave in southern Siberia is the only site known to have been occupied by Denisovans, Neanderthals and modern humans. The cave consists of three chambers (Main, East and South), with the archaeological assemblages and remains of hominins, fauna and flora recovered from Main and East Chambers being the most thoroughly investigated to date. Here we report the results of analyses of the Palaeolithic artefacts, faunal remains and hominin and mammalian mitochondrial (mt) DNA recovered from renewed excavations in South Chamber. We construct a calendar-year time scale for the stratified Pleistocene deposits from optical dating of the sediments. The timing of hominin occupation and major turnovers in the mtDNA of Denisovans and large mammals largely accords with the patterns detected in Main and East Chambers. Time gaps in those sequences are partly filled by the South Chamber data and the sediment DNA record of Denisovans after 80,000 years ago is more than doubled in size. We combine the sediment dating and DNA records for all three chambers to reveal the whole-of-cave history of this unique site and the climatic conditions experienced by hominins and fauna over the past 300,000 years, including potential changes in habitat suitability for Denisovans and Neanderthals.

 Climate responses of marine organisms differ from those on land as marine species have the flexibility to move vertically. While horizontal climate velocity has been used to predict poleward range shifts, many species are not moving as expected. Incorporating shifts in depth, which have received less attention, may better explain climate responses of marine organisms. Here we assess vertical and horizontal climate velocities across 63 global large marine ecosystems and find that 77% of vertical climate velocities are negative, reflecting isotherm deepening. Vertical climate velocity is 10,000 times smaller than horizontal climate velocity, allowing organisms to maintain constant temperatures by shifting metres in depth rather than kilometres horizontally. Within three key large marine ecosystems, we find more species shifts are explained by vertical than by horizontal climate velocity. Together, our findings have implications for understanding species adaptation to change and for future accessibility of marine resources.

 The Inner Tibetan Plateau (ITP), serving as a critical component of the Asian hydrological circulation, has witnessed an increase in summer extreme precipitation events under global warming. However, the spatiotemporal characteristics and underlying mechanisms of the events remain insufficiently understood. This study identifies two distinct synoptic patterns that govern summer regional extreme precipitation events (REPEs) over the ITP from 1979 to 2020. The first pattern (REPE1, constituting 50.5% of the events) is characterized by a Rossby wave train inducing a negative-positive-negative geopotential height anomaly, accompanied by moisture convergence via southwesterlies and convective updrafts over the southeastern ITP. Conversely, the second pattern (REPE2, 49.5%) features a persistent positive-negative-positive geopotential height anomaly associated with mid-to-high latitude circulation, along with moisture convergence driven by southeasterlies and ascending motions over the southwestern ITP. Moreover, both REPE1 and REPE2 have exhibited increased frequencies post-2010, with REPE2 showing a more pronounced upward trend. The rising frequencies of REPE1 and REPE2 have contributed significantly to the increase in extreme precipitation over the ITP in recent decades."

 Winter warm spells (or winter heatwaves) are prolonged periods of anomalously high temperatures in cold seasons where hot weather typically does not occur. These off-season events challenge ecosystems and societies by triggering snowmelt-induced flooding and favoring wildfires, etc., but are yet to be understood. Here we assess the behaviors and drivers of worldwide winter warm spells, which have become more frequent and longer-lasting during 1979–2023. Net shortwave and longwave radiations induced diabatic heating predominantly contribute to temperature anomalies during winter warm spells, but their contributions exhibit contrasts between the tropics and non-tropics. Specifically, tropical winter warm spells are primarily induced by increased solar radiation, accompanied by decreased cloud cover, dried soils and atmosphere, and moisture divergence; whereas, non-tropical winter warm spells are mainly driven by enhanced downwelling longwave radiation under cloudier and wetter conditions. Our findings underscore the urgency to understand and mitigate intensifying off-season events that occur outside their typical seasons in a warming world.

 An up-to-date, detailed global urban land use map is essential for disclosing urban structures and dynamics as well as their differences across different regions. However, generating an accurate global urban land use map remains challenging due to the complex diversity of land use types and the uneven availability of data. Existing methods, which either rely solely on remote sensing imagery or treat supplementary data like point-of-interest (POI) as mandatory inputs, fail to account for regional data disparities and the complex relationships between different data modalities. In this study, we propose an urban land use mapping framework optimized with POI prompts. First, we acquire global urban Sentinel-2 imagery, POI data, and labeled LU samples from Google Earth Engine (GEE) and OpenStreetMap (OSM), and then propose a POI-Prompt Urban Land-use Mapping Network (PPUL-Net), which utilizes POI prompts to enhance classification accuracy and produce reliable predictions in those regions lacking POI data. Consequently, a global land use dataset (GULU) with a 10 m resolution in 2020 has been produced at the first time. Experimental results show that GULU has an overall accuracy of 84.59 %, demonstrating robust performance across continents. Incorporating POI data improved the accuracies for some challenging categories, such as commercial and institutional lands, by 7.32 % and 17.66 %, respectively. Additionally, using POI as prompts instead of direct pixel-level fusion with imagery increased accuracy by 2.92 %. Finally, analysis of the GULU dataset reveals that Europe and North America exhibit high land use diversity, implying mature urban structures, whereas sub-Saharan Africa and South America are predominantly characterized by residential and undeveloped areas.

 Ecological niche models (ENMs) are crucial for identifying habitat distribution patterns, understanding habitat preferences, and formulating effective conservation policies. However, accurately quantifying the three-dimensional (3D) structure of habitats, a fundamental component, presents challenges. These estimations heavily depend on the quality of original samples (presence/absence), yet reliable absence data requires prolonged and repeated observations, limiting both efficiency and accuracy. In the study, we focused on the endangered Yunnan snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti), listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. We developed an adaptive similarity-based model that introduced a “similarity” pseudo-absence sampling approach for ecological niche modeling using fine-scale (20 m) 3D environmental variables from UAV LiDAR data. This approach integrated geographic similarity with an adaptive kernel density estimation (AKDE) method to prioritize pseudo-absence data sampling and then employed three typical machine learning models (SVM, BRT, and RF) for prediction, verifying the feasibility of this approach and offering direct insights into habitat distribution and preferences. The results indicated that the AKDE method provided the best fit in measuring similarity features. Through the model, the performance of estimations exhibited improved (AUC = 0.89–0.94, TSS = 0.71–0.82, and COR = 0.69–0.79), with average increases of 7 %, 14 %, and 12 %, respectively. The RF model produced more coherent suitable habitats, identifying regions at higher elevations (3100 m–3300 m) with preferences for low understory vegetation density (2–5 m, <10 %), moderate canopy relief ratio (> 0.35), lower tree height (10 m–25 m), and sunny slopes (0.60–1). Our findings demonstrate that integrating UAV LiDAR data with ecological niche modeling, along with the improved pseudo-absence sampling approach, enhances habitat assessment and offers significant potential for advancing conservation strategies."

 Accurate and reliable prediction of leaf traits is crucial for understanding plant adaptations to environmental variation, monitoring terrestrial ecosystems, and enhancing comprehension of functional diversity and ecosystem functioning. Currently, various approaches (e.g., statistical, physical models) have been developed to estimate leaf traits through hyperspectral remote sensing and leaf spectroscopy. However, the absence of high-performing, transferable, and stable models across various domains of space, plant functional types (PFTs) and seasons hinder our ability to quantify and comprehend spatiotemporal variations in leaf traits. This study proposes robust and highly transferable models for better predicting leaf traits with hyperspectral reflectance. Initially, three datasets were assembled, pairing common leaf traits — chlorophyll (Chla+b), carotenoids (Ccar), leaf mass per area (LAM), equivalent water thickness (EWT) — with leaf spectra measurements collected across diverse geographic locations in the U.S. and Europe, PFTs, and seasons. Measurements were acquired using spectroradiometers (e.g., ASD FieldSpec 3/4/Pro and SVC HR-1024i) with integrating spheres, leaf clips, and contact probes. We then developed transfer learning-based hybrid models that incorporated the domain knowledge of radiative transfer models (RTMs) through pretraining processes and were well-constrained by fine-tuning with field measurements. Through comparison with other state-of-the-art statistical models, including partial-least squares regression (PLSR) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), as well as pure physical models, we found that the proposed transfer learning models achieved better predictive performance and higher transferability. Specifically, compared to other statistical models and pure RTMs, the transfer learning model exhibited higher coefficient of determination (R2) values with range of 0.01 to 0.79, lower normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) with range of 0.06 % to 33.25 % in model performance. Additionally, the models exhibited improved transferability, with higher R2 values range from 0.04 to 0.32, lower NRMSE range from 0.08 % to 30.81 %. The findings underscore that transfer learning models through integrating domain knowledge from RTMs and limited observations, can harness the advantages of both RTMs and statistical models and serve as a promising approach for effectively predicting leaf traits."

 This study explores the potential of spatially explicit Harvester Production Reports (HPRs) for automatic annotation of Aerial Laser Scanning (ALS) data at tree-level, enabling accurate tree species classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By integrating HPRs into the modelling process, this approach provides a practical solution for addressing challenges in remote sensing data annotation for forestry applications. The ALS data were acquired in managed Norway spruce-dominated forests in southern Sweden using a dual-wavelength system composed by two monochromatic sensors. Thus, three datasets were produced: the 905 nm miniVUX dataset (∼100 points/m2), the 1550 nm VUX dataset (∼875 points/m2), and the dual-wavelength dataset (∼975 points/m2), the last being a junction of the two first datasets. The automatic annotation was performed by matching tree records in the HPR and ALS data based on spatial proximity and height similarity, with a total of 45,516 HPR-recorded tree positions being linked to ALS-derived segments and assigned species labels based on HPR records. Then, the individual tree-level ALS point clouds were converted into 2D images from multiple viewing angles, with varying image dimensions and pixel sizes to accommodate trees of different sizes. These images served as input for CNN-based classification, enabling species identification across ALS datasets with varying spectral and spatial resolutions. The CNN models were trained and evaluated to classify trees into Norway spruce, Scots pine, Deciduous, and a “Noise” class for segmentation errors. The classification accuracy varied according to the dataset used, with the dual-wavelength dataset achieving the highest macro-F1 score (0.896), followed by the VUX dataset (0.894) and miniVUX dataset (0.835).

 Land subsidence is a significant issue in many coastal megacities, including Shanghai, where it poses risks to infrastructure and economic stability. Although numerous studies have used SAR datasets to monitor land subsidence in Shanghai, multi-decadal displacement measurements obtained from multi-sensor SAR data remain unavailable. Moreover, the contributions and variations of driving factors behind the evolution of land subsidence remain poorly understood. This study employs multi-sensor SAR fusion method and a Random Forest model, along with Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to examine subsidence evolution and assess the influence of key drivers over the past 30 years. The results show that severe subsidence has spread from central urban areas to surrounding suburban regions, particularly in the eastern coastal and southern industrial zones in Shanghai. SHAP analysis identified that evapotranspiration, sediment thickness, and groundwater extraction were the dominant factors in the early stage of subsidence, while recent groundwater management and recharge practices have significantly mitigated the subsidence rate.

 Atmospheric aging causes PAH transform into more toxic OPAH(oxygenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). However, the performance and its influencing factors of PAH to OPAH in the real-world atmosphere remains obscure. High-time resolved variations in the ratio of aging products and precursors during haze can be effective in studying aging behavior. In this study, high-time resolution PM2.5 samples were collected during five haze events in three cities. Three pairs of PAH with different molecular weights and aging products OPAH (FLU-FLUO, ANT-ANTQ, BaA-BaAQ) were selected as target compounds. Combining with the ratio characteristics of PAH and OPAH emitted from typical emission sources (residential coal combustion, biomass burning, gasoline and diesel exhaust), as well as the traditional aging indicator BeP/BaP explored the evolution patterns of aging for PAH-OPAH. Results show: 1) Varying trends are observed in PAH and OPAH at different sessions of the diurnal variation, and FLUO/FLU, ANTQ/ANT, BaAQ/BaA of haze events were 0.65–2.73, 1.16–9.28, 0.18–0.86, which were higher than the ratios of typical emission sources(0.19–0.66, 0.38–1.35, 0.02–0.17), indicating the presence of PAH consumption and OPAH formation during hazes. 2) High molecular weight (HWM) BaAQ/BaA shows significant positive correlation with BeP/BaP, and correlation weakens as the molecular weight decreases (from BaAQ/BaA to FLUO/FLU), suggesting that HWM OPAH/PAH tends to indicate the evolution of particle-phase PAH, while low molecular weight (LWM) OPAH/PAH reflects the evolution of gas-phase PAH. 3) BaA-BaAQ and ANT-ANTQ both show higher oxidation degrees during daytime than nighttime, while FLU-FLUO shows higher oxidation degrees at nighttime than daytime, showing the aging of PAH is influenced by NO3· at night and O3 during hazes. Gas-phase aging of LWM PAH is activated instantly by sources input and heterogeneous aging of HWM PAH lagged relatively, leading to sustained pollution, which is most evident during fireworks display period. This study proposes that OPAH/PAH ratio serves as a new perspective and effective means for studying aging behavior in high-time resolution haze evolution, providing practical evidence for understanding the mechanisms of atmospheric aging."

 Using radar observation data together with ERA5 reanalysis data, this study exposes the mesocyclone characteristics of supercells associated with extreme flash heavy rainfall (FHR, hourly rainfall intensity ≥50 mm) in Jiangsu Province of China during 2020–2021, and reveals their differences from other severe supercells associated with convective hazards such as hail, gales and tornadoes. The results show that most FHR supercells occur in July and August, seasonally later than hail supercells or gale supercells in this region. During the warm season, FHR supercells generally move eastward led by westerly flow since most of them appear along the north edge of the western Pacific subtropical high. Half of FHR supercell mesocyclones sustain only about 2–3 radar volume scans (12–18 min). Most extreme FHR supercells are embedded in mesoscale convective systems and are triggered at more favorable locations where more abundant moisture converges and stronger low-level vertical wind shear is produced. In comparison, the developing extreme FHR supercell generally needs more abundant moisture but not as much higher convective available potential energy or stronger vertical wind shear as hail or gale supercells. In terms of mesocyclone characteristics, tornadic supercells exhibit the strongest rotation intensity, followed by gale and hail supercells, and FHR supercells possess the weakest rotation intensity. Hail supercells have the largest storm diameter, deepest mesocyclone, and highest elevation of strongest rotation, followed by gale supercells, FHR supercells and tornadic supercells. These differences are possibly related to the distinct formation mechanisms of the various severe convective phenomena induced by supercell: hail grows in lower ambient temperature and therefore corresponds to the highest vertical extension of supercell; the majority of convective windstorms in the Yangtze-Huai River region is associated with mid-upper-level dry air entraining into the storm and triggering a strong evaporative effect; and the definition of a tornadic supercell implies that the least diameter and the strongest rotation must approach ground.

Although drought is controlled by multiple factors, few studies have comprehensively considered the multiple controlling factors' effects at different time scales. For the Haihe River Basin (northern China), we investigated trends in meteorological drought and associated meteorological and atmospheric circulation factors for 1960–2017 using Mann-Kendall tests and wavelet transform coherence (WTC) analysis. Multiple wavelet coherence analysis was used to examine the multiple factors' combined effects at different time scales. The Standard Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index, an index of drought, decreased by 0.138 per decade, and the climate became warmer and drier over the 58 years. The meteorological factors with the greatest influence on drought were relative humidity (RH), the combination of mean temperature (Tmean) and RH, and the combination of Tmean, RH, and sunshine duration. Atmospheric circulation factors most affecting drought were the Arctic Oscillation (AO), the combination of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and AO, and the combination of AO, PDO, and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Among the mixed two-factor combinations, the combination of RH and the El Niño Southern Oscillation had the largest impact on drought. The impact of meteorological on drought was greater than that of the atmospheric circulation factors. More research on teleconnections of drought signals is needed to prevent drought."

Here, we reveal a previously unidentified mechanism by which CD40L-expressing CD8+T cells induce cytotoxicity in cancer cells. In murine models, up to 50% of tumor-specific CD8+T cells expressed CD40L, and conditional CD40L ablation in CD8+T cells alone led to tumor formation. Mechanistically, CD40L+CD8+T cells can induce cell death in CD40-expressing cancer cells by triggering caspase-8 activation. We demonstrate that a gene signature for resistance to CD40 signaling–induced cell death strongly correlates with worse survival in different human cancer cohorts.

We report the transport of transition metal dichalcogenide polaritons in 2D photonic crystals that are highly versatile for tuning, mode engineering, and integration. We achieve an order-of-magnitude enhancement in transport length compared to bare excitons and reveal transport dependence on polariton dispersion and population dynamics, which are controlled via photonic crystal design and pump intensity. Stimulated relaxation observed in the system suggests the potential for forming superfluid polaritons with frictionless transport.

The mechanism by which dynamic chromatin exploration by variant PRC1 complexes couples to ubiquitin writing is unknown. Here, we developed a single-molecule approach to directly observe chromatin interactions and ubiquitylation by PRC1. We find that variant PRC1 transiently samples chromatin until it reaches a catalytically competent nucleosome-bound state, resulting in E2 recruitment and ubiquitin transfer. Variant PRC1 is weakly processive in ubiquitylating neighboring nucleosomes. Moreover, activity differences between PRC1 subtypes, containing either a PCGF1 or PCGF4 subunit, result from distinct probabilities of achieving a catalytically competent state. Our results thus demonstrate that the dynamic formation of an active complex between variant PRC1, E2, and chromatin is the critical determinant of subtype-specific variant PRC1 activity."

In nonplume environments, carbonatite melts are progressively consumed until fully frozen as reduced carbon. Attachment of these materials to the cratonic keel further enhances craton stability.

However, methionine-selective modification remains one of the most difficult challenges in peptide chemistry, with notable limited strategies. In this study, we report a general reversible modification strategy at methionine sites that uses the ruthenium-catalyzed sulfimidation of peptides. This method provides a convenient and effective strategy for late-stage peptide functionalization. The N═S bonds of the conjugates are reduced in the presence of glutathione, resulting the traceless releasing of corresponding peptides and amides. Practical applications are then demonstrated using precise reversible modifications of bioactive peptides, the stapling and linearization of peptides, peptide-drug conjugates, and split-and-pool synthesis. This on/off strategy through methionine-selective and reversible sulfimidation provides a unique tool for peptide chemistry and peptide-based drug discovery."

Here, we report that selecting for dicentric recombinants through male crosses uncovers stabilized chromosome 4 fission events, which split it into 4a-4b complementary chromosome pairs, where 4a carries a native centromere and 4b carries a synthetic one. The cells rapidly stabilized chromosome ends by de novo telomere formation, and the new centromeres spread among genes without altering their expression. When both 4a and 4b chromosomes were made homozygous, they segregated through meiosis indistinguishably from wild type and gave rise to healthy plants with normal seed set, indicating that the synthetic centromere was fully functional. This work leverages synthetic centromeres to engineer chromosome fission, raising the diploid chromosome number of maize from 20 to 22."

We measured the length of 134 wild clown anemonefish every month and monitored temperature at the scale of their anemone for five lunar months. Our results show that clown anemonefish shrink in response to heat stress and individuals that shrink also display relatively more catch-up growth. Further, shrinking is modulated by social rank and size, and individuals that shrink more often and in a coordinated fashion with their breeding partner have higher survival during the heat stress event. In conclusion, a plastic individual growth response to heat stress, constrained by the social environment, can lead to short-term survival benefits.

However, none of the current commensuration approaches are suitable for addressing the current climatic effect of mire ecosystems as compared to the situation in which such mires would not exist. The mire ecosystems have accumulated carbon for millennia, creating a negative perturbation to the atmospheric carbon dioxide content, but at the same time they emit methane into the atmosphere. Thus, the functioning of mires involves GHG fluxes with opposing effects on Earth’s radiative balance. Here, based on a simple radiative forcing (RF) model, we propose a new metric for commensuration of the effects of accumulated carbon and methane emission (ACME) on Earth’s energy balance. This ACME approach is applicable to natural mires with a significant part of their carbon accumulated more than 1000 years ago and requires relatively few input data. We demonstrate the feasibility of the ACME approach by applying it to a set of northern mires. The ACME-based RF estimate indicates that these mires have a cooling effect on the current climate, contrary to what a global warming potential-based calculation suggests, since the climatic effect is dominated by the sustained carbon accumulation. By applying the new metric with varying estimates of the total carbon storage and methane emission of northern mires, we estimate the current RF of these mires to range from −0.49 to −0.26 W m−2."

Particularly, the European Union (EU) comprises countries with diverse energy mixes, emission characteristics, reduction technologies, and policy frameworks, leading to large variations in the impacts of energy consumption on climate, air quality, and public health. Understanding these country-level variations is critical to optimize regional energy policies and reduce climate and health disparities in the EU. This study quantifies the regional variations in both climate and health impacts of energy consumption across EU countries. In countries where coal or oil dominates power supply, the health impacts of electricity consumption can be larger than climate impacts by more than ten times (e.g. Bulgaria, Romania, and Greece), highlighting the necessity of incorporating health impacts into climate and energy policies. We found a significant variability in health impacts per electricity usage (1.4–1508 € MWh−1) among EU countries, largely driven by their energy source mix. The health benefits of sustainable energy strategies can be notably higher in Eastern Europe countries than those in Western or Northern Europe. For instance, saving the same amount of electricity in Estonia could achieve health benefits 1043 times greater than in Sweden. Furthermore, our results suggest that energy policies and reports with biomass lumped into renewables can overlook its potential health burden.

Results reveal that MPD effectively intercalates between the layers of GO nanosheets, significantly reducing the mass transfer resistance of water within the GO membrane. Furthermore, the MPD present on the GO membrane surface acts as a monomer source for interfacial polymerization, enabling the formation of an ultrathin PA layer ∼9 nm thick.

Characterizing the lifetime, fate, and cloud-forming potential of atmospheric NPPs improves our understanding of their environmental processes and climate impacts. This study provides the first quantified heterogeneous reaction rate and lifetime of polystyrene (PS) NPPs against common atmospheric oxidants. The atomized PS NPPs were introduced to a Potential Aerosol Mass (PAM) oxidation flow reactor with ·OH exposure of 0 to 1.5 × 1012 molecules cm–3 s, equivalent to atmospheric exposure from 0 to 18 days, assuming an ambient ·OH concentration of 1 × 106 cm–3. The decay of the PS mass concentration was quantified by monitoring tracer ions, C6H6+ (m/z 78) and C8H8+ (m/z 104), by using a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS). The pseudo-first-order rate constant of PS particles reacting with ·OH, kOH, was determined to be (3.2 ± 0.7) × 10–13 cm3 molecule–1 s–1, equivalent to a half-lifetime of a few hours to ∼80 days in the atmosphere, depending on particle sizes and hydroxyl radical concentrations.

To improve the quantification accuracy under scarce tire composition data, a novel method was established based on real treads to establish more accurate quantitative curves using pyrolysis gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. For the first time, the rubber content of three types of treads was quantified using a comprehensive group of pyrolysis monomers and derivatives. The approach was validated by tread cryogrinds, which showed the accuracy was improved to 94–113% compared with previous methods. A tiered approach was established to calculate worn tread mass while distinguishing and eliminating interfering signals in matrices.

Dynamic of MeHg in paddy soils are likely interacted with the emissions of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2), given the involvement of methanogenesis and organic matter mineralization in mercury (Hg) methylation, but poorly defined at present. Here, rice-growing pot experiments were performed with varying levels of paddy soil Hg to examine the interactions among CO2 and CH4 emissions and MeHg dynamics under variable Hg amendment scenarios. Mercury addition (20 mg kg–1) significantly enhanced the cumulative emissions of CO2 and CH4 from a paddy system, and shifts in methanogen community explained the increased CH4 emissions. In contrast, such enhancements were not observed at lower Hg addition levels. Under identical total Hg treatments, ecosystem-dependent negative correlations were observed between MeHg concentrations and C emissions during the rice growing period. The divergent kinetics associated with the production of MeHg, CO2, and CH4 likely explained the reason. In addition, methanogens mediated MeHg degradation as well as CH4 production from oxidative demethylation may also contribute to the negative correlations.

However, the roles of coexisting hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) remain insufficiently explored. This study, using protocatechuic acid (PCA) as a representative natural polyphenol, demonstrated that contaminant removal within the PCA/Fe(III)/PAA system under acidic pH conditions exhibited two kinetic stages: an initial rapid stage driven by PAA, followed by a slower stage driven by H2O2. The presence of H2O2 facilitated the complete degradation (100%) of contaminants even at low concentrations (<1.0 μM). Interestingly, these two stages contributed differently to various contaminants’ degradation. Mechanistic investigations revealed that Fe(IV) was the major reactive species (RSs) for contaminant degradation during the PAA stage, while •OH dominated during the H2O2 stage. In brief, H2O2 enriched the generation pathways and types of RSs. Notably, besides PCA itself, the reaction intermediates (i.e., phenoxy radicals) formed during the reaction between PCA and RSs also played a key role in reducing Fe(III), which explained why the PCA/Fe(III)/PAA system was able to maintain sufficient Fe(II) to further interact with H2O2. Overall, this study highlighted the synergistic role of coexisting H2O2 and provided valuable insights for optimizing various contaminants’ degradation in actual waters using PAA-based Fenton-like systems."

This labeling approach enabled precise tracking of NP uptake and elimination in the protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila, thereby circumventing issues of low fluorescence intensity and label leakage associated with conventional fluorescence labeling methods. Significant uptake and elimination of the differently sized PS NPs were observed with multiple endocytosis and exocytosis pathways involved.

DFT calculations reveal that the U-shaped coordinated Fe sites formed with 50% terminal hydroxyl coverage exhibit the best H2O2 activation performance, which allows the adsorbed H2O2 to form a ·OH directly with much lower activation energy. Herein, a crystal facet protection strategy induced by rapid high-temperature annealing is developed to synthesize FeOCl with high exposure of Fe atoms while regulating the surface hydroxyl coverage. The dominant expression of the (021) facet resulted in an optimized surface terminal hydroxyl coverage of 58.3%, increasing the intrinsic activity of FeOCl by 4.3 times. The d-band center of FeOCl with optimized terminal hydroxyl coverage is closer to the Fermi level, thus exhibiting higher affinity for H2O2, and the increased amount of U-shaped coordinated Fe sites enables sufficient ·OH generation for enhanced decontamination performance. Since the terminal hydroxyl groups can be consumed by Ca2+ and Mg2+ through coprecipitation, preremoving the hardness of actual wastewater is indispensable in the application of the FeOCl/H2O2 system.

Within the temperature range of 250–350 °C, the optimal VMoCeP/Ti catalyst achieved a NO conversion of more than 95% and maintained a SO2 oxidation ratio below 1.0%. The enhanced SCR activity of the modified catalyst could be attributed to the improvement in surface acidity and redox capacity by the addition of Ce and P, which would promote NH3 adsorption and activation. Meanwhile, Ce and P coaddition could regulate the surface structure of vanadyl species from predominantly polymeric to a more dimeric form, which could also promote the SCR reaction. More importantly, except for the suppressed sulfation of vanadium species, both a lower proportion of polymeric vanadyl species and the strong interactions among V–Ce–P species could raise the energy barrier of the decomposition of sulfated vanadium species into SO3, thereby inhibiting SO2 oxidation.

The sloshing component of AMOC has been identified as a significant mode of short‐term AMOC variability. While it does not cause permanent changes to the AMOC, this sloshing mode can reshape the ocean's thermal state by redistributing warmer water in the upper layers and altering both basin‐wide and regional ocean heat content (OHC).

Using 6 years of rain gauge data, this study identified the northeastern GBA as a hotspot for extreme hourly rainfall, especially during nighttime. Using high‐resolution assimilation data from a four‐dimensional variational Doppler radar system, we investigated storm‐scale dynamics and microphysics of a nocturnal event with a peak hourly accumulation of 167.8 mm. Results showed that the urban heat island amplified local thermal contrasts as the cold pool approached, leading to strong northeasterly outflows exceeding 14 m/s at 150 m. Consequently, despite the predominant east‐southeastward movement driven by upper‐level west‐northwesterly winds, the intense convection shifted southwest toward the urban area and intensified significantly. The maximum hourly rainfall was related to the quasi‐stationary mesoscale boundary that triggered repeated convection. Before the most intense 5‐min rainfall of 34 mm, low‐level vertical velocity increased significantly, driven mainly by buoyancy‐induced and nonlinear dynamical accelerations. However, the nonlinear acceleration played a key role in maintaining strong vertical velocity at lower levels. The nonlinear acceleration was associated with low‐level meso‐γ‐scale rotation and vertical vorticity peaking below 2.5 km. In the southern region, vorticity was mainly attributed to stretching from strong convergence along the cold pool outflow boundary, while the tilting effect dominated the vorticity to the west, related to intense 0‐3‐km vertical wind shear.

This study considers North Atlantic TCs located within low to moderate wind shear and at least 100 km from major landmasses. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis is applied to distinguish moisture environments based on the spatial pattern of total column water vapor surrounding the TC. Using these EOF patterns, four separate categories (groups) are created. Principal component scores indicate the TC samples most contributing to each EOF pattern and ultimately determine the cases in each group. TC structural differences among the groups are compared using size metrics based on the wind and precipitation fields and shape metrics based on the precipitation field. These metrics are considered across a 48‐hr window centered on the sample times evaluated in the EOF analysis. There are no statistically significant differences in the TC wind field size, but TCs with abundant moisture to the southeast have larger rain areas with more outer rainbands. TCs in a dry environment or with dry air southeast of the TC center have generally smaller rain areas and less closed rainbands than TCs with moisture to the southeast.

During the 2024 summer monsoon season, three major extreme precipitation events occurred across the western, southern, and northern states of India, leading to widespread flooding in these regions. We examine the causes and impacts of extreme precipitation and flood events using a combination of observational data, reanalysis data sets, and hydrological models. In all the three regions, extreme rainfall occurred immediately after multiday continuous precipitation, resulting in catastrophic flooding. The 3‐day extreme precipitation that caused flooding in the three regions had return periods of more than 75 years, 100 years, and 200 years, respectively. The primary moisture sources for the Gujarat floods were the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean, while the floods in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana were mainly sourced by the Bay of Bengal. For the floods in northern India, the dominant moisture sources were recycled land moisture and moisture transport from the Bay of Bengal. These moisture inflows, coupled with favorable atmospheric conditions, resulted in multiday extreme precipitation in the three regions. Saturated soil moisture conditions before the extreme precipitation contributed to high runoff, triggering extensive flooding in all the three regions. Our findings highlight the growing challenge of managing such extreme events as their frequency and intensity are projected to increase under a warming climate."

Japan, despite its early leadership in EV promotion and extensive patent portfolio, has been notably slow in transitioning, with charging accessibility emerging as a potential constraint. To address this challenge, we conduct a spatial evaluation of EV charger accessibility and assess strategies for optimizing network accessibility. Using data from 5,585 EV charging stations and road congestion patterns across the Tokyo metropolitan area, we developed a road‐level Charging Insufficiency Index to quantify accessibility gaps. Our results show that over 60% of roads in selected cities may face insufficient charging infrastructure, potentially posing barriers to EV adoption. Among the alleviation measures, expanding the rapid charging network achieves the greatest reduction in charging insufficiency, decreasing the total length of roads with above‐average charging insufficiency by approximately 904.10 km across 51% of cities during rush hour. This study offers a framework for guiding targeted infrastructure expansion and policy interventions, providing insights that can inform EV adoption strategies in Japan and other regions facing similar challenges."

 Transcriptomes provide highly informative molecular phenotypes that, combined with gene perturbation, can connect genotype to phenotype. An ultimate goal is to perturb every gene and measure transcriptome changes, however, this is challenging, especially in whole animals. Here, we present ‘Worm Perturb-Seq (WPS)’, a method that provides high-resolution RNA-sequencing profiles for hundreds of replicate perturbations at a time in living animals. WPS introduces multiple experimental advances combining strengths of Caenhorhabditis elegans genetics and multiplexed RNA-sequencing with a novel analytical framework, EmpirDE. EmpirDE leverages the unique power of large transcriptomic datasets and improves statistical rigor by using gene-specific empirical null distributions to identify DEGs. We apply WPS to 103 nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) and find a striking ‘pairwise modularity’ in which pairs of NHRs regulate shared target genes. We envision the advances of WPS to be useful not only for C. elegans, but broadly for other models, including human cells.

 Precise tuning of phase transition material properties enables multifunctional devices for information processing and energy conversion, but controlling on-device phase transitions and monitoring microscopic mechanisms remains challenging. Here, we develop a lab-on-device system for molybdenum oxide to probe operando hydrogenation mechanisms through in situ electrical and spectral characterization with density functional theory calculations, revealing threshold-driven proton dynamics that govern the transition between nonvolatile memory operation and catalytic hydrogen evolution. Moderate proton intercalation (flux < 1017 cm-2) achieves a five-order conductance modulation under ambient conditions via polaron formation and stoichiometric optimization (H/Mo up to 22%, Mo/O approaching ideal ratios), outperforming oxygen vacancy engineering. Beyond this threshold (flux ~1017 cm-2), intensive proton intercalation triggers electric-to-chemical energy conversion, directly linking proton history to catalytic activity. Leveraging these principles, we achieve nonvolatile electrochemical memory with linear synaptic and accumulative neuronal functionalities, and demonstrate an all electrochemical random-access memory neural network hardware that executes memory-efficient rank-order coding for sparse signals even under noisy conditions.

 Personalized cancer vaccines elicit robust T cell immunity and anti-tumour potency, but identifying tumour-specific antigens remains challenging, severely constraining the therapeutic window. Biomimetic nanovaccines employing cancer cell membranes display inherent biocompatibility and stimulate T-cell responses against diverse tumour antigens, though tumours develop multiple mechanisms to reduce antigen presentation. Here we demonstrate a rapid and general strategy to fabricate personalized nanovaccines based on Antigen-Enriched tumor Cell Membranes (AECM) for early intervention. Interferon-γ potently stimulates antigen presentation across a broad range of cancer cell types. By coupling the generated AECM with PC7A adjuvant, a stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-activating polymer, the AECM@PC7A nanovaccine induces robust poly-neoepitopic T-cell responses even at low dosage, achieving significant tumour regression and metastasis inhibition in multiple murine cancer models. This anti-tumor response relies on MHC-I restricted antigen presentation and CD8+ T-cell activation, with dendritic cells presenting AECM antigens predominantly via cross-dressing to prime T-cells. AECM@PC7A exhibits remarkable anti-tumor efficacy when compared to vaccines with diverse formulations, and demonstrates therapeutic potential in post-surgical and humanized xenograft tumor models. This proof-of-concept study provides a promising universal avenue for the rapid development of personalized cancer vaccines applicable to early intervention for a broad range of patients.

With qualitative content analysis, this study brings coherence to many documents discussing such approaches to support efforts towards mainstreaming them. 
 Transformation of economic systems is widely regarded as essential for tackling interacting global crises. Unconventional economic approaches seeking holistic human and planetary well-being have transformative potential, but mainstreaming them is hampered by vested interests and intellectual lock-ins. They are also diffuse and struggle to develop sufficient discursive power to gain more widespread traction in policy. To bring coherence, we undertake a qualitative content analysis of 238 document sources from science and practice. We identify ten ecological, social, political economy and holistic principles cutting across 38 economic approaches. They include: (1) social–ecological embeddedness and holistic well-being; (2) interdisciplinarity and complexity thinking; (3) limits to growth; (4) limited substitutability of natural capital; (5) regenerative design; (6) holistic perspectives of people and values; (7) equity, equality and justice; (8) relationality and social enfranchisement; (9) participation, deliberation and cooperation and (10) post-capitalism and decolonization. We also consider opportunities and barriers to applying these principles in the context of global crises. Our results can help consolidate transformative economic approaches and support future efforts to synthesize conceptual models, methodologies and policy solutions and to validate the identified principles more explicitly within global south contexts.

 Antibiotic resistance poses a major global threat to health and ecosystems. Genes that confer resistance and can move between microbes, known as mobile antibiotic resistance genes, are especially concerning, as they can spread into disease-causing bacteria. While many pathways for gene dispersal are known, airborne transport remains poorly understood due to the difficulty of collecting and analyzing low-biomass air samples. Here we sampled air during clear weather and Middle Eastern dust storms and applied a genomic method called co-assembly, which merges multiple datasets to improve gene detection. This approach enhanced gene recovery and revealed resistance genes against clinically important antibiotics, including aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, fosfomycin, glycopeptides, quinolones, and tetracyclines. However, most resistance genes were not clearly linked to mobile elements, reflecting the complexity of airborne microbial communities. Our findings suggest the potential for long-range airborne spread of antibiotic resistance and underscore the need for continued atmospheric monitoring and strategies to mitigate environmental dissemination.

 Subsurface geofluids drive Earth’s evolution through seismogenesis, volcanism, and plate motion. Previous geofluid-distribution estimates from various geophysical methods show large variations. To quantify the geofluid distribution, we employ a novel inversion method capable of simultaneously analysing seismic velocity from high-resolution seismic-wave tomography along with electrical conductivity from magnetotelluric data in a volcanic region of Northeast Japan. This study successfully maps the volume and geometrical parameters of aqueous fluids and basaltic and andesitic magmas. A large, slightly leaking fluid reservoir is identified at a depth of 10–20 km. The fluid pressure-depth profile indicates that the seismogenic region corresponds to the area with the highest excess fluid pressure directly above the reservoir. At the bottom of the reservoir near the Moho, the basaltic and andesitic magmatic roots exhibit horizontal distributions to the west and east of the volcanic front, respectively. Andesitic magma is identified directly beneath the front, along with a magma-depleted zone near the Moho. We deduce that magma along the Moho released aqueous fluids, resulting in high pore-fluid pressure that induced earthquakes in the upper crust. Certain magmas ascended to form active volcanoes, leaving behind a magma-depleted zone. Our findings highlight the importance of crustal processes in volcanic-front formation. Magmas and aqueous fluids beneath a volcanic arc in Northeast Japan are differentiated from each other and spatially mapped using an approach that involves joint inversions of seismic and megnetotelluric data"

 Drought, a marked deficiency of surface water, has a wide adverse impact on the environment, agriculture, and the socio-economy. The global impact of land use changes on drought features and associated exposures to droughts, however, remains largely unknown. In this study, the changes of drought features are estimated by using the model simulations with and without land use change. We show that historical land use changes since 1850, mainly deforestation and crop expansion, has increased the drought frequency, duration, and severity over half of the global land area. Regions with greater activity tend to experience stronger exacerbation of drought events. Owing to their increasing frequency and prolonged duration, populations, croplands and forests are increasingly exposed to drought events, which poses serious potential impacts on human health, agriculture, and forest ecosystems. The enhanced drought events could be substantially alleviated by potential reforestation activity. Our results provide useful information for land-management-related policy-making.

 European farmers struggle with mitigating global emissions of greenhouse gases effectively and to cope with climate change. European regulators and national governments encounter obstacles in implementing environmental policies, feeding frustration amongst farmers. We hypothesize that these issues relate to climate change skepticism within the farming community and dissensus with non-farmers and between countries. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed climate attribution and impact skepticism amongst farmers and the rest of the working population using the Eurobarometer and the European Social Survey, and national data about gross domestic product (GDP), innovativeness, share of agricultural land, and climate damage risk for agriculture. Impact skepticism of farmers increases with decreasing risk of climate damage and increasing GDP, causing a South-North gradient in Europe. The majority of farmers in the EU countries were more skeptical than non-farmers. Understanding and reducing this skepticism provides a key to more effective mitigation and adaptation.

 Magma-rich continental rifting and breakup commonly show complex distributions of volcanism, potentially due to both plume and rifting controls. As such, interpreting the main controls on the spatial evolution of magmatism is debated, as is the point at which continental rifting transitions to oceanic spreading. Here we present new argon-argon dating of 16 lava flows from the Stratoid and Gulf series of the Afar rift. We reconstruct the spatio-temporal evolution of the rift from widely distributed to localised along narrow magmatic segments (i.e., rift localisation). Our results rule out an ocean spreading-like style of rifting. We show that over 2–2.5 million years since the early Pleistocene, the rift progressively narrowed by asymmetric in-rift localisation and propagated along-rift. Concurrently, the mantle partial melting and the crustal magmatic system shallowed. While mantle plume-related elevated temperatures influence overall melt volumes, our results suggest that the rapid and localised changes in plate thinning caused by rifting are the primary control on the spatio-temporal distribution of volcanism.

 Restoring natural ecosystems has the potential to remove billions of tons of CO2 annually through the end of the century, but rigorously measuring the climate impacts of restoration activities on the ground remains elusive. Ecosystem restoration interventions across hundreds or thousands of smallholder properties require robust above-ground biomass (AGB) products at high spatial (deca-metric: 10–30 m) resolution for annual monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV). In addition to ongoing monitoring, historical AGB time series across the region are also necessary. Historical maps are for example needed for eligibility checks and the selection of appropriate counterfactuals, i.e., to establish a dynamic performance benchmark. We present a novel AGB product based on a recently developed foundation model leveraging progress in self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques from multi-spectral Earth Observation (EO) time series. The foundation model is non-contrastive and condenses all available spectral observations acquired within a year into a few, orthogonal and highly informative representations at 10 m (for Sentinel-2) and 30 m (for Landsat 7/8). Combined with spatially sparse Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) full-waveform measurements at two relative heights (RH95 and RH10), but otherwise without any further fine-tuning, we are able to estimate forest biomass with an RMSE of <25 Mg/ha, when validated against 38 in-situ AGB measurement sites across a range of agroforestry (cacao and oil palm) and restoration age classes. Compared to five openly available datasets – most of them not available at annual time steps – our approach reduces the RMSE by 15–55%. We demonstrate the scalability of our approach, by producing annual AGB maps covering the entire state of Para, Brazil, for the years 2013 to 2024. The approach is computationally efficient, fully self-supervised without relying on contrastive samples, and can therefore be scaled to global coverage, even under conditions of high cloudiness."

 Accurate estimation of individual tree above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for regional forest AGB measurement. In this study, 64 individual trees of Pinus kesiya var. langbianensis, exhibiting a range of diameters, were felled from natural forests in mountainous regions to develop region-specific allometric equations for AGB. To enhance AGB estimation accuracy, we integrated unmanned aerial vehicle laser scanning (ULS) and backpack laser scanning (BLS) point clouds using the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm for precise registration and fusion under varying slope conditions, enabling 3D tree reconstruction. Furthermore, a height-filtered segmentation strategy was introduced to further enhance registration accuracy by aligning ULS points above 2 m with BLS data. The results showed that: 1) Unnormalized point clouds exhibited better registration performance than normalized ones, indicating that slope has a significant impact on registration accuracy. 2) The segmentation-driven registration method performed best in integrating tree trunks and crowns, with the lowest registration error (RMSE = 0.2581 m) observed in the mid-slope areas (15-25°). In contrast, higher registration errors were found in steep (>25°) and gentle (0-15°) slopes, with RMSE of 0.2976 m and 0.2814 m, respectively. 3) The AGB allometric equation derived from the felled trees demonstrated high accuracy (R2 = 0.9879, RMSE = 22.9243 kg). 4) The individual tree AGB estimation based on breast height (DBH) and height (H) extracted from the fused point clouds had R2 values ranging from 0.8721 to 0.9730, with RMSE between 20.0242 kg to 48.6254 kg.

This study proposes an innovative method to generate reflectance time series to address this issue, enhancing data reliability and application scope. We adopted a lightweight reconstruction model based on the architecture of deep learning.

During the model training and evaluation, we selected time series image data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 in China and the United States, covering various typical geographical and climatic environments. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method performs excellently, significantly improving the completeness and accuracy of reflectance data, especially under conditions of prolonged cloud contamination leading to data gaps. To further validate the practical application of the model, we conducted a test in the grassland region of Mongolia to restore surface burnt areas. The results showed that this method performs excellently in restoring and detecting changes in burnt areas, significantly improving the accuracy and efficiency of detection. In summary, the method proposed in this study provides an effective solution to the problem of gaps in remote sensing image time series caused by cloud cover.

 Ground surface displacements monitored by interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques are a useful indicator for revealing precursors and assessing risks of tailings dam failures. However, the long-term and large-magnitude consolidation settlements, which impose low risks on dam collapses, usually dominate InSAR displacement observations. The phenomenon would cause misleading in failure precursors and false alarms in dam failure risks. To circumvent this, we proposed a new framework for assessing tailings dam failure risks from InSAR displacements. In which, a novel Weibull-based algorithm was firstly developed to statistically identify and robustly separate long-term consolidation settlement components from InSAR displacements. The dam failure risks were then statistically assessed based on the remaining InSAR observations after consolidation settlement separation using a comprehensive standardized deformation index (CSDI) model. Six tailings storage facilities (TSFs) worldwide were selected to be tested using the proposed model. The results suggest that the new framework can effectively reduce the false alarms of dam failure risks (about 48% in this study) due to consolidation settlements. In addition, the identified regions with high failure risks are more reliable than that by traditional algorithms without consolidation settlement separation. The new framework offers a robust tool to assess dam failure risks of large-scale (e.g., global) TSFs, thus scientifically guiding the control of catastrophic tailings dam failures."

 The present study investigates the temporal variation in the connection between Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) and Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) during 1980–2023. The ISMR shows an insignificant correlation with the preceding October–November–December–January (OND(−1)J(0)) Greenland Sea SIC (GSSIC) during 1980–2001, whereas the relationship turns to be significant positive during 2002–2023. During this latter period, the increasing GSSIC in preceding OND(−1)J(0) can exert wave trains that travel from North Atlantic to northeast Pacific, inducing anomalous anticyclone and cyclone over northeast of Hawaii and southwest of Mexico, respectively. This, in turn, generates a dipole sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) over northeast Pacific, with positive SSTA northeast of Hawaii and negative SSTA southwest of Mexico. The Wind-Evaporation-SST (WES) feedback helps maintain this dipole SSTA through to the following June–July–August–September, contributing to the negative SSTA over north central tropical Pacific (NCTP). The negative NCTP SSTA can induce anomalous ascending motion over the western Pacific–Indian Ocean by modulating Walker circulation, ultimately leading to increase ISMR. In contrast, during 1980–2001, GSSIC shows stronger co-variation with North Atlantic dipole (NAD) SSTA compared with that during 2002–2023. Due to the response of atmospheric circulation anomalies to the GSSIC are nearly opposite to those in terms of the NAD SSTA, the influence of the GSSIC anomalies on the wave trains over Northern Hemisphere is disturbed. Therefore, the GSSIC anomalies can slightly impact on the SSTA over northeast Pacific, resulting in weaker GSSIC-ISMR relationship."

However, early mammalian embryos lack efficient spindle assembly mechanisms, and it remains unclear how error-free chromosome segregation is achieved. In this work, we imaged early mouse embryos and identified a network of nuclear actin cables that organize prophase chromosomes at the nuclear periphery. Following nuclear envelope breakdown, the network contracts and gathers chromosomes toward the cell center. Network contraction was driven by filament disassembly in a myosin II–independent manner. Additionally, we identified a network of branched actin filaments that attenuates metaphase spindle elongation. We also visualized nuclear actin in human embryos, suggesting a conserved role for actin in ensuring mitotic fidelity during early mammalian development."

We show that the CTC1-STN1-TEN1 (CST) complex, a central 53BP1 axis component, suppresses DNA end resection by EXO1 and the BLM-DNA2 helicase-nuclease complex but acts by distinct mechanisms in restricting these entities. Whereas BRCA1-BARD1 alleviates the CST-imposed EXO1 blockade, it has little effect on BLM-DNA2 restriction. CST mutants impaired for DNA binding or BLM–EXO1 interaction exhibit a hyper-resection phenotype and render BRCA1-deficient cells resistant to poly(ADP–ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Our findings mechanistically define the crucial role of CST in DNA DSB repair pathway choice and have implications for understanding cancer therapy resistance stemming from dysfunction of the 53BP1 axis."

However, the extent to which these turf algae alter the surrounding chemical environment or affect the rebound potential of kelp forests (through chemically mediated interactions) remains unknown. Here, we used underwater visual surveys, comprehensive chemical profiling, and laboratory experiments to reveal that turf algae release bioactive compounds into the water that fundamentally alter the reef “chemical landscape” and directly suppress kelp recruitment. Therefore, our study reveals that chemical ecology is critical in shaping modern kelp forest ecosystems and their resilience. Further, it demonstrates that reversing climate-driven state shifts will require not only curbing global carbon emissions but also implementing targeted local interventions that break harmful ecological feedback loops and foster recovery."

Using trait modeling that combines total-evidence evolutionary trees and a comprehensive size dataset, we show that sloth body mass evolved with major lifestyle shifts and that most terrestrial lineages reached their largest sizes through slower evolutionary rates compared with extant arboreal forms.

Past studies have quantified snow cover changes with satellite products of relatively low spatial resolution (∼500 m) which are hindered by the steep topography of this mountain region. We derive snowlines from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 5, 7 and 8 images, which, thanks to their higher spatial resolution, are less sensitive to the local topography. We calculate the snow line altitude (SLA) and its seasonality for all glacierized catchments of HMA and link these patterns to climate variables corrected for topographic biases. As such, the snowline changes provide a clear proxy for climatic changes. Our results highlight a strong spatial variability in mean SLA and in its seasonal changes, including across mountain chains and between the monsoon-dominated and the westerlies-dominated catchments. Over the period 1999–2019, the western regions of HMA (Pamir, Karakoram, Western Himalaya) have undergone increased snow coverage, expressed as seasonal SLA decrease, in spring and summer. This change is opposed to a widespread increase in SLA in autumn across the region, and especially the southeastern regions of HMA (Nyainqentanglha, Hengduan Shan, South–East Himalaya). Our results indicate that the diversity of seasonal snow dynamics across the region is controlled not by temperature or precipitation directly but by the timing and partitioning of solid precipitation. Decadal snowline changes (1999–2009 vs 2009–2019) seasonally precede temperature changes, suggesting that seasonal temperature changes in the Karakoram–Pamir and Eastern Nyainqentanglha regions may have responded to snow cover changes, rather than driving them."

Freddy’s long lifespan benefited from an anomalously strong Mascarene High, which steered Freddy westward along its northern flank, thereby preventing it encountering cold water areas. In addition to its long lifespan, we found Freddy experienced a record-breaking six rapid intensification (RI) events and analyzed the atmosphere-ocean conditions driving Freddy’s multiple RI events. The results indicated that during the six RI events, Freddy experienced high sea surface temperatures, weak vertical wind shear, high potential intensity, and high relative humidity, with all four environmental factors more favorable than historical averages. Notably, three of these RI events occurred within the Mozambique Channel, which also prolonged its coastal activity (21 d). This phase of TC Freddy generated extreme rainfall with maximum cumulative precipitation of 877 mm, compounded by secondary disasters, which caused substantial economic losses and fatalities in coastal areas. Additionally, it was found that the frequency of RI events and the number of intense TCs reaching Category 4 or above in the SIO showed statistically significant upward trends during 1980–2023, indicating a growing threat to Africa, which is likely to face more intense TCs in a warming climate. With rising sea levels and increasing threat from TCs, greater focus on coastal disaster prevention and mitigation strategies is needed to address the escalating risks associated with TCs in the SIO in the context of global warming."

The measurement and discussion of clean fuel affordability is almost always based on the unitary, or single decision-maker, household as the unit of analysis, although the more realistic household disaggregated into its individual decision-makers is a well-established literature. The limited work on intra-household dynamics in clean cooking cannot reveal who is buying the stove or fuel and at what true cost. Following an experiment testing the effect of microsavings to increase clean fuel consumption in Shirati, a rural town in Mara region, Tanzania, we conducted 90 interviews and numerous focus groups/budget games with a stratified random sample of mostly female main cooks. Drawing on over two years of fieldwork, we investigate the range of household needs, the role of gender in household finances, and how these combine to determine cooking fuel purchases. We find distinct and gendered financial domains where spouses do not disclose their expenses to one another and are responsible for different categories of needs. Cooking fuel is firmly in the female domain. Thus, liquefied petroleum gas affordability is constrained by these gendered financial domains, as women must choose between using savings for daily necessities or refilling the gas. Our extensive ethnographic evidence demonstrates the inappropriateness of the unitary model for cooking fuel affordability and the implications of ignoring separate-account household models. Our work requires new interpretations of saving for, and affordability of, clean fuels that the clean cooking literature has yet to confront. We offer recommendations for how the clean cooking literature could measure affordability and design policy for regions where cooking fuel is exclusively in the female financial domain."

Despite its small geographical area, it faces escalating environmental challenges, including air pollution, water pollution, soil degradation, and poor waste management, that compromise natural resources, biodiversity, and public health. This review compiles and analyzes scientific literature and official reports on Lebanese river pollution from 1994 to 2024. It presents the status of river water quality, identifies major pollution sources and types, including untreated sewage, industrial discharges, and agricultural runoff, and highlights the use of bioindicators, alongside governmental and non-governmental mitigation efforts. Findings indicate widespread contamination across most Lebanese rivers due to the presence of pathogens, potentially toxic elements, and organic pollutants. Water quality degradation has often impaired access to safe water for drinking, irrigation, and industrial use. Although research and monitoring efforts have increased over the past decade, the implementation of control measures remains insufficient. Key challenges include fragmented environmental governance, lack of long-term monitoring programs, and limited public awareness. Addressing these issues requires integrated water resource management, stricter enforcement of environmental regulations, promotion of sustainable agricultural and industrial practices, and expansion of research on emerging contaminants.

The short range covered by direct AMOC observations, inconsistent paleoclimate records, and scattered hydrographic data are insufficient to realistically reconstruct the AMOC strength since 1900. An AMOC proxy index based on sea surface temperatures suggests that the AMOC has declined by 15% since the late 19th century but this index received extensive scientific criticism. Here, we use a deep learning algorithm and climate model simulations to accurately reconstruct the AMOC strength between 20° N and 60° N since 1900. In contrast with the existing indices, our reconstructions are well in agreement with AMOC strength variations simulated by climate models and direct observations at 26.5° N.

Yet these scenarios have often projected near-term CCS deployments that far exceed what is currently planned, let alone operational. They have also failed to consider regional differences in capacity to deploy large-scale CO2 capture, transport, and subsurface injection. Here, we update a leading integrated energy-economy-land model by recalibrating maximum deployments to publicly announced CCS projects through to 2030. We also quantify a range of regionally explicit future scaling and maximum injection rates for the overall CCS value chain and evaluate their implications for emissions trajectories, energy mix, use of rate-limited storage capacity, and mitigation costs. Under limited CCS growth rates, deployment at mid-century and 2100 could be reduced by a factor of 7 relative to a scenario that does not consider injectivity or growth rate limits. However, sustained efforts to rapidly scale CCS could reduce transition costs by nearly $11 trillion (20%) globally, with cost reductions most heavily concentrated in regions such as China and India. Delayed mitigation combined with slower-than-expected CCS deployment could result in large and prolonged temperature overshoot. Conversely, there are lower peak and long-term temperatures with aggressive emissions cuts in anticipation of slow CCS scaling that subsequently far exceeds expectations."

Surface treatment of filter media using the PTFE membrane can improve its filtration performance. Badly, the reprocessing of used filter media has become a major challenge due to the ecological impact and potential human toxicity of PTFE.

Benefiting from the three-dimensional porous network structure formed by the staggered arrangement of fibers in mPPS and the effective prediction and optimization of the structural performance of the designed filter media in advance, mPPS-25/NF-5 demonstrated superior filtration performance. Specifically, compared with commercial PTFE membrane lamination filter media, the average cleaning cycle of mPPS-25/NF-5 has been improved by 188.13 s, while the average residual resistance has been reduced by 41.84 Pa, which truly realizes a high efficiency, low resistance, and long service life.

These experiments were designed to characterize the colloid breakthrough curves and quantify their SEE. This approach significantly enhanced detection signals, enabling accurate colloid detection at very low concentrations (≤10 mg L–1) and precise colloid size differentiation. Furthermore, the colloid breakthrough curves were fitted to quantify a key SEE parameter, i.e., the water saturation inaccessible to mobile colloids (γ). Regression analysis revealed a power function correlation between the γ parameter and the colloid diameter, indicating that the SEE intensifies with increasing colloid diameter. These findings highlight the potential of DNA labeling for high-resolution characterization of low-concentration and mixed-size colloidal particle transport in porous media.

Besides species traits, the gut microbiome may provide an untested additional predictive factor since it often plays a role in host defense against stressors. Therefore, we investigated the gut microbiome’s causal role in shaping differences in pesticide sensitivity between two congeneric damselfly species. After an antibiotic treatment, reciprocal gut microbiome transplants were performed between pesticide-sensitive Ischnura elegans and more tolerant Ischnura pumilio larvae, with donor larvae first preexposed to either chlorpyrifos or a solvent control to match the subsequent pesticide treatments of the recipients. The gut microbiome, determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, of both species included pesticide-degrading bacteria, but also showed shared and species-specific responses to the pesticide. Notably, the most pesticide-sensitive combination, with the highest pesticide-induced mortality, consisted of I. elegans larvae receiving I. elegans donor gut microbiota, whereas the least sensitive combination consisted of I. pumilio larvae receiving I. pumilio donor gut microbiota, whereby the pesticide did not increase larval mortality. The two mixed donor–recipient gut microbiome combinations resulted in an intermediate sensitivity. Remarkably, I. elegans recipient larvae experienced a lower chlorpyrifos-induced mortality when they received an I. pumilio donor gut microbiome than when they received their conspecific I. elegans donor gut microbiome. Our results provide, to our knowledge, the first proof-of-evidence that the gut microbiome causally contributes to species differences in pesticide sensitivity."

The results showed that Zostera marina L. detritus captured nonylphenol (NP) and bisphenol A (BPA) with high efficiency (>90%) and enhanced organic carbon sequestration in marine ecosystems. Under various seawater-sediment scenarios (pure seawater, nonburial, and burial systems), phenolic EDC rerelease rates were low (<20%), while total organic carbon (TOC) stocks increased by 21.5%–28.8% in EDC-treated groups compared to controls. Kinetic analyses revealed that NP and BPA were rapidly captured onto heterogeneous active sites of the detritus surface, with capture efficiency influenced by the physicochemical properties of contaminants, environmental factors, and the specific characteristics of the detritus. Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) and density functional theory (DFT) were employed to investigate synergistic mechanisms between phenolic EDCs and carbon at cellular and molecular levels. The lipids mediated NP sequestration through hydrophobic interactions with lipid-rich sites (such as phospholipids), while polysaccharides facilitated BPA binding via electrostatic interactions, highlighting their crucial roles in capturing phenolic EDCs.

As a benefit from the combined merits of superior interfacial charge transfer accelerated by the vdW heterostructure and rapid Co(III)/Co(II) cycling promoted by the immobilization of electron-shuttle-like POM, the as-synthesized CoOx–POM vdW heterostructure (vdW-CPNSs) achieved efficient activation of PMS and exhibited a 21.5-fold higher degradation rate than the conventional Co3O4 counterpart for the elimination of antibiotic pollutants. Mechanism studies demonstrated that both radical (SO4• –) and non-radical (1O2)  contributed to the superior degradation performance. Additionally, vdW-CPNSs could be integrated into a flow-through wastewater treatment setup, achieving nearly 100% removal of environmentally realistic level antibiotic contaminants, which exhibited a great potential for practical wastewater purification.

Their structural disorder can alter the central metal redox states, enhancing oxyanion adsorption. Previously, we demonstrated that the reduced redox state of titanium in amorphous titanium (hydr)oxide (a-TiHO) increased arsenate and arsenite adsorption. Here, we show that incorporating cerium into a-TiHO further enhances redox modulation, improving the simultaneous adsorption of multiple oxyanions (arsenate, vanadate, tungstate, chromate, and selenate) from water. Using sol–gel synthesis, we produced cerium–titanium (hydr)oxides with varying Ce(III)/Ce(IV) and Ti(III)/Ti(IV) ratios, including a highly crystalline material via annealing. The best adsorption occurred in a 98% amorphous material with a 10:1 reduced-to-oxidized ratio of the central metal, achieving capacities of 22 and 19 μmol of oxyanion per millimole of metal at pH 6.5 and 8.5, respectively. Increasing the cerium content consistently improved oxyanion mixture adsorption. Advanced characterization, such as pair distribution function (PDF), combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), revealed that higher (III)/(IV) central metal ratios correlate with increased oxygen vacancies, which enhance oxyanion adsorption.

Samples originated from the wastewater treatment plant serving the Lausanne city catchment area, where an outbreak occurred before spreading to the broader Canton Vaud region. Despite high vaccination rates, viral loads of the measles wild type were detected during the first transmission event involving 21 cases identified within a week. However, viral loads were no longer detectable after the initial 21 cases, despite an additional 30 cases reported in the following 3 weeks, possibly due to lower incidence rate or location outside the catchment. Measles vaccine strain was not detected during the outbreak.

Using the Southern Ocean Freshwater Input from Antarctica (SOFIA) multi‐model ensemble, we study the atmospheric response to a 100‐year idealized freshwater release of 0.1 Sv. All models simulate a surface‐intensified tropospheric cooling and lower‐stratospheric warming south of 35°S. Tropospheric cooling is attributed to sea ice expansion and the associated albedo enhancement in winter and a colder sea surface in summer. This cooling yields a downward displacement of the tropopause, reduced stratospheric water vapor content and ultimately warming around 200 hPa. An enhanced southward eddy heat flux explains warming at 10–100 hPa during austral winter. Despite a temporally (and spatially) uniform prescribed freshwater flux, a prominent sea ice seasonal cycle and atmosphere dynamics result in a distinct seasonal pattern in the occurrence and magnitude of the temperature responses."

However, here we find that quite a few of subsurface MHWs in the western tropical Pacific Ocean show significant co‐occurrence with subsurface anticyclonic eddies using in situ observations from buoys and Argo floats.

The results reveal a relationship between the spectral energy density of KAWs and PAD of relativistic electrons, with butterfly PAD features becoming more pronounced and showing larger dip‐sizes as the spectral energy density of KAWs increases, particularly for electrons in 0.5–3.4 MeV energy range. At these times the magnetopause sub‐solar stand‐off distance renders magnetopause shadowing an unlikely formation mechanism.

Low‐vertical‐mode internal tides can transport energy far from their generation site, but it remains unclear how and where this energy is eventually dissipated at small scales. A potential mechanism for the transfer of energy from low‐mode internal tides to smaller scales in equatorial regions is superharmonic generation, whereby nonlinear self‐interaction of internal tides in non‐uniform stratification excites waves with shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies. Here, we use a realistically forced global configuration of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model to investigate an enhanced superharmonic signal in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. Using existing theory, we demonstrate that the superharmonic amplitude is consistent with nonlinear self‐interaction of the original baroclinic tide, providing strong evidence for an energy pathway from the mode‐1 semidiurnal internal tide to smaller horizontal scales."

However, the relative importance of synoptic atmospheric processes in the development of these events remains unclear, as previous studies have predominantly focused on quasi‐stationary systems. Here, we demonstrate that a severe marine heatwave (MHW) over the Southwest Pacific unfolded through two distinct warming stages followed by a cooling phase, all dominated by recurrent synoptic Rossby wave packets propagating through the upper troposphere. During each warming phase, these wave packets organized near‐surface circulation anomalies that inhibited wind‐driven mixing, causing unusually shallow mixed‐layer depths. The resultant shoaling amplified surface warming by intensifying the effects of increased solar radiation, ultimately triggering the extreme MHW. Conversely, during the intermediate cooling phase, the mixed layer returned to its climatological state, allowing the heatwave conditions to dissipate. Strong quasi‐stationary patterns emerged only near the ends of both intensification and decay, downstream of the recurring wave events. These blocking patterns appear to have helped terminate the recurrence by causing potential instability to build up to a point of more widespread release. A diagnostic analysis of the lower tropospheric vorticity budget highlights the central role of dynamical vorticity production tied to the anomalous atmospheric circulation forced by upper‐level waves."

 Chiral superconductors are unconventional superconducting states that break time reversal symmetry spontaneously and typically feature Cooper pairing at non-zero angular momentum. Such states may host Majorana fermions and provide an important platform for topological physics research and fault-tolerant quantum computing1–7. Despite intensive search and prolonged studies of several candidate systems8–26, chiral superconductivity has remained elusive so far. Here we report the discovery of robust unconventional superconductivity in rhombohedral tetra- and penta-layer graphene without moiré superlattice effects. We observed two superconducting states in the gate-induced flat conduction bands with Tc up to 300 mK and charge density ne down to 2.4*1011 cm-2 in five devices. Spontaneous time-reversal-symmetry-breaking due to electron’s orbital motion is found, and several observations indicate the chiral nature of these superconducting states, including: 1. In the superconducting state, Rxx shows magnetic hysteresis in varying out-of-plane magnetic field B⊥—absent from all other superconductors; 2. the superconducting states are robust against in-plane magnetic field and are developed within a spin- and valley-polarized quarter-metal phase; 3. the normal states show anomalous Hall signals at zero magnetic field and magnetic hysteresis. We also observed a critical B⊥ of 1.4 Tesla, higher than any graphene superconductivity and indicates a strong-coupling superconductivity close to the BCS-BEC crossover27. Our observations establish a pure carbon material for the study of topological superconductivity, with the promise to explore Majorana modes and topological quantum computing."

 Around 40% of the US population and 1 in 6 individuals worldwide have obesity, with the incidence surging globally1,2. Various dietary interventions, including carbohydrate, fat and, more recently, amino acid restriction, have been explored to combat this epidemic3–6. Here we investigated the impact of removing individual amino acids on the weight profiles of mice. We show that conditional cysteine restriction resulted in the most substantial weight loss when compared to essential amino acid restriction, amounting to 30% within 1 week, which was readily reversed. We found that cysteine deficiency activated the integrated stress response and oxidative stress response, which amplify each other, leading to the induction of GDF15 and FGF21, partly explaining the phenotype7–9. Notably, we observed lower levels of tissue coenzyme A (CoA), which has been considered to be extremely stable10, resulting in reduced mitochondrial functionality and metabolic rewiring. This results in energetically inefficient anaerobic glycolysis and defective tricarboxylic acid cycle, with sustained urinary excretion of pyruvate, orotate, citrate, α-ketoglutarate, nitrogen-rich compounds and amino acids. In summary, our investigation reveals that cysteine restriction, by depleting GSH and CoA, exerts a maximal impact on weight loss, metabolism and stress signalling compared with other amino acid restrictions. These findings suggest strategies for addressing a range of metabolic diseases and the growing obesity crisis.

 Globally, 2023 was the hottest year on record and saw the development of a strong El Niño with widespread impacts. This El Niño event was unusual for its strong oceanic warming yet muted Southern Oscillation and wind anomalies over the tropical Pacific. This discrepancy is perplexing given the historically close coupling of El Niño and the Southern Oscillation. Atmospheric model experiments show that warming in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans in 2023 and the slow background sea surface temperature trend reduced the surface wind response over the tropical Pacific by modulating the Walker circulation. We develop a hindcast system that reproduces 87% of the June–December El Niño warming even without wind stress feedback after April 2023. The intense oceanic warming was primarily driven by the strong build-up of western Pacific heat content during the preceding prolonged La Niña. This indicates that the 2023–2024 El Niño primarily arose from oceanic processes, independent of the classic positive Bjerknes feedback mechanism. Due to the strong ocean memory, this event was highly predictable at long time leads. Climate model simulations suggest that such 2023-like El Niños may become more frequent in a warming climate.

 Phase transformations are widely invoked as a source of rheological weakening during subduction, continental collision, mantle convection and various other geodynamic phenomena. However, despite more than half a century of research, the likelihood and magnitude of such weakening in nature remain poorly constrained. Here we use experiments performed on a synchrotron beamline to reveal transient weakening of up to three orders of magnitude during the polymorphic quartz to coesite (SiO2) and olivine to ringwoodite (Fe2SiO4) phase transitions. Weakening becomes increasingly prominent as the transformation outpaces deformation. We suggest that this behaviour is broadly applicable among silicate minerals undergoing first-order phase transitions and examine the likelihood of weakening due to the olivine-spinel, (Mg,Fe)2SiO4, transformation during subduction. Modelling suggests that cold, wet slabs are most susceptible to transformational weakening, consistent with geophysical observations of slab stagnation in the mantle transition zone beneath the western Pacific. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating transformational weakening into geodynamic simulations and provides a quantitative basis for doing so.

 Mangroves are a carbon-dense and highly productive ecosystem but can experience massive dieback under environmental extremes. Climatic oscillations, such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), are major drivers of global climate variability, yet their impact on mangrove growth at the global scale remains uncertain. Here, using long-term satellite observations from 2001 to 2020, we show that more than 50% of global mangrove areas experience significant variations during ENSO events, exhibiting a seesaw-like pattern across the Pacific Basin where mangrove leaf area decreases in the western Pacific but increases in the eastern Pacific during El Niño, with the reverse occurring during La Niña. The Indian Ocean Dipole affects mangroves across the Indian Ocean similarly but with a lower magnitude relative to ENSO. These patterns are driven by corresponding sea-level fluctuations across the Pacific and Indian ocean basins, with local contributions from lunar nodal cycles. Our study highlights the crucial role of short-term sea-level fluctuations driven by climatic oscillations in dominating the variability of coastal wetland growth and, consequently, in influencing the blue carbon sink. Short-term sea-level fluctuations during climatic oscillations result in divergent variations in global mangrove growth across ocean basins, according to analyses of satellite observations from 2001 to 2020."

Here, the authors use sophisticated biochemical reconstitutions to address how kinetochores, the microtubule-binding structures of chromosomes, regulate this checkpoint. 
 The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) ensures mitotic exit occurs only after sister chromatid biorientation, but how this coordination is mechanistically achieved remains unclear. Kinetochores, the megadalton complexes linking chromosomes to spindle microtubules, contribute to SAC signaling. However, whether they act solely as docking platforms or actively promote the co-orientation of SAC catalysts such as MAD1:MAD2 and BUB1:BUB3 remains unresolved. Here, we reconstitute kinetochores and SAC signaling in vitro to address this question. We engineer recombinant kinetochore particles that recruit core SAC components and trigger checkpoint signaling upon Rapamycin induction, and test their function using a panel of targeted mutants. At approximately physiological concentrations of SAC proteins, kinetochores are essential for efficient mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) assembly, the key effector of SAC signaling. Our results suggest that kinetochores serve not only as structural hubs but also as catalytic platforms that concentrate and spatially organize SAC components to accelerate MCC formation and ensure timely checkpoint activation.

Hippocampal circuits balance possible goals based on how much behavioral change is needed while prefrontal circuits represent changing plans. 
 Navigating a dynamic world requires rapidly updating choices by integrating past experiences with new information. In hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, neural activity representing future goals is theorized to support navigational planning. However, it remains unknown how prospective goal representations incorporate new, pivotal information. Accordingly, we designed a navigation task that precisely introduces new information using virtual reality, and we recorded neural activity as male mice flexibly adapted their planned destinations. Here we show that new information triggered increased hippocampal prospective representations of both possible goals; while in prefrontal cortex, new information caused prospective representations of choices to rapidly shift to the new choice. When mice did not adapt, prefrontal choice codes failed to switch. Prospective codes were dependent on the amount of behavioral adaptation needed; the new goal arm was represented more strongly when animals needed to change their behavior more. Thus, we show how prospective codes update with new information to flexibly adapt ongoing navigational plans. Neural mechanisms underlying flexible navigation are not fully understood.

 Posttranscriptional and posttranslational modifications play crucial roles in plant immunity. However, how plants fine-tune such modifications to activate antiviral immunity remains unknown. Here, we report that the m6A methyltransferase TaHAKAI is utilized by wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV) to increase viral genomic m6A modification and promote viral replication. However, TaHAKAI also functions as an E3 ligase that targets the viral RNA silencing suppressor P2 for degradation and inhibits viral infection. A major allele of TaHAKAI in a susceptible cultivar exhibited reduced E3 ligase activity but not m6A methyltransferase activity, promoting viral infection. Interestingly, TaHAKAIR attenuates the stability of TaWPS1 (Wheat paired spikelets 1, WPS1) mRNA, the negative regulator of spike development, which might increase panicle length and spikelet number by modulating its m6A modification.

Here, the authors present a method to provide real-time 3D temperature monitoring with minimal invasiveness, by matching a patient-specific library of simulations to a set of scarce and noisy measurements. 
 Oncological microwave hyperthermia is a clinically proven sensitizer of radio- and chemo-therapies; it acts by selectively increasing the temperature of tumor cells by means of antenna applicators. Its current limitations mostly come from the inability to reliably predict, and hence control, temperature inside the patient during treatment, especially for deep-seated tumors. Simulations are employed in treatment planning, but due to related uncertainties invasive thermometry is necessary, usually via catheters. Being invasive, their use must be minimized and provides very limited spatial information. Here, we demonstrate an approach to obtain 3D temperature information in real time from few measurement points via massive use of high-performance simulations carried out prior to treatment. The proposed technique is tested both in a fully anthropomorphic in-silico scenario, and in an experimental controlled setting. The obtained results demonstrate the potential of the proposed method as a low-cost real-time temperature monitoring technique in cancer hyperthermia. Use with intra-luminal, minimally-invasive catheters is supported by the positive outcome experimentally obtained using data points directly acquired in the trachea-mimicking phantom structure.

 Halide perovskite gas sensors have a low gas detection limit at room temperature, surpassing the performance of traditional metal oxide chemiresistors. However, they are prone to structural decomposition and performance loss due to the lack of coordination unsaturated surface metal ions and sensitivity to environmental factors such as water, oxygen, heat, and light. To address this issue, we present a general strategy: replacing the cation Cs+ in inorganic perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 with long-chain alkylamines. This modification synthesizes perovskite sensor materials that effectively block moisture and exhibit excellent stability under real-working conditions. The chemiresistors show high sensitivity and stability to CO gas, with (BA)4AgBiBr8 detecting CO at a limit of 20 ppb, maintaining performance after 270 days of continuous exposure to ambient air. The exceptional performance of (BA)4AgBiBr8 is elucidated through density functional theory calculations combined with sum frequency generation spectroscopy, marking a significant breakthrough in halide perovskite-based gas sensing by surpassing the stability and sensitivity of traditional sensors.

Preferential phosphate removal by ferric oxides and microbial competition may have promoted its biological usage. 
 Phosphorus availability has influenced the co-evolution of life and Earth’s environments. While phosphate was likely the main phosphorus source for life during the Archean, phosphite (HPO32−) gained importance leading up to the Great Oxidation Event (GOE). However, the concentration of phosphite in seawater at that time, and the processes driving this shift in P utilization, remain poorly constrained. Using lab experiments and phosphite data from banded iron formations (BIFs), we show that hydrous ferric oxides (HFO) preferentially remove phosphate over phosphite. This suggests that shallow seawater at the onset of the GOE could have contained up to 0.17 µM phosphite, comprising 5–88% of total dissolved inorganic phosphorus. We propose that phosphate depletion driven by HFO adsorption and microbial competition may have promoted the use of phosphite as an alternative P source.

 While Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy may result in durable remissions in recurrent large B cell lymphoma, persistence is limited and the mechanisms underlying long-term response are not fully elucidated. Using longitudinal single-cell immunoprofiling, here we compare the immune landscape in durable remission versus early relapse patients following CD19 CAR T cell infusion in the NCT02348216 (ZUMA-1) trial. Four weeks post-infusion, both cohorts demonstrate low circulating CAR T cells. We observe that long-term remission is associated with elevated native cytotoxic and proinflammatory effector cells, and post-infusion clonotypic expansion of effector memory T cells. Conversely, early relapse is associated with impaired NK cell cytotoxicity and elevated immunoregulatory cells, potentially dampening native T cell activation. Thus, we suggest that durable remission to CAR T is associated with a distinct T cell signature and pattern of clonotypic expansion within the native T cell compartment post-therapy, consistent with their contribution to the maintenance of response. The contribution of native T cells to the durability of post-CAR T cell responses is incompletely understood.

 One of the most challenging problems in paleoclimate research is how orbital cyclicities forced Earth’s climate variations during the late Quaternary. To address this issue, we investigated the differences in silicate weathering, a sensitive climate indicator, at different latitudes on orbital timescales by examining geochemical and clay mineral data from the mid-latitude Sea of Okhotsk and integrating published weathering records from low to high latitudes. Results show that silicate weathering in the mid-latitude Sea of Okhotsk responded sensitively to both temperature and rainfall, indicating the combined influence of ice sheets and low-latitude monsoons. However, silicate weathering is more sensitive to temperature in high-latitude regions, and to rainfall in tropical areas. Therefore, ice sheets primarily control silicate weathering at high latitudes, whereas monsoon rainfall has greater influences in tropical areas. These findings seem to support the “Milankovitch–Kutzbach” hypothesis, which proposes that ice sheets and monsoons together control orbital-scale climate variations of Earth."

 East Asia (EA) has experienced a decreasing trend in the summer-to-winter temperature difference (temperature seasonality) in the context of ongoing global warming. However, the impacts of natural external forcing remain unclear. The last deglaciation, marked by substantial global warming, provides a paleoclimate context for understanding the roles of natural forcing in EA temperature seasonality changes. Here, using transient simulations (iTraCE), we demonstrate that EA experienced greater winter warming compared to summer during the last deglaciation, supported by paleo-climatic reconstructions. Sensitivity experiments indicate that the inundation of continental shelf area due to rising sea-level played a critical role in driving these differential warming trends. Further quantifications highlight the contributions of greater heat capacity instead of reduced surface albedo of the expanded ocean area. Resulting atmospheric responses expanded the seasonality change to EA landmass by cloud‒radiation feedback and temperature advection processes.

Our results show that there is approximately −1.2‰ calcium isotopic fractionation between aragonite and seawater. On the other hand, the molybdenum, strontium, and neodymium isotopic compositions are similar to those found in modern seawater.

This study highlights the existence and potential importance of an ephemeral palaeolake, formed as a result of seismicity and environmental changes, for the prehistoric civilization in the Hexi Corridor, offering clues to the development of civilisation in this part of the Silk Road in relation to paleoenvironmental changes. Here we analyse sedimentary architecture and sequence chronology, suggesting ancient seismicity led to channel deformation in the valley floor, forming a natural dam and the resultant palaeolake. Drainage of the lake at 4.5 ka, linked to climate fluctuations, triggering human migration from the surrounding mountains to the lower reaches of the Hei River. Our findings reveal that rapid landform evolution probably influenced trans-Eurasian cultural exchange and delayed the formation of the Silk Road. 
                
                  
                
               An ancient lake in the Hexi Corridor, which was to become part of the Silk Road, was an important occupation site of the Hei Shan civilization for 5000 years, but its later drainage, 4500 years ago, triggered human migration from this site.

 The ocean has absorbed 25% of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions over the past 40 years, effectively slowing atmospheric carbon dioxide growth but causing ocean acidification. As acidification intensifies, the seawater absorption capacity for carbon dioxide will decline. While the Revelle factor has been used to assess carbon dioxide absorption, it becomes inapplicable at pH < 7.5. Here, we propose a new factor, γCO2, to better measure the absorption capacity for carbon dioxide and acidification. γCO2 decreases with increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide and decreased pH, indicating reduced absorption capacity and intensified acidification. In 2020, global surface ocean γCO2 was 15.50 ± 0.21, a 13% decline since 1992. Projections under SSP5-8.5 anticipate an average γCO2 of 4.72 by 2100, with 61.5% of global ocean regions below the critical threshold of γCO2 = 3.0, potentially harming aragonite-based organisms.

 Satellite land surface temperature (Ts) provides valuable information on vegetation drought stress via its physical linkage to plant stomatal activity and transpiration. New-generation geostationary satellites offer opportunities to monitor sub-diurnal variations in Ts and thus track plant physiological stress response occurring at sub-daily timescales. Nevertheless, the potential of satellite Ts and its derived metrics for early detection of vegetation drought stress before visible canopy changes occur has not been widely assessed. Here, we developed a parsimonious Surface-Air Temperature Difference Anomaly (SATDA) method for tracking vegetation drought stress using the cumulative sub-diurnal difference from late-morning to early-afternoon between Ts from the Himawari-8 geostationary satellite and hourly air temperature (Ta) from meteorological grids. SATDA utilised Ts−Ta as the physical driving gradient for sensible heat flux (H) to capture anomalous sensible heating due to reduced plant transpiration. We used SATDA to monitor the spatio-temporal patterns of the 2017–2019 Tinderbox Drought in southeast Australia. We benchmarked the skill of SATDA in forecasting visible drought-induced vegetation greenness decline against both conventional water availability-based indices (i.e., precipitation and soil moisture anomalies) and existing satellite Ts indices (i.e., Temperature Condition Index and Temperature Rise Index) across diverse climates and land covers. SATDA effectively captured a rapidly intensifying flash drought event at multi-week timescales (Jul to Sep 2019) embedded within the multi-year Tinderbox Drought, which contributed to detrimental impacts on agricultural production and increased wildfire risk. SATDA showed the best vegetation greenness forecast skill in the transitional semi-arid and sub-humid climates, with forecast correlation >0.5 at 32-day lead time. The advantage over water availability-based indices was more evident in woody-dominated ecosystems than herbaceous-dominated ecosystems, likely due to the importance of physiological regulations by trees during droughts such as deeper roots and stronger stomatal control. SATDA, based on Ts−Ta, showed overall better vegetation greenness forecasts than two Ts-only indices, especially in woody vegetation. Finally, SATDA showed consistently greater advantage over water availability-based and Ts-only indices in forecasting visible vegetation decline as the drought intensity increased. The parsimonious process-based SATDA method suits global-scale operational implementation to complement vegetation drought monitoring and early warning systems."

 The integration of machine learning (ML) algorithms with remote sensing (RS) data offers significant potential for enhancing dynamic forest characterization and change detection through high temporal density mapping. This study evaluates the effectiveness of RS-ML models for forest mapping in parts of southern Nigeria, with particular emphasis on assessing their temporal scalability using multi-sensor data from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 platforms. Three strategies were evaluated: the first involved training RS-ML model on spectral vegetation indices generated based on datasets from single date and applying it to datasets captured in different dates; the second entailed training distinct models for each datasets captured in certain time period and the third one utilized datasets from various dates (multi-temporal) to land cover mapping. Accuracy assessments of the land cover maps generated by all strategies were conducted to determine the loss of accuracy when a RS-ML model is trained and applied to another temporal dataset. The highest F1-scores for the forest class were obtained from ML-RS models trained and applied on the datasets captured in the same time period. For instance, when trained independently on datasets from January and December 2022, the model achieved F1-scores of 93.09% and 91.56% for the forest class, respectively. Conversely, a ML-RS- model trained based on both multi-temporal datasets − January and December 2022 jointly − registered a lower F1-score of 74.29% for the forest class. A similar decrease in accuracy was observed with a another multi-temporal (multi-season) model trained jointly on data from December 2022 and December 2023, resulting in an F1-score of 71.58%. This indicates a significant drop in accuracy when multi-temporal features are used for forest mapping. Thus, for further analysis of forest change mapping, the most accurate forest maps were utilized generated by using models with the highest F1-scores. Although the ML-RS models are highly accurate for specific dates, their temporal scalability poses a challenge propably due to the specific tropical conditions. Therefore, for land cover mapping it is crucial to select models that align with the specific temporal and environmental conditions and provide high accuracy. To address this challenge, the study recommends prioritizing adaptive modeling strategies. These strategies involve continuously updating and retraining ML-RS models to ensure they remain accurate over different periods, thereby improving the reliability of forest mapping over time. This approach emphasizes the importance of model selection based on the intended application period and environmental variability, to ensure the generation of accurate and reliable forest maps."

 Coal fires present significant global environmental and energy challenges, posing substantial barriers to achieving carbon-neutral goals. Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing (TIRS) technology, which is used to retrieve land surface temperatures, plays a crucial role in detecting coal fires. However, its accuracy suffers from solar radiation interference. In addition, there is limited research focused specifically on detecting coal fires over large areas. In this paper, thermal anomaly indices (TAIs), derived from short-wave infrared and near-infrared data, were selected for coal fire detection due to their relatively low sensitivity to solar radiation. Using these TAIs alongside other remote sensing (RS) indices, a coal fire detection model (CFDM) was developed and trained using the AutoGluon machine learning (ML) framework. The model is capable of identifying large-scale coal fire target areas without relying on deformation associated with coal fires. CFDM outperformed other ML algorithms, achieving Recall, Precision, F1-score, and Kappa coefficient values of 0.89, 0.94, 0.93, and 0.92, respectively. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were used to evaluate the importance of different features, validating the model’s reliability and interoperability. The model’s robustness has been further demonstrated using observed coal fire points over Xinjiang, China, and Jharkhand, India. A T-test confirms that the proposed CFDM is significantly superior to TAIs-based methods, offering better differentiation of coal fires from other thermal anomalies and reducing commission errors."

 Accurately monitoring impervious surface (IS) changes is vital for assessing the effects of urbanization on human activities and its broader environmental, economic, and social sustainability. However, optical building shadows pose significant challenges for IS extraction in high-density urban core areas. Even though combining optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery makes it easier to identify impervious surfaces, buildings block SAR signals, causing them to mix with optical shadows. Ascending (AS) and descending (DE) SAR imagery offer potential solutions due to their AS/DE characteristics. This study proposes an IS extraction method utilizing hierarchical samples, optical and AS/DE SAR imagery (HS-OAD). Firstly, the AS/DE SAR-based shadowed index (ADSI) is proposed by analyzing the characteristics of building shadowed areas. Then, the OTSU method is adopted to threshold imagery into non-shadowed areas, optically shadowed areas, and SAR shadowed areas. Within each area type, samples representing four urban land covers—IS, vegetation, bare soil, and water bodies—are comprehensively labeled. Subsequently, a random forest classifier is employed to extract IS integrating optical, AS SAR, and DE SAR imagery. The results indicated that the integration of AS and DE SAR imagery significantly reduces the misclassification of IS and water bodies within optically shadowed areas. Furthermore, the hierarchical samples enhance the classification accuracy and reduce the misclassification between IS and vegetation in optically shadowed areas. Moreover, samples labeled in SAR-shadowed areas contribute to the reduction of misclassification between IS and bare soil. Our proposed method performed well in high-density urban core areas with extensive shadows, achieving an overall accuracy of 89.61% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.79."

 Anthropogenic pressure on urban air quality is a concerning issue, and the transport sector plays a crucial role contributing with exhaust and non-exhaust emissions, such as Tyre and Road Wear Particles (TRWPs). TRWPs can accumulate on roadsides, be carried by stormwaters, and enter the atmosphere, together with their additives. Benzothiazoles (BTHs) are a family of compounds mostly employed as rubber additives in tire production, but they are also exploited in other applications. In urban environments, airborne BTHs are strongly linked to TRWPs, and they are potentially exploitable as traffic markers. Considering the limited information on airborne BTHs, and the unexplored potentiality as markers, a deepening on their occurrences, sources, and possible degradation phenomena was needed. PM10 aerosol samples were collected from thirteen cities in Northern Italy. BTH-SO3H was the most concentrated (up to 7 ng m−3), followed by BTH-MeS, BTH and BTH-OH. Cities close to airports showed a higher presence of BTHs, possibly indicating a new source for these compounds. BTH-SCNMeS, known to be easily degradable, was found in relative high concentrations (0.2 ± 0.1 ng m−3) only in Montebello Vicentino station, which is close to an industrial area with several leather manufacturing industry. In Aosta, at 580 m a.s.l., BTH-SH and BTH-NH2 were found higher than other stations, possibly indicating an additional apport from antifreeze liquids and stainless-steel industry.

 This study investigates the trend and health risk associated with carcinogenic particulate nitrosamines in the atmosphere of Seoul, South Korea from 2013 to 2019. The average concentration of five particulate nitrosamines (NDEA, NDBA, NPIP, NPYR, and NMEA) during this period was 3.94 ± 8.38 ng/m3, while seven particulate nitrosamines (including NDMA and NMOR) averaged 8.96 ± 16.94 ng/m3. Mann-Kendall analysis revealed that while overall nitrosamine levels showed no notable trend, decreasing trends were observed for NDMA (τ = −0.12, p < 0.05) and NDEA (τ = −0.45, p < 0.001), while NDBA showed an increasing trend (τ = 0.20, p < 0.001). Analysis of correlations of the observed nitrosamines with primary emission indicators (PAHs and CO) and atmospheric reactants (NO, NO2, and O3) suggests contributions from both primary emissions and secondary formation processes. Nitrosation appears to be the major reaction pathway, particularly in cold seasons, as evidenced by strong correlations with NO2 and liquid water content, while ozonation could affect the particulate nitrosamines formation in warm season. A health risk assessment was conducted using Monte Carlo simulations based on the Korean exposure factors database. The median cumulative lifetime cancer risk from particulate nitrosamines in Seoul was estimated at 10−7 to 10−5, which falls within the generally acceptable risk range (10−6 to 10−4). The highest risks were observed in winter 2018 (ranging from 7.16·10−7 to 6.10·10−6), with the age group 3–19 showing the highest risk levels. The risk levels in Seoul were comparable to those observed in other urban areas such as Chuncheon, Korea and North Kensington, UK (∼10−6). The increasing trend in nitrosamine concentrations, despite being within acceptable risk ranges, highlights the need for continued monitoring and potential mitigation strategies, particularly during winter months when risk levels are elevated."

 In this study, we investigated the temporal variation of outdoor radon (222Rn) and its decay products (218Po, 214Pb, 214Bi, 210Pb), focusing on their relationship with boundary layer height (BLH), meteorological factors and particulate matters (PM2.5 and PM10) measured in Bratislava, Slovakia. The activity concentrations of radon and its short−lived progeny show a pronounced diurnal pattern, with highest levels in the early morning (03:00–05:00) and lowest in the afternoon (14:00–16:00), with a distinct seasonality. Seasonal variations of radon and its decay products show elevated concentrations during late autumn and winter and lowest concentrations during spring and summer. The diurnal and seasonal variations of radon and its progeny were observed to be primarily governed by BLH. The mean ± std. deviation of the radon equilibrium factor was found to be 0.44 ± 0.26, with relatively clear diurnal and seasonal patterns influenced mainly by atmospheric pressure and BLH. The ratios of radon decay products (218Po/222Rn, 214Pb/218Po, and 214Bi/214Pb) show distinct diurnal and seasonal variability, highlighting periods of disequilibrium between them. In particular, the 214Bi/214Pb ratio showed a strong positive correlation with BLH, suggesting its potential use as an indicator of atmospheric mixing and stability. Canonical correlation analysis revealed a positive association between radon and its progeny with PM concentration. This highlights their similar atmospheric behaviour and the effect of pollution events in increasing the radon and its decay products levels. In addition, the mean aerosols residence times derived from the ratios of 210Pb/214Pb, 210Pb/214Bi and 210Pb/222Rn ranged from 0.35 to 6.73 d, which agrees with previous studies."

 The Mentawai Islands, located in the eastern Indian Ocean approximately 150 km west of Sumatera, experience precipitation patterns heavily influenced by the eastward propagation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). This study investigates the impact of the MJO on local precipitation patterns, with a specific focus on diurnal cycles, during the rainy season (November–March, NDJFM). The analysis is based on Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) data spanning from 2000 to 2022. It emphasizes diurnal patterns through the lens of precipitation amount (PA), precipitation frequency (PF), and precipitation intensity (PI). The size of the islands strongly shapes the diurnal precipitation patterns during the rainy season. On Siberut, the largest island, two pronounce precipitation peaks are observed: one in the afternoon (15 LST) and another in the early morning (04 LST). Two precipitation peaks were also observed in South Pagai, with an earlier early morning peak (02 LST) and an early afternoon peak (13 LST), exhibiting weaker afternoon peak values compared to those in Siberut. The early afternoon precipitation peak on larger islands suggests a dominant role of local convection in the diurnal precipitation system of the Mentawai Islands. In contrast, the smaller islands—Sipora and North Pagai—exhibit a single precipitation peak at 02 LST, dominated primarily by offshore precipitation propagation from Sumatera. The presence of the Mentawai Islands has been observed to disrupt the offshore propagation of convective systems during nighttime, as indicated by the disruption of PI propagation. However, this disruption becomes negligible when nighttime low-level winds from Sumatera strengthen during MJO phases 2–3. During these enhanced phases, the intensified offshore propagation from Sumatera significantly impacts both the peak values and timings of early morning precipitation in the Mentawai Islands. The enhancement of offshore precipitation propagation during phases 2–3 shifts the peak timing of early morning precipitation in the Mentawai mainland forward by 2 h. This shift in peak timing is particularly pronounced on the smaller islands, where stronger low-level winds associated with the MJO enhance precipitation propagation toward the Mentawai Islands. Understanding the MJO's influence on precipitation patterns in this region is critical for improving weather prediction models and enhancing preparedness for extreme weather events."

In typical SMMs, key properties like magnetic anisotropy and slow magnetic relaxation are imposed by complex ligand shells, whose bulky and three-dimensional structures hamper efficient manipulation of the molecular magnetism by chemical methods. This work demonstrates highly selective redox doping of an Fe4nanomagnet on a Pb(111) surface using lithium atoms. Scanning tunneling microscopy, x-ray absorption spectroscopy, and ab initio calculations reveal the cooperative incorporation of three Li atoms per Fe4molecule, resulting in a selective, threefold reduction of its iron-based magnetic core. The doping modifies the intramolecular exchange interaction, turning from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic, and changes the molecular magnetic anisotropy from easy-axis to easy-plane. This study demonstrates successful chemical redox doping of individual polynuclear molecular magnets, exploits a rare showcase of cooperative binding, and highlights a route for tuning magnetic properties of complex SMMs."

However, our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms is limited. Here, we found reduced expression of zinc finger protein with Krüppel-associated box and SCAN domains 4 (Zkscan4) in the hippocampi of patients with major depressive disorder and stress-susceptible mice. Zkscan4 disruption (Zkscan4−/−) was sufficient to induce depression-like behaviors following subthreshold social stress. Zkscan4 regulated excitatory synaptic transmission mainly through direct interaction with theHtr2apromoter and the recruitment of glucocorticoid receptors for the transcriptional repression of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2a (Htr2a). Reduced excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus and stress susceptibility inZkscan4−/−mice were restored by pharmacological inhibition, genetic knockdown of Htr2a, or overexpression of the amino-terminal SCAN domain of Zkscan4 (Zkscan41–133) in cornus ammonis region 3.

Because this field was likely stronger than that predicted by scaling laws for core convection dynamos, a longstanding hypothesis is that an ancient dynamo was amplified by plasma from basin-forming impacts. However, there have been no self-consistent models that quantify whether this process can generate the required field intensities. Our impact and magnetohydrodynamic simulations show that for an initial maximum surface field of only 2 microtesla, plasmas created from basin-forming impacts can amplify a planetary dipole field at the basin antipode to ~43 microtesla. This process, coupled with impact-induced body pressure waves focusing at the antipode, could produce magnetization that can account for the crustal fields observed today."

NAECs were differentiated, followed by single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and in vitro RSV infection. Gene expression of NAECs from children with a wheeze phenotype indicated abnormal differentiation and basal cell activation of developmental pathways, plasticity in precursor differentiation, delayed onset of maturation, increased diversity of RSV receptors, and blunted antiviral immune responses to in vitro RSV infection. The most marked changes in differentiation were observed in NAECs from children with both wheeze and RSV in the first year of life.

Through weighted correlation network analysis of 3164 lipid species from 930 samples, we identified 16 structurally distinct lipid clusters co-occurred across diverse oceanographic conditions. The highest lipid diversity was observed in the polar oceans, where plankton uses chain shortening for cold acclimation. Conversely, in the surface of tropical and subtropical oceans, plankton showed enrichment in non-phosphorus lipids, likely responding to warm temperature, with potential implications for the elemental stoichiometry of the biological pump.

These distinct functions arise from preferential innervation of striatal D1-SPNs by M1 and D2-SPNs by PrL, respectively. In a Shank3 knockout mouse model of ASD, the D1/D2 innervation ratio in the PrL-DMS pathway was reversed, leading to impaired action switching and repetitive behaviors.

Through biological, metabolic, and omic approaches, we now show that LSD1i acts as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressor, activating the integrated stress response and altering mitochondrial structure and function. These effects impair TICs’ oxidative metabolism and generate reactive oxygen species, further amplifying cellular stress. LSD1i also impairs TICs’ glycolytic activity, causing their metabolic decline. TICs with enhanced glycolysis benefit from LSD1-directed therapy. Conversely, metabolically silent TICs mantain ER and mitochondrial homeostasis, adapting to stress conditions, including LSD1i treatment. A dropout short hairpin RNA screening identifies postglycosylphosphatidylinositol attachment to proteins inositol deacylase 1 (PGAP1) as a mediator of resistance to LSD1i.

However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, using a mouse model of chronic restraint stress (CRS), we observed a notable increase in the activity, rather than its overall expression level, of hippocampal Rap1, a small guanosine triphosphatase belonging to the Ras superfamily. Pharmacological inhibition of Rap1 activity in the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) effectively mitigated CRS-induced anxiety. Cell type–specific manipulation of Rap1 activity revealed that Rap1 dysfunction in vHPC pyramidal neurons (PNs), but not in astrocytes or interneurons, contributed to CRS-induced anxiety-like behaviors. Mechanistically, the heightened Rap1 activity in vHPC PNs augmented their intrinsic excitability through Kv4.2 phosphorylation at the Thr607site, which contributes to the onset of anxiety-like behaviors in mice following CRS.

To overcome these issues, we introduce a universal alcohol-based molecule coupling (AMC) method to regulate amorphousness and inhibit V dissolution in VOs (VO2, V2O5, and V6O13), resulting in high-performance cathodes. The strategy enables alcohol molecules with different chain lengths (ethanol, isopropanol, and isobutanol) to couple with VOs by forming V─OH bonds under Lewis acid–based interactions, inducing controlled amorphization. Among these, isopropanol coupling stands out by enabling the formation of short-range ordered amorphous structure (SOA-VO/Ipr). This structure enhances the reaction kinetics and suppresses V dissolution. As a result, the SOA-VO/Ipr cathode achieves 219.4 mAh g−1at 100 A g−1, retains 92.6% capacity over 10,000 cycles, and delivers 228.8 mAh g−1at 9.1 A g−1under high loading (21.9 mg cm−2) over 3500 cycles, demonstrating a promising method for durable zinc-ion batteries."

Conditional knockout ofPtmain cardiomyocytes impaired neonatal heart regeneration. AAV9-mediated overexpression ofPtmaextended the neonatal proliferative window and showed therapeutic promise for enhancing adult heart regeneration. Mechanistically, PTMA interacted with MBD3, inhibiting its deacetylation activity within the MBD3/HDAC1 NuRD complex.

Using CRISPR-mediated knockout, cell surface clustering assays, and coimmunoprecipitation, we show that SCRIB and PSD93 bind to and are required for AIS Kv1 channel clustering, whereas SCRIB links the AIS Kv1 channel protein complex to the master AIS scaffolding protein AnkyrinG. These results define a hierarchy of scaffolding proteins that combine to cluster AIS Kv1 channels."

Our transcriptomics and bioenergetic profiling data reveal that mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is a metabolic vulnerability of MRT and can be exploited to overcome consumptive hypoxia by repurposing an FDA-approved antimalarial drug, atovaquone (AVO). We then establish the utility of oxygen-enhanced-multispectral optoacoustic tomography, a label-free, ionizing radiation-free imaging modality, to visualize and quantify spatiotemporal changes in tumor hypoxia in response to AVO. We show a potent but transient increase in tumor oxygenation upon AVO treatment that results in complete elimination of tumors in all tested mice when combined with 10-gray radiotherapy, a dose several times lower than the current clinic standard. Last, we use translational mathematical modeling for systematic evaluation of dosing regimens, administration timing, and therapeutic synergy in a virtual patient cohort. Together, our work establishes a framework for safe and pediatric patient-friendly image-guided metabolic radiosensitization of rhabdoid tumors."

However, whether small nucleolar RNAs participate in the regulation of ISC self-renewal remains unclear. Here, we identified a small nucleolar RNA (Snora54) that was highly expressed in the nucleolus of ISCs.Snora54knockout enhanced the self-renewal capacity of ISCs and intestinal regeneration. Mechanistically, in a steady state, highly expressedSnora54anchored the nucleolar protein Lyar in the nucleolus of ISCs, preventing Lyar from translocation into the nucleoplasm. Thereby, Lyar failed to recruit on theNotch2promoter region in the nucleoplasm to promoteNotch2transcription, leading to suppression of ISC self-renewal. By contrast, with deletion ofSnora54, Lyar translocated to the nucleoplasm of ISCs where it enriched on theNotch2promoter to initiate its transcription resulting in the activation of Notch2 signaling pathway. Therefore,Snora54negatively regulates self-renewal of ISCs and gut regeneration via suppression of Notch2 signaling."

Here, we use atomic-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and field-emission resonance (FER) spectroscopy to elucidate the structure and properties of atomically thin boron phases grown on Cu(111). Specifically, FER spectroscopy reveals charge transfer and electronic states that strongly differ from the decoupled borophene phases observed on silver, suggesting that the deposition of boron on copper results in strong covalent bonding characteristic of a 2D copper boride. This conclusion is reinforced by detailed STM characterization of line defects that are consistent with density functional theory calculations for atomically thin Cu8B14.

Tumor vasculature also plays a pivotal role in immunoregulation and antitumor immunity. Here, we show that small GTPase Rab27 controls the vascular morphogenesis and permeability for blood content and immune effectors. Thus, in Rab27a/b double knock out (Rab27-dKO) mice, the brain vasculature is abnormally scarce, while the blood vessels become dysmorphic and hyperpermeable in the context of brain tumors, including syngeneic glioblastoma. These defects are reflected in rearrangements of endothelial cell subpopulations with underlying diminution of venous endothelial subtype along with changes in gene and protein expression. Notably, Rab27-dKO brain endothelial cells exhibit deficient tight junctions, whereby they enable large-scale extravasation of cytotoxic T cells into the tumor mass.

The settling dynamics of particles are influenced by their macroscale shape, mesoscale roundness, and microscale surface properties, along with ambient fluid flow conditions. Variations in the wettability of submillimeter MPs affect molecular interactions at the particle–water interface, altering the microscopic flow field and subsequently modifying drag forces during settling. This study examines the impact of wettability on the settling behavior of aged acrylonitrile butadiene styrene MPs by measuring their settling velocities and contact angles. It was shown that increased wettability promotes the settlement of the MPs. A drag model incorporating the Eötvös number─a dimensionless ratio of buoyancy energy to contact angle-derived surface energy─is developed to quantify the relationship between interfacial chemistry and hydrodynamic resistance. Unlike the conventional models, our model considers wettability as a key factor controlling the settling of MP particles. The model was validated using independently measured data and four sets of published data for the MPs. Results demonstrate that the model significantly improves the accuracy of the settling predictions for weathering spherical MPs. Additionally, by integrating the shape factor, it effectively accounts for the settling behavior of irregularly shaped MPs using published data sets. This improvement enhances predictability for MP transport pathways, helping assess MP accumulation zones and potential ecological risks in marine and freshwater systems."

Inspired by how natural minerals incorporate Hg impurities within crystalline structures through isomorphous substitution, we design an iron-phosphate framework (NH4)Fe2(PO4)2(OH)·2H2O (denoted as NFP) for highly effective Hg sequestration. With its large quantities of negatively charged oxygen-rich channels, NFP effectively attracts Hg and physically entraps the ions by forming Hg–O coordination bonds. Thus, NFP renders fast kinetics and high capacity for Hg adsorption, ensuring extremely low Hg release and minimal microbial methylation potential. Regulating crystal facets decreases the ion exchange energy between NFP and Hg2+, further enhancing the effectiveness of NFP. Notably, mimicking natural mineral formation not only endows NFP with high environmental compatibility and versatility.

However, the specific response of the dayside ionospheric electric field and its influence on the equatorial electrojet (EEJ) remain controversial. This study investigates the electromagnetic field response in the dayside equatorial region during isolated substorms using ground magnetic field data. Statistical analysis revealed that the H component decreased at equatorial and low‐latitude stations during isolated substorms. These decreases were of similar magnitude on average, indicating that significant changes in the EEJ caused by penetrating electric fields were not observed. However, individual events showed slight positive and negative variations. These results suggest that substorm‐associated electric fields can reach equatorial regions, but additional conditions determine the positive and negative variations.

This study examines spatial precipitation patterns and their implications on urban hydrology over Chennai (a coastal megacity in South India) using geostationary satellite data from 2014 to 2022. An object detection algorithm (YOLOv5) was employed to identify core rainfall regions of propagating coastal storms and track their motion, detecting 55 and 71 rainfall events in urban and rural regions, respectively. Results show that urban regions experience a maximum downwind shift of ∼20 km in peak rainfall accumulation from the coastline, compared to a ∼12 km downwind shift in rural regions. However, differences in rainfall intensity during these propagating storms over the urban and rural cases were not significant. The convection‐permitting simulations of propagating storms revealed that the urban heat island effect drives warm‐moist easterly winds inland (relative to the rural region), leading to convergence and rainfall closer to the urban‐rural boundary on the downwind side. Further LULC sensitivity experiments indicate weakened penetration of easterlies, shifting convergence, and rainfall closer to the coastline when urbanization effects are absent. Hydrological model forced with simulated rainfall captured the observed reservoir inflows accurately. Specifically, the atmosphere‐hydrological coupled simulations showed higher cumulative reservoir inflow (∼41.64%) and river inflow into the city (∼49.3%) due to the urban‐induced spatial shift in the rainfall. These findings highlight that urban‐induced shifts in rainfall patterns from heavy storms, rather than increased intensity, can significantly impact river flow and heighten riverine flooding risks in coastal megacities."

Based on Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) data, land grid data from ECMWF Re‐Analysis project data‐Interim (ERA‐Interim), ECMWF Scheme for Surface Exchanges over Land incorporating land surface hydrology (ERA5‐land) and Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model 4 (GLEAM4) global land flux network (FLUXNET) data and weather observation data, the variability of the response of land‐atmosphere coupling processes to climate warming with the spatial change of the climate background in northern China was analyzed. The response mechanisms of the coupling processes between land evapotranspiration and soil moisture, and between surface net radiation and soil moisture to the spatial change of precipitation climate space (defined by the annual mean value of a given physical quantity) were investigated. Additionally, the effect of climate space on land‐atmosphere coupling characteristics was investigated. Results indicate that there were significant spatial differences in the trends of temperature and precipitation variation in northern China, and the characteristics of land‐atmosphere coupling in response to climate change were strongly reliant on the energy and moisture constraints in climate space. The summer monsoon transitional region (SMTR) was found to be a climate‐sensitive zone with competition between moisture and energy, where the response of land‐surface physical quantities to climate change underwent a radical transformation, and land‐atmosphere coupling processes displayed both positive feedback (temperature increasing→soil moisture decreasing→net radiation decreasing→temperature increasing) and negative feedback (temperature increasing→soil moisture decreasing→net radiation increasing→temperature decreasing) to climate warming. These findings would improve the scientific understanding of the characteristics and mechanisms of land‐atmosphere coupling processes for a heterogeneous underlying surface, and may provide an important theoretical basis for climate prediction in northern China."

Here, authors propose that these planets are surviving remnants of planet accretion during the end stages of stellar infall. 
 Exoplanetary systems that contain multiple planets on short-period orbits appear to be prevalent in the current observed exoplanetary population, yet the processes that give rise to such configurations remain poorly understood. A common prior assumption is that planetary accretion commences after the infall of gas and solids to the circumstellar disk ended. However, observational evidence indicates that accretion may begin earlier. We propose that compact systems are surviving remnants of planet accretion that occurred during the final phases of infall. In regions of the disk experiencing ongoing infall, the planetary mass is set by the balance between accretion of infalling solids and the increasingly rapid inward migration driven by the surrounding gas as the planet grows. This balance selects for similarly-sized planets whose mass is a function of infall and disk conditions. We show that infall-produced planets can survive until the gas disk disperses and migration ends, and that across a broad range of conditions, the mass of surviving systems is regulated to a few  × 10−5 to 10−4 times the host star’s mass. This provides an explanation for the similar mass ratios of known compact systems. Compact exoplanetary systems masses have a similar mass ratio compared to the host star’s mass.

 Clinical genetic testing identifies variants causal for hereditary cancer, information that is used for risk assessment and clinical management. Unfortunately, some variants identified are of uncertain clinical significance (VUS), complicating patient management. Case-control data is one evidence type used to classify VUS. As an initiative of the Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles (ENIGMA) Analytical Working Group we analyze germline sequencing data of BRCA1 and BRCA2 from 96,691 female breast cancer cases and 302,116 controls from three studies: the BRIDGES study of the Breast Cancer Association Consortium, the Cancer Risk Estimates Related to Susceptibility consortium, and the UK Biobank. We observe 11,207 BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants, with 6909 being coding, covering 23.4% of BRCA1 and BRCA2 VUS in ClinVar and 19.2% of ClinVar curated (likely) benign or pathogenic variants. Case-control likelihood ratio (ccLR) evidence is highly consistent with ClinVar assertions for (likely) benign or pathogenic variants; exhibiting 99.1% sensitivity and 95.3% specificity for BRCA1 and 93.3% sensitivity and 86.6% specificity for BRCA2. This approach provides case-control evidence for 787 unclassified variants; these include 579 with strong or moderate benign evidence and 10 with strong pathogenic evidence for which ccLR evidence is sufficient to alter clinical classification.

 Current catalysts face challenges with low formate selectivity at high current densities during the CO2 electroreduction. Here, we showcase a versatile strategy to enhance the formate production on p-block metal-based catalysts by incorporating noble metal atoms on their surface, refining oxygen affinity, and tuning adsorption of the critical oxygen-bound *OCHO intermediate. The formate yield is observed to afford a volcano-like dependence on the *OCHO binding strength across a series of modified catalysts. The rhodium-dispersed indium oxide (Rh/In2O3) catalyst exhibits impressive performances, achieving Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) of formate exceeding 90% across a broad current density range of 0.20 to 1.21 A cm−2. In situ Raman spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the oxophilic Rh site facilitates *OCHO formation by optimizing its adsorption energy, placing Rh/In2O3 near the volcano-shaped apex. A bipolar electrosynthesis system, coupling the CO2 reduction at the cathode with the formaldehyde oxidative dehydrogenation at the anode, further boosts the FE of formate to nearly 190% with pure hydrogen generation under an ampere-level current density and a low cell voltage of 2.5 V in a membrane electrode assembly cell.

Here, the authors design a dual-site Pt/CeO₂ catalyst that enables selective hydrogenation of S-nitroarenes by separating catalytic roles. 
 The liquid phase hydrogenation of nitroarenes is an important industrial reaction. The active sites are typically supported metal nanoparticles, which can be easily deactivated when sulfur groups are present in the substrate. Here, we report a new strategy for converting these S-containing nitroarenes by developing a dual-sites Pt/CeO2 catalyst consisting of highly defective CeO2 with abundant active oxygen vacancy and Pt sub-nano clusters. The hydrogenation of the nitro group in S-containing nitroarenes is induced to occur on the oxygen vacancies of the support rather than on the metal nanoparticles, which act only as the site of activating H2 by spillover. This functionality is not inhibited by strong chemisorption of the reactant S-groups, which is different from the hydrogenation of the nitro groups. Spillover H migrates to the oxygen vacancy site on the surface of defective CeO2, where the nitro-group is activated and reduced. This unconventional mechanism of hydrogenation is proven by combining many characterizations, theoretical modelling, kinetic and poisoning experiments. The best Pt/CeO2-300 catalyst shows a high reaction rate of 3.9 mmol·gcat.−1·h−1 with 5-amino benzothiazole selectivity of > 99%. It could produce over 145 kg·kgPt−1 of pure 5-amino benzothiazole in 250 hours on stream under continuous flow conditions. It is also proven and quantified by studying several molecules with different sizes and electronic structures that the accessibility of the -NO2 group to the Pt surface determines where the nitro groups are hydrogenated. Larger conjugated structures inhibit accessibility to the Pt surface of the -NO2 group, making it more prone to vacancy-activated nitro groups. This study provides valuable insights into the rational design and precise development of catalysts for the hydrogenation of liquid-phase chemicals containing S-groups. Liquid-phase hydrogenation of nitroarenes is a key industrial process, but conventional supported metal nanoparticles often suffer deactivation in the presence of sulfur-containing groups.

 Cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors (PRR) for double-stranded RNA, such as RIG-I/MDA5, are key mediators of anti-viral responses. Here we screen for synergistic drug-virotherapy combinations and find that the reovirus type III Dearing strain (Rt3D)-palbociclib combination augments oncolytic virus-induced stress responses and increases interferon production and signaling. Data from RIG-I agonist and ER stress-inducing agents further confirms the crosstalk between RNA-sensing and ER stress in inducing cancer cell death and interferon production. Combined Rt3D-palbociclib also increases innate immune activation and IFN-induced HLA expression within tumor cells, with accompanying alterations in the epigenetic landscape and endogenous retroviral (ERV) elements. Analysis of the immunopeptidome in treated cells further reveals changes to HLA-captured peptides, including altered expression of peptides from cancer or testis antigens and ERVs.

 Tumor-initiating cells (TICs) share features and regulatory pathways with normal stem cells, yet how the stem cell niche contributes to tumorigenesis remains unclear. Here, we identify CXCR4+ macrophages as a niche population enriched in normal mammary ducts, where they promote the regenerative activity of basal cells in response to luminal cell-derived CXCL12. CXCL12 triggers AKT-mediated stabilization of β-catenin, which induces Wnt ligands and pro-migratory genes, enabling intraductal macrophage infiltration and supporting regenerative activity of basal cells. Notably, these same CXCR4+ niche macrophages regulate the tumor-initiating activity of various breast cancer subtypes by enhancing TIC survival and tumor-forming capacity, while promoting early immune evasion through regulatory T cell induction. Furthermore, a CXCR4+ niche macrophage gene signature correlates with poor prognosis in human breast cancer. These findings highlight the pivotal role of the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis in orchestrating interactions between niche macrophages, mammary epithelial cells, and immune cells, thereby establishing a supportive niche for both normal tissue regeneration and mammary tumor initiation.

Recent developments in integrated photonics have advanced chip-scale OFCs, enabling on-chip OFC generation via the Kerr or electro-optic (EO) effect. However, these nonlinear processes can occur simultaneously and are often accompanied by parasitic effects, like Raman scattering, which may impede broadband and low-noise microcomb generation. Here, we harness these interactions to demonstrate a novel OFC, the self-locked Raman-electro-optic (REO) microcomb in a lithium niobate microresonator. By leveraging the collaboration of EO, Kerr and Raman scattering, the REO microcomb spans over 300 nm (~1400 lines) with a 26.03 GHz repetition rate, achieving low-noise operation without external feedback. Our approach points to a direction for improving the performance of microcombs and paves the way for exploring new nonlinear physics, such as new laser locking techniques, through the multi-nonlinear synergy. Optical frequency combs power technologies like communication but face stability issues in miniaturization.

 Lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are highly responsive to environmental change. Spatiotemporal variations in the lake surface water temperature (LSWT) significantly impact regional ecosystem stability, carbon cycling, and regional climate. However, due to limited observations, the intra-lake heterogeneity of LSWT and its driving forces remain unclear. By employing multi-source datasets, especially observation-constrained LSWT and lake inflow data, along with the random forest method, we analyzed three TP lakes (Nam Co, Siling Co, and Paiku Co) during 2001‒2019. No evident inter-annual LSWT changes were detected. Lake inflow (up to 40% contribution) was the main driver of LSWT variations from July to November, followed by air temperature. Spatially, LSWT intra-lake heterogeneity varied among lakes, with Siling Co showing the largest difference (nearly 4 °C) in autumn, mainly caused by river inflow locations and lake bathymetry. This study improves our understanding of the spatiotemporal variations of LWST for high-mountain lakes, providing insights for climate-change adaptation and water resources management."

 Biomineralization has existed on Earth for billions of years, documenting life evolution history and major geological events. However, determining the origins of putative biogenic minerals remains a persistent challenge. A prime example is the micrometer-sized fossil magnetite crystals (giant magnetofossils) discovered in global marine sediments, dating from the present to 97 Ma ago. Their origin remains unclear because their shape and size are different from any known nanometer-sized magnetite produced by magnetotactic bacteria. Here, we present three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of giant magnetofossils with nanometer resolution, and report two new morphologies of giant magnetofossils. By identifying diagnostic 3D morphological, crystallographic, and micromagnetic features, our results provide key identification criteria for giant magnetofossils and suggest a potential biologically controlled mineralization origin.

 Global warming is altering flood risks induced by rain-on-snow events. However, decision-makers lack guidance on how rain-on-snow induced extreme floods could be altered with warming. Here, storyline analyses using a kilometer-scale land surface model reveal diverse responses of four historically-impactful, decision-relevant rain-on-snow induced extreme flood events over the contiguous U.S. to warming, due to alterations in their water budgets. For the 2017-Feb California floods, runoff first increases and then decreases with warming, peaking under the +3 K scenario, while runoff of the 2017-Jan California floods increases monotonically by ~53%/K. Contrastingly, runoff of the 1996-Jan Mid-Atlantic floods decreases gradually with warming. Despite these differences, warming generally shifts flood-generating regimes along elevation profiles. High elevations could experience notably increased runoff, while low elevations encounter a shift from rain-on-snow-driven to rainfall-dominated runoff. These findings underscore the need for flood control planning to quantify region- and elevation-specific changes in rain-on-snow events in a warmer climate.

 Radiative transfer models (RTM) enable the simulation of remote sensing observations and can therefore be useful for sensitivity analyses and model inversions, for example to determine the biophysical properties of vegetation. For this purpose, the calculation of observation derivatives is crucial. In this study, we propose to differentiate vegetation RTM based on Monte Carlo Ray tracing, PolVRT, as a function of the leaf area index (LAI). The variation of LAI is done considering the average leaf area (u). The difference between simulations corresponding to two areas close to each other (u and u′) is used to calculate the derivative as the limit when u′ approaches u. We propose in this work to adjust traced paths for u to simulate (u′), but such paths are weighted to correct their bias. This weighting is based on the technique of Importance Sampling. It increases the weighting of likely paths and conversely decreases it of unlikely ones. We have made a correction for the hot spot effect, since there is a strong dependency between the incident and backscattered paths. Our approach performances are verified using some discrete ROMC scene parameters and compared with the standard finite difference technique."

 Slow-moving landslides pose a substantial threat to communities and infrastructure, with annual creeping distances ranging from a few mm to hundreds of meters. To protect local communities from the landslide motion, landslide displacement retrieving or monitoring is necessary. However, traditional field investigations are time- and labor-consuming, which may limit the understanding of the landslide evolution and thereby mitigation. We propose a new 4D landslide displacement framework, combining satellite-based structure-from-motion, cross-correlation feature tracking for horizontal ground-surface deformation measurements with COSI-Corr, and DEM differencing for vertical ground-surface deformation. We apply this method to very high resolution (0.5 m) optical stereo images acquired by the Pléiades satellite constellation. We use our method to monitor the annual movement of the ‘La Valette’ landslide in the French Alps, between 2012 and 2022. During this period, the landslide moved most actively during the years 2012 and 2013, with average 3D displacement rates of 1.22 and 0.89 cm / day, respectively. Furthermore, we found a decelerating trend in movement rates from 2012 to 2022, which we attribute to warmer weather, decreasing precipitation rates, drier air conditions, and the implementation of a drainage installation.

Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and pentachlorobenzene (PeCB) were analyzed in samples collected from 2008 to 2020 and 2013 to 2020, respectively. HCB showed a 13 % annual mean decline in air concentrations, but its mean concentration (255 pg/m3) remained 4.5 times higher than the mean concentration observed in the northern hemisphere. PeCB concentrations showed no significant temporal trends, indicating stabilized atmospheric levels. HCB displayed clear seasonal variations (summer > fall > spring > winter), while PeCB concentrations were slightly elevated during warmer seasons. Both compounds exhibited significantly higher air concentrations at urban and industrial sites than at suburban sites, with major industrial hubs like Ulsan, Gyeonggi, and Daegu identified as hotspots. While soil concentrations showed no temporal variation, they demonstrated distinct spatial patterns. HCB levels were potentially influenced by long-range atmospheric transport from continental Asia, while PeCB levels were attributed to soil re-volatilization. Fugacity fractions indicated that PeCB has reached stagnation levels, controlled by secondary sources (net volatilization), while HCB is approaching stagnation, exhibiting equilibrium conditions.

 Atmospheric heatwave events have substantial socioeconomic impacts, which have been widely studied under global climate change. This study investigates the characteristics and differences between long-lived and short-lived heatwave events (LHWs and SHWs). First, we identify heatwave events over the Western North America (WNA) over 1981–2022 and categorize them based on the 90th percentile of their duration parameter. Then, we reveal that the LHWs exhibit stronger surface warming with a stronger and thicker warm layer. Circulation anomalies show an anomalous ridge above the WNA, which is more persistent with a greater central value of positive geopotential height anomalies for LHWs. Furthermore, we reveal the important role of mid-to-high-latitude teleconnection in maintaining the LHWs. We find that the diabatic heating released by increased precipitation near Japan can excite Rossby wave trains crossing the Pacific Ocean, and then reach North America, which contributes to maintaining the anomalous ridge of LHWs. Moreover, positive diabatic heating anomalies, related to land-atmosphere interaction, in Central Siberia are also favorable for the generation or persistence of the anomalous ridge and thus the LHWs. Finally, we validate the above teleconnection mechanisms by using the linear baroclinic model and Community Atmosphere Model 5.0 model. By comparison, there is negligible cross-Pacific propagation of Rossby wave energy before the peak of SHWs. This study presents evidence of climate linkages of East Asia and Central Siberia with WNA, which may provide potential predictability for LHWs over the WNA."

We demonstrate that boron in global lithium- and boron-rich brines from closed basins exerts a similar influence on brine pH.

However, its role in sediment and organic carbon (OC) dynamics remains to be estimated. Our analyses of the inner Gulf of Thailand (IGoT) revealed that riverine sediment fluxes decreased from 6.6 to 5.4 Mt/yr after 1975, while sediment accumulation within the IGoT increased from 20.8 to 29.5 Mt/yr. The observed trend indicates major sediment contributions from coastal erosion, particularly from mangrove deposits. This process destabilizes coastal ecosystems and accelerates OC decomposition, that is, a low burial efficiency (16.8 ± 5.5%) leads to CO2 release. Extrapolating these findings globally, mangrove loss could release ∼175 Tg/yr CO2. As coastal erosion intensifies under sea‐level rise and human land‐use practices, preserving coastal ecosystems is critical for mitigating blue carbon loss and maintaining coastal stability and resilience."

However, variations in Pb isotopic compositions among different grain‐size fractions in sediments complicate their use. We examine the Nd‐Pb isotopic compositions of two sediment fractions (<2 μm and 30–63 μm) from the central Japan Sea during the last glaciation (26–12 ka BP). Our results indicate that these sediments primarily consist of aeolian dust transported by the East Asian Winter Monsoon. The <2 μm fraction exhibits more radiogenic Pb isotopes than the 30–63 μm fraction. This size‐dependent discrepancy in Pb isotopes is attributed to differences in sediment composition, governed by the incongruent weathering of minerals in source rocks and transport sorting. Comparisons of dust records from inland and marine archives reveal contrasting mechanisms that control Pb isotopic compositions. We propose that greater caution is necessary when using Pb isotopes in paleoclimatology and paleoceanography."

This research further investigated the underlying mechanism of this correlation by analyzing the properties and propagation characteristics of stratospheric GWs excited by Hurricane Joaquin based on a Weather Research and Forecasting model simulation. By employing the 3‐D Stockwell wave analysis method, we found that GWs excited during hurricane intensification display relatively higher intrinsic frequencies, shorter horizontal wavelengths, and longer vertical wavelengths than during weakening. Analysis of these GWs' propagation using the GROGRAT ray‐tracing model revealed that they can reach the middle stratosphere rapidly within 20 min. This quick propagation enabled the observation of intense stratospheric GWs before the hurricane reached its peak intensity, offering a potential indicator for hurricane intensification. These findings strengthened the basis for considering stratospheric GW activity as a proxy for hurricane intensification under specific conditions."

FR and WR are produced within different environmental conditions, but their microphysical differences and the possible underlying causes remain unclear. We use polarimetric radar observations and the ERA5 reanalysis data to investigate the microphysical properties of convective cells (CCs) in FR and WR. Overall, both frontal and warm sector CCs produce maritime‐type convective rain, but FR events exhibit stronger convection intensity, larger raindrop sizes, and higher rain rates than WR events. The larger reflectivity above the freezing level and the higher occurrence frequency of large‐sized graupel in FR suggest more active riming process, which might be partly attributed to its stronger dynamic conditions (i.e., larger 0–3 km storm relative helicity and stronger 0–6 km shear) and higher supercooled liquid water content. Collisional coalescence serves as the primary growth mechanism for raindrops in both types of CCs below the melting layer. However, in frontal CCs having the top 10 percentile mass‐weighted mean raindrop diameters oversized raindrops undergo breakup. The ratio of ice and liquid water contents indicates that warm rain processes play a key role in the formation of rainfall particularly in WR. These findings provide new insights into the microphysical characteristics of heavy rainfall in the tropical monsoon region of South China."

In observations, the CCs between the Niño‐3.4 index and surface air temperature (SAT)/precipitation are significantly unstable at a 95% confidence level over 74.7%/73.6% of the globe, respectively, mainly over tropical Indian and Atlantic Oceans, Africa, Australia, North America, and Eurasia. Further Analyses on Community Earth System Model version 2 pacemaker simulations suggest that after the non‐ENSO‐related internal variability is largely removed, the simulated CCs are always significant over most of the tropics and North America.

Our findings indicate that the overestimation of precipitation amounts caused by overestimated precipitation frequency in ERA5 is mitigated in WRF mainly through a reduction in light precipitation occurrences. This improvement is likely linked to increased temperatures and decreased relative humidity in the lower troposphere. Moreover, the much earlier precipitation peak in ERA5 is corrected in WRF, a result attributed to differences in related net water vapor transport onto the TP. Additionally, WRF provides a more accurate estimation of the percentage of short‐ and long‐duration precipitation events with only slight underestimations and overestimations, respectively, whereas ERA5 exhibits significantly larger errors. The relatively larger temperature changes in WRF, indicating increased solar heating, are likely responsible for the higher occurrence of short‐duration precipitation events. In contrast, the anticyclonic anomalies and northeastern wind anomalies in WRF reduce the persistence of long‐duration precipitation. Importantly, WRF also produces more realistic timings of precipitation with different durations compared to ERA5. For extreme precipitation, short‐duration extreme events dominate accounting for 50% of extreme precipitation. These events are better reproduced by WRF than by ERA5. Although WRF outperforms ERA5 in estimating the proportion and contribution of extreme events to total precipitation and in capturing their triggering timing, a slight underestimation persists in the simulated proportion and contribution."

These so‐called pan‐Atlantic extremes are necessarily mediated by the North Atlantic circulation. It is known that the Atlantic storm track modulates European windstorm occurrence, but it is unclear whether the American cold spells directly influence the storm track, or whether the cooccurrence of extremes is indirect—a result of a common large‐scale driver. In this study, cold spells over both central North America and northeast Canada are clustered with respect to the evolution of the large‐scale circulation over the North Atlantic. The direct contribution of cold spells to the European wind extremes is then ascertained using circulation analogs, so that different states of the North Atlantic storm track can be compared for days with and without cold spells. Consistent with previous work, two main pathways emerge from the analysis, called “zonal” and “wavy” for simplicity. For a wavy pathway, North American cold spell occurrence is directly associated with more frequent European wind extremes than expected from the Euro‐Atlantic flow, as a result of Rossby wave trains. For the other pathways, the common driver of storm track variability linked to the anomalous Atlantic circulation was sufficient to explain more frequent wind extremes across Europe, with no or little ascertainable contribution from the cold spells. This analysis clarifies that the causality of wintertime pan‐Atlantic extremes is flow‐dependent—either direct or indirect depending on the active dynamical pathway."

The complex interactions exist between binary TCs and impose challenges on TC track simulation and result in significant track prediction errors. Here, we use Typhoons Lekima and Krosa (2019) as an example of a binary‐TC system to examine the influences of binary‐TC interactions on their tracks. Using the Weather Research and Forecasting model with a cloud‐resolving (3 km resolution) TC‐downscaling simulation, it is found that precisely capturing feedbacks of Krosa's fine‐scale structures to the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) greatly improves the accuracy of track simulations of this binary‐TC system. Conversely, due to the larger distance between Lekima and the WPSH, the asymmetric convection in Lekima only has a limited influence on the WPSH, making a negligible effect on Krosa's track. The analysis of potential vorticity tendency suggests that Krosa's asymmetric convection mainly affects the TC tracks by changing the horizontal advection (HA), while the diabatic heating makes relatively small contributions. Further analyses suggest that the asymmetric convection of Krosa weakens the strength of β‐effect, thus diminishing its ventilation flows. This modification of ventilation flows changes the magnitude and direction of HA, consequently leading to Krosa's deceleration and zigzag motion. As Krosa's fine‐scale structures persistently interact with the environment, the western ridge of WPSH gradually gets enhanced and subsequently extends westward. This process further alters the β‐gyres and ventilation flows of Lekima, ultimately resulting in its northwestward turning."

The research combines the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model with the Dynamic L-System-based Architectural maize (DLAmaize) growth model to simulate field reflectance. Comparison with the 1D RTM SAIL revealed limitations in representing row structure effects, field slope, and complex light–canopy interactions.

GSA provided complementary results to assess estimation uncertainties of the proposed traits retrieval method across growth stages. A hybrid inversion framework combining DART simulations with an active learning strategy using Kernel Ridge Regression was implemented for traits estimation. The approach was validated using ground data and HyPlant-DUAL airborne hyperspectral images from two field campaigns in 2018 and achieved high retrieval accuracy of key maize traits: leaf area index (LAI, R2=0.91, RMSE=0.42 m2/m2), leaf chlorophyll content (LCC, R2=0.61, RMSE=3.89 μg/cm2), leaf nitrogen content (LNC, R2=0.86, RMSE=1.13 × 10−2 mg/cm2), leaf dry matter content (LMA, R2=0.84, RMSE=0.15 mg/cm2), and leaf water content (LWC, R2=0.78, RMSE=0.88 mg/cm2).

 Accurate knowledge of vegetation water content (VWC) and crop height is crucial for agricultural management, environmental monitoring, and for satellite-based retrieval algorithms for geophysical variables. Traditional methods to estimate VWC, primarily rely on optical indices, which has limitations of biomass saturation, and sensitivity to atmospheric conditions. This study introduces a novel application of geospatial foundation models (GFMs), leveraging extensive, unlabeled datasets through self-supervised learning to enhance the skill of VWC and crop height estimation. We developed a comprehensive model integrating Sentinel-1 A C-band SAR and Sentinel-2 A/B indices with weather parameters to estimate soybean and corn VWC and crop height.Our research study area spans a variety of climatic zones and management practices, from the humid continental climate of Iowa and Michigan to the subtropical environment of Florida, encompassing both irrigated and non-irrigated fields as well as diverse tillage practices. We compared the performance of Single-Task Learning GFM (STL-GFM), Multi-Task Learning GFM (MTL-GFM), and machine learning techniques including Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost (XGB) to evaluate their effectiveness in estimating VWC and crop height.Results demonstrated that STL-GFM outperforms other methods in accuracy and generalizability. For VWC estimation, STL-GFM achieved R2 values of 0.90 and 0.89 for soybean and corn, respectively. For crop height, R2 values reached 0.95 for soybean and 0.98 for corn. The integration of SAR, optical, and climate data provided more reliable estimations than using individual data sources.Feature importance analysis identified NDVI, NDWI, VH backscatter, and precipitation as key drivers for accurate VWC and height estimations. The red-edge band emerged as significant for VWC estimation but showed limited importance for height prediction. Notably, surface roughness demonstrated a noticeable impact on corn VWC and height estimations, while soil moisture exhibited less influence than initially anticipated. Notably, without directly incorporating soil moisture and surface roughness data, but by including diverse field conditions in training and validation, the STL-GFM model demonstrated strong generalization capabilities. This study highlights the potential of GFMs in advancing crop monitoring techniques, offering more reliable data for precision agriculture, and supporting sustainable farming practices across diverse agricultural landscapes."

 As one of the critical parameters in the land-atmosphere exchange processes, land surface temperature (LST) plays an essential role in various domains, such as climate change, urban heat island effect, disaster monitoring, and evaporation retrieval. Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing is one of the main approaches to obtaining LST on a large scale. For the sensors with only one TIR channel, the single-channel (SC) methods are commonly and effectively used to retrieve LST, as they are most suitable under such limitations. However, atmospheric correction is essential for the SC methods, which involves significant uncertainty and complexity. To reduce the atmospheric dependency of SC methods, this study proposes a Correlation-Hypothesis based Single-Channel (CH-SC) method to retrieve LST. In this method, the LST can be retrieved using the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) brightness temperature from a single TIR channel and the LSEs from two virtual adjacent channels, while atmospheric water vapor content (WVC) is used solely to assess atmospheric conditions. Consequently, the CH-SC method exhibits the least sensitive in atmospheric parameter errors compared to existing SC methods. This inherent robustness results in superior stability of retrieval accuracy, enhancing its practicality for real applications. Subsequently, the CH-SC method was applied to Landsat 7 data, alongside the mono-window (MW) method and generalized single-channel (GSC) method. The retrieved LSTs were compared with in-situ measurements for validation. As a result, the CH-SC method exhibited strong performance compared to in-situ measurements, with an RMSE of 2.83 K in SURFRAD sites and 4.02 K in BSRN sites, which was comparable to Landsat 7 LST product (3.15 K at SURFRAD and 4.26 K at BSRN) and outperforming other SC methods. Generally, compared to the existing methods, the proposed method exhibits minimal dependence on atmospheric information while ensuring superior accuracy and stability, even under high water vapor conditions. That holds significant application value, especially for the sensors with limited TIR channels to enable real-time on-orbit computation of LST."

 Spatially and temporally enhanced satellite precipitation products (SPPs) from the GPM mission offer a viable alternative to ground-based measurements. Although the SPPs have been extensively evaluated at specific time scales, such as hourly and daily, the temporally continuity feature of precipitation events is often overlooked. This study assessed and intercompared the performance of six GPM hourly SSPs, i.e. Early, Late and Final from IMERG, and NRT, MVK, NRT_GC (hereafter GC) from GSMaP, focusing on capturing three key precipitation properties (i.e. depth, duration and intensity) along with peak magnitude and timing, in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of their capability and potential for precipitation monitoring and related hydrometeorological applications. The minimum inter-event time (MIT) approach, with a range of threshold values (i.e. 1, 2, 6, 10 and 24 h), was adopted to delineate precipitation events for the SSPs and the reference data (site observations and CLDAS datasets). IMERG and GSMaP products revealed their respective strengths in detection capacity of precipitation events, with IMERG achieving lower FAR and GSMaP showing higher POD. Despite comparable capabilities in estimating the depth of precipitation events by all the SPPs, IMERG products tended to be more effective in characterizing precipitation intensity and event peak while GSMaP better identified event duration. Notably, near/post real-time products outperformed gauge-corrected versions in certain aspects. Early was more capable of capturing event-based precipitation properties compared to the other IMERG products, especially for shorter MITs, suggesting the potential of near-real-time products in precipitation monitoring and early warning of associated hazards. In addition, MVK excelled in characterizing event duration, intensity, and peak magnitude within the GSMaP system, revealing the possible effectiveness of gauge-free satellite retrieval algorithms. Subregion analysis using the K-means clustering algorithm demonstrated the integrated influence of multiple factors on the performance of the SPPs, also with region-dependent sensitivity to a specific factor. The findings obtained from this study could provide new insights into the practical application and possible further enhancement of the GPM SPPs."

 This study comprehensively evaluates the performance of ERA5 and MERRA-2 reanalysis datasets in representing key meteorological parameters consisting of air temperature, mean sea level pressure, and relative humidity across Türkiye between 2010 and 2023. By comparing reanalysis data to observations from 116 meteorological stations, the analysis provides critical insights into their spatial and seasonal accuracy, revealing notable strengths and limitations. The findings confirm that ERA5 consistently outperforms MERRA-2 across all three parameters, exhibiting higher determination coefficients (R2), lower root mean square errors (RMSE), and reduced mean bias errors (MBE), particularly for air temperature and relative humidity. ERA5 demonstrated superior performance in temperature representation, with seasonal R2 values ranging from 0.85 to 0.91, while MERRA-2 exhibited lower performance, ranging from 0.75 to 0.86. Similarly, ERA5 outperformed MERRA-2 in relative humidity estimation, achieving R2 values between 0.50 and 0.75, compared to MERRA-2's lower range of 0.33 to 0.62. Both datasets performed comparably for mean sea level pressure; however, ERA5 achieved slightly lower RMSE and MBE values, particularly in winter and regions with complex topography, where MERRA-2 systematically underestimated pressure. The seasonal and spatial analyses highlight ERA5's finer spatial resolution and enable a more accurate representation of meteorological variability, particularly in topographically complex and coastal regions. Its reduced systematic biases and improved accuracy in transitional seasons underscore its suitability for high-resolution applications, such as urban climate modeling, air quality research, and hydrological simulations. Conversely, MERRA-2, with its coarser grid and pronounced biases in colder months, remains suitable for broader-scale climatological studies but may require bias correction for localized applications."

 A novel way to represent cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation and cloud droplet growth by the diffusion of water vapor is introduced. The key is to apply a phase space diagram that plots the radius of a liquid droplet (deliquesced CCN or cloud droplet) versus the difference between the ambient supersaturation and the equilibrium supersaturation corresponding to the droplet radius. The latter combines the droplet and environmental characteristics, and it determines whether a droplet grows or evaporates. The diagram can be used to depict (in a straightforward way) key microphysical processes of CCN activation and deactivation as well as haze or cloud droplet transition from growth to evaporation. To show its utility, the diagram is applied to an idealized simulation of CCN activation and cloud droplet growth inside a rising turbulent air parcel and to simulations of microphysical processes inside a laboratory apparatus, the Pi cloud chamber. The adiabatic parcel mimics microphysical processes near the base of a natural cumulus or stratocumulus cloud. The Pi chamber simulations represent microphysical transformations in moist turbulent Rayleigh–Bénard convection with CCN proceeding through cycles of activation, growth, evaporation, and deactivation. A more general version of the phase diagram that is independent of the CCN dry radius is also developed. The phase diagram allows simple interpretations of key microphysical processes and highlights differences between droplet formation in natural and laboratory clouds."

In a validation case study using daily maximum near-surface air temperature (Tmax), the method works well and produces predictive distributions with closely matching theoretical versus actual coverage levels. Application of the method reveals that the magnitude of uncertainty in interpolated Tmax varies significantly in both space and time. 
 Uncertainty is inherent in gridded meteorological data, but this fact is often overlooked when data products do not provide a quantitative description of prediction uncertainty. This paper describes, applies, and evaluates a method for quantifying prediction uncertainty in spatially interpolated estimates of meteorological variables. The approach presented here, which we will refer to as DNK for “detrend, normal score, krige”, uses established methods from geostatistics to produce not only point estimates (i.e., a single number) but also predictive distributions for each location. Predictive distributions quantitatively describe uncertainty in a manner suitable for propagation into physical models that take meteorological variables as inputs. We apply the method to interpolate daily maximum near-surface air temperature (Tmax) and then validate the uncertainty quantification by comparing theoretical versus actual coverage of prediction intervals computed at locations where measurement data were held out from the estimation procedure. We find that, for most days, the predictive distributions accurately quantify uncertainty and that theoretical versus actual coverage levels of prediction intervals closely match one another. Even for days with the worst agreement, the predictive distributions meaningfully convey the relative certainty of predictions for different locations in space. After validating the methodology, we demonstrate how the magnitude of prediction uncertainty varies significantly in both space and time. Finally, we examine spatial correlation in predictions and errors using conditional Gaussian simulation to sample from the joint spatial predictive distribution. In summary, this work demonstrates the efficacy and value of describing uncertainty in gridded meteorological data products using predictive distributions."

Based on our assessment of usability and performance, CUDA demonstrates the best performance while Kokkos is a suitable option for its robust heterogeneous computing capabilities. Our complete implementation of the momentum equation using Kokkos achieves a 6-fold speedup on the GPU compared to our OpenMP-based CPU code, while maintaining competitiveness when run on the CPU.

Hydrophobic shells of different thicknesses were created on CNF prills by esterification with acyl chlorides of varying alkyl chain lengths, although esterification did not hinder the inherent biodegradability of the CNFs. Fertilizer release rates were largely invariable to pH and NPK loading but were tunable over 3 orders of magnitude by varying the alkyl chain length and the degree of substitution (i.e., shell thickness). However, NPK release rates did not increase monotonically with increasing shell thickness; for long-chain (6 carbons or longer) esters, increases in shell thickness beyond optimal values increased release rates; SEM revealed that this originated from the introduction of fractures to the prills which act as diffusion channels. This work demonstrates the potential of controlled surface modification to generate a mineralizable and tunable NPK release platform from naturally sourced and sustainable feedstocks."

Olivares,"Perfluoroalkane Sulfonamides and Derivatives, a Different Class of PFAS: Sorption and Microbial Biotransformation Insights","Perfluoroalkane sulfonamides and their derivatives (FASAs), an emerging subclass of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), have attracted increasing attention due to their widespread applications, environmental persistence, and potential biological toxicity. Unlike perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), FASAs can be transformed by microorganisms in the environment, producing fluorinated intermediates that eventually form stable PFAAs. A key difference of FASAs is that their pKas enable them to exist as neutral species or zwitterions, unlike all other PFAS subclasses, which are all anions. Sorption processes regulate the bioavailability of FASAs to microorganisms for transformation, driving the environmental transport and fate of FASAs. In this critical review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the classification, properties, and environmental fate of FASAs, with a focus on sorption and microbial transformation. We discuss recent advancements in understanding the sorption of FASAs onto soil, sediment, and microbial biomass, including key sorption descriptors and influencing factors. Additionally, we examine the microbial biotransformation of FASAs, detailing transformation pathways, key intermediates, transformation kinetics, and  enzymes involved. Finally, we identify critical research gaps and propose future directions to advance the study of the sorption and biotransformation of FASAs in environmental systems. Mechanistic understanding of these processes is crucial for managing sites impacted with FASAs."

This synthesis is accomplished without any catalyst or application of any external electric potential or radiation.

Previous studies have demonstrated associations of temperature with fall risk, but the effect and burden of hourly relative humidity and fall morbidity have been rarely investigated. Fall data and meteorological data were collected from the National Injury Surveillance System during 2006–2021 in China. Associations between hourly relative humidity and fall onset were analyzed using conditional logistic regression combined with a distributed lag nonlinear model. Stratified analysis was used to identify potential association modifiers. Several sensitivity analyses were applied to examine the robustness of the results. The study involved 4 197 495 fall-related cases. Relative humidity exhibited monotonic relationships with the fall onset risk. The excess risk (ER) of falls appeared immediately at lag 0 h and persisted for 8 h. A 10% decrease in relative humidity was associated with a 1.35% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83–1.87%) increase in excess risk of falls and much higher risk for males (ER = 1.89%, 95% CI: 1.29–2.48%) than that for females (ER = 0.52%, 95% CI: 0.14–0.90%). The excess risk of fall injury was the highest among individuals aged 5–14 years (ER = 3.45%, 95% CI: 2.57–4.32%) compared to other age groups. Moreover, compared to the highest relative humidity, the attributable fraction (AF) due to low relative humidity exposure was 4.94% (95% CI: 4.88–4.98%). Subgroup analyses revealed that males, individuals aged 5–14 years, students, cases occurring in public places, and cases engaged in sports activities were more susceptible to relative humidity than their correspondents. Regional disparities were observed, with individuals in southern China or warm regions showing greater sensitivity to changes in relative humidity. Results of this study suggest that hourly low relative humidity exposure is associated with an increased risk of fall onset. These findings underscore the necessity of time-specific interventions to mitigate the relative humidity risk."

As MJOs propagate over the Indian Ocean, some of them can be penetrated by fast‐moving equatorial Kelvin waves originating to the west of the MJOs. Through a series of sensitivity experiments, we demonstrate that these penetrating Kelvin waves can modulate the eastward propagation speed of MJO rainfall. Deep convection in the western MJO rainfall envelope initiates more frequently and produces greater lifetime rainfall when a convectively active Kelvin phase is present, while the opposite occurs during a convectively suppressed Kelvin phase. This alteration in deep convection activity can lead to notable changes in the propagation of the large‐scale MJO rainfall envelope. The modulation of deep convection lifetime rainfall by penetrating Kelvin waves primarily occurs through their impact on deep convection rainfall area, which is closely related to the variations in lower‐tropospheric moisture induced by the Kelvin waves."

 Quantum error correction [1–4] is essential for bridging the gap between the error rates of physical devices and the extremely low error rates required for quantum algorithms. Recent error-correction demonstrations on superconducting processors [5–8] have focused primarily on the surface code [9], which offers a high error threshold but poses limitations for logical operations. The color code [10] enables more efficient logic, but it requires more complex stabilizer measurements and decoding. Measuring these stabilizers in planar architectures like superconducting qubits is challenging, and realizations of color codes [11–19] have not addressed performance scaling with code size on any platform. Here, we present a comprehensive demonstration of the color code on a superconducting processor [8]. Scaling the code distance from three to five suppresses logical errors by a factor of Λ3/5 = 1.56(4). Simulations indicate this performance is below the threshold of the color code, and the color code may become more efficient than the surface code following modest device improvements. We test transversal Clifford gates with logical randomized benchmarking [20] and inject magic states [21], a key resource for universal computation, achieving fidelities exceeding 99 % with post-selection. Finally, we teleport logical states between color codes using lattice surgery [22]. This work establishes the color code as a compelling research direction to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation on superconducting processors in the near future."

 Microglia play a key role in the response to amyloid beta in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In this context, the major transcriptional response of microglia is the upregulation of APOE, the strongest late-onset AD risk gene. Of its three isoforms, APOE2 is thought to be protective, while APOE4 increases AD risk. We hypothesised that the isoforms change gene regulatory patterns that link back to biological function by shaping microglial transcriptomic and chromatin landscapes. We use RNA- and ATAC-sequencing to profile gene expression and chromatin accessibility of human microglia xenotransplantated into the brains of male APPNL-G-F mice. We identify widespread transcriptomic and epigenomic differences which are dependent on APOE genotype and are corroborated across the profiling assays. Our results indicate that impaired microglial proliferation, migration and immune responses may contribute to the increased risk for late-onset AD in APOE4 carriers, while increased phagocytic capabilities and DNA-binding of the vitamin D receptor in APOE2 microglia may contribute to the isoform’s protective role.

 Histopathology is the reference standard for diagnosing the presence and nature of many diseases, including cancer. However, analyzing tissue samples under a microscope and summarizing the findings in a comprehensive pathology report is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and non-standardized.

Furthermore, authors demonstrate a heterosynaptic role of eCB (endocannabinoid) signaling as the underlying molecular mechanism. 
 Innate escape behaviors, while not requiring prior learning, are shaped by an animal’s learned experiences, such as previous exposure. Here, we found that learned threat experience in mice enhances flight behaviors, which is linked to increased activation of cholecystokinin-expressing neurons in the dorsal premammillary nucleus (PMdCCK neurons), a population that controls circa-strike escape responses. This heightened activity coincides with reduced inhibition from parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons in the ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden (VTgPV), which typically suppress PMdCCK activity and escape behaviors. Furthermore, threat memory prompts a prefrontal projection to stimulate the release of endocannabinoids, inhibiting the axon terminals of VTgPV neurons. The necessity of this endocannabinoid-mediated disinhibition for the observed enhancement in flight behaviors is confirmed through genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of endocannabinoid receptors on VTgPV neurons. Thus, our study uncovers a neural mechanism by which experience amplifies innate escape behaviors, highlighting the crucial role of endocannabinoids. Neural mechanisms underlying strengthening of escape behaviors are not fully understood. Here authors show that mPFC (medial prefrontal cortex)/VTg (ventral tegmental nucleus of gudden) to cholecystokinin expressing neurons in PMd (dorsal premammillary nucleus) neural pathway controls the threat memory-driven strengthening of escape.

They reveal a synergistic MEK-JNK signaling response in colorectal cancer cells, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy. 
 Targeted kinase inhibitors are a cornerstone of cancer therapy, but their success is often hindered by the complexity of cellular signaling networks that can lead to resistance. Overcoming this challenge necessitates a deep understanding of cellular signaling responses. While standard global phosphoproteomics offers extensive insights, lengthy processing times, the complexity of data interpretation, and frequent omission of crucial phosphorylation sites limit its utility. Here, we combine data-independent acquisition (DIA) with spike-in of synthetic heavy stable isotope-labeled phosphopeptides to facilitate the targeted detection of particularly informative phosphorylation sites. Our spike-in enhanced detection in DIA (SPIED-DIA) approach integrates the improved sensitivity of spike-in-based targeted detection with the discovery potential of global phosphoproteomics into a simple workflow. We employed this method to investigate synergistic signaling responses in colorectal cancer cell lines following MEK inhibition. Our findings highlight that combining MEK inhibition with growth factor stimulation synergistically activates JNK signaling in HCT116 cells. This synergy emphasizes the therapeutic potential of concurrently targeting MEK and JNK pathways, as evidenced by the significantly impaired growth of HCT116 cells when treated with both inhibitors. Our results demonstrate that SPIED-DIA effectively identifies synergistic signaling responses in colorectal cancer cells, presenting a valuable tool for uncovering new therapeutic targets and strategies in cancer treatment.

Here, authors develop a high dielectric constant fiber separator that shows substantial polarization under electric field to facilitate a robust and low-resistance solid-electrolyte interphase. 
 The electrostatic effects of separators under the internal electric field are often overlooked, leading to the unreliability of traditional theoretical models. Here we introduce the dielectric constant as a descriptor and develop a high dielectric constant fiber separator primarily composed of phosphorylated cellulose. Under the internal electric field, the intense electron displacement polarization within the high dielectric constant separator enhances the charge transfer kinetics and optimizes the solvation structure, thus mitigating the formation of amorphous organic oligomers at the solid-electrolyte interphase. Furthermore, the separator induces the formation of LiF, thereby forming a robust and low-resistance solid-electrolyte interphase. The separator exhibits high ionic conductivity (0.76 mS cm−1 at 25 °C) and Li+ transference number (0.68). Consequently, the Li||LiFePO4 pouch cell with the prepared separator achieve high specific energy exceeding 350 Wh kg−1 (relative to the mass of pouch cells) under practical quantities of active materials and electrolyte.

 Targeting abnormal dysregulation of adenosine-to-inosine deamination by ADAR enzymes offers a promising therapeutic strategy in cancer research. However, the development of effective inhibitors is impeded by the incomplete structural information on ADAR1 complexes. In this study, we employ a combination of computational 3D modeling and high-speed atomic force microscopy to elucidate the atomic and molecular dynamics of ADAR1. Two distinct interface regions (IFx and IFy) on the surface of the deaminase domain and oligomerization structural models are identified. Single-molecule-level insights into the structural dynamics of ADAR1 reveal the oligomerization of ADAR1 monomers through the self-assembly of deaminase domains. In the presence of the substrate dsRNA, the N-terminal region, including RNA-binding domains, of ADAR1 dimer exhibits a controlled flexible conformation and promotes a stable dimeric interaction with dsRNA for RNA editing. These findings provide the basis for the development of targeted inhibitors to regulate ADAR1 activity in therapeutic applications.

Here, the authors propose that the phonon modes become frustrated in the charge density wave phase of CsV3Sb5. 
 The formation of a star-of-David charge density wave superstructure, resulting from the coordinated displacements of vanadium ions on a corner-sharing triangular lattice, has garnered significant attention to comprehend the influence of electron–phonon interaction within geometrically intricate lattice of Kagome metals, specifically AV3Sb5 (where A represents K, Rb, or Cs). However, understanding of the underlying mechanism behind charge density wave formation, coupled with symmetry-protected lattice vibrations, remains elusive. Here, from femtosecond time-resolved X-ray scattering experiments, we reveal that the phonon mode, associated with cesium ions’ out-of-plane motion, becomes frustrated in the charge density wave phase. Furthermore, we observed the photoinduced emergence of a metastable charge density wave phase, facilitated by alleviating the frustration. By not only elucidating the longstanding puzzle surrounding the intervention of phonons but introducing the phononic frustration, this research offers insights into the competition between phonons and periodic lattice distortions, a phenomenon widespread in other correlated quantum materials including layered high-temperature superconductors. The underlying mechanism behind charge density wave formation in Kagome metals is still not fully understood.

This study quantifies the flood-induced inflow/outflow selective migration by education, employment and age in the United States, and reveals how media sentiment and income effect aggravate selective migration. 
 Escalating flood risks from climate change cause economic losses and alter migration patterns, although their impacts across socioeconomic groups remain underexplored. Here we investigate flood-induced inter-county migration in the United States between 2006 and 2019, and find that floods increase outflow and inflow migration by 2.7% and 1.9%, respectively. Younger, better-educated and employed residents leave, while older, less-educated and unemployed individuals move into affected counties. Such patterns can be amplified by media sentiment on flood risks. Selective migration lowers housing prices but raises rent, suggesting structural changes in flood-prone housing markets. Flood-induced selective migration also has salient impacts on the local labour markets, with net annual income losses estimated to be US$9.3 million and $1.98 million, conditional on education and age profiles, respectively. Our results shed light on how natural disasters influence selective migration conditional on socioeconomic profiles and how information provision interacts with migration incentives.

 The chemical industry faces the pressing issue of managing excess by-products: for example, the phenol sector produces acetone as a by-product in vast quantities exceeding the market demand for acetone. Integrating electrocatalysis and bioengineering offers versatile access to repurposing these by-products into a wide range of valuable commodities. Nevertheless, the lack of suitable intermediate feedstocks prevents smooth integration of the hybrid electro-biosystem.

We developed an intercalated ruthenium electrocatalyst that achieves a maximal Faradaic efficiency of 95.6% for acetone-to-IPA conversion, with an IPA partial current density of −240 mA cm−2. We also showed the complete conversion of acetone to ~100% pure IPA using a bipolar membrane electrode assembly device and intercalated ruthenium. We then metabolically engineered the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which can directly feed on electrogenerated pure IPA as a carbon source, secreting p-coumaric acid, free fatty acids or lycopene.

 Investigating crustal stress beneath volcanoes is critical to understanding the dynamics of eruptions. To this end, seismology represents a powerful monitoring tool. The opening of fluid-filled fractures due to the interplay of different stress sources produces elastic anisotropy within the crust, affecting the propagation of seismic waves. Here we use probabilistic imaging for the inversion of P-wave travel times to map elastic anisotropy of the magmatic system beneath Mt. Etna (Italy). These images provide localized information about fracture orientations and stress below this active volcano. Comparing inferred stress with independent observations and geodynamic modeling, we show evidence of a pressurized magma storage in a radial dike network between 6 and 16 km depth under the volcano. The radial network of vertical dikes constitutes a system of oriented pathways for the upward migration of magma from the depths, leading to eruptive activity from the summit craters and lateral vents at Mount Etna.

 Agriculture is a major contributor to nutrient pollution that drives eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems. This study integrates hydrological modeling with farmer behavioral analysis to assess the effectiveness of two agricultural conservation practices—cover crops and reduced nitrogen fertilizer application—in reducing nitrate loss from fields in the Tar-Pamlico River Basin of North Carolina. Survey responses from 279 farmers revealed widespread reluctance to adopt conservation practices, particularly strict fertilizer reductions. A hydrological model showed that applying each practice to 25 percent of agricultural land could substantially reduce nitrate export, with cover crops showing greater effectiveness than reduced fertilizer use. However, an integrated socio-hydrological model, which incorporated behavioral responses from farmers, predicted much smaller reductions in nitrate loss due to limited voluntary adoption. Specifically, nitrate reductions were overestimated by a factor of 8 for cover crops and by a factor of 25 for reduced fertilizer application when behavioral responses were excluded. This result highlights a critical limitation of traditional modeling approaches and underscores the importance of integrating human decision-making into environmental policy analysis. By linking policy incentives with both biophysical and social responses, this study offers a more realistic framework for designing cost-effective and impactful agricultural conservation strategies.

We used simulations to explore the role of bigger droplets, known as precipitation embryos, in triggering rain. We found that they speed up rain only when their size and number exceed a critical threshold. This threshold becomes larger when collisions are naturally efficient, such as in clouds with broad droplet size distributions or strong turbulence. 
 Understanding warm rain initiation through droplet collision and coalescence is a fundamental yet complex challenge in cloud microphysics. Although it is well-known that sufficiently large droplets, so-called precipitation embryos (PEs), may accelerate droplet collisions, it is uncertain how many and how large these PEs should be to affect rain initiation substantially. We address this question using an ensemble of box simulations with Lagrangian cloud microphysics. We find that warm rain initiation is substantially accelerated only if the PE size or number (or the product of those) exceeds a critical threshold necessary to compensate for the PE-induced suppression of collisions among non-PEs. The sensitivity of this threshold to the shape of the droplet size distribution and turbulence effects on the collision process is analysed. It is shown that more and larger PEs are needed to accelerate rain initiation when collisions are already efficient without PEs, e.g. due to a broad droplet size distribution or a strong turbulence effect. Beyond increasing our fundamental understanding of the precipitation process in warm clouds, our results may help to constrain the effect of PE-like particles intentionally or unintentionally added in climate intervention approaches, such as rain enhancement or marine cloud brightening."

 Differentiating between snow and rainfall is crucial for hydrological modeling and understanding. Commercial microwave links (CMLs) can provide rainfall estimates for liquid precipitation but show minimal signal attenuation during dry snow events, causing the CML time series during these periods to resemble non-precipitation periods. Weather radars can detect precipitation also for dry snow, yet they struggle to accurately differentiate between precipitation types. This study introduces a new approach to improve rainfall and dry snow classification by combining weather radar precipitation detection with CML signal attenuation. Specifically, events in which the radar detects precipitation but the CML does not are classified as dry snow. As a reference method, we use weather radar, with the precipitation type identified by the dew point temperature at the CML location. Both methods were evaluated using measurements from disdrometers located within 8 km of a CML, taken as ground truth. The analysis used data from Norway, including 550 CMLs in December 2021 and 435 CMLs in June 2022. Our results show that the use of CMLs can improve the classification of dry snow and rainfall, presenting an advantage over the reference method. In addition, our research provides valuable insight into how precipitation at temperatures around 0 °C, such as sleet or wet snow, can affect CMLs, contributing to a better understanding of CML applications in colder climates."

It shows that the global CO2 uptake by cement materials increased from 7.74 Mt yr-1 in 1928 to 0.84 Gt yr-1 in 2023; for 2024, this value is projected to be 0.86 Gt yr-1. The accumulated CO2 uptake offsets about 46 % of cement process emissions. Dominance with respect to cement carbon uptake has shifted from the USA, Japan, and some European countries to emerging economies such as China and India. 
 The hydration products of cement materials can absorb atmospheric CO2, and this carbonation process provides an important decarbonization pathway for the cement industry. Global carbon sequestration by cement materials has been reported, but carbon uptake in different countries remains unquantified. Here, we quantify the national cement carbon uptake from 1928 to 2023 based on 58 517 activity data from 163 cement-producing countries and regions worldwide and 6186 carbonation parameters from detailed data records of 42 countries, and we project the trend in carbon uptake by countries in 2024. The global CO2 uptake by cement materials has increased from 7.74 Mt yr−1 (95 % confidence interval, CI: 5.84–9.85 Mt CO2 yr−1) in 1928 to 0.84 Gt yr−1 (95 % CI: 0.71–1.00 Gt yr−1) in 2023, and it was projected to rise to 0.86 Gt yr−1 (95 % CI: 0.73–1.02 CO2 yr−1) in 2024. The accumulated CO2 uptake from 1928 to 2023 is 21.26 Gt CO2 (95 % CI: 17.93–25.17 Gt CO2), which offsets about 46 % of the cement process emissions (46.06 Gt CO2) in the past 96 years. Simultaneously, the dominance in cement carbon uptake has shifted from the USA, Japan, and some European countries to emerging economies such as China and India, which account for 38.0 % and 9.1 % of total CO2 uptake, respectively, in the last decade (2014–2023). By analysing the long time series of carbon emissions and uptake of the 42 countries with detailed data, we find that they contributed 82.1 % of global cement CO2 uptake from 1928 to 2023, including 21 countries for which cement emissions have peaked and 21 countries for which they have not yet peaked.  The annual carbon offset level (the ratio of uptake to process emissions in a given year) shows a remarkable decrease due to the temporal lag in cement carbon uptake. This is significant for countries with higher cement imports; for example, the cement industries in Australia and Japan have achieved net-zero emissions when considering the cement carbonation sink.

West;Edward W. Blockley,"CMIP6 models overestimate sea ice melt, growth and conduction relative to ice mass balance buoy estimates","This study uses ice mass balance buoys – temperature- and height-measuring devices frozen into sea ice – to find how well climate models simulate (1) melt and growth of Arctic sea ice and (2) conduction of heat through Arctic sea ice. This may help understand why models produce varying amounts of sea ice in the present day. We find that models tend to show more melt, growth or conduction for a given ice thickness than the buoys, although the difference is smaller for models with more physically realistic thermodynamics. 
 With the ongoing decline in Arctic sea ice extent, the accurate simulation of Arctic sea ice in coupled models remains an important problem in climate modelling. In this study, the substantial Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) model spread in Arctic sea ice extent and volume is investigated using a novel, process-based approach. An observational dataset derived from the Arctic ice mass balance buoy (IMB) network is used to evaluate fluxes of melt, growth and conduction produced by a subset of CMIP6 models, to better understand the model processes that underlie the large-scale sea ice states. Due to the sparse nature of the IMB observations, the evaluation is performed by comparing distributions of modelled and observed fluxes in the densely sampled regions of the North Pole and Beaufort Sea.We find that all fluxes are routinely biased high in magnitude with respect to the IMB measurements by nearly all models, with too much melt in summer and too much conduction and growth in winter, even as a function of ice thickness. We also show that fluxes vary in ways which are physically consistent with the thermodynamic parameterisations used and that these effects likely modulate the large-scale relationship between ice thickness and ice growth and melt in the CMIP6 models."

Janoski;Ivan Mitevski;Ryan J. Kramer;Michael Previdi;Lorenzo M. Polvani,ClimKern v1.2: a new Python package and kernel repository for calculating radiative feedbacks,"We developed ClimKern, a Python package and radiative kernel repository, to simplify calculating radiative feedbacks and make climate sensitivity studies more reproducible. Testing of ClimKern with sample climate model data reveals that radiative kernel choice may be more important than previously thought, especially in polar regions. Our work highlights the need for kernel sensitivity analyses to be included in future studies. 
 Climate feedbacks are a significant source of uncertainty in future climate projections and need to be quantified accurately and robustly. The radiative kernel method is commonly used to efficiently compute individual climate feedbacks from climate model or reanalysis output. Despite its popularity, it suffers from complications, including difficult-to-locate radiative kernels, inconsistent kernel properties, and a lack of standardized assumptions in radiative feedback calculations, limiting the robustness and reproducibility of climate feedback computations. We designed the ClimKern project to address these issues with a kernel repository and a separate but complementary Python package of the same name. We selected 11 sets of radiative kernels and gave them a common nomenclature and data structure. The ClimKern Python package provides easy access to the kernel repository and functions to compute feedbacks, sometimes with a single line of code. ClimKern functions contain helpful optional parameters while maintaining standard practices between calculations.After documenting the kernels and ClimKern package, we test it with sample climate model output from an abrupt 2×CO2 experiment to explore the sensitivity of feedback calculations to kernel choice. Interkernel spread exhibits considerable spatial heterogeneity, with the greatest spread in the surface albedo and cloud feedbacks occurring in the Arctic and Southern Ocean. In the global mean, the Planck and surface albedo feedbacks show the greatest interkernel variability. Our results highlight the importance of using multiple radiative kernels and standardizing feedback calculations in climate feedback, sensitivity, and polar amplification studies. As ClimKern continues to evolve, we hope others will contribute to its development to make it an even greater tool for the radiative feedback community."

However, the formation of Mn colloids, critical determinants of Mn transport and aggregation, is often overlooked. To investigate Mn behavior and colloid formation upon C amendment, humic acid was reacted with Mn oxide suspensions at different C:Mn molar ratios (C:Mn = 0–15) over 200 h. The addition of organic carbon promoted the formation of highly stabilized and mixed-valence Mn colloids through reductive dissolution and complexation, with “aqueous” Mn (<450 nm, C:Mn = 15) release increasing by 56.3% from 0 to 200 h and colloidal Mn increasing by up to 31.9% (3–450 nm, C:Mn = 15, t = 200 h) compared to without carbon addition. Analysis of Mn oxidation state revealed that C–Mn colloids contained Mn in multiple oxidation states, and the percentage of Mn(II,III) relative to total Mn increased with increasing C concentrations. In surface water, the hydrodynamic diameter of both Mn and C–Mn colloids remained stable. In groundwater, C–Mn colloids (C:Mn = 3) remained stable (150 nm) over 30 days, while Mn colloids aggregated into larger particles. Analysis of natural surface and groundwaters identified a substantial fraction of Mn (up to 19.2 and 27.2%, respectively) existing in colloidal phases. These findings shed light on the intricate cycling of Mn among particulate, colloidal, and dissolved phases, which governs Mn fate and transport in the environment."

Some conventional approaches for normalizing pathogen signals in sewersheds may not be appropriate when there is substantial inflow and infiltration (I&I). Our objective for this study was to evaluate the effect of multiple normalization approaches on wastewater pathogen signals at the WWTP influent and across a small rural sewershed (<3000 people) with different levels of I&I. We collected wastewater samples monthly, from 2022 to 2023, from the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent and 11 additional sewer system nodes with well-characterized I&I impacts. We quantified concentrations of SARS-CoV-2, norovirus GII, and rotavirus at the WWTP influent and subsewershed sites, and compared normalization approaches using flow, population, physicochemical parameters (COD, TSS, NH3(aq), PO43––P), and human fecal markers (crAssphage, HF183, mtDNA). Overall, our findings suggest that in systems with substantial I&I, some commonly used normalization approaches, particularly those using physicochemical parameters, may inadvertently introduce additional variability in viral signals measured at WWTP influent and result in wastewater measures that are more closely associated with precipitation trends rather than with pathogen signals. Normalization with human fecal markers appears to be a relatively robust option for sewersheds impacted by substantial I&I."

Both anthropogenic and natural surfaces in environments provide ideal habitats for biofilm development. Microplastics (MPs), as emerging and rapidly proliferating anthropogenic pollutants, are of particular concern due to their unique physicochemical properties and ubiquity across environments. However, it remains unclear whether biofilms on MPs pose a higher AMR risk compared with natural surfaces. Here, we employed an integrative approach combining phenotypic and genotypic AMR analysis via single-cell spectroscopy and high-throughput quantitative PCR to systematically compare AMR risks on 5 MPs (polyethylene, polystyrene, poly(vinyl chloride), polylactic acid, and Tetra Pak) and 3 natural surfaces (wood, rock, and glass) in an urban aquatic ecosystem. Our results revealed that MPs harbored a higher proportion of metabolically active antibiotic-resistant bacteria and more high-risk antibiotic resistance genes than natural surfaces. By incorporating phenotypic and genotypic AMR with three additional biofilm-related risk factors, including biofilm biomass, microbial activity, and pathogen abundance, the health risk of AMR was quantified and found to be highly dependent on surface types. MPs exhibited, on average, a 10-fold higher health risk than natural surfaces. A structural equation model further identified surface hydrophobicity and microbial diversity as pivotal factors determining AMR risks across different surfaces. This systematic comparison provides new insights into the real-world environmental impact of MPs pollution and underscores the necessity of integrating plastic pollution control into AMR management strategies."

Herein, we developed a multifactor, multieffect, and multilevel meta-analytic model (3M) to systematically evaluate the toxicity of PLs to aquatic animals and examine the impacts of multiple influencing factors. Six biochemical functions (survival, growth, development, reproduction, behavior, and physiology) of aquatic animals and impacts of 20 influencing factors (plastic characteristics, environmental conditions, and animal traits) were analyzed. The results revealed that PLs significantly impaired aquatic animals, with an overall effect of −28% (−40, −16%) on survival, 10% (−18, −2%) on growth, 30% (−44, −16%) on development, and 13% (−25, −2%) on reproduction. PL toxicity was positively correlated with plastic size and concentration and influenced by polymer type, biodegradability, aging conditions, and leaching conditions. Notably, marine species showed greater sensitivity than freshwater species, and primary consumers were more vulnerable than secondary consumers. Future research should prioritize environmentally relevant PL concentrations, standardized leaching procedures, and transparent reporting of environmental conditions.

We compare cloud phase and its impact on radiation in present‐day conditions with simulations where we perturb (a) ice‐nucleating particle concentrations (INPC) and (b) atmospheric and surface temperatures using a pseudo‐global‐warming approach. Increasing the INPC leads to cloud thinning and reduced downward longwave radiation at the surface (SDLR).

This study found that the decadal transition of winter mean NSWS across China around 1991 could be induced by the alterations in strong and light winds, which accounted for approximately 76% of decadal variations in mean NSWS. Meanwhile, the variance contributions of frequencies and intensities for strong and light winds to the mean NSWS were also considerable, which exceeded 70%. We found that the decadal variations in strong and light winds were linked to variations in weather types. Under a specific weather type, surface air temperature anomalies in East Asia displayed a warm Arctic and cold Eurasia pattern, and sea level pressure increased at Eurasia's high latitudes and declined across regions south of 30°N. Additionally, an upward propagation of planetary waves sustained a deep anticyclone over the Arctic region, motivated a robust Rossby wave train to propagate downstream, and facilitated the strengthening of Siberia High. These dynamics contributed to increase in strong wind events in China. Conversely, more light winds could be generated if opposing horizontal and vertical circulation patterns occurred.

While the dynamical structures of SCCs resemble those of typical Kelvin waves, their phase speeds are much slower. This study investigates the physical processes underlying the eastward propagation of SCCs using a cloud‐permitting simulation of an MJO event over the tropical Indian Ocean. The results show that the eastward propagation of SCCs is hindered due to intersections with westward‐propagating waves originating from the western edge of the Maritime Continent. During these intersections, new cloud clusters, dominated by shallow convection, are triggered to the east. This shallow convection temporarily stalls the SCC due to positive feedback between shallow convective heating and moisture convergence. As shallow convection transitions to deep convection and new clusters replace the old ones, the system begins to move. Latent heat release causes low surface pressure to build to the east of the new clusters, setting the stage for the next intersection. The timescale of non‐instantaneous convection‐convergence feedback, which quantifies the time lag between moisture convergence and convective heating, governs the stagnation period during cloud cluster replacement and ultimately influences the propagation speed of SCCs."

While these new radio metrics can be employed to automatically process ELF/VLF transient observations to distinguish between Q‐bursts, N‐bursts, and VO‐bursts, we propose that this additional quantitative characterization of radio bursts could also be employed to detect and distinguish between various types of transient luminous events, but more observations are required to rigorously establish this relationship."

 Anyons1,2 are low-dimensional quasiparticles that obey fractional statistics, hence interpolating between bosons and fermions. In two dimensions, they exist as elementary excitations of fractional quantum Hall states3–5 and are believed to enable topological quantum computing6,7. One-dimensional anyons have been theoretically proposed, but their experimental realization has proven to be difficult. Here we observed emergent anyonic correlations in a one-dimensional strongly interacting quantum gas, resulting from the phenomenon of spin–charge separation8–10. A mobile impurity provides the necessary spin degree of freedom to engineer anyonic correlations in the charge sector and simultaneously acts as a probe to reveal these correlations. Starting with bosons, we tune the statistical phase to transmute bosons through anyons to fermions and observe an asymmetric momentum distribution11–14, a hallmark of anyonic correlations. Going beyond equilibrium conditions, we observed dynamical fermionization of the anyons15. This study opens the door to the exploration of non-equilibrium anyonic phenomena in a highly controllable setting15–17.

 To absorb nutrients and support commensal microbes, the host induces tolerogenic immune responses via peripheral regulatory T cells (pTregs) 1,2. Prior studies identified type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1) as initiators of dietary pTregs3. However, we now report that food-specific pTreg cells are exclusively induced by the recently identified RORγt APCs4–8 and not by cDCs. Instead, our data suggest that pTreg–cDC1 interactions in steady-state limit the expansion of food-specific CD8αβ T cells. This regulation breaks during infection or food poisoning, enabling dietary CD8αβ T cells to expand and acquire effector functions in response to mimicked food antigens. Unlike in typical infections, after the pathogen is cleared, dietary CD8αβ T cells do not expand in response to their corresponding dietary antigens. Thus, we propose that in response to dietary antigens, tolerance is mediated by a circuit of dedicated antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T cells. When the host is challenged by infection, this circuit permits the transient expansion of protective effector responses without compromising the overall strategy of tolerance that ensures safe food consumption."

They demonstrate how Topobexin, a Topoisomerase IIβ - selective catalytic inhibitor, blocks conformational changes and protects against anthracycline cardiotoxicity. 
 Topoisomerase II alpha and beta (TOP2A and TOP2B) isoenzymes perform essential and non-redundant cellular functions. Anthracyclines induce their potent anti-cancer effects primarily via TOP2A, but at the same time they induce a dose limiting cardiotoxicity through TOP2B. Here we describe the development of the obex class of TOP2 inhibitors that bind to a previously unidentified druggable pocket in the TOP2 ATPase domain to act as allosteric catalytic inhibitors by locking the ATPase domain conformation with the capability of isoform-selective inhibition. Through rational drug design we have developed topobexin, which interacts with residues that differ between TOP2A and TOP2B to provide inhibition that is both selective for TOP2B and superior to dexrazoxane. Topobexin is a potent protectant against chronic anthracycline cardiotoxicity in an animal model. This demonstration of TOP2 isoform-specific inhibition underscores the broader potential to improve drug specificity and minimize adverse effects in various medical treatments.

 Current hemostatic fabric often encounters the issue of blood seeping or leaking through the fabric and at the junctions between the fabric and tissue, leading to extra blood loss. Herein, we report a hemostatic nanofabric composed of anionic and cationic nanofibers. Upon contact with wound, the porous nanofabric can absorb the interfacial blood and self-seal to form a compact physical barrier through interfiber bonding, preventing blood from longitudinally penetrating the fabric. This process results in the encapsulation of blood components within the electrostatically crosslinked nanofiber network, creating a robust thrombus that reinforces the physical barrier. Moreover, this nanofabric exhibits strong tissue adhesiveness, inhibiting blood seeping out at the seam of the fabric and tissue. Its hemostatic performance in animal injuries surpasses that of standard cotton gauze and Combat GauzeTM. In the pig femoral artery injury, the blood loss from the nanofabric is only ca. 8% of that from Combat GauzeTM. The nanofabric exhibits excellent biodegradability, hemocompatibility, cytocompatibility, antibacterial activity, and wound healing promotion. Seepage can be an issue in haemostatic dressings.

Here, the authors show that lipid overload in chondrocytes boosts fatty acid oxidation, fueling disease progression via SOX9 degradation and epigenetic dysregulation. 
 Osteoarthritis is the most prevalent age-related degenerative joint disease and is closely linked to obesity. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that altered lipid metabolism in chondrocytes, particularly enhanced fatty acid oxidation (FAO), contributes to osteoarthritis progression. Excessive FAO causes acetyl-CoA accumulation, thereby altering protein-acetylation profiles, where the core FAO enzyme HADHA is hyperacetylated and activated, reciprocally boosting FAO activity and exacerbating OA progression. Mechanistically, elevated FAO reduces AMPK activity, impairs SOX9 phosphorylation, and ultimately promotes its ubiquitination-mediated degradation. Additionally, acetyl-CoA orchestrates epigenetic modulation, affecting multiple cellular processes critical for osteoarthritis pathogenesis, including the transcriptional activation of MMP13 and ADAMTS7. Cartilage-targeted delivery of trimetazidine, an FAO inhibitor and AMPK activator, demonstrates superior efficacy in a mouse model of metabolism-associated post-traumatic osteoarthritis. These findings suggest that targeting chondrocyte-lipid metabolism may offer new therapeutic strategies for osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is closely linked to obesity.

Here, the authors conduct an environmental influenza surveillance study in remote, uninhabited regions of the Global South by sampling fresh bird guano. 
 Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) pose a growing global health threat, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where limited surveillance capacity and under-resourced healthcare systems hinder timely detection and response. Migratory birds play a significant role in the transboundary spread of AIVs, yet data from key regions along migratory flyways remain sparse. To address these surveillance gaps, we conducted a study between December 2021 and February 2023 using fresh bird guano collected across 10 countries in the Global South. Here, we show that remote, uninhabited regions in previously unsampled areas harbor a high diversity of AIV strains, with H5N1 emerging as the most prevalent. Some of these H5N1 samples also carry mutations that may make them less responsive to the antiviral drug oseltamivir. Our findings documented the presence of AIVs in several underrepresented regions and highlighted critical transmission hotspots where viral evolution may be accelerating. These results underscore the urgent need for geographically targeted surveillance to detect emerging variants, inform public health interventions, and reduce the risk of zoonotic spillover.

 The long-standing challenges facing Pt-based alloy catalysts in oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) are rapid oxidation and loss of transition metal/Pt in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In this work, we report a concept of “covalentization” in intermetallic L10-PtMM’ (M = Fe, Co, Ni and M’ = one of the 4th-period elements (from Ti to Ge)) alloys to enhance their electrochemical stability. Specifically, the formation of a quasi-covalent bond network in L10-PtMM’ due to the less occupied antibonding states induced by high d-band positions of M’ elements (e.g., Ti, V, Cr) enhances atomic bond order and strength, diminishing Co anodic dissolution via strengthened Pt/Co-M’ bonds and reducing Co cathodic corrosion by inhibiting Pt oxidation through an electron buffering effect. The developed L10-PtCoCr/C catalysts show a high mass activity (MA = 1.27 A mgPt−1) and rated power (16.5 W mgPt−1) in PEMFCs at a low total Pt loading of 0.075 mgPt cm−2. The catalysts also exhibit high electrochemical stability with ~3% and 5% loss of MA and rated power after 30,000 accelerated durability testing cycles and projects a lifetime of about 42,000 hours.

 Interlayer coupling in two-dimensional (2D) layered nanomaterials can provide us strategies to evoke their superior properties, such as the layer-dependent phonon vibration, the formation of moiré excitons and related nontrivial topology. However, to accurately quantify interlayer potential and further measure elastic properties of 2D materials remain challenging, despite significant efforts. Herein, the layer-dependent lattice dynamics and elastic constants of 2D nanomaterials have been systematically investigated via pressure-engineering strategy based on ultralow frequency Raman spectroscopy. The shear and layer-breathing modes Raman shifts of 2H-MoS2 with various thicknesses are analyzed by the monoatomic chain model (MCM). Intriguingly, it is found that the layer-dependent dω/dP of shear (SN,1) and breathing (LBN,N-1) modes display the opposite trends, quantitatively consistent with MCM analysis, our molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations. The diatomic chain model is combined with Raman data to analyze the intralayer and interlayer shear force constants and their pressure coefficients, revealing a strong dependence on the number of layers. These results can be generalized to other van der Waals systems, and may shed light on the potential applications of 2D materials in nanomechanics and nanoelectronics.

Authors here assess how biodiversity levels of fisheries around the world can be leveraged to maximize nutrients provided with less biomass. 
 Wild fish harvests from freshwaters and oceans per person on Earth have been stagnating for decades due to increased food demand from a burgeoning global human population, raising the stakes for maximizing the nutritional benefits from limited fish stocks. Here we adopt an allocation optimization approach using biogeographic and nutrient data for the world’s fishes to identify ideal portfolios of species for consumption in every country. We find that, across nations, biodiversity increases opportunities to fulfil multiple nutritional requirements with less fish biomass. This advantage emerges through complementarity among species; portfolios of complementary species provide >60% more nutrients than the same biomass of the most nutrient-rich species. Moreover, biodiverse fisheries enable harvest allocation towards species with traits enhancing fishery resilience (for example, small size, low trophic position) and offer greater redundancy, whereby a wider range of comparably nutritious species is available. Our analysis underscores that conserving fish biodiversity can improve nutrition and fishery resilience while reducing harvest pressure on already-stressed aquatic ecosystems.

 Formation of mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) is a key process in the global carbon cycle, stabilising organic carbon in soils. The relative importance of mineral composition and land use as potential controls of MAOM stability at regional scales and underlying microbial processes are still unresolved. Here, we assessed the stability of MAOM formed on goethite (iron oxide) and illite (phyllosilicate clay) exposed for five years in topsoils at 68 forest and grassland sites across Germany. We incubated the newly formed MAOM, determined its extractability, and analysed the composition and functioning of associated microbial communities. Decomposition of MAOM was always significantly lower for goethite than illite, highlighting that higher organic carbon accumulation on goethite was not exclusively due to its larger sorption capacity. Instead, reduced organic carbon extractability and higher phosphorus-acquiring enzyme activities indicated stronger substrate limitation of microbial growth on goethite than illite. Across the two minerals, MAOM decomposition was consistently lower for forests than grasslands, relating to greater nutrient constraints and a different microbial community composition in forests. Overall, mineral type and land use explained 34.6 and 23.2% of the variance in MAOM decomposition. The pronounced land use effect on MAOM stability underlines its potential responsiveness to environmental change.

10.1016/j.jag.2025.104619,False,International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,该论文主要关注利用遥感数据和深度学习模型来识别加拿大草原地区的原生草地。它侧重于植被指数（NDVI）的时间序列分析，以区分原生草地和人工草地，并探讨了关键的物候阶段。虽然使用了Sentinel-2卫星数据，但其应用目标是土地覆盖分类和生态系统管理，而非大气环境遥感，如空气质量监测或大气成分分析。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,[],Yihan Pu;Amy Nixon;Beatriz Prieto;Xulin Guo,Identifying native grasslands and key phenological stages using time series Sentinel-2 data and deep learning models,"•Sentinel-2 NDVI time series distinguishes native and tame grasslands. •Conv1D-based model achieves superior accuracy (OA = 0.88) in classification. •DOY 170–200 is key phenological window for native grassland identification. •Optimal 10-day resolution enhances Conv1D in Southern grasslands. •Multi-model comparison: CNNs outperform LSTMs and RF. 
 Canadian prairies are among the world’s most endangered ecosystems, and the identification of native grasslands is crucial for supporting grassland management and wildlife conservation. However, the current amount, distribution, and dynamic changes of native grassland remain uncertain, partly due to the difficulty of separating native grassland with other land cover types, especially tame grassland in landcover classification products. This study aims to identify native grasslands in the Mixed Grasslands ecoregion of Saskatchewan using Sentinel-2 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data through deep learning and multi-temporal approaches. Three classifiers, one-dimensional convolutional (Conv1D), Attention Long Short-Term Memory (At-LSTM), and Random Forest (RF), were applied to distinguish the native and tame grasslands, analyzing the key phenological stages. The results show that the Conv1D-based model outperformed the others in both the South (accuracy: 0.88; F1 score: 0.87) and North (accuracy: 0.78; F1 score: 0.77) sub-regions. In contrast, the At-LSTM and RF models performed worse, particularly in the North sub-region, with F1 scores of 0.64 and 0.68, respectively. The early July period (Day of Year 170 to 200) was critical for distinguishing native and tame grassland landcover, especially in the South sub-region. Additionally higher resolution data (5-day intervals) generally improved model accuracy compared to 10-day and 30-day intervals. Overall, the study demonstrates the effectiveness of time series NDVI data and deep learning approaches for identifying native grasslands, offering valuable information to assist in grassland ecosystem management and conservation strategies in the Canadian prairies."

 Phase filtering is crucial for ensuring accurate phase unwrapping in the processing of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data. Traditional filtering methods often struggle to effectively suppress noise and accurately preserve phase edge information when processing InSAR interferometric phases with complex noise and large gradient deformations. In response to this challenge, we have proposed the MCR-PFNet model based on residual attention convolution for InSAR phase filtering. MCR-PFNet integrates residual blocks, the convolutional block attention module (CBAM), and a multi-head self-attention module, enabling the simultaneous extraction of both local and global phase features, while filtering out noise and preserving phase details. To further enhance the generalization capability of MCR-PFNet, additive Gaussian noise and local phase jumps were introduced into the training dataset, and the MCR-PFNet model was trained with a custom-designed periodic phase loss function. The filtering performance was evaluated on simulated and real datasets. The results demonstrate that MCR-PFNet excels in scenarios with complex noise and large gradient deformations. In the simulated wrapped phase experiments, MCR-PFNet outperformed other methods in three metrics: PSNR (55.820–64.017 dB), SSIM (0.965–0.990), and MSE (0.026–0.170 rad2). In two sets of real data experiments, MCR-PFNet significantly improved the quality of the interferograms. In the real InSAR data of coal mining subsidence, the filtered NOR decreased to 517, PRR reached 86.987 %, and Metric Q reached 95.278 %. In the real InSAR data of earthquakes, NOR was reduced by 4.016 %–79.997 % compared to other methods, while PRR and Metric Q increased by 0.116 %–25.899 % and 0.111 %–13.803 %, respectively."

 Tire wear particles (TWPs) generated from vehicular sources significantly contribute to urban air pollution and pose risks to human health. To investigate the emission behavior of TWPs, chassis dynamometer driving tests were conducted on different-mileage vehicles. The results revealed that tire wear mileage increase led to decreased particle number emission for 10–500 nm TWPs and a gradual increase in particle mass emission. The long-mileage tires result in the formation of lumpy particles with fibrous structures. Tires with varying mileage produce lumpy particles and agglomerated irregular particles. Characteristic elements from the tire material are uniformly distributed on the lumpy particles. The agglomerated irregular particles mainly contain C and O and are not uniformly distributed with other characteristic elements. In addition, tire surface material from short-milage vehicles reduces more mass than long-milage vehicles under low thermogravimetric analysis temperatures. The lost material is mainly oxidized to CO2 gas. Wear over long mileages can lead to changes in the organic substances of tire surface material. The discussion of mileage impact provides data to support the assessment and control of particle emissions over the full life cycle of tires."
