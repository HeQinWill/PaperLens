10.1088/1748-9326/adde71,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注欧洲城市在气候适应方面的资金和融资问题，特别是城市间在获取资金、分配资金以及由此导致的适应进展方面的差异。研究调查了17个欧盟国家的148个城市政府，发现普遍存在资金短缺、人员能力不足和政治支持不足等问题。此外，弱势群体的参与度较低，气候风险和脆弱性在资源分配中考虑不足。城镇在适应措施的资金方面落后于城市，南欧落后于北欧。论文强调了公共资金的重要性，并提出了有凝聚力的适应措施作为一种更公平的政策和实践的融资策略。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,[],Kayin Venner;Marta Olazabal;Melissa García-Lamarca;Aldo Treville;Luca Costantino Arbau;Paolo Bertoldi,"Who leads, who lags? Inter-urban inequities in European climate adaptation funding and financing","Despite increased attention to climate finance in urban adaptation, empirical data on the socio-political processes shaping funding accessibility, allocation, and their implications for inter-urban adaptation progress remains limited. In a first-of-its-kind survey, we analyse results from 148 urban administrations across 17 EU countries. Our results reveal widespread funding shortages (>85% of administrations), insufficient staff capacity (73%) and low levels of political support (43%). Additionally, we find limited participation of vulnerable groups and inadequate consideration of climate risks and vulnerability when allocating resources. Towns lag behind cities, and Southern Europe lags behind Northern Europe in funding adaptation measures. Notably, higher climate risk levels are not associated with easier access to funding sources or increased funding availability. With reliance on public funding over loans, we nuance the role of financialisation in urban climate governance and propose cohesive adaptation as a finance strategy towards more equitable policy and practice."

This study addresses this gap using a simplified energetically based dynamical system model that explicitly separates and quantifies dynamical and thermodynamic influences. A pronounced dipole pattern is identified in TC IR trends over the past four decades, characterized by decreases (increases) in the northwest (southeast) NA. While thermodynamic factors have generally become more favorable for intensification across the entire NA, dynamical factors, primarily vertical wind shear, exhibit a dipole trend closely aligned with observed IR changes. Quantitative analyses indicate that the decreasing TC IR in the northwest NA is primarily driven by deteriorating environmental dynamical conditions linked closely with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Conversely, the IR increase in the southeast NA is mainly attributable to enhanced thermodynamic conditions associated with global warming. These results highlight region-specific drivers of long-term changes in TC intensification, providing insights for improving future projections."

While droughts are known to reduce crop yields, their impacts on livestock systems are more complex and evolve over time. Producers may respond to drought conditions by liquidating herds, including breeding stock, which alters supply dynamics throughout the meat value chain. These shifts may occur through multiple, overlapping channels, including increased feed costs and direct physiological effects on animals such as heat stress. We estimate the short- and long-term effects of drought-related environmental stress on the U.S. beef value chain, using the Drought Severity and Coverage Index as a composite measure of realized drought conditions. We interpret our findings as capturing the total effect of drought conditions on livestock market dynamics. Results show that producer prices increase significantly with a lag following drought events, while livestock futures markets respond earlier. Retail beef prices are also affected, but the impact on consumers is dampened and more delayed. These findings suggest that drought-related supply disruptions are a key contributor to rising U.S. beef prices."
10.5194/acp-25-6141-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了向海洋层积云中注入海盐气溶胶对云水路径的影响。通过计算机模型模拟气溶胶播撒实验，研究云滴数量浓度扰动对云水路径调整的幅度和时间尺度。结果表明，云水损失发生较快，但不会完全抵消初始的云增亮效果。研究还分析了对播撒的响应机制，包括夹卷、云水路径、边界层湍流等因素，并确定了相关的时间尺度。虽然该研究没有直接涉及特定的遥感技术或卫星观测，但它对理解云的微物理过程和辐射效应至关重要，这些过程可以通过大气环境遥感技术进行观测和评估。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术间接相关，尤其是在评估云对气候的影响以及气溶胶-云相互作用方面。,"['aerosol seeding', 'cloud droplet number concentration', 'liquid water path', 'marine stratocumulus', 'cloud brightening', 'large eddy simulation', 'radiative effects']",Yao-Sheng Chen;Prasanth Prabhakaran;Fabian Hoffmann;Jan Kazil;Takanobu Yamaguchi;Graham Feingold,Magnitude and timescale of liquid water path adjustments to cloud droplet number concentration perturbations for nocturnal non-precipitating marine stratocumulus,"Injecting sea salt aerosols into marine stratiform clouds can distribute the cloud water over more droplets in smaller sizes. This process is expected to make the clouds brighter, allowing them to reflect more sunlight back to space. However, it may also cause the clouds to lose water over time, reducing their ability to reflect sunlight. We use a computer model to show that the loss of cloud water occurs relatively quickly and does not completely offset the initial brightening. 
 Cloud liquid water path (L) adjusts to perturbations in cloud droplet number concentration (N) over time. We explore the magnitude and timescale of this adjustment in nocturnal non-precipitating marine stratocumuli using large eddy simulations of baseline conditions and aerosol seeding experiments for 22 meteorological conditions. The results confirm that the L adjustment (δL) slope (k) is more negative for simulation pairs with relatively low N and less negative for high N. Overall, k is unlikely to be lower than −0.4 within 24 h of seeding start, meaning the L adjustment is unlikely to fully offset the brightening due to the Twomey effect. After seeding, the δL becomes increasingly negative, which can be characterized by an exponential convergence. This evolution is governed by a short timescale around 5 h and lasts for around 8–12 h. It is driven by the feedback between entrainment, L, and boundary layer (BL) turbulence. Other processes, including radiation, surface fluxes, and subsidence, respond to the seeding weakly. This short timescale is insensitive to the amount of seeding, making the evolution of δL and some other deviations similar for different seeding amounts after appropriate scaling. The timescale of k evolution is closely related to the δL timescale and hence also short, while it could also be affected by the δN evolution. The results are most relevant to conditions where seeding is applied to a large area of marine stratocumulus in well-mixed and overcast BL where shear is not a primary source of turbulence."

Lee Thornhill;Christiane Voigt;Simon Kirschler;Armin Sorooshian,A method to retrieve mixed-phase cloud vertical structure from airborne lidar,"A method was developed to extract information from airborne lidar observations about the distribution of ice and liquid water within clouds. The method specifically targets signatures of horizontal and vertical gradients in ice and water that appear in the polarization of the lidar signals. The method was tested against direct measurements of the cloud properties collected by a second aircraft. 
 A technique was developed to provide cloud phase information using data collected by the NASA Langley airborne High Spectral Resolution Lidar systems with a particular emphasis on mixed-phase cloud conditions, where boundaries and gradients in the distribution of ice and liquid water are critically important for microphysical and radiative processes. The method is based on the established use of depolarization to identify ice particles but incorporates a new method to separate the ice depolarization from the depolarization produced by multiple scattering in dense liquid clouds. Clouds known to be liquid-only based on ambient temperature were used to train an empirical model of the multiple-scattering depolarization that results at different ranges from the lidar. The method classifies lidar observations as liquid-dominant, mixed-phase, and ice-dominant and has an additional categorization for oriented ice. For evaluation of the retrieval, a two-aircraft approach was used with the lidar observing the same clouds that were concurrently being sampled with in situ microphysical probes. Aircraft matchups were able to track the individual cloud elements and capture marked changes in the distribution of liquid and ice across flight segments of typically 20–100 km. Qualitative features relating to localized changes in the cloud-top temperature, cloud morphology, and convective circulations were generally replicated between the lidar phase classification and the in situ microphysical data. Quantitative evaluation of the phase classification was carried out using a subset of 15 cloud scenes that satisfied strict aircraft collocation and microphysical requirements. Using the in situ microphysical data, it was found that ice extinction fractions of 14 % and 76 % most closely matched the upper and lower bounds of the lidar mixed-phase classification."

It includes weather, geological, soil, and land cover data. Covering 1981–2022, it provides precipitation, temperature, and streamflow records from 347 basins. This helps researchers understand catchment responses and climate change impacts. By being publicly available, it supports studies on hydrology, water management, and fosters collaboration. 
 Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-Sample Studies (CAMELS-COL) is a large-sample hydrological dataset for Colombia that integrates daily meteorological and hydrological time series with comprehensive catchment attributes. The dataset comprises daily precipitation, evapotranspiration, and temperature from CHIRPS and MSWX satellite sources and streamflow records from 347 gauging stations covering the range 1981–2022. Additionally, CAMELS-COL provides a wide range of catchment attributes, including physiographic characteristics, climatic indices, hydrological signatures, land cover, geology, and soil properties, derived primarily from official governmental sources. CAMELS-COL follows the standardized framework of previous CAMELS datasets, such as those developed for Brazil and Chile, to ensure consistency with global hydrological datasets. By incorporating Colombian catchments across diverse hydroclimatic regions, including the Andean, Amazonian, and Caribbean basins, this dataset extends the CAMELS initiative into tropical environments, offering a unique resource for hydrological research. The analysed basins show low flood susceptibility. An analysis of the aridity index reveals that 74.7 % of basins have a subhumid climate, 20.7 % are semiarid, and only 4.6 % are classified as humid. Flow elasticity to precipitation is highest in the Amazon and Orinoco, highlighting their greater streamflow sensitivity to rainfall changes. The Base Flow Index underscores groundwater’s crucial role in stabilizing and regulating surface water, particularly in forested basins. The dataset supports studies on hydrological processes, extreme hydroclimatic events, climate change impacts, and water resource management. Public availability encourages scientific collaboration and facilitates the inclusion of Colombian catchments in continental and global hydrological analyses.

Together with scientists from the Technical University of Denmark, they proposed an interesting interpretation of recorded gravity data, which enables direct comparison of gravity measurements to quasi-geoid models. The proposed interpretation provides useful information for geodesy, geophysics, and navigation. 
 Regional coverage of marine areas by data from marine gravity measurements is important in geodesy and geophysics. However, interpretation of recorded gravity data is still a challenge. This paper addresses the problem of interpreting gravity data using two related, but slightly different methods. The first method involves gravity anomalies, while the second employs gravity disturbances. The main objective of this paper, apart from publishing in some detail the theory behind the two methods, is to demonstrate and briefly discuss the differences in the results. The cause of these different results are mainly interpretation errors in extracting, from marine gravimeter readings, the corrected readings caused by the gravity signal. We show that when both methods are applied to the same data set, which is available at https://doi.org/10.34808/30k6-fj34 (Pyrchla Krzysztof et al., 2025), a model of the marine geoid along the survey lines can be obtained. This can be used either as a direct estimate of the geoid or as an additional constraint by which we can detect and correct the interpretation errors."

Yet, they mainly oversee critical local processes. This paper presents and demonstrates the inclusion of wastewater treatment and reuse into a global hydrological model. As a result, model performance improves, and models consider treated wastewater as an alternative water source. 
 Wastewater treatment and reuse are becoming increasingly critical for enhancing water use efficiency and ensuring reliable water availability. Wastewater also significantly influences hydrological dynamics within urban watersheds. Although hydrological modeling has advanced to incorporate human–water interactions, large-scale and multi-resolution models often lack the comprehensive integration of wastewater treatment and reuse processes. This paper presents the new wastewater treatment and reuse module as part of the hydrological Community Water Model (CWatM) and demonstrates its capabilities and advantages in an urban watershed with intermittent flows. Incorporating wastewater into the model improves model performance by better representing low and peak flows during the respective dry and wet seasons. It allows for the representation of sectoral wastewater reuse, the exploration of different measures to increase wastewater reuse, and the examination of the effects of wastewater reuse on the water stress level. Modeling wastewater treatment and reuse is particularly relevant in regions with semi-arid or arid climates, rapid urbanization, or active policies promoting water reuse. The wastewater treatment and reuse module could be upscaled by minimizing the data requirements via simplified workflows. Combined with the availability of recent datasets on wastewater treatment plants and processes, a global application of the module is feasible. As current developments focus on water quantity, the water quality dimension of wastewater treatment remains a limitation. This opens prospects for incorporating water quality into the model and developing global input data for wastewater treatment and reuse."

Bieri;Francina Dominguez;Gonzalo Miguez-Macho;Ying Fan,Implementing deep soil and dynamic root uptake in Noah-MP (v4.5): impact on Amazon dry-season transpiration,"Access to deep moisture below the Earth's surface is important for vegetation in areas of the Amazon where there is little precipitation for part of the year. Most existing numerical models of the Earth system do not adequately capture where and when deep root water uptake occurs. We address this by adding deep soil layers and a root water uptake feature to an existing model. Out modifications lead to increased dry-month transpiration and improved simulation of the annual transpiration cycle. 
 Plant roots act as critical pathways of moisture from the subsurface to the atmosphere. Deep moisture uptake by plant roots can provide a seasonal buffer mechanism in regions with a well-defined dry season, such as the southern Amazon. Here, mature forests maintain transpiration (a critical source of atmospheric moisture in this part of the world) during drier months. Most existing state-of-the-art Earth system models do not have the necessary features to simulate subsurface-to-atmosphere moisture variations during dry-downs. These features include groundwater dynamics, a sufficiently deep soil column, dynamic root water uptake (RWU), and a fine model spatial resolution (<5 km).To address this, we present DynaRoot, a dynamic root water uptake scheme implemented in the Noah-Multiparameterization (Noah-MP) land surface model, a widely used model for studying kilometer-scale regional land surface processes. Our modifications include the implementation of DynaRoot, eight additional resolved soil layers reaching a depth of 20 mm, and soil properties that vary with depth. DynaRoot is computationally efficient and ideal for regional- or continental-scale climate simulations. We perform four 20-year uncoupled Noah-MP experiments for a region in the southern Amazon basin. Each experiment incrementally adds physical complexity. The experiments include the default Noah-MP with free drainage (FD), a case with an activated groundwater scheme that resolves water table variations (GW), a case with eight added soil layers and soil properties that vary with depth (SOIL), and a case with DynaRoot activated (ROOT).Our results show that DynaRoot allows mature forests in upland regions to avoid water stress during dry periods by taking up moisture from the deep vadose zone (where antecedent precipitation still drains downward). Conversely, RWU in valleys can access moisture from groundwater (while remaining constrained by the water table). Temporally, we capture a seasonal shift in RWU from shallower layers in wetter months to deeper soil layers in drier months, particularly over regions with dominant evergreen broadleaf (forest) vegetation. Compared to the control case, there is a domain-averaged increase in transpiration of about 29 % during dry months in the ROOT experiment. Critically, the ROOT experiment performs best in simulating the temporal evolution of dry-season transpiration using an observation-based ET (evapotranspiration) product as the reference. Future work will explore the effect of the DynaRoot uptake scheme on atmospheric variables in a coupled modeling framework."

A study of different variables and their efficiency as inputs for these models is also proposed and reveals that the best results are obtained when using all of them. Comparison between network architectures and information fusion methods allows for the extraction of knowledge on the most efficient methods in the context of this study. 
 Ground-level concentrations of particulate matter (more precisely PM2.5) are a strong indicator of air quality, which is now widely recognised to impact human health. Accurately inferring or predicting PM2.5 concentrations is therefore an important step for health hazard monitoring and the implementation of air-quality-related policies. Various methods have been used to achieve this objective, and neural networks are one of the most recent and popular solutions. In this study, a limited set of quantities that are known to impact the relation between column aerosol optical depth (AOD) and surface PM2.5 concentrations are used as input of several network architectures to investigate how different fusion strategies can impact and help explain predicted PM2.5 concentrations. Different models are trained on two different sets of simulated data, namely, global-scale atmospheric composition reanalysis provided by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) and higher-resolution data simulated over Europe with the Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques ALADIN model. Based on an extensive set of experiments, this work proposes several models of knowledge-inspired neural networks, achieving interesting results from both the performance and interpretability points of view. Specifically, novel architectures based on boundary condition generative adversarial networks (BC-GANs, which are able to leverage information from sparse ground observation networks) and on more traditional UNets, employing various information fusion methods, are designed and evaluated against each other. Our results can serve as a baseline benchmark for other studies and be used to develop further optimised models for the inference of PM2.5 concentrations from AOD at either the global or regional scale."

The present study revealed that low DO (∼0.2 mg/L) enhanced the N2O emission factor (EF) from nitrification by 4.5 times in canonical ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB)-dominated sludge, while it reduced N2O EF by 73% in comammox Nitrospira-dominated sludge. During nitrification, the accumulation of intermediate NH2OH in AOB-dominant sludge was much higher and increased more significantly by low DO (from 0.018 to 0.067 mg-N/L) compared to comammox Nitrospira-dominant sludge (from 0.004 to 0.009 mg-N/L). In AOB-dominant sludge, the increased NH2OH and upregulated AOB-NOR gene at low DO promoted NO reduction, thus increasing N2O EF while simultaneously decreasing NO emission. In the comammox Nitrospira-dominant sludge, N2O was primarily produced via abiotic pathways. Further investigation found that N2O production decreased significantly under low DO in inactivated sludge and pure water with the sole addition of NH2OH, suggesting that low DO inhibited N2O formation via abiotic NH2OH oxidation. Therefore, in comammox Nitrospira-dominant sludge, low DO decreased N2O production primarily due to the inhibition of low DO to N2O formation via abiotic NH2OH oxidation and the low NH2OH accumulation. These results imply that enriching comammox Nitrospira in the wastewater treatment process can ensure stably low N2O emissions regardless of the variations in DO."

Nanoplastics (NPs) are ubiquitous in marine environments and often co-occur with Phaeocystis blooms. However, the effect of NPs on the colony formation and bloom dynamics of Phaeocystis remains poorly understood. Here, we conducted both indoor and outdoor mesocosm experiments to demonstrate that NPs significantly increased the total cell density, colonial diameter, and colonial density of P. globosa. These enhancements in colonial density and diameter were primarily driven by elevated levels of extracellular polysaccharides as well as key substrates involved in polysaccharide synthesis, including glucose 1-phosphate, adenosine diphosphate glucose, and uridine diphosphate glucose. Concurrently, the accumulation of extracellular polysaccharides was accompanied by the significant upregulation of ten genes associated with N-glycan synthesis.

These findings indicate that the ongoing rise in MPs pollution could exacerbate Phaeocystis blooms by enhancing colony formation, posing substantial risks to marine ecosystems."

Twenty-three supporting databases were curated for this platform, encompassing the exposome and diseases together with their related biological pathways and molecules, to build their interaction network. The network nodes included up to 119,247,057 unique exposures, 17,186 diseases, 153,780 proteins, 19,122 metabolites, and 572,278 annotated pathways, while the network links included 10 interaction modes, e.g., exposure and protein (3,971,005 pairs), exposure and GO (28,632 pairs), protein and disease (10,153 pairs), gene and disease (108,298,474 pairs), GO and disease (3,085,406 pairs), and associations between exposures and diseases for meta-analysis and review summary (1244 pairs). ExposomeX allows effective analysis of multidimensional exposomic data as well as investigations of the “exposure−biology−disease” nexus through explorations of the association strengths, which was well-validated by reanalyzing three typical multiomics data sets.

By integrating a novel surface energy balance model into a global climate model, we simulate the consequences of installing solar farms over 20% of desert areas across five continents. Our findings reveal significant global and regional climatic feedbacks, including a 6.95% reduction in near-surface wind speeds, which leads to a 5.5% decline in global wind power generation potential (312.47 TW h annually). Furthermore, solar farms induce local atmospheric changes, such as increased surface temperatures and cloud cover, resulting in a 22.44 TW h reduction in solar power output. Crucially, these climatic impacts on surface radiation extend beyond immediate locations, influencing renewable energy resources in distant regions through teleconnections. This self-limiting dynamic underscores the inherent trade-offs between solar and wind energy, highlighting the need for integrated global energy planning that accounts for cross-border climatic and energy interdependencies. Our results emphasize the importance of balancing renewable energy expansion with the resilience of global energy systems, offering critical insights for sustainable energy strategies in a decarbonized future."

Responding agencies had to make real-time decisions about emergency response, infrastructure repair, and aid allocation. Here, we describe how our decade-long transdisciplinary research program supported data-driven recovery decisions in the days following a storm through the development of a novel emergency response decision support system (DSS). Integrating publicly available and geospatial data sets, we estimated that 4% of the total land area across the initial 25 disaster declared counties was flooded during Helene. While some areas did not experience a 100-year flood event, others had more severe flooding. We estimated that approximately 19 600 private wells, 34 300 businesses, and 500 fire stations were flooded. This type of real-time information was critical for supporting local health departments (LHDs) and state governments in their requests for emergency relief funding and their planning for emergency needs and assistance. Lessons learned through this effort highlight the importance of codeveloping knowledge and resources and providing actionable data and insights to enhance future disaster response efforts.

Residential fuel combustion is a major contributor to light-absorbing brown carbon (BrC) and black carbon (BC), yet their mass absorption efficiency (MAE) and association with complex chemical components remain poorly understood. This study investigated the MAE of BrC at λ = 370 nm (MAEBrC) and BC at λ = 880 nm (MAEBC), focusing on their variabilities attributed to organic chemical components through 131 burning tests involving various fuel-stove combinations. The MAEBrC, with an average of 4.8 ± 2.2 m2/g and a range of 0.35 to 10 m2/g, was comparable to previously reported values from field-based experiments; however, MAEBC (average: 8.7 ± 3.7 m2/g, range: 2.9–28 m2/g) was obviously lower than those field-based observations. This discrepancy was attributed to the greater dependence of MAEBC on combustion efficiency and highlighted the need for appropriate methodologies for measuring MAE values. MAEBC increased with the rise in organic carbon-to-element carbon ratios due to the lensing effect, which was a significant factor determining the MAEBC and explaining 36–77% of its variations. While MAEBrC mainly depended on the different BrC chromophores emitted during combustion with protein-like substances and humic-like substances being the predominant components of BrC derived from biomass and coal combustion, contributing 31% and 46% to the light absorption of extractable BrC from biomass and coal, respectively."

Results show that late‐afternoon to evening is the major peak period for boreal summer precipitation across all altitudes, while late night is the secondary peak period at 2–4 km above sea level (ASL). Precipitation tends to peak more in the late afternoon above 5 km ASL compared to lower altitudes. With global warming, the late‐afternoon peak is weakening while the evening peak is strengthening, particularly above 4 km ASL.

This flow is regulated by ice‐shelf thickness, which depends on tributary flux across the grounding line and the balance between surface accumulation and ocean‐induced melting. Consequently, ice shelves that are tributary‐sustained will be more susceptible to dynamic changes upstream of the grounding line. In contrast, atmospherically sustained ice shelves will be more susceptible to changing local atmospheric and oceanographic conditions. Our results differentiate between these internal and external regimes by mapping which ice shelves are tributary‐ and which are atmospherically sustained and we compare these findings with published estimates of local ice‐shelf buttressing strength.

To elucidate the subunit composition, physiological architecture, and gating mechanisms of CP-AMPARs, here we present the first visualization of these receptors, immunoaffinity purified from rat cerebella, and resolve their structures using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Our results indicate that the predominant assembly consists of GluA1 and GluA4 subunits, with the GluA4 subunit occupying the B and D positions, while auxiliary subunits, including TARPs, are located at the B′/D′ positions and CNIHs or TARPs at the A′/C′ positions. Furthermore, we resolved the structure of the Noelin 1-GluA1/A4 complex, wherein Noelin 1 (Noe 1) specifically binds to the GluA4 subunit at the B and D positions. Notably, Noe 1 stabilizes the amino-terminal domain (ATD) layer without affecting receptor gating properties. Noe 1 contributes to AMPAR function by forming dimeric-AMPAR assemblies that likely engage in extracellular networks, clustering receptors within synaptic environments and modulating receptor responsiveness to synaptic inputs."

 Lingering global emissions of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) are slowing ozone layer recovery. Estimates of global CCl4 emissions based on observed atmospheric mole fractions and inverse modelling (top down) exceed the emissions derived from known sources (bottom up) by ~30–40%. Here we derived CCl4 emissions from China for 2011–2021 using long-term atmospheric observations from a network of sites from across China and a top-down approach. Mean annual CCl4 emissions in China during 2011–2021 were between approximately 16 Gg yr−1 and 25 Gg yr−1, substantially larger than previous bottom-up inventories for China of less than 6 Gg yr−1 since 2011. Expressed in terms of ozone depletion potential (ODP)-weighted emissions, CCl4 annual emissions from China are comparable to global annual ‘unexpected’ trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) emissions during 2013–2018, or global total annual hydrochlorofluorocarbon emissions in 2020. The CCl4 emissions from China accounted for approximately half of the reported global total during 2011–2020, with neither showing a significant decreasing trend during this period. Substantial CCl4 emissions in China from allowed feedstock use, during the renewed production of CFC-11 between 2013 and 2018, and from by-production could close some of the emissions gap. However, ~4–15 Gg yr−1 of CCl4 emissions in China remain unexplained during 2011–2021, potentially accounting for more than half of the remaining global gap.

 Bridgmanite, a magnesium-rich silicate perovskite, is the most prevalent mineral in Earth’s lower mantle and contains substantial quantities of ferric (oxidized) iron, even in equilibrium with iron metal. Mixing of oxygen-rich material from the lower mantle could have raised the oxidation state of the upper mantle to its present level after the more reducing conditions during core formation. However, it remains unclear how the lower-mantle oxygen content was established to achieve this level. Here we use high-pressure and temperature multi-anvil experiments at known oxygen fugacities to show that the bridgmanite ferric iron content is independent of pressure but decreases with temperature. Using these data, we build a thermodynamic model to calculate the ferric iron content of the lower mantle as bridgmanite crystallized from a reduced magma ocean in the early Earth. We determine that this ferric iron content would have been sufficient to explain the current upper mantle’s ferric iron content after whole mantle mixing.

This finding suggests targets for diagnostics and treatment. 
 Brain waste is cleared via a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathway, the glymphatic system, whose dysfunction may underlie many brain conditions. Previous studies show coherent vascular oscillation, measured by blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI, couples with CSF inflow to drive fluid flux. Yet, how this coupling is regulated, whether it mediates waste clearance, and why it is impaired remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that cholinergic neurons modulate BOLD-CSF coupling and glymphatic function. We find BOLD-CSF coupling correlates cortical cholinergic activity in aged humans. Lesioning basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in female mice impairs glymphatic efflux and associated changes in BOLD-CSF coupling, arterial pulsation and glymphatic influx. An acetylcholinesterase inhibitor alters these dynamics, primarily through peripheral mechanisms. Our results suggest cholinergic loss impairs glymphatic function by a neurovascular mechanism, potentially contributing to pathological waste accumulation. This may provide a basis for developing diagnostics and treatments for glymphatic dysfunction. The authors find cholinergic neurons regulate glymphatic waste clearance via neurovascular mechanisms, with their loss impairing this process.

This allows for graded separations of different-sized molecules. 
 Artificial stimulus-responsive membranes, particularly those responsive to different solvents, have important applications in complex and graded separation systems. Inspired by natural lipid membrane that alters mass transport behavior in response to interactions with various solvents, we report that incorporating porous graphene (PG) into graphene oxide (GO) membrane enables smart and switchable molecular sieving reversibly responsive to solvent types. The membrane shows high permeance for water and methanol, 45.52 and 13.56 L m−2 h−1 bar−1, respectively, and its molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) at ~319 g mol−1 in water, similar to pristine GO membrane, reversibly switches to 960 g mol−1 in methanol which is not observed in either pristine GO or graphene membrane. We accounted this switching to the change of transport pathways. In water, the GO-GO nanochannel is dominant, providing similar molecular sieving to pristine GO. In methanol, the GO-PG nanochannel becomes favorable because a strong solvent adsorption on the nanochannel surface, coupled with a weak solvent network under nanoconfinement, promotes a significant interlayer expansion, reducing the transport resistance and enabling larger, switched MWCO. This switchable sieving behavior is further demonstrated for efficient graded separation of ternary solution of solutes with various molecular weights. Porous graphene integrated into graphene oxide membranes yields smart molecular sieves that switch separation based on the solvent. This allows for graded separations of different-sized molecules."

 Tissue crowding represents a critical challenge to epithelial tissues, which often respond via the irreversible process of live cell extrusion. We report that apical size reduction via macropinocytosis serves as a malleable and less destructive form of tissue remodeling that can alleviate the need for cell loss. We find that macropinocytosis is triggered by tissue crowding via mechanosensory signaling, leading to substantial internalization of apical membrane. This drives a reduction in apical surface which alleviates crowding. We report that this mechanism regulates the long-term organization of the developing epithelium and controls the timing of proliferation-induced cell extrusion. Additionally, we observe a wave of macropinocytosis in response to acute external compression. In both scenarios, inhibiting macropinocytosis induces a dramatic increase in cell extrusion suggesting cooperation between cell extrusion and macropinocytosis in response to both developmental and external compression. Our findings implicate macropinocytosis as an important regulator of dynamic epithelial remodeling.

 Tropical cyclones (TCs) in the western North Pacific (WNP), which occur mainly from June through November, are greatly influenced by El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), particularly during the peak and late seasons (August–November). However, during the early season (June–August; JJA), ENSO is in its onset or developing phase and thus is relatively weak. Consequently, the drivers of interannual variability in early-season WNP TC activity remain less understood. This study shows that Atlantic Niño/Niña, the leading mode of tropical Atlantic sea surface temperature variability in JJA, significantly influences early-season WNP TC activity. Specifically, Atlantic Niño produces anomalous upper-level convergence in the tropical WNP, resulting in a decrease in low-level relative vorticity and mid-level relative humidity in the southern WNP (0°–10°N), and an increase in low-level relative vorticity in the northern WNP (20°N–30°N). These environmental conditions lead to an increase in TC activity over the northern WNP and a decrease over the southern WNP. Due to the resulting northward shifts in TC genesis and track density, the risk of landfalling TCs in far eastern Asia, particularly Korea and Japan, is greatly increased. These results suggest that Atlantic Niño/Niña may serve as a key predictor for seasonal WNP TC activity, especially during ENSO-neutral years."

Our results show distinct bimodal patterns in the BrC number concentration for the sub-500 nm particles at Mace Head, the west coast of Ireland, with peaks at ~20 nm and 107 nm, attributable to new particle formation (nucleation mode) and subsequent growth processes to the accumulation mode, respectively. Light absorption also exhibited a bimodal distribution, with peaks at 137 nm and increasing values to 484 nm. This difference highlights that the larger particles (e.g. around 484 nm), though fewer in number (~3.6% of the total BrC particles), contribute significantly (~70%) to light absorption due to high mass concentration. The direct solar absorption of BrC relative to black carbon ranges from 1.7% to 4.8%, with a slight increase for particles larger than 100 nm, emphasizing the importance of larger particles in BrC radiative effects. These results offer insights into the size-resolved properties of sub-500 nm BrC, enhancing our understanding of BrC properties and potentially reducing uncertainties in aerosol-radiation interactions."

 Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) numerical weather prediction (NWP) have transformed atmospheric modeling. AI NWP models outperform state-of-the-art conventional NWP models like the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting’s (ECMWF) Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) on several global metrics while requiring orders of magnitude fewer computational resources. However, existing AI NWP models still face limitations due to training datasets and dynamic timestep choices, often leading to artifacts that affect performance. To begin to address these challenges, we introduce the Community Research Earth Digital Intelligence Twin (CREDIT) framework, developed at the NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). CREDIT is a flexible, scalable, foundational research platform for training and deploying AI NWP models, providing an end-to-end pipeline for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The CREDIT framework supports both existing architectures and the development of new models. We showcase this flexibility with WXFormer, a novel multiscale vision transformer designed to predict atmospheric states while mitigating common AI NWP pitfalls through techniques like spectral normalization, intelligent padding, and multi-step training. Additionally, we train the FuXi architecture within the CREDIT framework for comparison. Our results demonstrate that both FuXi and WXFormer, trained on hybrid sigma-pressure level ERA5 sampled at 6-h intervals, generally achieve better performance than the IFS High-Resolution (IFS HRES) on 10-day forecasts, offering potential improvements in efficiency and accuracy. The modular nature of CREDIT fosters collaboration, enabling researchers to experiment with models, datasets, and training options."

 The characteristics and concentrations of microbial communities in the air have been studied extensively; however, existing monitoring methods are often complex and expensive. In this study, we monitored the atmospheric environment in the Huairou District of Beijing for one year, using microbial metabolic activity (MA) as an indicator of microbial presence. We analyzed the lag effect of environmental factors on MA and assessed how these factors influence MA in PM2.5. Significant seasonal variations in MA within PM were observed, with higher levels recorded in winter and under fair weather conditions compared to other seasons and weather conditions. PM2.5, O3, and CO concentrations, as well as temperature and humidity, had a substantial impact on MA. Notably, the MA in PM2.5 was more sensitive to environmental factors than the MA in PM10. Seasonal variations in MA within PM2.5 were primarily driven by air pollution and meteorological factors, with ozone exerting the greatest influence on MA in summer. Additionally, environmental factors improved the accuracy of MA predictions in summer. These findings provide strong evidence that environmental factors can be used to predict bioaerosol contamination, providing a cost-effective and rapid alternative to traditional monitoring methods."
