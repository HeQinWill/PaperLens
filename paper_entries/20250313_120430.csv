10.5194/acp-25-2979-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇研究论文主要关注重力波在突发性平流层增温期间对流层、平流层和中间层大气耦合的影响。它通过分析重力波的传播和反射，探讨了不同大气层之间能量和动量的传递机制。虽然该研究涉及大气过程，但其重点在于大气动力学和物理机制，而非直接与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析）相关。,"['Gravity waves', 'Sudden stratospheric warming', 'Troposphere-stratosphere-mesosphere coupling', 'Atmospheric dynamics']",Gordana Jovanovic,Gravity waves as a mechanism of troposphere–stratosphere–mesosphere coupling during sudden stratospheric warming,"Sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) is a phenomenon that occurs when the temperature in the stratosphere rises by several tens of degrees in just a few days. SSWs are caused by the breaking of atmospheric waves that propagate from the troposphere via the stratosphere to the mesosphere. SSWs impact the tropospheric circulation and the climate and can lead to a dramatic decrease in temperature. During SSW events, the filtration of gravity waves has a major impact on mesospheric cooling. 
 The propagation of gravity waves (GWs) and their role in the coupling of the troposphere–stratosphere–mesosphere atmospheric layers during sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) are studied. A standard set of hydrodynamic (HD) equations is used to derive the analytical dispersion equations and the GW reflection coefficient. These equations are applied to the troposphere–stratosphere and stratosphere–mesosphere discontinuities to analyse which part of the GW spectra has the greatest chance of crossing them and affecting the dynamics of the upper atmosphere. We found that the GW reflection coefficient at the troposphere–stratosphere discontinuity increases significantly during SSW. This is not the case for the reflection coefficient at the stratosphere–mesosphere discontinuity when the reflection coefficient decreases compared to its value in the no-SSW case. The generation of GWs in the stratosphere during the SSW is responsible for the reduction in the reflection coefficient. However, these additional GW fluxes are not sufficient to compensate for the reduction in GW fluxes from the troposphere to the mesosphere. As a result, mesospheric cooling accompanied by SSW events occurs."
10.5194/acp-25-2989-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了冰岛溢流式火山喷发对气候的影响，特别是不同季节和喷发规模的影响。虽然论文没有直接提及大气环境遥感技术，但它关注火山喷发释放的二氧化硫气体和气溶胶对大气成分的影响，以及气候模型的应用。这些因素与大气成分分析、卫星观测（用于监测火山喷发和气溶胶分布）以及空气质量监测密切相关。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术具有较强的关联性，尤其是在火山喷发监测和气候影响评估方面。,"['sulfur dioxide emissions', 'aerosols', 'atmospheric composition', 'climate modeling', 'Earth system model', 'Arctic climate', 'volcanic eruption monitoring']",Tómas Zoëga;Trude Storelvmo;Kirstin Krüger,Modelled surface climate response to effusive Icelandic volcanic eruptions: sensitivity to season and size,"We use an Earth system model to systematically investigate the climate response to high-latitude effusive volcanic eruptions as a function of eruption season and size, with a focus on the Arctic. We find that different seasons strongly modulate the climate response, with Arctic surface warming observed in winter and cooling in summer. Additionally, as eruptions increase in terms of sulfur dioxide emissions, the climate response becomes increasingly insensitive to variations in emission strength. 
 Effusive, long-lasting volcanic eruptions impact climate through the emission of gases and the subsequent production of aerosols. Previous studies, both modelling and observational, have made efforts to quantify these impacts and untangle them from natural variability. However, due to the scarcity of large and well-observed effusive volcanic eruptions, our understanding remains patchy. Here, we use an Earth system model to systematically investigate the climate response to high-latitude, effusive volcanic eruptions, similar to the 2014–2015 Holuhraun eruption in Iceland, as a function of eruption season and size. The results show that the climate response is regional and strongly modulated by different seasons, exhibiting midlatitude cooling during summer and Arctic warming during winter. Furthermore, as eruptions increase in size in terms of sulfur dioxide emissions, the climate response becomes increasingly insensitive to variations in emission strength, levelling off for eruptions between 20 and 30 times the size of the 2014–2015 Holuhraun eruption. Volcanic eruptions are generally considered to lead to surface cooling, but our results indicate that this is an oversimplification, especially in the Arctic, where warming is found to be the dominant response during autumn and winter."
10.5194/acp-25-2967-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要探讨了中国北方城市冬季大气中异戊二烯来源的有机硫酸盐（OSi）的非生物来源问题。通过对中国南方和北方典型城市气溶胶中有机硫酸盐形成的空间差异进行研究，发现北方城市异戊二烯来源的有机硫酸盐含量明显高于南方城市。结合主成分分析和燃烧实验，表明生物质燃烧是北方城市OSi的重要来源，而非汽油、柴油和煤炭燃烧。该研究首次提供了直接的分子证据，表明非生物来源对中国冬季OSi的形成有显著贡献。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术或卫星观测，但其研究内容与大气成分分析、空气质量监测以及大气污染来源识别密切相关，这些都是大气环境遥感技术的重要应用领域。,"['aerosol composition', 'organosulfates', 'air quality monitoring', 'biomass burning', 'atmospheric pollution', 'chemical analysis']",Ting Yang;Yu Xu;Yu-Chen Wang;Yi-Jia Ma;Hong-Wei Xiao;Hao Xiao;Hua-Yun Xiao,Non-biogenic sources are an important but overlooked contributor to aerosol isoprene-derived organosulfates during winter in northern China,"Previous measurement–model comparisons of atmospheric isoprene levels showed a significant unidentified source of isoprene in some northern Chinese cities during winter. Here, the first combination of large-scale observations and field combustion experiments provides novel insights into biomass burning emissions as a significant source of isoprene-derived organosulfates during winter in northern cities of China. 
 Previous measurement–model comparisons of atmospheric isoprene levels showed a significant unidentified source of isoprene in some northern Chinese cities during winter. Here, spatial variability in winter aerosol organosulfate (OS) formation in typical southern (Guangzhou and Kunming) and northern (Xi'an and Taiyuan) cities, China, was investigated to reveal the influence of potential non-biogenic contributor on aerosol OS pollution levels. Monoterpene-derived OSs were significantly higher in southern cities than in northern cities, which was attributed to the temperature-dependent emission of monoterpenes (i.e., higher temperatures in southern cities drove more monoterpene emissions). However, isoprene-derived OSs (OSi) showed the opposite trend, with significantly higher levels in northern cities. Principal component analysis combined with field simulation combustion experiments suggested that biomass burning rather than gasoline, diesel, and coal combustion contributed significantly to the abundance of OSi in northern cities. The comparison of anthropogenic OS molecular characteristics between particles released from various combustion sources and ambient aerosol particles suggested that stronger biomass and fossil fuel combustion activities in northern cities promoted the formation of considerable anthropogenic OSs. Overall, this study provides direct molecular evidence for the first time that non-biogenic sources can significantly contribute to the formation of OSi in China during winter."

T. Griffith;Lukas Heizmann;Nicholas B. Jones;Tomi Karppinen;Rigel Kivi;Martine de Mazière;Justus Notholt;Mahesh Kumar Sha,Implementation and application of an improved phase spectrum determination scheme for Fourier transform spectrometry,"The primary measurement result delivered by a Fourier transform spectrometer is an interferogram, and the spectrum required for further analysis needs to be calculated from the interferogram by Fourier analysis. The paper deals with technical aspects of this process and shows how the reconstruction of the spectrum can be optimized. 
 Correct determination of the phase spectrum is a highly relevant task in Fourier transform spectrometry for concluding which spectral distribution most likely gave rise to the measured interferogram. We present implementation of an improved scheme for phase determination in the operational Collaborative Carbon Column Observing Network (COCCON) processor. We introduce a robust unwrapping scheme for retrieving a spectrally smooth phase spectrum at intermediate spectral resolution, which uses all spectral positions carrying enough signal to allow a significant determination of the phase. In the second step, we perform a least-squares fit of model parameters of a suitable analytical phase spectrum model through all reliable phase values constructed in the first step. The model fit exploits the fact that we expect the phase to be spectrally smooth. Still, it can be refined to reflect specific characteristics inherent to the optical and electronic layout of the interferometer. The proposed approach avoids the problems of the classical phase reconstruction method, which enforces a spectrally smooth phase by directly limiting spectral resolution when calculating the complex phase. Thereby, the phase is created from a very low number of interferogram points around the centerburst of the interferogram, which results in a suboptimal noise propagation from the interferogram into the spectral domain. Moreover, the interpolation of the phase spectrum across spectral subsections with reduced spectral signal is not well behaved, and results depend strongly on the numerical apodization function used for creating the low-resolution phase."

We created a high-resolution cropland map of China for 2020, using imagery from Mapbox and Google. By combining image quality assessments, active learning for semantic segmentation, and results integration. The accuracy achieved to 88.73 %, with 30 out of 32 provincial units reporting area estimates within ±10 % of official statistics. In contrast, only 9 to 1 provinces from 7 existing datasets meet the same accuracy standard. 
 Accurate and detailed cropland maps are essential for agricultural planning, resource management, and food security, particularly in countries like China, where agricultural productivity is high but resources are limited. Despite the availability of several medium-to-high-resolution satellite-based cropland maps, significant discrepancies in area estimates and spatial distribution persist, limiting their utility. This study proposes a data-driven framework for cropland mapping that leverages 2 m High Resolution (HR) imagery from Mapbox and Google. The framework consists of three main stages: First, national imagery is partitioned into 0.05°×0.05° blocks for efficient parallel computation. An Image Quality Assessment (IQA) using ResNet models is performed on both sources to address the challenge of missing image acquisition metadata. Second, a robust cropland identification model integrates Mask2Former for precise segmentation and XGBoost for error evaluation, facilitating iterative improvements through active learning. Finally, a novel integration strategy combines four feature groups—Geography, IQA, Region Property, and Consistency—using XGBoost to merge the datasets into a unified cropland layer, named Croplayer. The Croplayer dataset achieves an overall mapping accuracy of 88.73 %, with 30 out of 32 provincial units reporting area estimates within ±10 % of official statistics. In contrast, only 1 to 9 provinces from seven other existing datasets meet the same accuracy standard. The results highlight Croplayer's potential for applications such as crop yield estimation and agricultural structure analysis, offering a reliable tool for addressing agricultural and food security challenges."
10.5194/essd-2025-89,True,Earth System Science Data Discussions,该研究论文主要关注冰核粒子（INP）的测量，以及它们在云和气溶胶相互作用中的作用。虽然它没有直接涉及卫星观测或传统的空气质量监测，但它与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它研究了影响云形成和气候的关键大气成分。通过高时间分辨率测量INP浓度，该研究为理解气溶胶如何影响云的性质提供了重要数据，这些数据可以用于验证和改进大气模型，并最终提高我们对气候变化的理解。此外，研究中使用的数据可以与气象数据结合，以研究INP的来源和性质，这对于大气成分分析至关重要。,"['ice-nucleating particles', 'INP concentration', 'aerosol-cloud interactions', 'freezing temperature', 'meteorological data', 'cloud properties', 'sub-Arctic environment']",Alexander Böhmländer;Larissa Lacher;Romy Fösig;Nicole Büttner;Jens Nadolny;David Brus;Konstantinos-Matthaios Doulgeris;Ottmar Möhler,Measurement of the ice-nucleating particle concentration with the Portable Ice Nucleation Experiment during the Pallas Cloud Experiment 2022,"Cloud-aerosol interactions lead to a phase change of water droplets inside the atmosphere. One of these interactions happens due to a small subset of aerosols, ice-nucleating particles (INPs). These INPs lead to the freezing of pure water droplets above −35 °C, which otherwise would stay liquid. This has impacts on the weather and climate. The present data set presents a unique data set with a high temporal resolution. 
 The Portable Ice Nucleation Experiment (PINE) was deployed during the Pallas Cloud Experiment (PaCE) 2022 for a three-month-period at the Sammaltunturi station in autumn 2022. The station is located on top of a hill on the edge between sub-Arctic and boreal forest environments, typically receiving air masses from the Arctic and the south. Since clouds are frequently present at the station during autumn, the present aerosol particles can have a direct impact on cloud properties. Ice-nucleating particles (INPs) are aerosol particles that facilitate primary ice nucleation in supercooled cloud droplets. The PINE measured the INP concentration with a high temporal resolution of six minutes at different nucleation temperatures between 240 K and 252 K. The INP concentration varied exponentially with the freezing temperature and differences between different months were observed. The highest median INP concentration was measured during December over the whole temperature range, while during November the lowest median INP concentration was measured. The data presented here is useful to study aerosol-cloud interactions for a sub-Arctic location with minimal anthropogenic influence. The high temporal resolution allows to correlate the INP concentration with other measurements, such as size distribution data and meteorological data. In addition, the data provides the ice nucleating ability of arriving aerosol particles, which can be combined with models to study the nature, the source and the age of the INPs."

Athanasiadis,CY-Bench: A comprehensive benchmark dataset for sub-national crop yield forecasting,"Improving crop yield predictions is crucial for food security. Prior research relied on case studies, making it hard to compare methods & track progress. We introduce CY-Bench, a global dataset for forecasting maize and wheat yields across diverse farming systems in over 25 countries. It includes standardized weather, soil, and satellite data, curated by a diverse set of experts. CY-Bench supports the development of better forecasting tools to help decision-makers plan for global food security. 
 In-season, pre-harvest crop yield forecasts are essential for enhancing transparency in commodity markets and improving food security. They play a key role in increasing resilience to climate change and extreme events and thus contribute to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 2 of zero hunger. Pre-harvest crop yield forecasting is a complex task, as several interacting factors contribute to yield formation, including in-season weather variability, extreme events, long-term climate change, soil, pests, diseases and farm management decisions. Several modeling approaches have been employed to capture complex interactions among such predictors and crop yields. Prior research for in-season, pre-harvest crop yield forecasting has primarily been case-study based, which makes it difficult to compare modeling approaches and measure progress systematically. To address this gap, we introduce CY-Bench (Crop Yield Benchmark), a comprehensive dataset and benchmark to forecast maize and wheat yields at a global scale. CY-Bench was conceptualized and developed within the Machine Learning team of the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgML) in collaboration with agronomists, climate scientists, and machine learning researchers. It features publicly available sub-national yield statistics and relevant predictors—such as weather data, soil characteristics, and remote sensing indicators—that have been pre-processed, standardized, and harmonized across spatio-temporal scales. With CY-Bench, we aim to: (i) establish a standardized framework for developing and evaluating data-driven models across diverse farming systems in more than 25 countries across six continents; (ii) enable robust and reproducible model comparisons that address real-world operational challenges; (iii) provide an openly accessible dataset to the earth system science and machine learning communities, facilitating research on time series forecasting, domain adaptation, and online learning. The dataset (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11502142, (Paudel et al., 2025a)) and accompanying code (https://github.com/WUR-AI/AgML-CY-Bench, (Paudel et al., 2025b))) are openly available to support the continuous development of advanced data driven models for crop yield forecasting to enhance decision-making on food security."

 Long-term monitoring of phytoplankton communities is essential for understanding the functioning and evolution of marine systems. This paper presents a decadal dataset on phytoplankton observations conducted along a coastal-offshore transect by the Strait of Dover, at fine spatial resolution, using an automated in vivo approach. Nine stations (∼ 1 km apart) were sampled off the Slack estuary, representing the northern limit of the Marine Protected Area of “Picard Estuaries and Opal Seas” (EPMO). Since 2012, phytoplankton functional groups were characterized in vivo in sub-surface waters using multi-spectral fluorometry (Fluoroprobe, bbe Moldaenke, Gmbh) and single-cell optical analysis with a pulse shape-recording flow cytometer (CytoSense and CytoSub, Cytobuoy b.v., Netherlands). Total phytoplankton biomass was estimated via chlorophyll a extraction and in vivo fluorescence. Spectral and functional groups were quantified in terms of abundance, size, and estimated chlorophyll a in surface waters. Weekly sampling resolution allowed to address the community composition in order to disentangle short-term, fine spatial, seasonal, and inter-annual variability. Additionally, biogeochemical and hydrological variables—temperature, salinity, Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR), and nutrients (nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, silicate) were systematically measured. Over 11 years, the survey generated 1,835 samples from 268 dates, averaging 167 samples per year across 24 cruises. This unique dataset provides valuable insights into phytoplankton dynamics and environmental drivers in a temperate coastal system.

 We develop a method for computing Bayes' factors of conceptual rainfall–runoff models based on thermodynamic integration, gradient-based replica-exchange Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms and modern differentiable programming languages. We apply our approach to the problem of choosing from a set of conceptual bucket-type models with increasing dynamical complexity calibrated against both synthetically generated and real runoff data from Magela Creek, Australia. We show that using the proposed methodology, the Bayes factor can be used to select a parsimonious model and can be computed robustly in a few hours on modern computing hardware."

This is partly due to the detailed model used to represent atmospheric transport. We demonstrate how a machine learning (ML) model can be used to simulate high-resolution atmospheric transport. This type of ML model will help estimate GHG emissions using dense observations, which are becoming increasingly common with the proliferation of urban monitoring networks and geostationary satellites. 
 There has been a proliferation of dense observing systems to monitor greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations over the past decade. Estimating emissions with these observations is often done using an atmospheric transport model to characterize the source–receptor relationship, which is commonly termed the measurement “footprint”. Computing and storing footprints using full-physics models is becoming expensive due to the requirement to simulate atmospheric transport at high resolution. We present the development of FootNet, a deep-learning emulator of footprints at the kilometer scale. We train and evaluate the emulator using footprints simulated with a Lagrangian particle dispersion model (LPDM). FootNet predicts the magnitudes and extents of footprints in near real time with high fidelity. We identify the relative importance of input variables of FootNet for improving the interpretability of the model. Surface winds and a precomputed Gaussian plume from the receptor are identified as the most important variables for footprint emulation. The FootNet emulator developed here may help address the computational bottleneck of flux inversions using dense observations."

An evaluation during the summer of 2023 shows that the updated model overall improves the simulation of MDA8 O3 by reducing the bias by 8%–12% in the contiguous US. PM2.5 predictions have mixed results due to wildfire, highlighting the need for future refinements. 
 The air quality forecasting system is an essential tool widely used by environmental managers to mitigate adverse health effects of air pollutants. This work presents the latest development of the next-generation regional air quality model (AQM) forecast system within the Unified Forecast System (UFS) framework in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The UFS air quality model incorporates the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model as its main chemistry component. In this system, CMAQ is integrated as a column model to solve gas and aerosol chemistry, while the transport of chemical species is processed by UFS. The current AQM version 7 (AQMv7) is coupled with an earlier version of CMAQ (version 5.2.1). Here we describe the development of the updated AQMv7 by coupling to a “state-of-the-science” CMAQ version 5.4. The updates include improvements in gas and aerosol chemistry, dry deposition processes, and structural changes to the input/output (I/O) interface, enhancing both computational efficiency and representation of air–surface exchange processes. A simulation was conducted for the period of June–August 2023 to assess the effects of these updates on the forecast performance of ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), two major air pollutants over the continental United States (CONUS). The results show that the updated model demonstrates an enhanced capability in simulating O3 over the CONUS by reducing the positive bias, leading to a reduction in the mean bias by 3 %–5 % and 8 %–12 % for hourly and the maximum daily 8 h average O3, respectively. Spatially, the updated model lowers the positive bias of hourly O3 in most of the 10 EPA regions, particularly within the central and northwest areas, while amplifying the O3 underestimation over the sites with negative bias. Similarly, the updates induce uniformly lower fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations across the CONUS domain, reducing the positive bias at some sites over the northeast in August and central Great Plains. The updated model does not improve model performance for PM2.5 in the vicinity and downwind of fire emission sources, where AQMv7 shows the highest negative bias, thus indicating a focal point of model uncertainty and needed improvement. Despite these challenges, the study highlights the importance of the ongoing refinements for reliable air quality predictions from the UFS-AQM model, which is a planned future update to NOAA's current operational air quality forecast system."

Siegert;Liam Holder,Quantitative sub-ice and marine tracing of Antarctic sediment provenance (TASP v1.0),"Ice sheet models can help predict how Antarctica's ice sheets respond to environmental change, and such models benefit from comparison to geological data. Here, we use an ice sheet model output and other data to predict the erosion of debris and trace its transport to where it is deposited on the ocean floor. This allows the results of ice sheet modelling to be directly and quantitively compared to real-world data, helping to reduce uncertainty regarding Antarctic sea level contribution. 
 Ice sheet models should be able to accurately simulate palaeo ice sheets to have confidence in their projections of future polar ice sheet mass loss and resulting global sea level rise. This requires accurate reconstructions of the extent and flow patterns of palaeo ice sheets using real-world data. Such reconstructions can be achieved by tracing the detrital components of offshore sedimentary records back to their source areas on land. For Antarctica, however, sediment provenance data and ice sheet model results have not been directly linked, despite the complementary information each can provide on the other. Here, we present a computational framework (Tracing Antarctic Sediment Provenance, TASP) that predicts marine geochemical sediment provenance data using the output of numerical ice sheet modelling. The ice sheet model is used to estimate the spatial pattern of erosion potential and to trace ice flow pathways. Beyond the ice sheet margin, approximations of modern detrital particle transport mechanisms using ocean reanalysis data produce a good agreement between our predictions for the modern ice sheet–ocean system and seabed surface sediments. These results show that the algorithm could be used to predict the provenance signature of past ice sheet configurations. TASP currently predicts neodymium isotope compositions using the PSUICE3D ice sheet model, but thanks to its design it could be adapted to predict other provenance indicators or use the outputs of other ice sheet models."

Ordoñez,The DOE E3SM version 2.1: overview and assessment of the impacts of parameterized ocean submesoscales,"Version 2.1 of the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) adds the Fox-Kemper et al. (2011) mixed-layer eddy parameterization, which restratifies the ocean surface layer through an overturning streamfunction. Results include surface layer bias reduction in temperature, salinity, and sea ice extent in the North Atlantic; a small strengthening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation; and improvements to many atmospheric climatological variables. 
 The U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) version 2.1 builds on E3SMv2 with several changes, with the most notable being the addition of the Fox-Kemper et al. (2011) mixed-layer eddy parameterization. This parameterization captures the effect of finite-amplitude, mixed-layer eddies as an overturning streamfunction and has the primary function of restratification. Herein, we outline the changes to the mean climate state of E3SM that were introduced by the addition of this parameterization. Overall, the presence of the submesoscale parameterization improves the fidelity of the v2.1 simulation by reducing the ocean surface biases in the North Atlantic present in v2, as illustrated by changes in the climatological sea surface temperature and salinity and the Arctic sea-ice extent. Other impacts include a slight shoaling of the mixed-layer depths in the North Atlantic and a small improvement in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). We note that the expected shoaling due to the parameterization is regionally dependent in our coupled configuration. In addition, we investigate why the parameterization and its impacts on mixed-layer depth have little impact on the simulated AMOC: despite increased dense-water formation in the Norwegian Sea, only a small fraction of the water formed makes its way south into the North Atlantic basin. Version 2.1 also exhibits small improvements in the atmospheric climatology, with smaller biases in many notable quantities and modes of variability."

Our results reveal changes in particle characteristics during wildfire days, with particle number concentrations decreasing by 60% and particle diameter increasing by 30% compared to nonwildfire days. Moreover, the median lung deposited surface area (LDSA) levels rose by 31% during wildfire events. We employed gradient boosting models to estimate near-road LDSA levels on both wildfire and nonwildfire days. The LDSA ratio (wildfire/nonwildfire) exceeded 2.0 in certain areas along highways and in downtown Toronto. Furthermore, our findings show that marginalized communities faced greater LDSA increases than less marginalized ones. Under wildfire conditions, the LDSA ratio difference between the most and least marginalized groups was 16% for recent immigrants and visible minorities and 7% for seniors and children, both statistically significant.

It contains antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) that pose significant antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threats. Herein, aerobic and anaerobic membrane bioreactors (AeMBRs and AnMBRs, respectively) were compared in terms of the volume of waste sludge generated by them, the presence of ARGs in the sludge, and the potential for horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events using metagenomics to determine which treatment process can better address AMR concerns associated with the generation of waste sludge. The estimated abundance of ARGs in the suspended sludge generated by the AnMBR per treated volume is, on average, 5–55 times lower than that of sludge generated by the AeMBR. Additionally, the ratio of potential HGT in the two independent runs was lower in the anaerobic sludge (0.6 and 0.9) compared with that in the aerobic sludge (2.4 and 1.6). The AnMBR sludge exhibited reduced HGT of ARGs involving potential opportunistic pathogens (0.09) compared with the AeMBR sludge (0.27). Conversely, the AeMBR sludge displayed higher diversity and more transfer events, encompassing genes that confer resistance to quinolones, rifamycin, multidrug, aminoglycosides, and tetracycline. A significant portion of these ARGs were transferred to Burkholderia sp. By contrast, the AnMBR showed a lower abundance of mobile genetic elements associated with conjugation and exhibited less favorable conditions for natural transformation. Our findings suggest that the risk of potential HGT to opportunistic pathogens is greater in the AeMBR sludge than in AnMBR sludge."

Here, we conduct a mining site-specific environmental impact assessment of lithium on a global scale, focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water use, and land use. We then track the production and international trade flows of all lithium-containing commodities to assess how lithium mining impacts are distributed across global supply chains. Results indicate that environmental impact intensities of battery-grade Li2CO3 production from various mine sites differ between 4 times for GHG emissions to 2885 times for land use. 56–68% of environmental impacts generated in the mining countries were embodied in internationally traded lithium flows. On the production side, China, Australia, and Chile were the top 3 countries, accounting for 91–94% of environmental impacts. Regarding final demand, China was the major consuming region, inducing 46–47% of the environmental impacts of global lithium mining, followed by Korea (17–18%) and the EU-27 (9%).

Elemental mercury (Hg0) is the dominant species in flue gas and is hard to immobilize. Therefore, it is necessary to comprehend the reaction mechanisms of Hg0 oxidation, namely, Hg0 to oxidized mercury (Hg2+), for mercury immobilization. In spite of extensive research on homogeneous Hg0 oxidation, universal accurate prediction models and unified explanations are lacking. In this study, for the first time, quantitative prediction models were developed for the Hg0 oxidation percentage with machine learning (ML) using flue gas compositions and operating conditions as inputs. Gradient boosting regression models showed optimal performance (test R2 ≥ 0.85). ML-aided feature analysis results exhibited that Cl2, HCl, Hg0, temperature, and HBr were the top five critical factors affecting mercury homogeneous oxidation. Halogen gas promoted Hg0 oxidation at temperatures around 250 °C, while Hg0, SO2, and quench rates were not conducive to Hg0 oxidation. High reaction rate coefficients for the Hg/Cl and Hg/Br reactions verified the ML interpretive results and revealed the major mercury homogeneous oxidation mechanisms. Models developed here may play important roles in understanding Hg0 oxidation and optimizing flue gas Hg immobilization technologies."

This study elucidates the relationship between solute–membrane electrostatic interactions and solute permeability in RO membranes. The transport of salt and neutral molecules through charged polyamide (PA) and uncharged cellulose triacetate (CTA) RO membranes was examined. Results show that salt rejection and salt permeability in the PA membrane are highly dependent on the solution pH due to the variations of membrane charge density and the Donnan potential at the membrane–solution interface. Specifically, a higher salt rejection (and hence lower salt permeability) of the PA membrane is observed under alkaline conditions compared to acidic conditions. This observation is attributed to the enhanced Donnan potential at higher solution pH, which hinders co-ion partitioning into the membrane. In contrast, for salt transport through the CTA membrane and neutral solute transport through both membranes, solute permeability is independent of the solution pH and solute concentration due to the negligible Donnan effect. Overall, our results demonstrate the important role of solute-membrane electrostatic interactions, combined with steric exclusion, in regulating solute permeability in RO membranes."

The study revealed that dust could be coated by abundant fluorescent substances, with a maximum fluorescence efficiency reaching 0.15. Moreover, the fluorescent spectra of air pollutants exhibited a unimodal structure, while the spectra of dust exhibited three peaks, suggesting that they may be useful for highly accurate identification of dust aerosols from other aerosols.

We investigated the possible isotopic exchange between Fe2+aq and sedimentary Fe(III) in Fe–Si–C-rich lake sediments. 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy was used to evaluate Fe mineral speciation in unaltered lake sediments. Unaltered and oxidized sediment laboratory incubations were coupled with a classical kinetic approach that allows a quantitative description of the reactivity of assemblages of Fe-(oxyhydr)oxides found in sediments. Specifically, unaltered and oxidized sediment samples were separately incubated with an 55Fe2+aq-enriched solution and exchange was observed between 55Fe2+aq and sedimentary Fe(III), highest in the top of the sediment and decreasing with depth with the 55Fe2+aq tracer distributed within the bulk of the sedimentary Fe(III) phase.

However, the mechanisms by which they alter the carbon stability within soil aggregates remain unclear . Herein, a one-year field experiment was conducted in an arid agricultural region employing stable isotope techniques to evaluate the soil organic carbon flow in the presence of both persistent (PE, PVC) and biodegradable (PLA, PHA) MPs. PE and PVC reduced the stability of soil aggregates, while PLA and PHA maintained it. Additionally, organic carbon content increased in microaggregates but decreased in small macroaggregates for PE and PVC treatments. By contrast, treatment with PLA and PHA enhanced organic carbon content across aggregates. The δ13C values of PE- and PVC-treated aggregates ranged from −25.34 to −20.85‰, while those of PLA and PHA ranged from −16.29 to −9.26‰. Notably, MPs altered the direction of carbon flow between aggregates, reduced carbon flux, and accelerated carbon emissions.

Electrochemical reduction (ER) is an efficient technology for dehalogenation, but it still suffers from limited efficiencies in breaking C–F bonds. Herein, we present a strategy to enhance C–F cleavage and promote detoxification by loading benchmark palladium cathodes onto boron-doped carbon. This improves the florfenicol (FLO) degradation rate constant and defluorination efficiency by 1.24 and 1.05 times, respectively, and improves the defluorination of various fluorinated compounds. The cathode with optimal B content shows superior mass activity for FLO degradation (1.11 mmol g–1 Pd min–1), which is 5.9 times that of commercial Pd/C and is among the best-reported cathodes. Notably, the exclusive formation of the direct defluorination product (i.e., FLO-F) on Pd/B–C implies a higher intrinsic C–F cleavage ability endowed by B doping. As revealed by experiments and theoretical calculations, boron modification enhances palladium binding and induces stronger strain effects and higher electron density for surface palladium atoms, which boosts H* generation and reduces the energy barrier for C–F cleavage.

A prevalent strategy to enhance the monovalent and multivalent ion selective separation performance involves modifying the membrane surface charge properties to influence the Donnan exclusion. However, the counterion adsorption and shielding effects are aggravated with increasing ionic strength, which severely weaken the Donnan exclusion. This study revealed that the contribution of Donnan exclusion was fairly moderate to SO42– rejection in high salinity solutions, while it was dielectric exclusion that exerted the most important influence on Cl–/SO42– selective separation with a pore radius at 0.35–0.44 nm (molecular weight cutoff at 180–300 Da). Consequently, we proposed that tailored design of nanofiltration membranes with a precise pore radius to fully utilize the steric and dielectric exclusion instead of increasing membrane charge density is more crucial for monovalent/multivalent ion selective separation in high salinity solutions.

Here we aimed to investigate the effects of three typical BFRs (BDE-47, BDE-209, and DBDPE) on the development of atherosclerosis and explored the underlying mechanisms using an in vitro cell model and ApoE–/– mice. Our data showed that BFRs significantly inhibited the viability of human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) and induced the generation of ROS. BFRs significantly enhanced the content of Ox-LDL in THP-1 macrophages, which promoted the formation of foam cells. In an in vivo study, BFRs exposure significantly increased the plaque area and lipid content in the aortic root of mice. BFRs significantly increased the ROS level in plaques and promoted the expression level of adhesion molecule ICAM-1, which enhanced the recruitment of macrophages. Transcriptome analysis showed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in signaling pathways related to oxidative stress and lipid metabolism.

Accurate estimation of phytoplankton growth rates and Net Primary Production (NPP) from space requires knowledge of θ $\theta $, but cloud cover creates gaps.

Groundwater δ18O might help provide clarity as they are a widely distributed record of annual weighted mean precipitated δ18O. Here, groundwater δ18O during the last glacial maximum (LGM) and late Holocene (LH) are first illustrated throughout China based on 158 archived δ18O and 14C measurements. Between LGM and LH, the magnitude of changes in groundwater δ18O is higher in North China (NC > 2‰) than South China (SC < 0.5‰). This spatial inconsistency is similar to the seasonal precipitation δ18O variations in China caused by changes in atmospheric circulation patterns. Likewise, the difference of groundwater δ18O between LGM and LH in NC and SC is attributed to changes in the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM): during the LGM, the EASM was weaker in significantly affecting NC, whereas during the LH, the EASM was stronger and moved northward into NC. This illustrates that although the monsoon strengthens, the higher δ18O values in groundwater in NC are still found during the LH than that during the LGM. Furthermore, this spatial difference between NC and SC highlights the importance of moisture sources in affecting precipitation δ18O values, implying that the explanation for paleoclimate reconstruction based on stable isotope effects might need careful examination."

Nitrogen oxides (NOx), emitted by ocean‐going vessels, react with sea salt chloride to generate reactive chlorine species. However, the exact mechanisms and chemical budget of chlorine remain poorly understood. In this study, we explore chlorine activation through field observations in Hong Kong, complemented by box modeling. Over the 2‐week measurement period, the summer monsoon introduced abundant NOx, producing molecular chlorine (Cl2, 0.64 ± 0.69 ppt) and hypochlorous acid (HOCl, 8.9 ± 5.1 ppt). Daytime Cl2 production was attributable to nitrate (NO3−) photolysis and the uptake on hydroxyl radicals (OH·) on chloride‐containing aerosols. A budget analysis using the box model revealed that the production rate of HOCl, primarily driven by chlorine nitrate (ClONO2) hydrolysis, was substantially lower than its loss rate. This discrepancy indicates either uncertainties in known HOCl sources or a missing source of chlorine atoms (Cl·). We examined the potential precursors of Cl· by incorporating emerging reactive chlorine species, such as, trichloramine (NCl3) and iodine chloride (ICl), into the model. However, the inclusion of NCl3 caused an overestimation of ambient Cl2 levels, while adding ICl led to excessive ozone (O3) depletion. Incorporating an unknown Cl· source (equivalent to ∼46 ppt Cl2) remarkably enhanced atmospheric oxidation capacity, increasing daytime OH· levels by 12.8% and net ozone production by 35.7% while decreasing the mercury (Hg) lifetime by a factor of 3. These findings highlight the incomplete understanding of chlorine chemistry and suggest the existence of unidentified Cl· sources in coastal environments."

Assisted natural regeneration (ANR) emerges as a promising approach to achieving global forest restoration targets, yet its potential and benefits for climate and biodiversity in China remain underexplored. Here, we assessed ANR potential across China and modeled spatial prioritization strategies targeting climate mitigation, biodiversity conservation, and cost savings, individually and in combination, as well as strategies considering spatial constraints from current forest restoration projects and fragmentation mitigation. From 1995 to 2015, 3.40 million hectares of land naturally regenerated into forests, with an additional 5.11 million hectares identified as potential regeneration areas, which could contribute to 12.41% of China's restoration goal in 2035. Spatial prioritization revealed limited overlap among the three single‐objective ANR strategies, while a multi‐objective optimization strategy emerged as the most effective solution to achieve synergies among goals. The top 30% of prioritized areas under the multi‐objective strategy could sequester 46.54 gigatons of CO2, reduce extinction risks of forest‐dependent species by 40.64%, and lower implementation costs by 31.55% compared to monoculture tree plantations.

Two key questions are how relevant is this exacerbation and whether tsunami design parameters are significantly affected. We perform a non‐stationary probabilistic tsunami hazard assessment (nPTHA) in the Southern California bays of San Pedro and San Diego, with consideration of tsunamis generated by earthquakes in the Alaska‐Aleutians (ASZ) and Cascadia subduction zones (CSZ). We evaluate the changes of the maximum considered tsunami (MCT) design parameter, defined as a tsunami intensity that is exceeded with a 2% probability in 50 years. MCT elevation maps in the bays are calculated incorporating tides and SLR by means of a surrogate model. MCT elevations at assessed sites in San Pedro Bay and San Diego yield 2 m. The nPTHA shows that tsunamis generated in the ASZ zone are more hazardous in Southern California than those from the CSZ when evaluating MCT intensities. A comparison of scenarios with and without SLR also shows an increase of the MCT elevations of more than a foot in San Pedro Bay and San Diego, demonstrating that SLR causes a relevant impact, comparable to the influence of tides. The effect of SLR increasing MCT values is also comparable to the sensitivity of nPTHA results to some common earthquake epistemic uncertainties, such as the slip marginal distribution. Future tsunami hazard maps shall incorporate SLR when exposure times are long, as well as the uncertainty of tsunamigenic earthquake properties."

With the use of the model we evaluated grassland performance across the Mediterranean for two most commonly used architectures, namely mixed mounted solar panels and rotating solar tracking panels. We found that C3 grassland yields can be significantly enhanced only in climates where annual potential evapotranspiration exceeds annual rainfall. Changes in grassland productivity were attributed primarily to changes in the light environment at the land surface, with changes in surface aerodynamic roughness and rainfall redistribution due to drainage on panels playing a smaller negative role of comparable magnitudes."

These challenges involve: integrating thinking, data collection, modeling, and prediction across disciplines in a manner that facilitates the work of practitioners and regulators; scaling across time and space; measuring and predicting feedbacks and nonlinear interactions; measuring and predicting resilience and resistance of floodplains and river corridors to natural and human‐induced disturbances; and effectively communicating social and technical uncertainties in river management."

 State-of-the-art climate models project a substantial decline in precipitation for the Mediterranean region in the future1. Supporting this notion, several studies based on observed precipitation data spanning recent decades have suggested a decrease in Mediterranean precipitation2–4, with some attributing a large fraction of this change to anthropogenic influences3,5. Conversely, certain researchers have underlined that Mediterranean precipitation exhibits considerable spatiotemporal variability driven by atmospheric circulation patterns6,7 maintaining stationarity over the long term8,9. These conflicting perspectives underscore the need for a comprehensive assessment of precipitation changes in this region, given the profound social, economic and environmental implications. Here we show that Mediterranean precipitation has largely remained stationary from 1871 to 2020, albeit with significant multi-decadal and interannual variability. This conclusion is based on the most comprehensive dataset available for the region, encompassing over 23,000 stations across 27 countries. While trends can be identified for some periods and subregions, our findings attribute these trends primarily to atmospheric dynamics, which would be mostly linked to internal variability. Furthermore, our assessment reconciles the observed precipitation trends with Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 model simulations, neither of which indicate a prevailing past precipitation trend in the region. The implications of our results extend to environmental, agricultural and water resources planning in one of the world’s prominent climate change hotspots10.

 Antigenic variation is an immune evasion strategy used by many different pathogens. It involves the periodic, non-random switch in the expression of different antigens throughout an infection. How the observed hierarchy in antigen expression is achieved has remained a mystery1,2. A key challenge in uncovering this process has been the inability to track transcriptome changes and potential genomic rearrangements in individual cells during a switch event. Here we report the establishment of a highly sensitive single-cell RNA sequencing approach for the model protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei. This approach has revealed genomic rearrangements that occur in individual cells during a switch event. Our data show that following a double-strand break in the transcribed antigen-coding gene—an important trigger for antigen switching—the type of repair mechanism and the resultant antigen expression depend on the availability of a homologous repair template in the genome. When such a template was available, repair proceeded through segmental gene conversion, creating new, mosaic antigen-coding genes. Conversely, in the absence of a suitable template, a telomere-adjacent antigen-coding gene from a different part of the genome was activated by break-induced replication. Our results show the critical role of repair sequence availability in the antigen selection mechanism. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the power of highly sensitive single-cell RNA sequencing methods in detecting genomic rearrangements that drive transcriptional changes at the single-cell level.

 Crop production faces persistent threats from insect-vector-borne viral diseases1,2. Recent advancements have revealed the intricate immune mechanisms that plants deploy against viral pathogens3–8. However, the molecular mechanisms through which plant hosts recognize viral infections and initiate antiviral defence at disease onset have not been elucidated. Here, through the natural infection of rice by inoculation with insect vectors carrying the natural forms of viruses, we show that viral coat proteins are perceived by the RING1–IBR–RING2-type ubiquitin ligase (RBRL), initiating the first step of the natural antiviral response in rice. RBRL subsequently targets an adaptor protein of the transcriptional repression complex of the jasmonate pathway, NOVEL INTERACTOR OF JAZ 3 (NINJA3), for degradation through the ubiquitination system, inducing jasmonate signalling and activating downstream antiviral defence. We further show that this phenomenon is a universal molecular mechanism used by rice plants to perceive viral infections and initiate antiviral signalling cascades. This approach is important not only for obtaining a deeper understanding of virus–host interactions but also for further disease resistance breeding.

 In a subset of children and adolescents, SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a severe acute hyperinflammatory shock1 termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) at four to eight weeks after infection. MIS-C is characterized by a specific T cell expansion2 and systemic hyperinflammation3. The pathogenesis of MIS-C remains largely unknown.

This functional impairment in T cell reactivity is accompanied by the presence of TGFβ-response signatures in T cells, B cells and monocytes along with reduced antigen-presentation capabilities of monocytes, and can be reversed by blocking TGFβ. Furthermore, T cell receptor repertoires of patients with MIS-C exhibit expansion of T cells expressing TCRVβ21.3, resembling Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-reactive T cell clones capable of eliminating EBV-infected B cells. Additionally, serum TGFβ in patients with MIS-C can trigger EBV reactivation, which is reversible with TGFβ blockade. Clinically, the TGFβ-induced defect in T cell reactivity correlates with a higher EBV seroprevalence in patients with MIS-C compared with age-matched controls, along with the occurrence of EBV reactivation. Our findings establish a connection between SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 sequelae in children, in which impaired T cell cytotoxicity triggered by TGFβ overproduction leads to EBV reactivation and subsequent hyperinflammation. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome following SARS-CoV-2 infection results from increased serum levels of TGFβ, which impairs the reactivation of virus-specific T cells."

 The goal of future quantum networks is to enable new internet applications that are impossible to achieve using only classical communication1–3. Up to now, demonstrations of quantum network applications4–6 and functionalities7–12 on quantum processors have been performed in ad hoc software that was specific to the experimental setup, programmed to perform one single task (the application experiment) directly into low-level control devices using expertise in experimental physics. Here we report on the design and implementation of an architecture capable of executing quantum network applications on quantum processors in platform-independent high-level software. We demonstrate the capability of the architecture to execute applications in high-level software by implementing it as a quantum network operating system—QNodeOS—and executing test programs, including a delegated computation from a client to a server13 on two quantum network nodes based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in diamond14,15. We show how our architecture allows us to maximize the use of quantum network hardware by multitasking different applications. Our architecture can be used to execute programs on any quantum processor platform corresponding to our system model, which we illustrate by demonstrating an extra driver for QNodeOS for a trapped-ion quantum network node based on a single 40Ca+ atom16. Our architecture lays the groundwork for computer science research in quantum network programming and paves the way for the development of software that can bring quantum network technology to society.

 The eukaryote Tree of Life (eToL) depicts the relationships among all eukaryotic organisms; its root represents the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) from which all extant complex lifeforms are descended1. Locating this root is crucial for reconstructing the features of LECA, both as the endpoint of eukaryogenesis and the start point for the evolution of the myriad complex traits underpinning the diversification of living eukaryotes. However, the position of the root remains contentious due to pervasive phylogenetic artefacts stemming from inadequate evolutionary models, poor taxon sampling and limited phylogenetic signal1. Here we estimate the root of the eToL with unprecedented resolution on the basis of a new, much larger, dataset of mitochondrial proteins that includes all known eukaryotic supergroups. Our analyses of a 100 taxon × 93 protein dataset with state-of-the-art phylogenetic models and an extensive evaluation of alternative hypotheses show that the eukaryotic root lies between two multi-supergroup assemblages: ‘Opimoda+’ and ‘Diphoda+’. This position is consistently supported across different models and robustness analyses. Notably, groups containing ‘typical excavates’ are placed on both sides of the root, suggesting the complex features of the ‘excavate’ cell architecture trace back to LECA. This study sheds light on the ancestral cells from which extant eukaryotes arose and provides a crucial framework for investigating the origin and evolution of canonical eukaryotic features.

 Two-dimensional (2D) metals are appealing for many emergent phenomena and have recently attracted research interests1–9. Unlike the widely studied 2D van der Waals (vdW) layered materials, 2D metals are extremely challenging to achieve, because they are thermodynamically unstable1,10. Here we develop a vdW squeezing method to realize diverse 2D metals (including Bi, Ga, In, Sn and Pb) at the ångström thickness limit. The achieved 2D metals are stabilized from a complete encapsulation between two MoS2 monolayers and present non-bonded interfaces, enabling access to their intrinsic properties. Transport and Raman measurements on monolayer Bi show excellent physical properties, for example, new phonon mode, enhanced electrical conductivity, notable field effect and large nonlinear Hall conductivity. Our work establishes an effective route for implementing 2D metals, alloys and other 2D non-vdW materials, potentially outlining a bright vision for a broad portfolio of emerging quantum, electronic and photonic devices.

 Habitat fragmentation generally reduces biodiversity at the patch scale (α diversity)1. However, there is ongoing debate about whether such negative effects can be alleviated at the landscape scale (γ diversity) if among-patch diversity (β diversity) increases as a result of fragmentation2–6. This controversial view has not been rigorously tested. Here we use a dataset of 4,006 taxa across 37 studies from 6 continents to test the effects of fragmentation on biodiversity across scales by explicitly comparing continuous and fragmented landscapes. We find that fragmented landscapes consistently have both lower α diversity and lower γ diversity. Although fragmented landscapes did tend to have higher β diversity, this did not translate into higher γ diversity. Our findings refute claims that habitat fragmentation can increase biodiversity at landscape scales, and emphasize the need to restore habitat and increase connectivity to minimize biodiversity loss at ever-increasing scales.

 Who the first inhabitants of Western Europe were, what their physical characteristics were, and when and where they lived are some of the pending questions in the study of the settlement of Eurasia during the Early Pleistocene epoch. The available palaeoanthropological information from Western Europe is limited and confined to the Iberian Peninsula1,2. Here we present most of the midface of a hominin found at the TE7 level of the Sima del Elefante site (Sierra de Atapuerca, Spain), dated to between 1.4 million and 1.1 million years ago. This fossil (ATE7-1) represents the earliest human face of Western Europe identified thus far. Most of the morphological features of the midface of this hominin are primitive for the Homo clade and they do not display the modern-like aspect exhibited by Homo antecessor found at the neighbouring Gran Dolina site, also in the Sierra de Atapuerca, and dated to between 900,000 and 800,000 years ago3. Furthermore, ATE7-1 is more derived in the nasoalveolar region than the Dmanisi and other roughly contemporaneous hominins. On the basis of the available evidence, it is reasonable to assign the new human remains from TE7 level to Homo aff. erectus. From the archaeological, palaeontological and palaeoanthropological information obtained in the lower levels of the Sima del Elefante and Gran Dolina sites4–8, we suggest a turnover in the human population in Europe at the end of the Early Pleistocene.

 Active systems composed of energy-generating microscopic constituents are a promising platform to create autonomous functional materials1–16 that can, for example, locomote through complex and unpredictable environments. Yet coaxing these energy sources into useful mechanical work has proved challenging. Here we engineer active solids based on centimetre-scale building blocks that perform adaptive locomotion. These prototypes exhibit a non-variational form of elasticity characterized by odd moduli8,12,17, whose magnitude we predict from microscopics using coarse-grained theories and which we validate experimentally. When interacting with an external environment, these active solids spontaneously undergo limit cycles of shape changes, which naturally lead to locomotion such as rolling and crawling. The robustness of the locomotion is rooted in an emergent feedback loop between the active solid and the environment, which is mediated by elastic deformations and stresses. As a result, our active solids are able to accelerate, adjust their gaits and locomote through a variety of terrains with a similar performance to more complex control strategies implemented by neural networks. Our work establishes active solids as a bridge between materials and robots and suggests decentralized strategies to control the nonlinear dynamics of biological systems8,18–22, soft materials5,6,9,11,12,23–25 and driven nanomechanical devices7,26–30.

 Global ocean surface temperatures were at record levels for more than a year from April 2023 onwards, exceeding the previous record in 2015–2016 by 0.25 °C on average between April 2023 and March 20241. The nearly global extent and unprecedented intensity of this event prompted questions about how exceptional it was and whether climate models can represent such record-shattering jumps in surface ocean temperatures2. Here we construct observation-based synthetic time series to show that a jump in global sea surface temperatures that breaks the previous record by at least 0.25 °C is a 1-in-512-year event under the current long-term warming trend (1-in-205-year to 1-in-1,185-year event; 95% confidence interval). Without a global warming trend, such an event would have been practically impossible. Using 270 simulations from a wide range of fully coupled climate models, we show that these models successfully simulate such record-shattering jumps in global ocean surface temperatures, underpinning the models’ usefulness in understanding the characteristics, drivers and consequences of such events. These model simulations suggest that the record-shattering jump in surface ocean temperatures in 2023–2024 was an extreme event after which surface ocean temperatures are expected to revert to the expected long-term warming trend.

 Intratumour heterogeneity and phenotypic plasticity drive tumour progression and therapy resistance1,2. Oncogene dosage variation contributes to cell-state transitions and phenotypic heterogeneity3, thereby providing a substrate for somatic evolution. Nonetheless, the genetic mechanisms underlying phenotypic heterogeneity are still poorly understood. Here we show that extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a major source of high-level focal amplification in key oncogenes and a major contributor of MYC heterogeneity in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We demonstrate that ecDNAs drive varying levels of MYC dosage, depending on their regulatory landscape, enabling cancer cells to rapidly and reversibly adapt to microenvironmental changes. In the absence of selective pressure, a high ecDNA copy number imposes a substantial fitness cost on PDAC cells. We also show that MYC dosage affects cell morphology and dependence of cancer cells on stromal niche factors. Our work provides a detailed analysis of ecDNAs in PDAC and describes a new genetic mechanism driving MYC heterogeneity in PDAC. In a model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, extrachromosomal DNAs are shown to be a source of high-level focal amplification driving MYC heterogeneity and phenotypic adaptation."

 Many natural motor skills, such as speaking or locomotion, are acquired through a process of trial-and-error learning over the course of development. It has long been hypothesized, motivated by observations in artificial learning experiments, that dopamine has a crucial role in this process. Dopamine in the basal ganglia is thought to guide reward-based trial-and-error learning by encoding reward prediction errors1, decreasing after worse-than-predicted reward outcomes and increasing after better-than-predicted ones. Our previous work in adult zebra finches—in which we changed the perceived song quality with distorted auditory feedback—showed that dopamine in Area X, the singing-related basal ganglia, encodes performance prediction error: dopamine is suppressed after worse-than-predicted (distorted syllables) and activated after better-than-predicted (undistorted syllables) performance2. However, it remains unknown whether the learning of natural behaviours, such as developmental vocal learning, occurs through dopamine-based reinforcement. Here we tracked song learning trajectories in juvenile zebra finches and used fibre photometry3 to monitor concurrent dopamine activity in Area X. We found that dopamine was activated after syllable renditions that were closer to the eventual adult version of the song, compared with recent renditions, and suppressed after renditions that were further away. Furthermore, the relationship between dopamine and song fluctuations revealed that dopamine predicted the future evolution of song, suggesting that dopamine drives behaviour. Finally, dopamine activity was explained by the contrast between the quality of the current rendition and the recent history of renditions—consistent with dopamine’s hypothesized role in encoding prediction errors in an actor–critic reinforcement-learning model4,5. Reinforcement-learning algorithms6 have emerged as a powerful class of model to explain learning in reward-based laboratory tasks, as well as for driving autonomous learning in artificial intelligence7. Our results suggest that complex natural behaviours in biological systems can also be acquired through dopamine-mediated reinforcement learning. Studies in zebra finches show that dopamine has a key role as a reinforcement signal in the trial-and-error process of learning that underlies complex natural behaviours."

 Mechanical metamaterials with high recoverable elastic energy density, which we refer to as high-enthalpy elastic metamaterials, can offer many enhanced properties, including efficient mechanical energy storage1,2, load-bearing capability, impact resistance and motion agility. These qualities make them ideal for lightweight, miniaturized and multi-functional structures3–8. However, achieving high enthalpy is challenging, as it requires combining conflicting properties: high stiffness, high strength and large recoverable strain9–11. Here, to address this challenge, we construct high-enthalpy elastic metamaterials from freely rotatable chiral metacells. Compared with existing non-chiral lattices, the non-optimized chiral metamaterials simultaneously maintain high stiffness, sustain larger recoverable strain, offer a wider buckling plateau, improve the buckling strength by 5–10 times, enhance enthalpy by 2–160 times and increase energy per mass by 2–32 times. These improvements arise from torsional buckling deformation that is triggered by chirality and is absent in conventional metamaterials. This deformation mode stores considerable additional energy while having a minimal impact on peak stresses that define material failure. Our findings identify a mechanism and provide insight into the design of metamaterials and structures with high mechanical energy storage capacity, a fundamental and general problem of broad engineering interest.

 Nanoribbons, nanometre-wide strips of a two-dimensional material, are a unique system in condensed matter. They combine the exotic electronic structures of low-dimensional materials with an enhanced number of exposed edges, where phenomena including ultralong spin coherence times1,2, quantum confinement3 and topologically protected states4,5 can emerge. An exciting prospect for this material concept is the potential for both a tunable semiconducting electronic structure and magnetism along the nanoribbon edge, a key property for spin-based electronics such as (low-energy) non-volatile transistors6. Here we report the magnetic and semiconducting properties of phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs). We demonstrate that at room temperature, films of PNRs show macroscopic magnetic properties arising from their edge, with internal fields of roughly 240 to 850 mT. In solution, a giant magnetic anisotropy enables the alignment of PNRs at sub-1-T fields. By leveraging this alignment effect, we discover that on photoexcitation, energy is rapidly funnelled to a state that is localized to the magnetic edge and coupled to a symmetry-forbidden edge phonon mode. Our results establish PNRs as a fascinating system for studying the interplay between magnetism and semiconducting ground states at room temperature and provide a stepping-stone towards using low-dimensional nanomaterials in quantum electronics.

 Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) have a central pathogenetic role in the development of liver fibrosis. However, their fibrosis-independent and homeostatic functions remain poorly understood1–5. Here we demonstrate that genetic depletion of HSCs changes WNT activity and zonation of hepatocytes, leading to marked alterations in liver regeneration, cytochrome P450 metabolism and injury. We identify R-spondin 3 (RSPO3), an HSC-enriched modulator of WNT signalling, as responsible for these hepatocyte-regulatory effects of HSCs. HSC-selective deletion of Rspo3 phenocopies the effects of HSC depletion on hepatocyte gene expression, zonation, liver size, regeneration and cytochrome P450-mediated detoxification, and exacerbates alcohol-associated and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. RSPO3 expression decreases with HSC activation and is inversely associated with outcomes in patients with alcohol-associated and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. These protective and hepatocyte-regulating functions of HSCs via RSPO3 resemble the R-spondin-expressing stromal niche in other organs and should be integrated into current therapeutic concepts.

Rushworth,Basis functions for complex social decisions in dorsomedial frontal cortex,"A study combining group decision-making tasks with fMRI shows that the brain’s dorsomedial prefrontal cortex uses basis functions, similar to those in the visual, motor and spatial domains, to represent patterns of social interaction. 
 Navigating social environments is a fundamental challenge for the brain. It has been established that the brain solves this problem, in part, by representing social information in an agent-centric manner; knowledge about others’ abilities or attitudes is tagged to individuals such as ‘oneself’ or the ‘other’1–6. This intuitive approach has informed the understanding of key nodes in the social parts of the brain, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)7–9. However, the patterns or combinations in which individuals might interact with one another is as important as the identities of the individuals. Here, in four studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging, behavioural experiments and a social group decision-making task, we show that the dmPFC and ACC represent the combinatorial possibilities for social interaction afforded by a given situation, and that they do so in a compressed format resembling the basis functions used in spatial, visual and motor domains10–12. The basis functions align with social interaction types, as opposed to individual identities. Our results indicate that there are deep analogies between abstract neural coding schemes in the visual and motor domain and the construction of our sense of social identity. A study combining group decision-making tasks with fMRI shows that the brain’s dorsomedial prefrontal cortex uses basis functions, similar to those in the visual, motor and spatial domains, to represent patterns of social interaction."

 Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the principal energy currency of all living cells1,2. Metabolically impaired obligate intracellular parasites, such as the human pathogens Chlamydia trachomatis and Rickettsia prowazekii, can acquire ATP from their host cells through a unique ATP/adenosine diphosphate (ADP) translocator, which mediates the import of ATP into and the export of ADP and phosphate out of the parasite cells, thus allowing the exploitation of the energy reserves of host cells (also known as energy parasitism). This type of ATP/ADP translocator also exists in the obligate intracellular endosymbionts of protists and the plastids of plants and algae and has been implicated to play an important role in endosymbiosis3–31. The plastid/parasite type of ATP/ADP translocator is phylogenetically and functionally distinct from the mitochondrial ATP/ADP translocator, and its structure and transport mechanism are still unknown. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of two plastid/parasite types of ATP/ADP translocators in the apo and substrate-bound states. The ATP/ADP-binding pocket is located at the interface between the N and C domains of the translocator, and a conserved asparagine residue within the pocket is critical for substrate specificity. The translocator operates through a rocker-switch alternating access mechanism involving the relative rotation of the two domains as rigid bodies. Our results provide critical insights for understanding ATP translocation across membranes in energy parasitism and endosymbiosis and offer a structural basis for developing drugs against obligate intracellular parasites. ATP/ADP translocators in obligate intracellular parasites and plastids facilitate energy parasitism and endosymbiosis by mediating ATP import and ADP export, with their cryo-EM structures and mechanisms revealed, providing insights for drug development against intracellular pathogens."

 Given the high recurrence rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) post-resection1–3, improved early identification of patients at high risk for post-resection recurrence would help to improve patient outcomes and prioritize healthcare resources4–6. Here we observed a spatial and HCC recurrence-associated distribution of natural killer (NK) cells in the invasive front and tumour centre from 61 patients. Using extreme gradient boosting and inverse-variance weighting, we developed the tumour immune microenvironment spatial (TIMES) score based on the spatial expression patterns of five biomarkers (SPON2, ZFP36L2, ZFP36, VIM and HLA-DRB1) to predict HCC recurrence risk. The TIMES score (hazard ratio = 88.2, P < 0.001) outperformed current standard tools for patient risk stratification including the TNM and BCLC systems. We validated the model in 231 patients from five multicentred cohorts, achieving a real-world accuracy of 82.2% and specificity of 85.7%. The predictive power of these biomarkers emerged through the integration of their spatial distributions, rather than individual marker expression levels alone. In vivo models, including NK cell-specific Spon2-knockout mice, revealed that SPON2 enhances IFNγ secretion and NK cell infiltration at the invasive front. Our study introduces TIMES, a publicly accessible tool for predicting HCC recurrence risk, offering insights into its potential to inform treatment decisions for early-stage HCC.

 Climate change is expected to increase heavy rainfall with concomitant increases in flooding1. Causes of increased heavy rainfall include the higher water-holding capacity of a warmer atmosphere and changes in atmospheric circulation patterns2, which may translate into future heavy rainfall increases in most of Europe3. However, gathering evidence on the time evolution of past changes has been hampered by data limitations and measurement uncertainties, in particular for short rainfall durations, such as 1 h. Here we show an 8% increase in daily and 15% increase in hourly heavy rainfall over the last four decades by analysing a new dataset comprising 883 stations in Austria from 1900 to 2023. These increases are fully consistent between two independent networks and occurred after a retarding phase between 1960 and 1980. Hourly heavy rainfall changes are aligned with temperature increases with the sensitivity of a 7% increase per 1 °C of warming, in line with Clausius–Clapeyron scaling. Daily heavy rainfall changes, however, are aligned with atmospheric circulation indices with little correlation to air temperature, which suggests a bigger role of atmospheric circulation modes than previously thought. The daily heavy rainfall changes are remarkably consistent with observed flood increases of about 8% in large catchments. The hourly heavy rainfall changes are similarly consistent with flood changes in small catchments, although the flood increase is stronger (25% over the last four decades). Climate adaptation measures in flood management may therefore be more pressing for rivers draining smaller catchment areas than for large rivers. Long-term increases in heavy daily and hourly precipitation in Austria from different climatic mechanisms emphasize the need for flood management adaptation, especially in smaller catchments affected by the increased hourly rainfall."

 Magnonic systems provide a fertile playground for bosonic topology1, for example, Dirac2–6 and Weyl7,8 magnons, leading to a variety of exotic phenomena such as charge-free topologically protected boundary modes6,7, the magnon thermal Hall effect9 and the magnon spin Nernst effect10. However, their understanding has been hindered by the absence of fundamental symmetry descriptions of magnetic geometries and spin Hamiltonians primarily governed by isotropic Heisenberg interactions. The ensuing magnon dispersions enable gapless magnon band nodes that go beyond the scenario of representation theory of the magnetic space groups11,12, thus referred to as unconventional magnons. Here we developed spin space group13–17 theory to elucidate collinear magnetic configurations, classifying the 1,421 collinear spin space groups into 4 types, constructing their band representations and providing a comprehensive tabulation of unconventional magnons, such as duodecuple points, octuple nodal lines and charge-4 octuple points. On the basis of the MAGNDATA database18, we identified 498 collinear magnets with unconventional magnons, among which more than 200 magnon band structures were obtained by using first-principles calculations and linear spin wave theory. In addition, we evaluated the influence of the spin–orbit-coupling-induced exchange interaction in these magnets and found that more than 80 per cent are predominantly governed by the Heisenberg interactions, indicating that the spin space group serves as an ideal framework for describing magnon band nodes in most 3d, 4d and half-filled 4f collinear magnets.

 Ancient DNA from the Mediterranean region has revealed long-range connections and population transformations associated with the spread of food-producing economies1–6. However, in contrast to Europe, genetic data from this key transition in northern Africa are limited, and have only been available from the far western Maghreb (Morocco)1–3. Here we present genome-wide data for nine individuals from the Later Stone Age through the Neolithic period from Algeria and Tunisia. The earliest individuals cluster with pre-Neolithic people of the western Maghreb (around 15,000–7,600 years before present (bp)), showing that this ‘Maghrebi’ ancestry profile had a substantial geographic and temporal extent. At least one individual from Djebba (Tunisia), dating to around 8,000 years bp, harboured ancestry from European hunter–gatherers, probably reflecting movement in the Early Holocene across the Strait of Sicily. Later Neolithic people from the eastern Maghreb retained largely local forager ancestry, together with smaller contributions from European farmers (by around 7,000 years bp) and Levantine groups (by around 6,800 years bp), and were thus far less impacted by external gene flow than were populations in other parts of the Neolithic Mediterranean.

 Optical amplification, crucial for modern communication, primarily relies on erbium-doped fibre amplifiers (EDFAs)1,2. Yet, EDFAs only cover a portion of the low-loss spectrum of optical fibres. This has motivated the development of amplifiers operating beyond the erbium gain window. Pioneering work on optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs)3,4 using intrinsic third-order optical nonlinearity has led to demonstrations of increased channel capacity. OPAs offer high gain, can reach the 3-dB quantum limit for phase-preserving amplifiers and exhibit unidirectional operation. However, power requirements for highly nonlinear fibres3,5–8 or bulk waveguides9,10 have impeded their adoption. By contrast, OPAs based on integrated photonic circuits offer the advantages of substantially increased mode confinement and optical nonlinearity but have been limited in bandwidth11,12. We overcome this challenge by using low-loss gallium phosphide-on-silicon dioxide13–15 photonic integrated circuits (PICs) and attain up to 35 dB of parametric gain with waveguides only a few centimetres long in a compact footprint of 0.25 square millimetres. Fibre-to-fibre net gain exceeding 10 dB across an ultra-broad bandwidth of approximately 140 nm (that is, 17 THz) is achieved, with a threefold increase in the gain window compared with C-band EDFAs. We further demonstrate a high dynamic range for input signals, spanning six orders of magnitude, while maintaining a low noise figure. We exploit these performance characteristics to amplify coherent communication signals. This marks, to our knowledge, the first ultra-broadband, high-gain, continuous-wave amplification in a photonic chip, opening up new capabilities for next-generation integrated photonics.

Here, the authors report an inorganic–organic hybrid spinel oxide that enhances both catalytic activity and structural stability through a coordination method. 
 Fully triggering the deep-seated potential of traditional nanomaterials, such as the classic spinel family, is of paramount importance in the field of materials science, which is yet believed to heavily depend on advanced conceptual designs and synthetic strategies. Herein, a type of inorganic–organic hybrid spinel oxide is designed using a π-conjugated azobenzene single-tooth coordination method to overcome their stubborn problems of moderate activity and phase instability in electrocatalytic reactions. Taking spinel Co3O4 nanocubes as a pre-catalyst, after subtle etching of the cube surfaces, some oxygen atoms in the tetrahedral Co–O coordination field are replaced and selectively linked to weakly polar azo-extended π-conjugated units (π*–N=N–π*) via electrophilic carboxyl groups. The π-conjugation structure in Co3O4 suppresses the covalency competition between the tetrahedral and octahedral Co–O coordination fields, successfully preventing the phase transition during the electrocatalytic process and improving the electrocatalytic activity and durability. This study not only expands the spinel family but also provides useful guidelines for developing advanced functional materials.

 Increasing attention has been paid to silacyclobutanes because of their wide application in ring opening and ring extension reactions. However, the synthesis of functionalized silacyclobutanes remains an unmet challenge because of the limited functional group tolerance of the reactions with organometallic reagents and chlorosilacyclobutanes. Herein, we report a conceptually different solution to this end through a visible-light-induced metal-free hydrosilylation of unactivated alkenes with hydrosilacyclobutanes. A wide range of unactivated alkenes with diverse functional groups including the base-sensitive acid, alcohol and ketones participated in this reaction smoothly. In particular, the first hydrosilylation reaction of alkenes with dihydrosilacyclobutane provides a facile access to various functionalized alkyl monohydrosilacyclobutanes. Unsymmetrical dialkyl silacyclobutanes have also been synthesized through consecutive hydrosilylation with dihydrosilacyclobutane in one pot. The mechanism study reveals that the Lewis basic solvent could promote the generation of strained silyl radicals by direct light irradiation without a redox-active photocatalyst and the thiol catalyst plays an important role in accelerating the reaction. Silacyclobutanes have wide applications in ring opening and ring extension reactions, but functionalization remains challenging.

Here, the authors show that BaH2 does not merely serve as static platform for reactions during ammonia synthesis, but rather it is a dynamic entity that evolves under reaction conditions. 
 The modern view of industrial heterogeneous catalysis is evolving from the traditional static paradigm where the catalyst merely provides active sites, to that of a functional material in which dynamics plays a crucial role. Using machine learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations, we confirm this picture for the ammonia synthesis catalysed by BaH2. Recent experiments show that this system acts as a highly efficient catalyst, but only when exposed first to N2 and then to H2 in a chemical looping process. Our simulations reveal that when first exposed to N2, BaH2 undergoes a profound change, transforming into a superionic mixed compound, BaH2−2x(NH)x, characterized by a high mobility of both hydrides and imides. This transformation is not limited to the surface but involves the entire catalyst. When this compound is exposed to H2 in the second step of the looping process, ammonia is readily formed and released, a process greatly facilitated by the high ionic mobility. Once all the nitrogen hydrides are hydrogenated, the system reverts to its initial state, ready for the next looping cycle. Our microscopic analysis underlines the dynamic nature of this heterogeneous catalyst, which does not merely serve as static platform for reactions, rather it is a dynamic entity that evolves under reaction conditions.

Here the authors constrain projections to show that the magnitude of the NAO increases under high emissions, leading to more severe winters. 
 The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) dominates winters in Western Europe and eastern North America. Future climate model projections of the NAO are highly uncertain due to both modelled irreducible internal variability and different model responses. Here we show that some of the model spread in multi-decadal NAO simulations is caused by climatological water vapour errors, and develop an emergent constraint that reveals a substantial response of the NAO to volcanic eruptions and greenhouse gases (GHGs). Taking account of the signal-to-noise paradox apparent in these simulations suggests that under the high-emissions scenario the multi-decadal NAO will increase to unprecedented levels that will likely cause severe impacts, including increased flooding and storm damage. This can be avoided through mitigation to reduce GHG emissions. Our results suggest that taking model projections at face value and seeking consensus could leave society unprepared for impending extremes.

Using eight sensitivity experiments, we disentangle the individual impacts of these three components and their interactions on the forecast skill for the contiguous United States. The CESM2-S2S experiment, in which land states are initialized while atmosphere and ocean remain in their climatological states, contributes 91 ± 3% of the total sub-seasonal forecast skill across varying soil moisture conditions during summer and winter. Most SM predictability stems from the soil moisture memory effect. Additionally, land-atmosphere coupling contributes 50% of the land-driven soil moisture predictability.

 The Global Warming Potential-star (GWP*) approach is a way to convert the emissions of short-lived climate forcers to CO2-equivalent emissions while maintaining consistency with temperature outcomes. Here we evaluate the performance of GWP* when it is used to account for non-CO2 gases within the carbon budget framework. We convert methane (CH4) emissions to CO2-equivalent emissions via GWP* and calculate the temperature through simple climate models. We show that GWP* can accurately convert CH4 emissions to reproduce the temperature until 2100 under a variety of scenarios, including overshoot scenarios, except those with a rapid decline in CH4 emissions. Beyond 2100, however, the use of GWP* can lead to temperature overestimation since it extends beyond its calibration range. Furthermore, we find that under scenarios designed to achieve identical temperature targets but with varying overshoot profiles, cumulative CO2-eq budgets (GWP*-basis) generally increase with overshoot length and magnitude. This is driven by the internal dynamics of our model, as characterized by its negative zero-emission commitment. While the use of GWP* enhances such effects with increasing overshoot length, it exerts opposite effects with increasing overshoot magnitude."

 An unprecedented marine heatwave (MHW) struck the extratropical Northeastern Pacific during the summer of 2020. This study reveals that this event is characterized by a persistent atmospheric high-pressure anomaly in the MHW region, which leads to a decreased cloud cover, an increased surface shortwave radiation (SWR), a decreased mixed-layer depth, and an increased sea surface temperature (SST). The local net surface heat flux anomaly associated with the increased SWR primarily drives the increased SST, while the oceanic processes likely play a minor role. Both observations and simulations further demonstrate that the SST and high-pressure anomaly are closely associated with a large-scale wave train over the extratropical sector from Asia to the North Pacific which can be forced by the Tibetan Plateau heating change. According to our findings, the projection of a persistent warming Tibetan Plateau heightens the risk of escalating MHW events in the Northeastern Pacific under future scenarios."

 In 2012, soybean crops failed in the three largest producing regions due to spatially compounded hot and dry weather across North and South America. Here, we present different impact storylines of the 2012 event, calculated by combining a statistical crop model with climate model simulations of 2012 conditions under pre-industrial, present-day (+1 °C), and future (+2 °C) conditions. These simulations use the ECHAM6 climate model and maintain the same observed seasonally evolving atmospheric circulation. Our results demonstrate that anthropogenic warming strongly amplifies the impacts of such a large-scale circulation pattern on global soybean production. Although the drought intensity is similar under different warming levels, larger crop losses are driven not only by warmer temperatures but also by stronger heat-moisture interactions. We estimate that one-third of the global soybean production deficit in 2012 is attributable to anthropogenic climate change. Future warming (+2 °C above pre-industrial) would further exacerbate production deficits by one-half compared to present-day 2012 conditions. This highlights the increasing intensity of global soybean production shocks with warming, requiring urgent adaptation strategies.

 Humid high-elevation tropical ecosystems (HETEs), known as páramos, jalca, or moorlands, are essential for biodiversity conservation and water supply. Yet, a key question remains of how future climate change will affect their hydroclimatic spaces: the multidimensional hydroclimatic conditions in which they currently thrive. We use CMIP6-downscaled climate data to assess the potential breaching of these hydroclimatic spaces concerning the long-term means, extremes, and seasonality of temperature and precipitation. Our results show that HETEs in Northern South America will experience the largest increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation, leading to the breaching of their current hydroclimatic space by up to 100%.

CUPs were recorded in 97% of all vegetation and 97% of all topsoil samples (76 of 78 samples each). In total, 140 unique mixtures with ≥2 components were recorded. A prediction map using additional site parameters suggests a widespread presence of CUPs extending multiple hundred meters beyond CUP application areas. Landscape-scale mixture contamination is not addressed in environmental risk assessment for the regulation of pesticides. The study design could serve as a benchmark for evaluating landscape-scale pesticide contamination after implementation of pesticide reduction efforts in agricultural policies and practice. Agricultural landscapes in the Upper Rhine Valley, Germany showed substantial pesticide contamination up to hundreds of metres away from fields, according to analyses of 186 samples of vegetation, topsoil and water taken during the 2022 pesticide application season."

 Environmental migration occurs across spatial and temporal scales and is influenced by the dynamics of individual and collective human behavior, as well as environmental stresses. Agent-based modeling (ABM) has demonstrated potential for studying such complex processes, especially where individual decision-making is important. We developed an ABM to simulate environmental shocks, labor markets, and household livelihoods and used it to study environmental migration in rural Bangladesh. Using a pattern-oriented modeling approach, we found that an economic model of migration decisions can robustly reproduce observed patterns so long as economic inequality is properly represented. The results were sensitive to both the functional form and the parameters characterizing the distribution of land-ownership within a community. We conclude that community-level inequality has significant implications for environmental migration dynamics and should be considered in future policy interventions and research efforts. Levels of inequality within a community are important contributors to community-level patterns of migration, according simulations with an agent-based model of the influence of environmental shocks, labor markets, and household livelihoods on migration in Bangladesh."

 Previous studies have suggested that Arctic sea-ice loss can have a profound influence on atmospheric circulation far away from the Arctic. However, there is little scientific consensus on the features of these remote responses, with the opposite impacts reported. Here we present a multi-model analysis of the decadal climate response to Arctic sea-ice loss using state-of-the-art energy conserving methodologies to isolate the impacts of sea-ice decline. We observe weakening of the Aleutian Low and development of a geopotential ridge in the North Pacific, associated with drier winter conditions over the southwest United States. Over the Atlantic, a negative NAO-like response drives wetter winter conditions across the western Mediterranean. These decadal-scale impacts substantially differ from reported centennial-scale responses to Arctic sea-ice loss simulated using non-energy conserving methodologies. Factors such as the timescale of the response and methodologies used to isolate the impacts of disappearing sea-ice cover should be carefully considered when consolidating scientific understanding on the future impacts of changing Arctic.

 Low wind chill temperatures can have negative impacts on human health and the capability of performing outdoor activities. An open question is how climate change is projected to impact this hazard in high latitude land regions. Here we focus on changes in the magnitude and timing of extreme wind chill days (i.e., days with wind chill temperatures below −34.4 °C) in response to future changes in large-scale mean-state climate conditions in Alaska. We find a future reduction in extreme wind chill days, especially in northern Alaska and at lower elevations where most of the population resides. Moreover, the extreme wind chill days’ mean date shifts by up to two weeks later in the future, with a narrower seasonal distribution compared to the historical period. These changes are primarily attributed to increased temperatures rather than changes in wind speed. Our finding highlights how this hazard decreases under future large-scale mean-state climate conditions, with likely positive impacts for human health and an increased capability to perform outdoor activities.

 Arctic communities urgently need regional to local-scale information on the rapid coastal changes, caused by thawing permafrost, melting glaciers, and declining sea ice. We introduce a procedure for mapping coastal land cover change from satellite images in the challenging Arctic conditions (and beyond). Our approach utilizes data fusion and cloud computing in Google Earth Engine to process the full Landsat collections for the entire Arctic. It merges information from multiple Landsat sensors and utilizes complementary spatial data and two algorithms to enhance classification accuracy and processing efficiency. This mitigates issues with local illumination conditions and the low availability and quality of satellite data in the Arctic before 2010s. Calculating post-classification composites of coastal land cover over five-year time-steps effectively reduces the impacts of clouds, suspended sediment, and the tide. The procedure was iteratively developed in calibration sites with contrasting physical characteristics. Validation of the final product indicates an overall classification accuracy of more than 98 % (against manually labelled data) and a median shoreline error distance of c. 20 and 10 m in mesotidal and microtidal coasts, respectively. The resulting Arctic Coastal Change dataset presents coastal dynamics from 1984 to 2023 at a 30-m resolution, and highlights hotspots that experience coastal erosion or accretion at a rate of more than 10 m/a.

 The spatially continuous dynamic monitoring of near-surface NO2 concentrations on sub-daily scales would serve to enhance awareness of the current state of air pollution, which is crucial to improving regional air quality. Satellites, like OMI and TROPOMI, are capable of observing atmospheric NO2 column concentrations on a global scale. However, the fixed transit times of the satellites and severe data deficiencies restricted their applicability for revealing patterns of change in NO2 on sub-daily scales. This study proposes a time-constrained XGBoost model (T-XGB) to convert multi-source information to daily cumulative near-surface NO2 concentrations. Furthermore, a temporally conservative downscaling framework is developed to facilitate seamless monitoring of near-surface NO2 at the 0.03°/3-hour scale in China. Evaluated with in-situ NO2 measurements, the results have demonstrated the robust and excellent performance of the T-XGB (R2: 0.920–0.948; MAE: 2.89–3.67 µg/m3/h), as well as the accuracy of the temporally conserved downscaling technique (R2 > 0.973). The 3-hour near-surface NO2 was consistent with the TROPOMI observations at the corresponding moments and it exhibited a detailed gradient variation signature. In China, near-surface NO2 exhibited a single-peak diurnal variation, with an initial increase followed by a subsequent decrease. The maximum concentration was observed between 8p.m. and 11p.m. in local time. The assessment of NO2 pollution exposure can yield disparate results when evaluated at varying time scales. Sub-daily monitoring of NO2 provides a more detailed and nuanced understanding of the pollutant, making it a more applicable and flexible tool for use in subsequent studies."

 In urban areas of low-and middle-income countries, short-term anthropogenic activities, such as festive fireworks, escalate air pollution. Diwali, one of the major Indian festivals, leads to severe air quality conditions due to massive emissions from fireworks. While the mass concentrations in ambient fixed locations are well explored, the chemical characterization and the redox-active components during such events, as well as potential exposures in residential outdoor locations, are poorly studied. This study focuses on examining the diurnal variation of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and its chemical and toxicological properties in residential areas during festive fireworks. A 5-day continuous diurnal monitoring was conducted across different residential sites in Mumbai, India, using real-time PM sensors collocated with the gravimetric measurements. The collected particles were subjected to multiple optical (babs,370 and babs,880), chemical (ionic, water-soluble organic carbon, elemental), and oxidative potential (OPDTT and OPAA) analyses. The study shows that the average increase in residential outdoor PM2.5 concentration on Diwali night was ∼2.6 times higher than on non-Diwali night (206 ± 167 μg/m3). Similarly, optical parameters (babs,370 and babs,880) are elevated by 1.5 times, ions such as K+, NH4+, NO3−, and SO42− by 5 times while Zn, Pb, Mn, and Cu spiked by ∼ 3 times during Diwali night. Toxicity of the particles as estimated by OPDTTv and OPAAv, increased by ∼1.5-fold during Diwali night, and was significantly correlated with NO3−, SO42−, Mn, Ni, and As (p < 0.05). Chemical speciation data reveal that toxic pollutants from Diwali fireworks increase particle toxicity. This study highlights the need for strict regulation of fireworks and policies addressing acute emission events. To protect public health, long-term air quality management strategies are essential in urban areas of India, rather than just short-term bans on fireworks or other episodic events."

 The significance of terpenoid emissions from traffic-related and biogenic sources in urban areas of the developing world is largely unknown, mainly due to the lack of measurements. This study is based on well time-resolved continuous measurements of ambient monoterpene concentration at an urban site in western India during January–May 2020, coinciding with the winter-to-summer and COVID-19 pre-lockdown to lockdown transitions. Despite large day-to-day variations of α-pinene (7–76 ppt) and β-pinene (6–55 ppt) their levels in winter were slightly higher than in summer. The trends in monoterpenes concentrations do not directly reflect the impact of enhanced biogenic contributions in summer due to counterbalancing effects of increased rates of oxidation and dilution. However, the increase of ∑α+β-pinene/∑BTEX ratios from 5 to 13 in winter to 61–87 ppt ppb−1 in summer highlights the impact of increased biogenic contributions at higher temperatures. The very high ∑α+β-pinene/∑BTEX ratios during the strict COVID-19 lockdown phases than the pre-lockdown period could be additionally attributed to the reductions of anthropogenic emissions. The estimated relative daytime biogenic contributions to α-pinene increased from 66 ± 10% in January to 88 ± 13% in May, while that of β-pinene from 56 ± 8% to 70 ± 19%. Overall, depending on the season, the complex interplay between the variability in anthropogenic activities, biogenic emissions, and photochemical/meteorological factors controls the ambient air variability of monoterpenes. The study provides insights into seasonal changes in anthropogenic and biogenic contributions of atmospheric monoterpenes. The knowledge of monoterpene sources is critical to assess secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation, contributing to regional climate change."

 In recent years, vehicle emissions have emerged as one of the most significant sources of air pollutants and CO2 in Chinese cities. Promoting electric vehicles (EVs) has become a critical strategy for mitigating vehicle-related pollution. While replacing conventional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) with EVs reduces on-road emissions, the associated increase in electricity consumption and power plant emissions may introduce negative environmental impacts. Overlooking emissions from the upstream fuel production stage can lead to overestimating the benefits of vehicle electrification policies. Therefore, it is essential to comprehensively quantify the environmental effects of electric vehicle promotion policies during the whole fuel cycle. Given that generation emissions are closely tied to the electricity mix, Chengdu (a city with over 85% hydropower) was selected as a pilot city for this study. The research follows a structured approach of ‘emission inventory establishment - air quality simulation - environmental benefit assessment - policy scenario analysis'. We systematically account for fleet emissions in Chengdu over the fuel cycle, simulate pollutant concentrations using the SMOKE-WRF-CMAQ model, estimate premature deaths through the GEMM model with Chinese population distribution data, and evaluate energy-saving and carbon-reduction potentials under various scenarios. The findings reveal that the Electricity Vehicles (EV) scenario reduces annual GHG-100 emissions by nearly 80% compared to the Business As Usual (BAU) scenario, while the Electricity Vehicles with Low-Carbon power grid (EVLC) scenario brings an additional 2.3% reduction. The EV policy significantly reduces PM2.5, NOX, and SO2 concentrations in Chengdu's central urban area but leads to a notable increase in O3 levels. These differences are further amplified when considering population-weighted concentrations, reflecting fluctuations in population prevalence. Finally, we monetise the impacts of pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions using the Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) and Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), estimating that the promotion of EVs avoids approximately 3913 million yuan in economic losses. These results provide a theoretical foundation and data support for the scientific promotion of vehicle electrification policies and the formulation of low-carbon green development strategies for urban transport in Chengdu."

Without flow, resistantP. aeruginosacells generate local gradients by neutralizing all three antimicrobials through degradation or chemical modification. As flow increases, delivery overwhelms neutralization, allowing antimicrobials to penetrate deeper into bacterial populations.

ATP-binding cassette A (ABCA) proteins are lipid transporters associated with neurodegenerative diseases. How ABCA transporters regulate lipid homeostasis in neurodegeneration is an outstanding question. Here we report that theDrosophilaABCA protein engulfment ABC transporter in the ovary (Eato) regulates phagocytosis-dependent neurodegeneration by playing opposing roles in neurons and phagocytes: In neurons, Eato prevents dendrites and axons from being attacked by neighboring phagocytes; in phagocytes, Eato sensitizes the cell for detecting neurons as engulfment targets. Thus,Eatodeficiency in neurons alone causes phagocytosis-dependent neurite degeneration, but additionalEatoloss from phagocytes suppresses the neurite degeneration. Mechanistically, Eato functions by removing the eat-me signal phosphatidylserine from the cell surface in both neurons and phagocytes. Multiple human and worm ABCA homologs can rescueEatoloss in phagocytes but not in neurons, suggesting both conserved and cell type–specific activities of ABCA proteins. These results imply possible mechanisms of neuron-phagocyte interactions in neurodegenerative diseases."

Enteroviruses use the cloverleaf RNA structure at the 5′ end of the genome to balance these two processes. Cloverleaf acts as a promoter for RNA synthesis and forms a complex with viral 3CD protein, the precursor to 3Cproprotease, and 3Dpolpolymerase. The interaction between cloverleaf and 3CD is mediated by the 3Cprodomain, yet how 3Cpropromotes specific RNA-binding is not clear. We report the structure of coxsackievirus cloverleaf RNA-3Cprocomplex, wherein two 3Cpromolecules interact with cloverleaf stem-loop D. 3Cprodimer mainly recognizes the shape of the dsRNA helix through symmetric interactions, suggesting that 3Cprois a previously undiscovered type of RNA binding protein.

Although chromatin intratumoral heterogeneity is a characteristic feature of GBM, most current studies are conducted at a single tumor site. To investigate the GBM-specific 3D genome organization and its heterogeneity, we conducted Hi-C experiments in 21 GBM samples from nine patients, along with three normal brain samples. We identified genome subcompartmentalization and chromatin interactions specific to GBM, as well as extensive intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity at these levels. We identified copy number variants (CNVs) and structural variations (SVs) and demonstrated how they disrupted 3D genome structures. SVs could not only induce enhancer hijacking but also cause the loss of enhancers to the same gene, both of which contributed to gene dysregulation.

This is particularly controversial in the marine realm, where the success of restoration is mostly evaluated in terms of the short-term survival of transplanted organisms. In view of this, we combined population and trait-based approaches to explore the long-term effectiveness of active restoration of a key Mediterranean octocoral. For this purpose, an assemblage with restoredCorallium rubrumcolonies was monitored over 10 years and compared with a nearby reference site. Our results revealed growth of the transplanted colonies followed by a change in the functional structure (i.e., dominance and diversity of traits) of the restored assemblage. This change was related not only to the development of the coral but also to the arrival and/or increase of species with different traits. Overall, our findings provide an example of how active restoration of long-lived octocorals can be an effective tool for recovering high-diverse coralligenous assemblages at decadal timescales."

Given the limited understanding of U6 snRNA dynamics across cells and EVs, particularly in SIV infection, this research explores U6 snRNA trafficking and its association with splicing proteins in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and EVs. We observed a redistribution of U6 snRNA from the nucleus to EVs post-infection, accompanied by distinct protein profile changes and alterations in nucleic acid metabolism and spliceosome pathways. In addition, U6 machinery proteins changed in cells and EVs in a contrasting manner. The redistribution of U6 and related proteins we observed could be part of a viral strategy to redirect host splicing machinery, suggesting that U6 may have regulatory roles and be part of retroviral infection signature."

Therefore, under steady-state conditions, a given individual needs to maintain a large pool of naïve T cells, ready to respond to potential threats. Here, we demonstrate that N-myc downstream-regulated gene 3 (Ndrg3) is essential for naïve T cell stability. Mice with T cell–specific Ndrg3 loss are lymphopenic, with reduced numbers of conventional T cells and natural killer T cells. We show that in the absence of Ndrg3, naïve CD8+ T cells exhibit high rates of both proliferation and apoptosis, phenotypes that could be partially rescued by transgenic expression of a high-avidity T cell receptor. Furthermore, Ndrg3-deficient cells were refractory to interleukin-4, resulting in reduced Eomes induction, and a decreased virtual memory population. Our study therefore identifies Ndrg3 as an unexpected, pleiotropic regulator of T cell homeostasis."

To promote the expression of target genes, two ChREBP-MLX heterodimers form a heterotetramer to bind a tandem element with two adjacent E-boxes, called carbohydrate-responsive element (ChoRE). How the ChREBP-MLX hetero-tetramerization is achieved and regulated remains poorly understood. Here, we show that MLX phosphorylation on an evolutionarily conserved motif is necessary for the heterotetramer formation on the ChoRE and the transcriptional activity of the ChREBP-MLX complex. We identified casein kinase 2 (CK2) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) as MLX kinases.

We hypothesized that the lysine demethylase UTY (ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat containing Y-linked) decreases methylation uniquely in male VICs responding to nanoscale extracellular matrix cues to promote an osteoblast-like cell phenotype. Here, we describe a hydrogel biomaterial cell culture platform to interrogate how nanoscale cues modulate sex-specific methylation states in VICs activating to myofibroblasts and osteoblast-like cells.

By coupling the phonon mode to an antenna, the resulting excitation is then radiated to the far field as a single photon with a frequency matching the phonon mode. By combining macroscopic QED calculations with methods from open quantum system theory, we show that optimal parameters to generate these MIR photons occur for modest light-matter coupling strengths, which are achievable with state-of-the-art technologies. Combined, the cascaded system we propose provides a quasi-deterministic source of heralded single photons in a regime of the electromagnetic spectrum where this previously was not possible."

We used a cross-species design to uncover the developmental trajectory and neural underpinnings of brain dysconnectivity in 22q11DS. In LgDel mice, a model for 22q11DS, we found age-specific patterns of brain dysconnectivity, with widespread fMRI hyperconnectivity in juvenile mice reconfiguring to hippocampal hypoconnectivity over puberty. These changes correlated with developmental alterations in dendritic spine density, and both were transiently normalized by GSK3β inhibition, suggesting a synaptic origin for this phenomenon. Notably, analogous pubertal hyperconnectivity-to-hypoconnectivity reconfiguration occurs in human 22q11DS, affecting cortical regions enriched for GSK3β-associated synaptic genes and autism-relevant transcripts.

The sensor boasts a wide sensing range (35 to 600 kPa) and a rapid response time (∼300 ms), allowing it to record and recognize individual keystroke dynamics. Integrated with machine learning, this keyboard enables identity authentication through both fixed- and dynamic-text inputs. It accurately authenticates fixed passwords of eight characters with a 95.3% success rate and dynamic text from 14 sets of double keys with 100% accuracy. Given its capabilities, the SFIK offers promising applications in artificial intelligence, network security, and access control for computers and networks."

However, understanding their nanoscale structures and polymer component distributions remains a challenge. To address this limitation, we have developed a super-resolution fluorescence microscopy–based technique called oxygen-excluded nanoimaging. By using point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography with sulfonate-based dye molecules, we achieved nanoscale imaging of polymer blend films while specifically labeling non-oxygen domains and excluding oxygen-containing domains. This selectivity is attributed to the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged sulfonate groups in the dye molecules and the oxygen atoms in the polymer side chains. We demonstrate the applicability of oxygen-excluded nanoimaging to various polymer blend films, enabling domain identification and visualization of nanoscale structures. Our oxygen-excluded nanoimaging technique provides unique insights into the complex phase separation behavior of polymer blends at the nanoscale, opening possibilities for the nanoscale characterization of a wide range of materials beyond polymer blends."

Micro- and nanorobots have been used to eliminate biofilm infections in hard-to-reach regions inside the body. However, applying antibiofilm robots under physiological conditions is limited by the conflicting demands of accessibility and driving force. Here, we introduce a liquid-bodied antibiofilm robot constructed by a dynamically cross-linked magnetic hydrogel. Leveraging the viscoelastic response of the robot enables it to adapt to complex surface topographies such as medical meshes and stents. Upon actuation, the robot can mechanically destroy the biofilm matrix, chemically deactivate bacterial cells, and collect disrupted biofilm debris. The robot’s antibiofilm performance is studied in vitro and demonstrated on a medical mesh and a biliary stent. Tracking and navigation under endoscopy and x-ray imaging in an ex vivo porcine bile duct are demonstrated. Last, in vivo antibiofilm treatment is conducted by indwelling infected stents into mice’s abdominal cavity and clearing the biofilm infection using the proposed robot."

We demonstrate the assembly of DNA nanostructures at constant temperatures ranging from 4° to 50°C in solutions containing different counterions. The choice of counterions and the assembly temperature influence the isothermal assembly of several DNA motifs and designed three-dimensional DNA crystals. Molecular dynamics simulations show more fluctuations of the DNA structure in select monovalent ions (Na+and K+) compared to divalent ions (Mg2+and Ca2+). A key highlight is the successful assembly of DNA motifs in nickel-containing buffer at temperatures below 40°C, otherwise unachievable at higher temperatures or using an annealing protocol. DNA nanostructures isothermally assembled in different ions do not affect the viability of fibroblasts, myoblasts, and myotubes or the immune response in myoblasts. The use of ions other than the typically used magnesium holds key potential in biological and materials science applications that require minimal amounts of magnesium."

More than 80% of patients with PC present with advanced-stage disease, preventing potentially curative surgery. The neuropeptide Y (NPY) system, best known for its role in controlling energy homeostasis, has also been shown to promote tumorigenesis in a range of cancer types, but its role in PC has yet to be explored. We show that expression of NPY andNPY1Rare up-regulated in mouse PC models and human patients with PC. Moreover, using the genetically engineered, autochthonous KPR172HC mouse model of PC, we demonstrate that pancreas-specific and whole-body knockout ofNpy1rsignificantly decreases metastasis to the liver. We identify that treatment with the NPY1R antagonist BIBO3304 significantly reduces KPR172HC migratory capacity on cell-derived matrices. Pharmacological NPY1R inhibition in an intrasplenic model of PC metastasis recapitulated the results of our genetic studies, with BIBO3304 significantly decreasing liver metastasis. Together, our results reveal that NPY/NPY1R signaling is a previously unidentified antimetastatic target in PC."

Studying past comparable crises can offer insights, but there is no fossil evidence of diverse megafloral ecosystems surviving the largest Phanerozoic biodiversity crisis. Here, we investigated palynomorphs, plant, and tetrapod fossils from the Permian-Triassic South Taodonggou Section in Xinjiang, China. Our fossil records, calibrated by a high-resolution age model, reveal the presence of vibrant regional gymnospermous forests and fern fields, while marine organisms experienced mass extinction. This refugial vegetation was crucial for nourishing the substantial influx of surviving animals, thereby establishing a diverse terrestrial ecosystem approximately 75,000 years after the mass extinction. Our findings contradict the widely held belief that restoring terrestrial ecosystem functional diversity to pre-extinction levels would take millions of years. Our research indicates that moderate hydrological fluctuations throughout the crisis sustained this refugium, likely making it one of the sources for the rapid radiation of terrestrial life in the early Mesozoic."

Previously unidentified fungicides and targets are urgently needed to combatB. cinerea–associated infections as alternative therapeutic options. In this study, the promising compound Z24 demonstrated efficacy against all tested plant pathogenic fungi. Thiamine thiazole synthase (Bcthi4) was identified as a target protein of Z24 by drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS), cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays. Molecular docking and enzyme activity experiments have demonstrated that Z24 can affect the function of Bcthi4. Last, mechanistic studies show that Z24 inhibits thiamine biosynthesis by binding to Bcthi4 and induces up-regulation of alternative splicing [alternative 5′ splice site (A5SS)] of theBcthi4gene. In conclusion, by targeting Bcthi4, Z24 has the potential to be developed as a previously unidentified anti–B. cinereacandidate."

Some policy-makers have championed public disclosure to counter distrust, but others worry that it might undermine ballot secrecy. We introduce the term vote revelation to refer to the linkage of a vote on an anonymous ballot to the voter’s name in the public voter file and detail how such revelation could theoretically occur. Using the 2020 election in Maricopa County, Arizona, as a case study, we show that the release of individual ballot records would lead to no revelation of any vote choice for 99.83% of voters as compared to 99.95% under Maricopa’s current practice of reporting aggregate results by precinct and method of voting. Further, revelation is overwhelmingly concentrated among the few voters who cast provisional ballots or federal-only ballots. We discuss the potential benefits of transparency, compare remedies to reduce or eliminate privacy violations, and highlight the privacy-transparency trade-off inherent in all election reporting."

For decades, Climate or Earth System Models have been predicting how these climate change signals will unfold. While challenges remain, given the growing forced trends and the lengthening observational record, the climate science community is now in a position to confront the signals, as represented by historical trends, in models with observations. This review covers the state of the science on the ability of models to represent historical trends in the climate system. It also outlines robust procedures that should be used when comparing modeled and observed trends and how to move beyond quantification into understanding.
