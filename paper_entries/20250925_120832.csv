10.5194/acp-25-11183-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注使用激光雷达（lidar）和多轴差分吸收光谱仪（MAX-DOAS）技术，对南大堡礁地区气溶胶的垂直分布进行测量。研究通过比较不同技术来推断气溶胶的空间变化，并验证气候模型。论文讨论了气溶胶消光系数、光学深度等参数，以及这些参数的日变化规律。这些测量对于理解气溶胶与云和太阳光之间的相互作用至关重要，并为区域尺度的气溶胶建模提供数据支持，尤其是在海洋云增亮等太阳辐射管理方案的评估中。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术，特别是大气成分分析密切相关。,"['aerosol vertical profiling', 'lidar', 'MAX-DOAS', 'aerosol extinction', 'aerosol optical depth', 'atmospheric aerosols', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'remote sensing']",Robert G. Ryan;Lilani Toms-Hardman;Alexander Smirnov;Daniel P. Harrison;Robyn Schofield,Measurement report: Aerosol vertical profiling  over the Southern Great Barrier Reef using lidar  and MAX-DOAS measurements,"Measurements of aerosol vertical distribution are key for understanding how they interact with clouds and sunlight. Such measurements are currently lacking at the Great Barrier Reef, limiting our ability to validate climate models in this sensitive, ecologically rich environment. Here we use a range of techniques to quantify the vertical variation of aerosols above the Great Barrier Reef for the first time, using the comparison of techniques to also infer aerosol spatial variation. 
 Aerosol vertical profile measurements were made using a Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectrometer (MAX-DOAS) and Mini Micro Pulse Lidar (MPL) at One Tree Island in the Southern Great Barrier Reef from February to April 2023. This is an understudied location in terms of atmospheric aerosols and chemistry but is growing in importance as multiple research streams examine the influence of aerosols on radiation over the Great Barrier Reef. Solar radiation management proposals, such as marine cloud brightening, require regional-scale aerosol modelling, which is evaluated against aerosol extinction and optical depth measurements, necessitating a thorough understanding of measurements of these quantities. MPL aerosol retrieval showed extinction-to-backscatter ratios (0.031 on average) and depolarization ratios (0.015 on average) consistent with clean, unpolluted southern hemispheric marine aerosol. The maximum depolarization ratio tended to be above the layer of maximum MPL backscatter, consistent with dried sea salt layers above the boundary layer. MAX-DOAS and MPL extinction profiles show aerosol layers extending beyond 2 km altitude in the morning and to around 1 km in the afternoon. We run the MAX-DOAS retrieval at 360 and 477 nm simultaneously, using the Retrieval of Atmospheric Parameters from Spectroscopic Observations using DOAS Instruments (RAPSODI) algorithm, finding that this gives much better agreement with the vertically resolved diurnal cycle of aerosol extinction from the MPL. We also compared aerosol optical depth measurements from integrated MAX-DOAS and MPL extinction profiles, with observations from a hand-held Microtops sun photometer. Mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) values across the campaign compare well, being 0.084 ± 0.003 for the Microtops, 0.090 ± 0.040 for the MAX-DOAS and 0.091 ± 0.025 for the MPL (smoothed to match the MAX-DOAS vertical sensitivity). The diurnal cycles of the smoothed MPL and the MAX-DOAS AOD agreed within uncertainty in most hours of the day, showing a morning peak and afternoon minimum in boundary layer aerosol amount. These measurements show that even in this challenging environment with frequent occurrences of low marine clouds and high humidity, MAX-DOAS (with dual-wavelength retrieval) and MPL provide robust methods for probing aerosol vertical distributions and optical depth in the lower troposphere."
10.5194/acp-25-11129-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该论文研究了气溶胶与雾的相互作用，重点在于通过改进气溶胶活化参数化方案来提高雾的模拟精度。虽然涉及到了气溶胶，但主要关注的是雾的形成和演变过程，以及模型参数对雾特性的影响。与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）的直接关联较弱，更偏向于气象模型和雾的微物理过程研究。,"['aerosol-fog interaction', 'fog droplet number concentration', 'numerical weather prediction model', 'aerosol activation scheme', 'fog liquid water content']",Pratapaditya Ghosh;Ian Boutle;Paul Field;Adrian Hill;Anthony Jones;Marie Mazoyer;Katherine J. Evans;Salil Mahajan;Hyun-Gyu Kang;Min Xu;Wei Zhang;Noah Asch;Hamish Gordon,High sensitivity of simulated fog properties  to parameterized aerosol activation  in case studies from ParisFog,"We study aerosol–fog interactions near Paris using a weather and climate model with high spatial resolution. We show that our model can simulate the fog life cycle effectively. We find that the fog droplet number concentrations, the amount of liquid water in the fog, and the vertical structure of the fog are highly sensitive to the parameterization that simulates droplet formation and growth. The changes we propose could improve fog forecasts significantly without increasing computational costs. 
 Aerosols influence fog properties such as visibility and lifetime by affecting fog droplet number concentrations (Nd).  Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models often represent aerosol–fog interactions using highly simplified approaches. Incorporating prognostic size-resolved aerosol microphysics from climate models could allow them to simulate Nd and aerosol–fog interactions without incurring excessive computational expense. However, microphysics code designed for coarse spatial resolution may struggle with sub-kilometer-scale grid spacings. Here, we test the ability of the UK Met Office Unified Model to simulate aerosol and fog properties during case studies from the ParisFog field campaign in 2011. We examine the sensitivity of fog properties to variations in Nd caused by modifications to simulated aerosol activation.Our model, with a 500 m horizontal resolution and interactive aerosol and cloud microphysics, significantly underpredicts Nd, although it only slightly underestimates the cloud condensation nuclei concentration. With an updated version of the Abdul-Razzak and Ghan (2000) activation scheme, we produce Nd that are more consistent with those predicted by a cloud parcel model under fog-like conditions. We activate droplets only by adiabatic cooling. We incorporate more realistic hygroscopicities for sulfate and organic aerosols and explore the sensitivity of simulated Nd to unresolved updrafts. We find that both Nd and simulated fog liquid water content are very sensitive to the updated activation scheme but remain less affected by the update to hygroscopicities. Our improvements offer insights into the physical processes regulating Nd in stable conditions, potentially laying foundations for improved operational fog forecasts that incorporate interactive aerosol simulations or aerosol climatologies."
10.5194/acp-25-11157-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注欧洲雾事件的生命周期模拟，重点在于气溶胶活化过程中绝热冷却和辐射冷却的作用。论文通过改进天气和气候模型，特别是通过加入辐射冷却驱动的液滴形成和增长过程，来更准确地模拟雾中的总液态水含量。研究还探讨了如何通过改进模型物理过程和解决模型伪像来解决液滴数量高估的问题。虽然该研究涉及气溶胶，但其重点在于雾的形成和演变过程，而非大气环境遥感技术的应用，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,"['Fog', 'Aerosol activation', 'Droplet formation', 'Radiative cooling', 'Adiabatic cooling', 'Liquid water path', 'Droplet number concentration']",Pratapaditya Ghosh;Ian Boutle;Paul Field;Adrian Hill;Marie Mazoyer;Katherine J. Evans;Salil Mahajan;Hyun-Gyu Kang;Min Xu;Wei Zhang;Hamish Gordon,Adiabatic and radiative cooling are both  important causes of aerosol activation  in simulated fog events in Europe,"We study the life cycle of fog events in Europe using a weather and climate model. By incorporating droplet formation and growth driven by radiative cooling, our model better simulates the total liquid water in foggy atmospheric columns. We show that both adiabatic and radiative cooling play significant, often equally important, roles in driving droplet formation and growth. We discuss strategies to address droplet number overpredictions by improving model physics and addressing model artifacts. 
 Aerosol–fog interactions affect the visibility in, and life cycle of, fog and are difficult to represent in weather and climate models. Here we explore processes that impact the simulation of fog droplet number concentrations (Nd) at sub-kilometer scale horizontal grid resolutions in the UK Met Office Unified Model. We modify the parameterization of aerosol activation to include droplet activation by radiative cooling in addition to adiabatic cooling and determine the relative importance of the two cooling mechanisms. We further test the sensitivity of simulated Nd to: (a) interception of droplets by trees and buildings, (b) overestimation of updrafts in temperature inversions (which leads to artificially high Nd values), and (c) potential mechanisms for droplet deactivation due to downward fluctuations in supersaturation.We evaluate our model against observations from the ParisFog and LANFEX field campaigns, building on evaluation described in the companion paper. Including radiative cooling in the activation mechanism improves how accurately we represent the liquid water path and the vertical structure of the fog in our LANFEX case study. However, with radiative cooling, the Nd are overestimated for most of the ParisFog cases and for the LANFEX case. The time-averaged overestimate exceeds a factor of three (the normalized mean bias factor exceeds 2.0) in 4 out of 11 ParisFog cases. Our sensitivity studies demonstrate how these overestimates can be mitigated. Assuming the overestimate affects both radiative and adiabatic cooling, we find that although radiative cooling is more often the dominant source, both cooling sources can sometimes dominate activation."
10.5194/acp-25-11087-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了东亚气溶胶中的铁溶解度及其对北太平洋的影响，重点关注了大气化学过程如何影响气溶胶中铁的溶解度，以及溶解的铁如何影响海洋的初级生产力。虽然该研究没有直接涉及遥感技术或卫星观测，但它与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及气溶胶的成分分析和空气质量监测，这些都是遥感技术可以应用的关键领域。特别是，了解气溶胶的化学成分和溶解度对于利用遥感数据进行准确的大气成分分析至关重要，并有助于评估气溶胶对气候的影响。,"['aerosol iron solubility', 'atmospheric chemical weathering', 'dissolved iron deposition', 'East Asian aerosols', 'North Pacific Ocean', 'air quality', 'atmospheric composition']",Kohei Sakata;Shotaro Takano;Atsushi Matsuki;Yasuo Takeichi;Hiroshi Tanimoto;Aya Sakaguchi;Minako Kurisu;Yoshio Takahashi,Atmospheric chemistry in East Asia determines  the iron solubility of aerosol particles supplied  to the North Pacific Ocean,"Deposition of aerosol iron (Fe) into the ocean stimulates primary production and influences the global carbon cycle, although the factors governing the aerosol Fe solubility remain uncertain. Our observations in Japan revealed that both mineral dust and anthropogenic aerosols are significant sources of dissolved Fe, and that atmospheric chemical weathering enhances their solubility. This finding is expected to play a crucial role in estimating the supply of dissolved iron to the ocean. 
 The deposition of dissolved iron (d-Fe) from East Asian aerosols to the North Pacific Ocean modulates primary productivity in surface seawaters, facilitating uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide by the ocean, thereby affecting the global climate. Given that microorganisms in surface seawater utilize d-Fe as a micronutrient, the bioavailability of aerosol Fe depends on its fractional solubility (Fesol%). Although emission sources and atmospheric processing influence Fesol%, their effects on Fesol% are incompletely understood. We assessed the factors controlling Fesol% in size-fractionated aerosol particles collected along the coast of the Sea of Japan over one year (July 2019–June 2020). Approximately 70 % of d-Fe in East Asian aerosols was present in fine aerosol particles (< 1.3 µm), with Fesol% ranging from 4.1 % to 94.9 %. Anthro-Fe accounted for approximately 50 % of d-Fe in fine aerosol particles during pre- and post-lockdown of COVID-19, but its contribution was negligible during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Fesol% in fine aerosol particles was correlated with the abundance of water-soluble Fe species (Fe-sulfates and Fe-oxalate). These water-soluble Fe species were detected in mineral dust and anthropogenic aerosols in fine aerosol particles. Dissolution models optimized for Fe in mineral dust and anthropogenic aerosols demonstrated that Fe in both aerosols dissolved through proton-promoted dissolution under acidic conditions (pH < 2.0). Subsequently, d-Fe dissolved from aerosols was stabilized by the formation of Fe(III)-oxalate in the aqueous phase. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the chemical alteration processes of East Asian aerosols is essential for accurately quantifying their Fesol% upon transport to the North Pacific."
10.5194/acp-25-11109-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究主要关注东日本熊谷地区对流云中雨滴大小分布（DSD）与环境条件的关系，特别是具有破碎特征的雨滴分布。研究使用地面观测、C波段极化天气雷达数据和高空探测数据，旨在了解对流云的微物理过程以及环境条件如何影响这些过程，最终影响降雨量。虽然使用了雷达数据，但重点在于降水过程的微观物理机制，而非大气环境遥感技术的应用，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['drop size distribution', 'convective clouds', 'C-band polarimetric weather radar', 'precipitation processes', 'microphysical processes']",Takashi Unuma,Observed relationship between drop size distribution including a breakup signature and environmental properties near Kumagaya in eastern Japan,"The relationship between the cloud microphysical processes within convective clouds with a breakup signature and their environmental conditions is not fully understood. The conversion process of cloud droplets to raindrops is dominant near the ground, whilst the collisional coalescence of cloud droplets and raindrops dominates above the layer within convective clouds. These processes depend strongly on static stability and are more likely to be associated with humid environments. 
 The drop size distribution (DSD) is an important property for characterising precipitation processes that sometimes lead to more intense rainfall in different climate regions. Previous studies have shown that a stationary distribution with a breakup signature can be obtained not only with ground-based disdrometers but also with remote sensing instruments such as vertically pointing radars and/or wind profilers. However, these observations do not explain how the underlying microphysical processes within convective clouds that generate more rain occur and how the environmental conditions affect these processes. This study aims to investigate the environmental conditions for the development of convective clouds having a breakup signature on a ground-based observation near Kumagaya in eastern Japan. In situ observations and operational C-band polarimetric weather radar data are used to extract the convective clouds by applying a cell-tracking algorithm, and upper-air sounding data are used to diagnose their environmental conditions. The larger diameter of the DSD is likely to be associated with higher instability, whilst the larger liquid water content is likely to be associated with the higher moisture contents in the lower layer under the weaker vertical shear condition. Convective clouds that generate more rain should have a similar three-dimensional structure within them when the DSD has a breakup signature at ground level under a humid environment. These characteristics can be diagnosed as the microphysical processes of converting from cloud drops to raindrops and/or coalescing cloud drops and raindrops."

Sedlacek III,Aerosol hygroscopicity over the South-East Atlantic Ocean during the biomass burning season –  Part 2: Influence of sea salt and burning conditions on CCN hygroscopicity,"We studied aerosols over a remote island in the Atlantic Ocean to understand how they affect cloud formation. By analyzing data from two fire seasons, we found that changes in sea salt and smoke from fires strongly influenced how easily these particles form cloud droplets. In 2017, sea salt increased due to weather changes, making the particles more water-attracting. This helps us understand how natural and human activities impact clouds and climate. 
 Biomass burning (BB) significantly influences cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations over the southeastern Atlantic; however, aerosol hygroscopicity (κ) – a key factor for CCN activation – remains poorly constrained during the BB season. This study investigates κ variability using in situ measurements from Ascension Island during the 2016 and 2017 BB seasons. Results show substantial monthly variability, with κ values lowest in August and increasing through October. On average, κ was significantly higher in 2017 (∼ 0.55) than in 2016 (∼ 0.33), suggesting that the aerosols in 2017 were more hygroscopic and more easily activated as CCN. Sulfate and sea salt were the two dominant contributors to κ and the primary drivers of its interannual variability. During the 2017 BB season, sulfate – the major inorganic component – accounted for ∼ 34 % of the submicron aerosol mass, while sea salt, estimated via κ-closure analysis, contributed ∼ 17 %. The higher κ in 2017 was largely attributed to increased sea salt, likely driven by stronger marine winds. Approximately 67 % of sulfate was linked to BB emissions. Variations in BB combustion efficiency, modulated by regional meteorology, influenced sulfate fraction and thus κ values. Specifically, higher relative humidity and lower wind speeds over BB source regions in 2017 favored smoldering combustion, explaining the higher sulfate fraction. Overall, the observed interannual differences in aerosol hygroscopicity reflect the combined impacts of BB combustion characteristics and sea salt emissions, underscoring the critical roles of both BB and marine aerosol sources in regulating aerosol-cloud interactions over the southeastern Atlantic."
10.5194/acp-25-10949-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了中国气溶胶减少与澳大利亚干旱和高温之间的联系。研究表明，中国气溶胶的减少改变了南北半球之间的温度和气压梯度，导致南印度洋的流出加强，进而增强了南半球的信风。这种大气模式导致澳大利亚的水汽辐散，减少了地表湿度，使得更多的地表能量转化为感热而不是潜热，从而提高了澳大利亚近地面的温度。研究结果对于管理澳大利亚的干旱和野火风险具有重要意义。虽然论文没有直接提及具体的遥感技术或卫星观测，但其研究内容与大气成分（特别是气溶胶）的变化及其对气候的影响密切相关，因此与大气环境遥感技术有较强的关联性。,"['aerosol reduction', 'atmospheric aerosols', 'air quality', 'atmospheric circulation', 'temperature gradients', 'precipitation', 'Southern Trade Winds', 'moisture divergence', 'wildfire risk']",Jiyuan Gao;Yang Yang;Hailong Wang;Pinya Wang;Hong Liao,Dry and warm conditions in Australia exacerbated by aerosol reduction in China,"The decline in aerosols in China alters temperature and pressure gradients between the two hemispheres, which intensifies the Southern Trade Winds and causes a moisture divergence in Australia, resulting in less rainfall. Reduced surface moisture leads to more energy being converted into sensible heat instead of evaporating as latent heat, which raises near-surface temperatures in Australia. Our findings offer insights for managing drought and wildfire risks in Australia. 
 A substantial decline in anthropogenic aerosols in China has been observed since the initiation of clean air actions in 2013. This study reveals a linkage between aerosol reductions in China and drier and warmer conditions in Australia. Aerosol decline in China trigger alterations in temperature and pressure gradients between the two hemispheres, leading to intensified outflow from Asia towards the South Indian Ocean, strengthening the Southern Indian Subtropical High and its related Southern Trade Winds. Consequently, this atmospheric pattern results in a moisture divergence over Australia. The reduction in surface moisture further results in more surface energy being converted into sensible heat instead of evaporating as latent heat, warming the near-surface air. The intensified dry and warm climate conditions further cause the increase in wildfire risks during fire seasons in Australia. Our study illuminates the potential impact of distant aerosols on precipitation and temperature variations in Australia, offering valuable insights for drought and wildfire risk mitigation in Australia."

Using lab-based simulations, we examined these reactions and measured particle formation and by-products. Our findings reveal that α- and β-phellandrenes are efficient particle sources and enhance our understanding of biogenic–anthropogenic interactions and their contributions to atmospheric changes affecting climate and health. 
 Nighttime NO3-initiated oxidation of monoterpenes plays a crucial role as source of organic nitrates (ONs) and secondary organic aerosol (SOA), impacting climate, air quality, and human health. Nevertheless, monoterpene reactions with NO3 remain poorly understood. This study provides an in-depth investigation of the NO3-initiated oxidation of α- and β-phellandrenes through simulation chamber experiments and a combination of various analytical techniques (FTIR, PTR-ToF-MS, ACSM, nitrate-CI-APi-ToF-MS, Orbitrap, SMPS). SOA yields were measured, and oxidation products, including highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs), were investigated in gas and aerosol phases. Numerical simulations were also performed to investigate the dominant chemical regimes for RO2 radicals. We found that α- and β-phellandrenes are efficient SOA precursors with yields reaching up to 35 % and 60 %, respectively, with β-phellandrene generating significantly more SOA than α-phellandrene. Both monoterpenes produce large quantities of ONs in gas and aerosol phases with total molar yields of 40 %–60 %. Similar gas-phase products were detected for α- and β-phellandrenes. In particular, carbonyl nitrates, dicarbonyl nitrates, and dicarbonyls were detected as first-generation products. Autooxidation processes were also shown to occur with numerous gas-phase HOM monomers and dimers detected. Chemical mechanisms have been proposed to explain the formation of the detected products. Since gas-phase products were similar for both monoterpenes, they do not explain the differences in SOA yields. However, some differences in aerosol-phase composition were observed, which may explain why β-phellandrene is a more efficient SOA precursor. This study is the first mechanistic investigation of the reactions of α- and β-phellandrenes with the NO3 radical."

Conway;Mingjin Tang,A critical review of the use of iron isotopes in atmospheric aerosol research,"The sources of aerosol Fe, especially soluble aerosol Fe, remain to be constrained. The stable isotope ratio of Fe has emerged as a potential tracer for discriminating and quantifying sources of aerosol Fe. In this review, we examine the state of the field for using Fe isotopes as an aerosol source tracer, and constraints on endmember signatures. 
 Deposition of atmospheric aerosols is recognized as a major source of iron (Fe) to the surface oceans, where it acts as a key micronutrient for primary productivity and the metabolic functions of marine microbes. Initially, natural desert dust was thought to be the main source of aerosol Fe, albeit largely insoluble; however, in the last few decades, the role of anthropogenic and wildfire sources in providing soluble Fe to aerosols has been increasingly recognized. The stable isotope ratio of Fe (δ56Fe) has emerged as a potential tracer for discriminating and quantifying sources of aerosol Fe. In this review, we examine the state of the field for using δ56Fe as an aerosol source tracer, and constraints on endmember signatures. We begin with an overview of the methodology of δ56Fe analysis for aerosol samples. We then describe knowledge of δ56Fe endmember signatures of different source materials, and review existing knowledge of the δ56Fe signature of ambient aerosols collected from around the globe, and how these measurements can be used to enhance atmospheric Fe deposition modelling. We also examine the various chemical processing mechanisms which might influence δ56Fe source signatures of aerosol Fe during its transport in the atmosphere. This review paper is concluded with a perspective on the state of the field and a call for future work. Overall, we find aerosol δ56Fe to be a promising tracer, but highlight that greater constraints on both source endmembers and processing mechanisms are needed to fully utilize this tracer."

And light absorption of oxygenated brown carbon (BrC) increases significantly with aging, but hydrocarbon-like BrC decreases over time. These results emphasize the necessity to classify BrC into different groups based on their mass absorption efficiency and atmospheric behavior in climate models. 
 Atmospheric brown carbon (BrC) plays a significant role in global warming, yet the evolution of its optical properties during aging remains poorly understood, leading to substantial uncertainties in its climate effects. In this study, we investigate the aging process of BrC and its driving factors using laboratory-generated biomass burning emissions, including four types of straw and one type of wood. Upon OH oxidation, there exists a large increase in OA fraction after 2 d aging, followed by a minor increase during aging to 7 d. The particle growth is dominated by the change in OA content and thus shows a similar trend during aging. The mass absorption efficiency (MAE) of fresh BrC measured at 370 nm is 2.1–5.7 m2 g−1. A sharp decline in MAE is observed after 2 d aging, equally attributed to photobleaching and secondary organic aerosol formation. Although a negative correlation is observed between particle size and MAE, the reduction in MAE is mainly driven by the decline in the imaginary part (k) of BrC, with particle size playing a minor role. Combined with positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis, the study reveals that oxygenated OA, characterized by higher O / C ratios but lower MAE, increases significantly with aging. In contrast, two hydrocarbon-like OA factors with lower O / C ratios and higher MAE decrease over time. These results emphasize the importance of categorizing BrC based on its MAE and atmospheric behavior in climate models."

Laboratory-generated aerosol was extracted into water and analyzed with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, identifying over 350 new water-soluble wood-burning tracers. This study also examines the toxicities and atmospheric lifetimes, revealing that the newly identified molecules are harmful and can undergo chemical processing in atmospheric hydrometeors. 
 The molecular composition of water-soluble fine (PM3) brown carbon aerosol (BrCaq) generated by the combustion of wood was studied with ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-ToF/MS) using a non-target analysis (NTA) workflow. The NTA analysis workflow based on MS-DIAL and MS-FINDER showed the best performance of the five software tested. Structures of 361 out of the 420 water-soluble organics in BrC were tentatively identified for the first time. The total emission of fine, water-soluble BrCaq was approx. 1 g kg−1 of wood burned, comparable with the emission factors of some semi-volatile organics from open biomass burning. Potential precursors of aqueous secondary organic aerosols (aqSOAs) and toxic molecules were selected among the newly identified molecules.The newly identified harmful tracers of fine BrC included plant and wood care products, alkaloids, and fungal metabolites. Fungal metabolites were also identified among the potential precursors of aqSOAs with high Henry's law constant values, alongside natural compounds occurring in roots and leaves, diterpenoids, flavonoids, anthraquinones, and coumarins. The release of these natural and man-made compounds is possible during wildfires and domestic uses of biomass. The atmospheric lifetimes calculated for the newly identified precursors of aqSOAs showed that natural dyes, bacterial and fungal metabolites, and (aromatic) glucosides can undergo aqueous OH oxidation in cloud water. Such molecules can produce low-volatility products without decomposing due to their large carbon backbones. Many new potential chromophores were also identified in BrC, including natural dyes and molecules with conjugated double bonds and aromatic rings."

A theoretical framework is then used to identify the dynamical origin of these enhanced winds, which we find to be a combination of a strengthened global circulation and a modification of large-scale atmospheric waves. 
 Following tropical volcanic eruptions, westerly zonal-wind accelerations have been observed in the winter hemisphere polar vortex region. This wind response has been reproduced in some (but not all) simulated eruption studies. As the primary effect of volcanic aerosols during the initial post-eruption period is to heat the tropical stratosphere, the midlatitude zonal-wind response is often explained as a thermal wind effect. Several studies have shown that this explanation is insufficient in understanding the relative significance of the aerosol direct effect and indirect dynamical feedbacks. In this work, we use a Transformed Eulerian Mean (TEM) framework to identify the dynamical origins of stratospheric wind anomalies following the simulated 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. A paired set of volcanic and non-volcanic 15-member ensembles is used to isolate the volcanic impact. A TEM decomposition of the net zonal-wind forcing is then performed to close the differenced momentum budget between the two ensembles. Zonal-wind accelerations near 30–40° N and 3–30 hPa are identified with significance in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) during both the summer and winter. We find each of these seasonal acceleration episodes to have distinct dynamical drivers. In the summertime, the response is primarily governed by an accelerated meridional residual circulation. In the wintertime, the response is eddy-driven, where an equatorward deflection of planetary waves was robustly identified near 30N and 30 hPa. We additionally identified that a deficit of wave forcing in the tropical stratosphere dampens the amplitude of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) for at least 2 years following the eruption."

Our study highlights small-scale surface variability, complementing satellite observations. Surface temperature was retrieved via radiative transfer simulations, while surface type was classified using machine learning. Additionally, we analysed segment sizes of each surface type, presenting results based on their distance from the sea-ice edge. 
 Two retrieval methods for the determination of Arctic surface skin temperature and surface type based on radiance measurements from the thermal infrared (TIR) imager VELOX (Video airbornE Longwave Observations within siX channels) were developed. VELOX captured TIR radiances in terms of brightness temperatures for wavelengths from 7.7 to 12 µm in six spectral channels. The imager was deployed on the High Altitude and LOng Range research aircraft (HALO) during the HALO–(𝒜𝒞)3 aircraft field campaign conducted in the framework of the Arctic Amplification: Climate Relevant Atmospheric and SurfaCe Processes and Feedback Mechanisms (𝒜𝒞)3 research programme. The measurements were taken over the Fram Strait and the central Arctic in March and April 2022. Radiative transfer simulations assuming cloud-free atmospheric conditions were performed showing that the influence of water vapour on the measured brightness temperature can be neglected. Therefore it was possible to apply a single-channel retrieval technique to obtain the surface skin temperature from the VELOX data. The retrieval results were compared with data from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) showing an agreement within 2.0 K. Secondly, a pixel-by-pixel surface classification retrieval was developed using a random forest algorithm. It classifies surfaces into types of open water, sea-ice–water mixture, thin sea ice, and snow-covered sea ice. The resulting sea-ice concentrations were compared with satellite data, yielding a mean absolute difference (MAD) of 5 %. In addition, the classified pixels were aggregated into segments of the same surface type, providing different segment size distributions for all surface types. When grouped by the distance to the sea-ice edge, the segment size distribution showed a shift to fewer but larger floes in the direction of the pack ice."

Measurements from the eVe lidar, a combined linear/circular polarization and Raman lidar and ESA's ground reference system, that have been collected during the Joint Aeolus Tropical Atlantic Campaign are compared with collocated Aeolus Level 2A profiles obtained from the latest version (Baseline 16) of the Aeolus algorithms. 
 Aeolus was an ESA Earth Explorer satellite mission launched in 2018 with a lifetime of almost five years. The mission carried the Atmospheric Laser Doppler Instrument (ALADIN), a Doppler wind lidar for providing wind profiles on global scale and also vertically resolved optical properties of particles (aerosols and clouds) using the high spectral resolution lidar technique. To validate the particles' optical properties obtained from Aeolus as Level 2A products, the eVe lidar, ESA's reference system for the calibration and validation of Aeolus mission, has been deployed at the ASKOS campaign in the framework of the Joint Aeolus Tropical Atlantic Campaign (JATAC). ASKOS is the ground-based component of JATAC where ground-based remote sensing and in-situ instrumentation for aerosols, clouds, winds and radiation observations has been deployed at Cado Verde during summer 2021 and 2022 for the validation of the Aeolus products. The eVe lidar is a combined linear/circular polarization and Raman lidar specifically designed to mimic the operation of Aeolus and provide ground-based reference measurements of the optical properties for aerosols and thin clouds. The eVe lidar measurements can be used for the validation of the Aeolus L2A products while taking into consideration the ALADIN's limitation of misdetection of the cross-polar component of the backscattered signal. As such, in this validation study the cloud-free Aeolus L2A profiles obtained from the Standard Correct Algorithm (SCA), the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), and the AEL–PRO algorithms of Baseline 16 are compared against the corresponding cloud-free Aeolus-like profiles from eVe lidar, which are calculated using the retrieved particle circular depolarization ratio profile from eVe in order to account for the lack of the detection of the circular cross-polar backscatter component from Aeolus. The analysis focuses on the 14 collocated measurements between eVe and Aeolus during the nearest Aeolus overpass from the ASKOS site passing within a radius of 100 km from the site and within a temporal window of ± 1.5 h from the overpass time. The validation results reveal good performance for the co-polar particle backscatter coefficient, being the most accurate L2A product from Aeolus with absolute systematic and random errors up to 0.37 and 2 Mm−1 sr−1, respectively. The particle extinction coefficient also performs good with absolute systematic and random errors up to 53  and 183 Mm−1, respectively. The co-polar lidar ratio seems to be the noisiest L2A product with extreme error values and variability. The observed discrepancies between eVe and Aeolus L2A profiles increase at lower altitudes where higher atmospheric loads (molecules and aerosols) are encountered leading to increased noise levels in the Aeolus retrievals due to enhanced laser beam attenuation, and greater atmospheric variability (e.g. Planetary Boundary Layer inhomogeneities) are typically encountered. Overall, this study underlines the strengths of the optimal estimation algorithms (MLE and AEL–PRO) with consistent performance and reduced uncertainties, while the standard inversion algorithm (SCA), which was originally developed, could be further improved particularly in the retrieval of the particle extinction coefficient and lidar ratio. In addition, the SCAmid-bin resolution profiles outperform the corresponding SCAnormal-bin as expected, since mid-bin resolution is obtained when averaging the values from two consecutive SCAnormal height bins."

First, aerosol load retrieval performance is demonstrated based on realistic synthetic data. Second, the potential for aerosol type characterization is proven, with the estimation of fine mode fraction. This work opens pathways for the future study of diurnal aerosol variations from space thanks to the high temporal resolution of geostationary satellites. 
 Aerosols have significant effects on Earth, which vary according to the type of these atmospheric particles. Different observing systems exist today to monitor aerosols, mainly through the retrieval of aerosol optical depth (AOD), among which meteorological satellites in geostationary orbit provide unique information thanks to their acquisition of several Earth's images per hour. The third generation of European geostationary satellites, Meteosat Third Generation-Imager with the onboard Flexible Combined Imager (FCI) operational since December 2024, brings new possibilities for aerosol remote sensing compared to its predecessor, Meteosat Second Generation, with the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) on board. This article assesses the improvements in aerosol characterization that will be made possible thanks to FCI, based on realistically generated synthetic data that are processed by optimal estimation methods to quantify aerosol information content and to retrieve relevant aerosol properties. Two case studies corresponding to challenging aerosol retrieval situations are simulated, a dust outbreak in North Africa and the wildfire season in South West Africa. First, synthetic data are used to study the potential for AOD retrieval of new FCI spectral channels in comparison to SEVIRI's. Results prove that channel VIS04 (centered at 444 nm) is the best suited for this task, with a significant decrease in retrieval error (root square mean error by 23 % and mean bias error by 65 %) in comparison to AOD estimated from the SEVIRI-heritage channel VIS06 (centered at 640 nm). Second, the FCI capabilities to further characterize aerosol particles are investigated, with the joint retrieval of AOD and fine mode fraction (FMF), which is linked to particle size distribution and therefore aerosol type. This is achieved by exploiting near-infrared channel NIR22 (centered at 2250 nm, and found to be sensitive to coarse particles only in the first part of the study) in addition to channel VIS04. Experiments show that, except under certain unfavorable conditions, the joint retrieval of AOD and FMF is possible, even if fast but less accurate radiative transfer models are used, which could be employed in an operational setting. This article demonstrates the possibility of obtaining advanced high temporal frequency aerosol observations from FCI and opens pathways for the future study of aerosol diurnal variations from space."

Launched in August 2024, AWS features a 19-channel microwave cross-track radiometer. Notably, it introduces groundbreaking channels at 325.15 GHz. In addition, AWS acts as the stepping stone to a suggested constellation of satellites, denoted as EUMETSAT Polar System Sterna. 
 The Arctic Weather Satellite (AWS) is a project led by the European Space Agency (ESA) that has several novel aspects. From a technical perspective, it serves as a demonstrator of how to expand the network of operational satellite-based microwave sensors cost-effectively and acts as the proto-flight model for a suggested constellation of satellites, denoted as EUMETSAT Polar System (EPS) Sterna. The design philosophy has been to reduce complexity and instead focus the efforts on critical parts and characterise the instrument well before the launch. The single instrument onboard is a 19-channel microwave cross-track radiometer. There are 15 channels covering ranges around 54, 89 and 174 GHz. These are channels similar to ones found on existing sensors, however, thanks to the short development process, allowing use of more modern and recent technology, the performance and resolution of these channels on AWS exceed or match similar sensors, despite being a small satellite. Additionally, four channels around 325.15 GHz form a completely new frequency band for observations from space. The addition of these new channels aims to improve sensitivity to ice hydrometeors.In this article, we outline the mission and describe the instrument in detail, to support the usage of radiances measured by AWS. The satellite was launched in August 2024, and the status towards the end of the commissioning phase is reflected here. For example, a characterisation of the noise performance is provided, showing that the target specifications have been met, for most channels with a margin. This is except for two channels identified to have technical issues already before the launch. If EPS-Sterna is selected by EUMETSAT, these and other identified problems will be corrected, but otherwise the constellation is expected to consist of recurrent models of AWS with minor modifications."

Ott;Hartmut Bösch,Surface reflectance biases in XCH4 retrievals from the 2.3 µm band are enhanced in the presence of aerosols,"In space-based estimates of atmospheric methane concentrations, one can often observe biases that look like imprints of surface features. We performed realistic simulation experiments and find the root cause to be unaccounted aerosols. Since good knowledge of aerosols is difficult to achieve for operational science data processing, we conclude that a comprehensive surface bias correction scheme is highly important for missions utilizing the 2.3 µm spectral band for methane retrievals. 
 In this work, we present the results of an observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) in which we investigate the emergence of a surface-reflectance-dependent bias in retrieved column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of methane (XCH4). Our focus is on single-band retrievals in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) at 2.3 µm. This particular bias manifests as artificial gradients in XCH4 fields that relate to surface features on the ground and can, for example, cause erroneous estimates of methane source emission rates.We find that even for near-ideal conditions (that being a perfectly calibrated instrument, perfect knowledge of meteorology and trace gas vertical distributions, and an absence of clouds and aerosols) a surface-reflectance-related bias appears in the retrieved XCH4. While the magnitude of the bias is much lower than is observed in, for example, real data from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), the overall qualitative shape is strikingly similar. When we study a more realistic scenario by considering synthetic measurements that are affected by aerosols, the surface bias increases in magnitude roughly by a factor of 10. We hold all other properties of the synthetic measurements fixed and thus can make the following statements about these surface biases from the 2.3 µm  absorption band. First, the bias already appears in the near-perfect scenario, meaning that its origin is likely fundamental to XCH4 retrievals from this particular absorption band and using an optimal-estimation-type retrieval approach. Second, the magnitude of the bias increases significantly when aerosols are encountered. As aerosols give rise to a magnification of the bias, we have implemented a retrieval configuration in which the retrieval algorithm knows the true aerosol abundance profiles along with their optical properties. With this configuration, the surface bias returns mostly to the level first seen when synthetic measurements were not affected by aerosols.The results we present in this work should be considered for new missions where XCH4 is a target quantity and the design relies on the 2.3 µm  absorption band. Since the surface bias will likely emerge, it is crucial that a validation approach is planned which sufficiently samples the needed range of surface reflectance in areas of near-uniform methane concentrations in order to capture the bias and thus correct for it."

It covers 50 African countries and regions. it aims to support the UN's sustainable development goal 9.1. With an accuracy rate of 77%–96%, it correlates well with existing data. It can be used to guide infrastructure upgrades, assess sustainable development goal, and analyze its impacts on traffic safety, energy consumption, ecological environment, and economic development. 
 Road surface types not only influence the accessibility of road networks and socio-economic development but also serve as a critical data source for evaluating United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 9.1. Existing research indicates that Africa generally have a low road paved rate, limiting local socio-economic development. Although the International Road Federation (IRF) provides statistical data on paved road length and road paved rates for certain African countries, this data neither covers all African country nor specifies the surface type of individual roads, making it challenging to offer decision-making support for improving Africa's road infrastructure. To fill this gap, this study developed the first dataset for 50 African countries and regions, incorporating the surface type of every road. This was achieved using multi-source geospatial data and a tabular deep learning model. The core methodology involved designing 16 proxy indicators across three dimensions—derived from five open geospatial datasets (OSM road data, GDP data, population distribution data, building height data, and land cover data)—to infer road surface types across Africa. Key findings include: The accuracy of the African road surface type dataset ranges from 77 % to 96 %, with F1 scores between 0.76 and 0.96. Total road length, paved road length, and road paved rates calculated from this dataset show high correlation (correlation coefficients: 0.69–0.94) with corresponding IRF statistics. Notably, the road paved rate also exhibits strong correlation with GNI per capita and HDI (correlation coefficients: 0.80–0.83), validating the reliability of the dataset. Spatial analysis of African road paved rates at national, provincial, and county scales revealed an average paved rate of only 17.4 % across the 50 countries and regions. A distinct ""higher in the north and south, lower in the central region"" pattern emerged, the average paved rate north of the Sahara is approximately three times that of Sub-Saharan (excluding South Africa). The African road surface type dataset developed in this study not only provides data support for enhancing road infrastructure and evaluating SDG 9.1 progress in Africa but may also facilitate research on how road surface types impact road safety, energy consumption, ecological environments, and socio-economic development."

Eirund;Matthieu Leclair;Matthias Muennich;Nicolas Gruber,ROMSOC: a regional atmosphere–ocean coupled model for CPU–GPU hybrid system architectures,"To realistically simulate small-scale processes in the atmosphere and ocean, such as clouds or mixing, high-resolution numerical models are needed. However, these models are computationally very demanding. Here, we present a recently developed atmosphere–ocean model which is able to resolve most of these processes and is less expensive to run due to its computational design. Our model can be used for a wide range of applications like the investigation of marine heatwaves or future projections. 
 Recent years have seen significant efforts to refine the horizontal resolutions of global and regional climate models to the kilometer scale. This refinement aims to better resolve atmospheric and oceanic mesoscale processes, thereby improving the fidelity of simulations. However, these high-resolution simulations are computationally demanding, often necessitating trade-offs between resolution and simulated timescale. A key challenge is that many existing models are designed to run on central processing units (CPUs) alone, limiting their ability to leverage the full computational power of modern supercomputers, which feature hybrid architectures with both CPUs and graphics processing units (GPUs).In this study, we introduce the newest model version of ROMSOC, a recently developed regional coupled atmosphere–ocean model. This new model version integrates the Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS) in its original CPU-based configuration with the Consortium for Small-Scale Modeling (COSMO) model (v5.12), which can utilize GPU accelerators on heterogeneous system architectures. The combination efficiently exploits the hybrid CPU–GPU architecture of the Piz Daint supercomputer at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS), achieving a speed-up of up to 6 times compared to a CPU-only version with the same number of nodes.We evaluated the model using a configuration focused on the northeast Pacific, where ROMS covers the entire Pacific Ocean with a telescopic grid, providing full-ocean mesoscale-resolving refinement in the California Current System (CalCS; 4 km resolution). Meanwhile, COSMO covers most of the northeast Pacific at a 7 km resolution. This configuration was run in hindcast mode for the years 2010–2021, examining the roles of different modes of air–sea coupling at the mesoscale, including thermodynamical coupling (associated with heat fluxes) and mechanical coupling (associated with wind stress and surface ocean currents).Our evaluation indicates that the hindcast generally agrees well with observations and reanalyses. Notably, large-scale sea surface temperature (SST) patterns and coastal upwelling are well-represented, but SSTs show a small cold bias, resulting from wind forcing that is too strong and biases in the radiative forcing. Additionally, the coupled model exhibits a deeper and more realistic simulation of the ocean mixed-layer depth with a more pronounced seasonal cycle, driven by the enhanced wind-driven mixing. On the other hand, our ROMSOC simulations reveal a negative cloud cover bias and related biases in surface radiative fluxes off the coast of southern California, a common issue in climate models."

Since then, sea ice age has been largely overlooked, despite its value in evaluating climate model skill in capturing sea ice dynamics. Comparing modeled sea‐ice age with observations is limited by differing methods for determining age, making fair comparison difficult. Here, we apply an ice‐tracking algorithm to diagnose sea ice age from daily concentration and drift data in a climate model and compare it to satellite‐derived estimates using the same method. We show that the derived sea ice age retains the spatial pattern and long‐term trends of the reported model age, but with less than half the bias. Changes in sea‐ice age highlight shifts in sea‐ice dynamics more clearly than thickness or volume. This shows that using a common algorithm enables both a fair model validation and improves insight into sea‐ice dynamics."

Radar‐retrieved wind profiles in both hurricanes revealed a boundary‐layer jet generally >1 km AGL, descending toward smaller radii as the hurricanes moved inland. A “knee‐like” structure in most wind profiles below the jet suggests an internal boundary layer (IBL) below 200 m and a log layer above it.

The magnitude of the drought‐induced subsidence was spatially correlated with specific surface water management and land use zones, with the largest impact in rain‐fed, rice growing regions. We argue that the uncompensated surface drop in two regions, reaching up to 3.5 cm, was caused by inelastic deformation.

Based on a non‐accelerated transient global climate simulation at ∼1° resolution, we illustrate that the annual cycle of environmental conditions supporting TC genesis over the NIO bifurcates into two discrete periods during the warm‐cold transition, manifested by a shift from a unimodal to bimodal seasonal distribution. The shift is largely linked to the increased favorability for TC genesis in pre‐monsoon season (April–May–June) toward the last glacial inception (∼115 ka), which is in turn tied to the orbitally‐induced weakening of Indian monsoon‐like circulations."

A key finding is the significant influence of volcanic eruptions, particularly the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, which caused abrupt cooling followed by a gradual recovery, leading recent variation of OHUE. Moreover, the Southern Ocean is becoming less efficient at absorbing heat into interior ocean in recent period associated with increased stratification.

Conventional models, such as the Cubic Law, which is based on mechanical aperture measurements, often neglect fracture roughness, leading to model misspecifications and inaccurate conductivity estimates.

Using Bayesian inference combined with data‐driven and geometric corrections, we reconstruct local hydraulic aperture fields that reliably estimate fracture conductivities.

We demonstrate that strong cooling greatly strengthens the post‐eruption precipitation anomalies in simulations. Conversely, simulations with paleoproxy‐consistent volcanic surface cooling show post‐eruption precipitation to be unexceptional at most locations.

Governments invest in the manufacturing and deployment of clean technologies to advance economic development, energy security and emissions cuts. Geoeconomic competition has the potential to accelerate global decarbonization by facilitating greater technology deployment, speeding up technology cost declines and, thus, lowering the barriers to climate action. However, it also creates major pitfalls by facilitating the rise of trade protectionism, creating international conflict, and reproducing economic divides between richer and poorer, yet growing, countries. It is thus uncertain how the geoeconomic turn will impact global decarbonization. Meanwhile, policymakers are asking fundamental questions about how to design industrial policy, manage politics, develop institutions, and deal with the trade-offs between economic, climate and security goals. This Perspective demonstrates the recent geoeconomic turn in decarbonization, lays out its implications for policymaking, identifies global spillovers and addresses research needs. The rise of green industrial policy is transforming decarbonization efforts; the implications for policymaking and global spillovers are discussed, as well as research needs."

 Among the many types of qubit presently being investigated for a future quantum computer, silicon spin qubits with millions of qubits on a single chip are uniquely positioned to enable quantum computing. However, it has not been clear whether the outstanding high-fidelity operations and long coherence times shown by silicon spin qubits fabricated in academic settings1–8 can be reliably reproduced when the qubits are manufactured in a semiconductor foundry9–11.

 Elucidating the complex network of communication between tumour cells is central to understanding cell fate decisions and progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)1,2. We previously showed that constant suppression of BMP activity by the BMP antagonist GREM1 secreted by mesenchymal PDAC cells is essential for maintaining the fate of epithelial PDAC cells3. Here we identify SPP1 (also known as osteopontin)4 as a key regulator of mesenchymal cell fate in pancreatic cancer. Proteomic analysis of plasma from patients with PDAC showed that SPP1 is substantially upregulated in late-stage disease. Inactivation of Spp1 led to a delay in tumorigenesis in mouse PDAC models and abolished metastasis formation. Spp1 was expressed in epithelial PDAC cells, and Spp1 inactivation resulted in a conversion of mesenchymal to epithelial PDAC cells. Mechanistically, SPP1 bound the CD61 receptor on mesenchymal PDAC cells to induce Bmp2 and Grem1 expression, and GREM1 inhibition of BMP signalling was required for Spp1 expression in epithelial cells, thereby forming an intercellular regulatory loop. Concomitant inactivation of Grem1 reverted the epithelial phenotype of Spp1 knockout to fully mesenchymal PDAC. Conversely, Grem1 heterozygosity combined with Spp1 knockout resulted in wild-type PDAC histology, a result that confirmed the direct antagonistic functions of these factors. Hence, mesenchymal and epithelial PDAC cell fates are determined by the reciprocal paracrine regulation of the soluble factors GREM1 and SPP1. Mutual paracrine regulation of the cytokines GREM1 and SPP1 mediate mesenchymal and epithelial cell fate in pancreatic cancer."

 The evolution of a single-dentary-boned lower jaw and its secondary craniomandibular articulation between the dentary condyle and the squamosal glenoid has been regarded as a pivotal vertebrate innovation and defining mammalian trait1–7. Here we report two mammaliamorphs with novel shapes of secondary jaw joint, offering insight into the evolution of the mammalian jaw. The first, Polistodon8, a Middle Jurassic herbivorous tritylodontid with a relatively large body size and a lifestyle that is likely to have been fossorial, uniquely evolved a dentary–jugal articulation. The second, an Early Jurassic morganucodontan, exhibits a dentary–squamosal joint that lacks a bulbous condyle, supporting the hypothesis that the mammalian dentary condyle was formed by expansion of the lateral ridge of the dentary9. These diverse joints reflect repeated evolutionary experimentation in advanced cynodonts, in which secondary jaw joints arose independently7,10, and in which the load-bearing dentary–squamosal joint is a synapomorphy of mammaliaforms. Although body miniaturization might have driven this transformation11, our findings indicate that other factors were involved, such as jaw-muscle reorganization, feeding ecology and masticatory behaviour7,12–17. The ecomorphological diversity of these taxa suggest that phenotypic plasticity and environmentally induced morphological changes18–20 could have shaped jaw-joint evolution, emphasizing how ecological pressures and developmental flexibility guided the diversification of jaw structures in mammalian ancestors.

 Metabolic dysregulation can lead to inflammatory responses1,2. Imbalanced nucleotide synthesis triggers the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to the cytosol and an innate immune response through cGAS–STING signalling3. However, how nucleotide deficiency drives mtDNA-dependent inflammation has not been elucidated. Here we show that nucleotide imbalance leads to an increased misincorporation of ribonucleotides into mtDNA during age-dependent renal inflammation in a mouse model lacking the mitochondrial exonuclease MGME14, in various tissues of aged mice and in cells lacking the mitochondrial i-AAA protease YME1L. Similarly, reduced deoxyribonucleotide synthesis increases the ribonucleotide content of mtDNA in cell-cycle-arrested senescent cells. This leads to mtDNA release into the cytosol, cGAS–STING activation and the mtDNA-dependent senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which can be suppressed by exogenously added deoxyribonucleosides. Our results highlight the sensitivity of mtDNA to aberrant ribonucleotide incorporation and show that imbalanced nucleotide metabolism leads to age- and mtDNA-dependent inflammatory responses and SASP in senescence.

 Polymer electrolytes paired with lithium-rich manganese-based layered oxide (LRMO) cathodes and anode-free cell design are considered one of the most promising high-energy-density and high-safety systems1–4. However, the unstable anode morphological changes and the irreversible anionic reactions at the electrolyte–cathode interfaces induce oxygen escape and catalytic decomposition of polymer electrolytes, resulting in severe interfacial degradation and poor cycling stability. Here we design an in-built fluoropolyether-based polymer electrolyte composed of strongly solvating polyether and weakly solvating fluorohydrocarbon pendants, creating an anion-rich solvation structure and thus anion-derived fluorine-rich interfacial layers on the cathode and anode to resist interfacial issues. The LRMO cathode exhibits improved oxygen redox reversibility with substantially reduced oxygen-involving interfacial side reactions. This quasi-solid-state polymer electrolyte with 30 wt% trimethyl phosphate enables an LRMO cathode with a reversible high-areal-capacity cycling (>8 mAh cm−2) in pouch cells and long-term stability (>500 cycles at 25 °C) in coin cells, respectively. The pouch cells exhibit an energy density of 604 Wh kg−1 (1,027 Wh l−1) and excellent safety under a nail penetration at a fully charged condition. Our work, therefore, provides a promising direction for creating practical high-energy-density and high-safety lithium batteries.

 Worldwide, freshwater systems contain more than 18,000 fish species1–3, which are critical to the functioning of these ecosystems4 and are vital cultural and economic resources to humans5–7; despite this value, fish biodiversity is at risk globally8,9. In the USA, leading threats to fish communities in rivers and streams include climate change and invasive fish introductions and game fish stocking by humans10–14. Here we harmonized US federal biomonitoring datasets with 389 species spanning 27 years (1993–2019) and 2,992 sites to analyse trends in fish biodiversity. In cold streams (past summer stream temperatures below 15.4 °C), fish abundance and richness declined by 53.4% and 32% over 27 years, respectively, and uniqueness increased. Periodic (large-bodied, late-maturing) fishes increased, and opportunists (small-bodied, short generation time, ‘r-selected’) decreased, possibly due to proliferation of native or introduced game fishes. In warm streams (stream temperatures greater than 23.8 °C), fish abundance and richness increased by 70.5% and 15.6% over 27 years, respectively, and communities homogenized. Small opportunistic fishes replaced large periodic fishes. Intermediate streams (stream temperatures 15.4–23.8 °C), representing the average stream, had minimal changes in fish biodiversity through time. Interactions between warming and introduced fish were associated with increased rates of degradation to local fish biodiversity. Given the magnitude of these changes in a relatively short time span, there is an urgent need to curb degradation of fish biodiversity caused by fish introductions and warming water temperatures. In the past three decades, fish abundance, richness and uniqueness have diverged across cold and warm streams, and the effects on native fish communities of stream warming and increases in introduced fishes have magnified each other."

 Volcanic crises, driven by renewed magma inflow and migration, result in surface deformation and seismicity that can provide unique insights into the structure of volcanic systems and magmatic processes. Although the highly explosive volcanoes of Santorini and Kolumbo1,2 in the Greek Aegean Sea are just 7 km apart, their potentially coupled deep magmatic feeding systems are only poorly understood3,4. The 2025 volcano–tectonic crisis of Santorini simultaneously affected both volcanic centres, providing insights into a complex, multistorage feeder system. Here we integrate onshore and marine seismological data with geodetic measurements to reconstruct magma migration before and during the crisis. Gradual inflation in the Santorini caldera, beginning in mid-2024, preceded the January 2025 intrusion of a magma-filled dike sourced from a mid-crustal reservoir beneath Kolumbo, indicating a link between the two volcanoes. Joint inversion of ground and satellite-based deformation data indicates that approximately 0.31 km3 of magma intruded as an approximately 13-km-long dike, reactivating principal regional faults and arresting 3–5 km below the seafloor. The 2024–2025 resurgence of magmatic activity beneath both volcanic centres and their apparent coupling provides insights into the dynamic interplay of magma storage, transport and reservoir failure beneath neighbouring volcanoes.

 Neural activity in awake organisms shows widespread, spatiotemporally diverse correlations with behavioural and physiological measurements1–4. We propose that this covariation reflects in part the structured, nonlinear dynamics of an underlying arousal-related process that organizes brain-wide and body-wide physiology on the timescale of seconds. By framing this interpretation within dynamical systems theory, we arrive at a surprising prediction: a single, scalar measurement of arousal (for example, pupil diameter) should suffice to reconstruct the continuous evolution of multidimensional, spatiotemporal measurements of large-scale brain physiology. Here, to test this hypothesis, we perform multimodal cortex-wide optical imaging5 and behavioural monitoring in awake mice. We demonstrate that the seconds-scale spatiotemporal dynamics of neuronal calcium, metabolism and brain blood oxygen can be accurately and parsimoniously modelled from a low-dimensional, nonlinear manifold reconstructed from a time delay embedding6,7 of pupil diameter. Extending this framework to behavioural and electrophysiological measurements from the Allen Brain Observatory8, we demonstrate the ability to integrate diverse experimental data into a unified generative model via mappings from a shared arousal manifold. Our results support the hypothesis9 that spontaneous, spatially structured fluctuations in brain-wide physiology on timescales of seconds—widely interpreted to reflect regionally specific neural communication10,11—are in large part expressions of a low-dimensional, organism-wide dynamical system. In turn, reframing arousal itself as a latent dynamical system offers a new perspective on fluctuations in brain, body and behaviour observed across modalities, contexts and scales. Reframing of arousal as a latent dynamical system can reconstruct multidimensional measurements of large-scale spatiotemporal brain dynamics on the timescale of seconds in mice."

 Protein design has focused on the design of ground states, ensuring that they are sufficiently low energy to be highly populated1. Designing the kinetics and dynamics of a system requires, in addition, the design of excited states that are traversed in transitions from one low-lying state to another2,3. This is a challenging task because such states must be sufficiently strained to be poorly populated, but not so strained that they are not populated at all, and because protein design methods have focused on generating near-ideal structures4–7. Here we describe a general approach for designing systems that use an induced-fit power stroke8 to generate a structurally frustrated9 and strained excited state, allosterically driving protein complex dissociation. X-ray crystallography, double electron–electron resonance spectroscopy and kinetic binding measurements show that incorporating excited states enables the design of effector-induced increases in dissociation rates as high as 5,700-fold. We highlight the power of this approach by designing rapid biosensors, kinetically controlled circuits and cytokine mimics that can be dissociated from their receptors within seconds, enabling dissection of the temporal dynamics of interleukin-2 signalling. A fresh approach to protein design that incorporates excited intermediate states enables precise control over the lifetime of protein interactions, with potential applications in cell-signalling modulation and in biosensors and synthetic circuits."

 The concentration of proteins containing intrinsically disordered regions must be tightly controlled to maintain cellular homeostasis1,2. However, mechanisms for collective control of these proteins, which tend to localize to membraneless condensates, are less understood than pathways mediated by membrane-bound organelles3,4. Here we report ‘interstasis’, a homeostatic mechanism in which increased concentration of proteins within RNA–protein condensates induces the sequestration of their own mRNAs. The selectivity of interstatic mRNA capture relies on the structure of the genetic code and conserved codon biases, which ensure that similar multivalent RNA regions encode similar low-complexity domains. For example, arginine-enriched mixed charge domains (R-MCDs) tend to be encoded by repetitive purine-rich sequences in mRNAs. Accumulation of proteins containing R-MCDs increases the cohesion of nuclear speckles, which induces selective capture of purine-rich multivalent mRNAs. The multivalent regions are bound by specific RNA-binding proteins, including TRA2 proteins, which relocalize to speckles upon interstasis to promote selective mRNA capture. CLK-mediated phosphorylation of TRA2 proteins counters their localization to speckles, thereby modulating interstasis. Thus, the condensation properties of nuclear speckles act as a sensor for interstasis, a collective negative-feedback loop that co-regulates mRNAs of highly dosage-sensitive genes, which primarily encode nuclear condensation-prone proteins. The authors discover a homeostatic process termed interstasis, in which an increased concentration of proteins within RNA–protein condensates induces the sequestration of their own mRNAs."

 Despite decades of investigation, it remains unclear (and hard to predict1–4) how the outcomes of chemical reactions change over multidimensional ‘hyperspaces’ defined by reaction conditions5. Whereas human chemists can explore only a limited subset of these manifolds, automated platforms6–12 can generate thousands of reactions in parallel. Yet, purification and yield quantification remain bottlenecks, constrained by time-consuming and resource-intensive analytical techniques. As a result, our understanding of reaction hyperspaces remains fragmentary7,9,13–16. Are yield distributions smooth or corrugated? Do they conceal mechanistically new reactions? Can major products vary across different regions? Here, to address these questions, we developed a low-cost robotic platform using primarily optical detection to quantify yields of products and by-products at unprecedented throughput and minimal cost per condition. Scanning hyperspaces across thousands of conditions, we find and prove mathematically that, for continuous variables (concentrations, temperatures), individual yield distributions are generally slow-varying. At the same time, we uncover hyperspace regions of unexpected reactivity as well as switchovers between major products. Moreover, by systematically surveying substrate proportions, we reconstruct underlying reaction networks and expose hidden intermediates and products—even in reactions studied for well over a century. This hyperspace-scanning approach provides a versatile and scalable framework for reaction optimization and discovery. Crucially, it can help identify conditions under which complex mixtures can be driven cleanly towards different major products, thereby expanding synthetic diversity while reducing chemical input requirements. A low-cost robotic platform using mainly optical detection to quantify yields of products and by-products allows the analysis of multidimensional chemical reaction hyperspaces and networks much faster than is possible by human chemists."

 Enabling vertical-stack proximal cooperation between multirotor flying robots can facilitate the execution of complex aerial manipulation tasks.

Here we introduce an isothermal solidification strategy for the synthesis of HEAs by rapidly altering the metal alloy composition through liquid–liquid interface reactions at low temperatures, for example, from 25 °C to 80 °C. We use gallium (Ga)-based metal as the sacrificial reagent and mixing medium. By directing the reactions to the interfaces between the Ga-based liquid metal and an aqueous metal ion solution, the foreign metal ions can be reduced at the interfaces and incorporated into the liquid metal quickly. HEAs with various crystallinity (single crystal, mesocrystal, polycrystal and amorphous), morphology (zero, two and three dimensions) and compositions can be achieved through the isothermal solidification. Ga can be completely consumed, resulting in Ga-free HEAs. If desired, Ga can be one of the metal elements in the final products. In situ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies and theoretical analysis show the isothermal solidification mechanisms. Our direct observations show the enhanced mixing of liquid metal elements and the solidification process with fluctuating nucleation dynamics. The isothermal solidification marks a powerful strategy for HEA synthesis through an unexplored pathway of kinetically trapping the high-entropy states. Gallium is used as a sacrificial agent and mixing medium for the isothermal solidification synthesis of high-entropy alloy nanomaterials with diverse crystallinities and morphologies."

 Holliday junctions (HJs) are branched four-way DNA structures that link recombining chromosomes during double-strand break repair1. Despite posing a risk to chromosome segregation, HJs accumulate during meiotic prophase I as intermediates in the process of crossing-over2,3. Whether HJs have additional regulatory functions remains unclear. Here we establish an experimental system in budding yeast that enables conditional nucleolytic resolution of HJs after the establishment of meiotic chromosome synapsis. We find that HJ resolution triggers complete disassembly of the synaptonemal complex without disrupting the axis–loop organization of chromosomes. Mechanistically, HJs mediate the continued association of ZMM proteins with recombination nodules that form at the axes interface of homologous chromosome pairs. ZMM proteins, in turn, promote polymerization of the synaptonemal complex while simultaneously protecting HJs from processing by non-crossover pathways. Thus, reciprocal feedback between ZMMs, which stabilize HJs, and HJs, which retain ZMM proteins at future crossover sites, maintains chromosome synapsis until HJ-resolving enzymes are activated during exit from prophase I. Notably, by polymerizing and maintaining the synaptonemal complex structure, the HJ–ZMM interplay suppresses de novo double-strand break formation and recombination reinitiation. In doing so, this interplay suppresses the DNA damage response, enabling meiotic progression without unrepaired breaks and supporting crossover assurance. Holliday junctions maintain chromosome synapsis to enable crossover assurance in budding yeast."

 Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown remarkable success in treating blood cancers, but CAR T cell dysfunction remains a common cause of treatment failure1. Here we present CELLFIE, a CRISPR screening platform for enhancing CAR T cells across multiple clinical objectives. We performed genome-wide screens in human primary CAR T cells, with readouts capturing key aspects of T cell biology, including proliferation, target cell recognition, activation, apoptosis and fratricide, and exhaustion. Screening hits were prioritized using a new in vivo CROP-seq2 method in a xenograft model of human leukaemia, establishing several gene knockouts that boost CAR T cell efficacy. Most notably, we discovered that RHOG knockout is a potent and unexpected CAR T cell enhancer, both individually and together with FAS knockout, which was validated across multiple in vivo models, CAR designs and sample donors, and in patient-derived cells. Demonstrating the versatility of the CELLFIE platform, we also conducted combinatorial CRISPR screens to identify synergistic gene pairs and saturation base-editing screens to characterize RHOG variants. In summary, we discovered, validated and biologically characterized CRISPR-boosted CAR T cells that outperform standard CAR T cells in widely used benchmarks, establishing a foundational resource for optimizing cell-based immunotherapies.

 Neuroblastoma is a highly lethal childhood tumour derived from differentiation-arrested neural crest cells1,2. Like all cancers, its growth is fuelled by metabolites obtained from either circulation or local biosynthesis3,4. Neuroblastomas depend on local polyamine biosynthesis, and the inhibitor difluoromethylornithine has shown clinical activity5. Here we show that such inhibition can be augmented by dietary restriction of upstream amino acid substrates, leading to disruption of oncogenic protein translation, tumour differentiation and profound survival gains in the Th-MYCN mouse model. Specifically, an arginine- and proline-free diet decreases the amount of the polyamine precursor ornithine and enhances tumour polyamine depletion by difluoromethylornithine. This polyamine depletion causes ribosome stalling, unexpectedly specifically at codons with adenosine in the third position. Such codons are selectively enriched in cell cycle genes and low in neuronal differentiation genes. Thus, impaired translation of these codons, induced by combined dietary and pharmacological intervention, favours a pro-differentiation proteome. These results suggest that the genes of specific cellular programmes have evolved hallmark codon usage preferences that enable coherent translational rewiring in response to metabolic stresses, and that this process can be targeted to activate differentiation of paediatric cancers.

Here we used a genome-scale CRISPR–Cas9-based screen to identify LRP8, an apolipoprotein E and reelin receptor with high expression in the brain, as a TBEV receptor. LRP8 downregulation reduced TBEV infection in human cells, and its overexpression enhanced infection. LRP8 bound directly to the TBEV E glycoprotein and mediated viral attachment and internalization into cells. An LRP8-based soluble decoy blocked infection of human cell lines and neuronal cells and protected mice from lethal TBEV challenge.

 Barley is one of the oldest cultivated crops, with a complex evolutionary and domestication history1. Previous studies have rejected the idea of a single origin and instead support a model of mosaic genomic ancestry2,3. With increasingly comprehensive genome data, we now ask where the haplotypes — the building blocks of this mosaic — originate, and whether all domesticated barleys share the same wild progenitors or whether certain wild populations contribute more heavily to specific lineages. To address these questions, we apply a haplotype-based approach to investigate the genetic diversity and population structure of wild and domesticated barley. We analyse whole-genome sequences from 682 genebank accessions and 23 archaeological specimens, tracing the spatiotemporal origins of haplotypes and identifying wild contributors during domestication and later gene flow events. Ancient DNA supports our genome-wide findings from modern samples. Our results suggest that a founding domesticated population emerged in the Fertile Crescent during a prolonged period of pre-domestication cultivation. A key practical insight is that the high haplotype differentiation among barley populations — arising independently, or layered on top, of selection — poses challenges for mapping adaptive loci.

 Robertsonian chromosomes are a type of variant chromosome that is commonly found in nature. Present in 1 in 800 humans, these chromosomes can underlie infertility, trisomies and increased cancer incidence1–5. They have been recognized cytogenetically for more than a century6, yet their origins have remained unknown. Here we describe complete assemblies of three human Robertsonian chromosomes. We identified a common breakpoint in SST1, a macrosatellite DNA located on chromosomes 13, 14 and 21, which commonly undergo Robertsonian translocation. SST1 is contained within a larger shared homology domain7 that is inverted on chromosome 14, which enables a meiotic crossover event that fuses the long arms of two chromosomes. Robertsonian chromosomes have two centromeric DNA arrays and have lost all ribosomal DNA. In two cases, we find that only one of the two centromeric arrays is active. In the third case, both arrays can be active but owing to their proximity, they are often encompassed by a single outer kinetochore. Thus a combination of array proximity and epigenetic changes in centromeres facilitates the stable propagation of Robertsonian chromosomes. Investigation of the assembled genomes of chimpanzee and bonobo highlights that the inversion on chromosome 14 is unique to the human genome. Resolving the structural and epigenetic features of human Robertsonian chromosomes at a molecular level provides a foundation for a broader understanding of the molecular mechanisms of structural variation and chromosome evolution. Analysis of human Robertsonian chromosomes originating from 13, 14 and 21 reveal that they result from breaks at the SST1 macrosatellite DNA array and recombination between homologous sequences surrounding SST1."

 Chromosomal linkages formed through crossover recombination are essential for the accurate segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis1. The DNA events of recombination are linked to structural components of meiotic chromosomes2. Imperatively, the biased resolution of double Holliday junction (dHJ) intermediates into crossovers3,4 occurs within the synaptonemal complex (SC), the meiosis-specific structure that mediates end-to-end synapsis of homologues during the pachytene stage5,6. However, the role of the SC in crossover-specific dHJ resolution remains unclear. Here we show that key SC components function through dependent and interdependent relationships to protect dHJs from aberrant dissolution into non-crossover products. Conditional ablation experiments reveal that cohesin, the core of SC lateral elements, is required to maintain both synapsis and dHJ-associated crossover recombination complexes (CRCs) during pachytene. The SC central region transverse-filament protein is also required to maintain CRCs. Reciprocally, the stability of the SC central region requires the continuous presence of CRCs effectively coupling synapsis to dHJ formation and desynapsis to resolution. However, dHJ protection and CRC maintenance can occur without end-to-end homologue synapsis mediated by the central element of the SC central region. We conclude that local ensembles of SC components are sufficient to enable crossover-specific dHJ resolution to ensure the linkage and segregation of homologous chromosomes. Conditional ablation experiments show that key components of the synaptonemal complex protect double Holliday junction recombination intermediates to ensure their resolution into crossover products, which are required for accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis."

 Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are highly effective in haematological malignancies1. However, progressive loss of CAR T cells contributes to relapse in many patients2–4. Here we performed in vivo loss-of-function CRISPR screens in CAR T cells targeting B cell maturation antigen to investigate genes that influence CAR T cell persistence and function in a human multiple myeloma model. We tracked the expansion and persistence of CRISPR library-edited T cells in vitro and at early and late time points in vivo to track the performance of gene-modified CAR T cells from manufacturing to survival in tumours. The screens revealed context-specific regulators of CAR T cell expansion and persistence. Ablation of RASA2 and SOCS1 enhanced T cell expansion in vitro, whereas loss of PTPN2, ZC3H12A and RC3H1 conferred early growth advantages to CAR T cells in vivo. Notably, we identified cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (encoded by CDKN1B), a cell cycle regulator, as the most important factor limiting CAR T cell fitness at late time points in vivo. CDKN1B ablation increased CAR T cell proliferation and effector function, significantly enhancing tumour clearance and overall survival. Our findings reveal differing effects of gene perturbation on CAR T cells over time and in different environments, highlight CDKN1B as a promising target to generate highly effective CAR T cells for multiple myeloma and underscore the potential of in vivo screening for identifying genes to enhance CAR T cell efficacy.

 Van der Waals (vdW) materials offer unique opportunities for 3D integration1,2 of planar circuits towards higher-density transistors and energy-efficient computation3–7. Owing to the high thermal budget and special substrate requirement for the synthesis of high-quality vdW materials8–10, an advanced transfer technique is required that can simultaneously meet a broad range of industrial requirements, including high intactness, cleanliness and speed, large scale, low cost and versatility. However, previous efforts based on either etching or etching-free mechanisms typically only improve one or two of the aforementioned aspects11–13 and a comprehensive and systematic solution remains lacking.

The high material intactness and interface cleanliness enable superior device performances in 2D field-effect transistors with 100% yield, near-zero hysteresis (7 mV) and near-ideal subthreshold swing (65.9 mV dec−1).

 Fast, reliable logical operations are essential for realizing useful quantum computers1–3. By redundantly encoding logical qubits into many physical qubits and using syndrome measurements to detect and correct errors, we can achieve low logical error rates. However, for many practical quantum error correction codes such as the surface code, owing to syndrome measurement errors, standard constructions require multiple extraction rounds—of the order of the code distance d—for fault-tolerant computation, particularly considering fault-tolerant state preparation4–12. Here we show that logical operations can be performed fault-tolerantly with only a constant number of extraction rounds for a broad class of quantum error correction codes, including the surface code with magic state inputs and feedforward, to achieve ‘transversal algorithmic fault tolerance’. Through the combination of transversal operations7 and new strategies for correlated decoding13, despite only having access to partial syndrome information, we prove that the deviation from the ideal logical measurement distribution can be made exponentially small in the distance, even if the instantaneous quantum state cannot be made close to a logical codeword because of measurement errors. We supplement this proof with circuit-level simulations in a range of relevant settings, demonstrating the fault tolerance and competitive performance of our approach. Our work sheds new light on the theory of quantum fault tolerance and has the potential to reduce the space–time cost of practical fault-tolerant quantum computation by over an order of magnitude.

 The periplasm of gram-negative bacteria facilitates critical functions, including nutrient uptake, cell wall metabolism, antibiotic resistance, and virulence. Efficient quality control of proteins involved in these processes is crucial for bacterial fitness and survival. The limited size of the periplasm has hindered high-resolution mechanistic investigations of complex processes within this compartment. Using in-cell NMR spectroscopy, we dissect the mechanism of periplasmic quality control of the metallo-β-lactamase NDM-1 under conditions of zinc starvation, which destabilizes its native structure promoting its degradation. We show that the protease Prc targets membrane-bound NDM-1 at specific residues and secondary structure motifs, while DegP processes peptides generated by Prc. This approach discloses the concerted mechanism of these proteases at atomic resolution in the periplasm of live cells.

This study presents a specialized large language model for literature that outperforms six general LLMs and helps clinicians in study selection and data extraction tasks. 
 Applying artificial intelligence (AI) for systematic literature review holds great potential for enhancing evidence-based medicine, yet has been limited by insufficient training and evaluation. Here, we present LEADS, an AI foundation model trained on 633,759 samples curated from 21,335 systematic reviews, 453,625 clinical trial publications, and 27,015 clinical trial registries. In experiments, LEADS demonstrates consistent improvements over four cutting-edge large language models (LLMs) on six literature mining tasks, e.g., study search, screening, and data extraction. We conduct a user study with 16 clinicians and researchers from 14 institutions to assess the utility of LEADS integrated into the expert workflow. In study selection, experts using LEADS achieve 0.81 recall vs. 0.78 without, saving 20.8% time. For data extraction, accuracy reached 0.85 vs. 0.80, with 26.9% time savings. These findings encourage future work on leveraging high-quality domain data to build specialized LLMs that outperform generic models and enhance expert productivity in literature mining.

 Impaired musical rhythm abilities and developmental speech-language related disorders are biologically and clinically intertwined. Prior work examining their relationship has primarily used small samples; here, we studied associations at population-scale by conducting the largest systematic epidemiological investigation to date (total N = 39,358). Based on existing theoretical frameworks, we predicted that rhythm impairment would be a significant risk factor for speech-language disorders in the general adult population. Findings were consistent across multiple independent datasets and rhythm subskills (including beat synchronization and rhythm discrimination), and aggregate meta-analyzed data showed that non-linguistic rhythm impairment is a modest but consistent risk factor for developmental speech, language, and reading disorders (OR = 1.33 [1.18 – 1.49]; p < .0001). Further, cross-trait polygenic score analyses (total N = 7180) indicated shared genetic architecture between musical rhythm and reading abilities, suggesting genetic pleiotropy between musicality and language-related phenotypes.

Here, the authors design a diblock DNA probe to isolate and reveal the charge-driven contribution of the RFI to ionic current regulation. 
 Mass transport through nanochannels involves interactions across six distinct regions, including the “real first interface” (RFI), a region formed by functional elements extending into the bulk solution and their surrounding bulk solution. While previous studies have revealed the roles of the bulk solution, outer surface, and inner wall, the contribution of RFI remains unclear due to its susceptibility to interference from neighboring regions, which makes its individual role difficult to isolate. Herein, we show that a diblock DNA probe can be used to independently investigate the RFI by keeping the properties of the other five regions constant. Our results demonstrate that the RFI’s role in regulating ionic current in our system is mainly determined by charge effects. These findings highlight the distinct and previously underappreciated role of the RFI in nanochannel transport and suggest that resolving its function may provide the final piece in understanding ion transport mechanisms in confined systems.

 The activation entropy of dislocation glide, a key process controlling the strength of many metals, is often assumed to be constant or linked to enthalpy through the empirical Meyer-Neldel law-both of which are simplified approximations. In this study, we take a more direct approach by calculating the activation Gibbs energy for kink-pair nucleation on screw dislocations of two body-centered cubic metals, iron and tungsten. To ensure reliability, we develop machine learning interatomic potentials for both metals, carefully trained on dislocation data from density functional theory. Our findings reveal that dislocations undergo harmonic transitions between Peierls valleys, with an activation entropy that remains largely constant, regardless of temperature or applied stress. We use these results to parameterize a thermally-activated model of yield stress, which consistently matches experimental data in both iron and tungsten. Our work challenges recent studies using classical potentials, which report highly varying activation entropies, and suggests that simulations relying on classical potentials-widely used in materials modeling-could be significantly influenced by overestimated entropic effects.

Here the authors conduct cross-disease genome wide association studies using multi-trait analyses to uncover shared genetic mechanisms contributing to overlapping risk profiles. 
 The extensive co-occurrence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), as evidenced by epidemiological studies, is supported by positive genetic correlations identified in comprehensive genetic investigations, suggesting a shared genetic basis. However, the precise genetic mechanisms underlying these associations remain elusive. By assessing genetic correlations, genetic overlap, and causal connections, we aim to shed light on common genetic underpinnings among major CVDs. Employing multi-trait analysis, we pursue diverse strategies to unveil shared genetic elements, encompassing SNPs, genes, gene sets, and functional categories with pleiotropic implications. Our study systematically quantifies genetic overlap beyond genome-wide genetic correlations across CVDs, while identifying a putative causal relationship between coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure (HF). We then pinpointed 38 genomic loci with pleiotropic influence across CVDs, of which the most influential pleiotropic locus is located at the LPA gene. Notably, 12 loci present high evidence of multi-trait colocalization and display congruent directional effects. Examination of genes and gene sets linked to these loci unveiled robust associations with circulatory system development processes. Intriguingly, distinct patterns predominantly driven by atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and venous thromboembolism underscore the significant disparities between clinically defined CVD classifications and underlying shared biological mechanisms, according to functional annotation findings.

Here the researchers find that inappropriate development policies could have a greater effect on exposure to flooding than sea-level rise up to 2100 in China. 
 Effective coastal exposure assessments are crucial for adaptively managing threats from sea-level rise (SLR). Despite recent advances, global and regional assessments are constrained by omitting critical factors such as land-use change, failing to disaggregate potential impacts by land uses and oversimplifying land subsidence. Here we address these gaps by developing context-specific scenarios to 2100 based on a comprehensive analysis of Chinese coastal development policies. We integrate high-resolution simulations of population and land-system changes with inundation exposure assessments that incorporate SLR, land subsidence, tides and storm surges, offering a more nuanced understanding of coastal risks. Across our plausible set of downscaled scenarios of shared socioeconomic and representative concentration pathways, policy decisions have a bigger effect on what is exposed to coastal flooding until 2100 than does the magnitude of SLR. Hence, coastal policy decisions largely influence coastal risk and adaptation needs to 2100, demonstrating the necessity of appropriate policy design to manage coastal risks. Coastal risk assessment under future climate change is important for effective adaptation, but multidimensional analyses are still rare.

 An inventory of 761 confirmed pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) events observed worldwide during 2013-2023 answers many open questions on the inter-annual, seasonal, sub-daily, and regional variability of this hazardous fire weather phenomenon, along with potential controlling factors. It reveals that the 2023 fire season set new records for total pyroCb activity regionally (142 events in Canada alone) and worldwide (169 events). Smoke injection altitudes range from the mid-troposphere to the lower stratosphere (8–18 km), with 414 pyroCb events (55%) linked to smoke injection within 1 km of the tropopause or higher. Estimated aerosol mass in these plumes spans four orders of magnitude, which has significant implications for climate-scale radiative effects and ozone chemistry. The cumulative aerosol particle mass injected near the tropopause over an active fire season can rival that of recent extreme pyroCb events and significant volcanic eruptions. This pyroCb inventory is critical for advancing fire weather prediction capabilities to aid firefighting efforts and improving smoke transport forecasts. It sets a foundation for an Earth System Data Record that can be used to identify longer-term trends in pyroCb activity and consequent impacts."

 The Arctic Ocean has seen a profound sea ice loss during the summer, with changes most pronounced in the Western Arctic. This has resulted in the Chukchi Sea, located just north of Bering Strait, being ice-free by the end of summer, i.e. September, since 2000, except during 2024. Here using the ice thickness budget, we investigate the processes responsible for the return of summer sea ice to the region during 2024. We show that an exceptional ice convergence event in February 2024, along with additional events in the winter and spring, resulted in ice thicknesses along the Siberian coast of the Chukchi Sea through the summer months that exceeded values last seen in the region during the late 20th century. The reduced penetration of shortwave radiation through the anomalously thick ice contributed to a delay in melt, contributing to the presence of sea ice in the region during the summer of 2024. We also argue that a thinner and more mobile ice pack contributed to this remarkable return of summer sea ice after a 25-year hiatus, opening the possibility of similar events in the future."

 Hydrothermal fluid migration and supercritical phase transitions around the brittle–ductile transition are key to understanding volcanic activity and geothermal energy, but it remains challenging due to limited subsurface imaging. Here we conducted active-source seismic surveys at Kuju volcano, Japan, applying extended common-reflection-surface analysis to image magma-related and hydrothermal structures. We further estimated earthquake hypocenters, focal mechanisms, and seismic velocity. A continuous horizontal reflector could indicate a low-permeability seal confining supercritical fluids, while a low-amplitude reflection zone reveals fractures disrupting the seal. This permeable window, located at the magma margin, coincides with earthquake clusters of various focal mechanisms, suggesting upward fluid migration. A plume-shaped zone with low P-wave and S-wave velocity ratio (Vp/Vs) above the permeable window indicates thermally-altered formations and gas release from phase transitions. These results provide 3D visualization of the interplay among trapped supercritical fluid, its migration through permeable window, and related seismicity near the brittle-ductile transition.

 Sedimentary DNA is becoming an invaluable tool for biodiversity assessments across spatial and temporal scales. Accurate interpretation, however, requires a clear understanding of its origin and taphonomy, from transport to preservation processes within lake systems. Insights into these processes are crucial for developing efficient sampling methods for precise ecological monitoring. Our analysis of 42 adjacent surface sediment sample replicates shows that deeper, central samples, with reduced influence from aquatic taxa, exhibit greater taxonomic richness compared to near-shore samples. By comparing these results to systematic vegetation surveys, we demonstrate that central cores are optimal as they capture the main taxonomic richness in the catchment, while marginal samples near inflows are essential for detecting rarer, spatially restricted taxa. This study highlights the potential of central-core sampling to effectively capture vegetation profiles in small, bathymetrically simple lakes, while enhancing the understanding of DNA transport mechanisms in catchments with similar topographic or hydrological characteristics.

 Ancient DNA and branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers are powerful tools to reconstruct past ecosystems and climate in high-latitude lakes, but often require contrasting redox conditions for reliable interpretations. Here, we present a new approach using adjacent oxic and seasonally suboxic lakes from Iceland to 1) better understand the impacts of redox potential on these molecular proxies, and 2) reconstruct Holocene climate, human settlement, and plant history. We observe that oxic lakes provide more reliable branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers-based paleotemperature records, possibly due to the diminished presence of bacterial communities associated with reducing environments. On the other hand, oxic conditions in shallow lakes, which are often targeted for ancient DNA, can lead to poor preservation. By combining oxic and suboxic lake sediment records, we show that natural climate, and not humans, has controlled Holocene vegetation changes in northeast Iceland, and therefore provides ideal constraints for Earth system models.

 Changes in weather persistence have important implications for flood risk and regional climate resilience. In recent decades, the winter North Atlantic Oscillation index has shown a sustained shift toward more strongly positive values, exceeding the range projected by climate models under high greenhouse gas scenarios. Here we investigate whether this shift has influenced the persistence of warm and wet winter conditions in north-western Europe. We use daily temperature and precipitation records from weather stations across Europe and daily values of the North Atlantic Oscillation index from 1950–1980 and 1990–2020. Using quantile autoregressive models applied to the temperature data, we find significant increases in the persistence of warm weather. Moreover, we observe a rise in precipitation persistence. To assess the robustness of our findings, we also evaluate the influence of the Scandinavian teleconnection pattern and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation.

 Glaciers serve as sensitive indicators of climate change, influencing both regional water supplies and global sea-level rise. Contrasting to the global tendency towards retreat, glaciers in the Karakoram exhibits an unusual pattern of stability and modest thickening. However, the spatial variability and underlying causes of the mass balance anomalies remain insufficiently understood, primarily due to the limitations in previous measurement methods. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive geodetic analysis of glacier elevation changes in the central and eastern Karakoram, covering 681 glaciers of over 10,000 km2 between 2011 and 2019. The elevation was measured exclusively with TanDEM-X InSAR data to reduce penetration bias and temporal ambiguities. The geodetic analysis was conducted using a three-module DEM Differencing framework. In this framework, the first module generates high-quality InSAR DEM with an iterative approach to address the challenges of mountainous terrain for InSAR processing; the second module employed an innovative voids filling method using Gaussian Process Regression for robust elevation change mapping; and the third module incorporates a non-stationary uncertainty analysis for rigorous uncertainty quantification. The results reveal a regional mean elevation change rate of 0.0038±0.0042myr−1 and a specific mass balance of 0.0032±0.0052mw.e.yr−1, indicating slight overall thickening during the study period. The spatial patterns of elevation change display pronounced heterogeneity and clear differences between surge-type and non-surge glaciers, reflecting the complex interplay of dynamic, climatic, and morphological factors in the region. This study demonstrates the capability of high-resolution TanDME-X InSAR DEM for accurate geodetic mass balance analysis in challenging mountain environments. The proposed framework provides a scalable methodology for future large-scale glacier studies."

 Forests are a key element for reaching the EU climate neutrality targets, but natural disturbances, climate change and human activities, make it urgent to set up a continuous monitoring system of the main parameters affecting forest ecosystems. A key parameter is the annual felling: the volume of trees felled during a given reference period.We combine National Forest Inventory data, based on direct field measurements, with yearly time series data derived by remote sensing, to assess the amount of fellings carried out in Italy between 2000 and 2023. Italy was selected as a representative case study as harvest statistics are missing or partially inconsistent, which is also the case for other European countries.We highlighted that no data source, considered individually, can provide a comprehensive estimate of the harvest level and its evolution in time.Between 2000 and 2023, total fellings ranged from a peak of 16.5 million m3 in 2006 to a low of 10.4 million m3 in 2014.A near real-time assessment of the harvest level, such as estimated within our study, is increasingly important to quantify the impact of human activities on forest ecosystems. According to our results, the fellings rate, i.e. the ratio between fellings and increment, was about 0.38 within the latest years. Nevertheless, considering the uncertainty of all input data, the total fellings ranged by about ± 50 %, and the corresponding fellings rate could be significantly larger. From this arises the urgent need to set up a continuous monitoring system, integrating National Forest Inventory surveys and remote sensing data reliably, not only in Italy, but across the EU."

 Learning-based Digital Elevation Model (DEM) super-resolution (SR) remains a challenge due to the complexity of real-world terrains. Existing approaches typically treat DEMs as digital grids or triangulated irregular networks, solving numerical fitting problems to densify points through learning models. However, these methods often overlook the spatial context and structural textures inherent in the terrain. To address this limitation, we propose utilizing relative depth maps derived from open-source remote sensing images by a foundational Depth Anything Model (DAM), which provide complementary structural information about the terrain and enhance the elevation details in DEMs. A novel DEMSR dataset, DEM-OPT-Depth SR, is constructed, pairing open-source remote sensing images, DEMs, and their corresponding relative depth maps. Additionally, we present a benchmark method, the Multi-modal Fusion Super-Resolution (MFSR) network, which extracts features through multi-branch pseudo-siamese networks and performs multi-scale feature fusion. Extensive experiments on the DEM-OPT-Depth SR dataset demonstrate a 24.63% improvement in RMSE-Elevation, a 22.05% improvement in RMSE-Slope, and an 11.44% improvement in RMSE-Aspect, showing the superiority and generalization capabilities of the MFSR model over previously proposed state-of-the-art baselines in DEMSR tasks.

 To investigate the impacts of anthropogenic and natural substances transported from the Asian continent in winter on the abundance of atmospheric aerosols and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and free troposphere (FT) over the receptor region, aircraft observations of number concentrations of aerosol and CCN as well as sulfur dioxide (SO2) were carried out over the East China Sea (ECS) during the Asian Atmospheric Particulate Environmental Change Experiment 1 (APEX-E1) in December 2000. Reanalysis data of meteorology (ERA5) and aerosols (MERRA-2) were used to interpret the observation results. The results on December 23 were characterized by the highest concentrations of all parameters including CCN more than 400 cm−3 at supersaturation (SS) of 0.40 % and SO2 (>4 ppbv) in the PBL under relatively fresh polluted air, due to rapid transport of anthropogenic and natural substances through the PBL by subsidence of air and strong winds behind cold front. On December 24, anthropogenic pollutants and dust particles were transported into the FT by ascent of air associated with a low-pressure system over the Asian continent. SO2 and coarse mode aerosols were higher than those in the PBL and CCN concentration was more than 100 cm−3 (SS = 0.40 %). In addition, this kind of ascent of air to the lower FT occurs several times on average in December. Our results suggest that in addition to traditional trajectory analysis, it is necessary to incorporate the history analysis of vertical transport and wind-induced aerosol emissions along the transport pathway."

 In the Himalayan region of Nepal, the majority of households are single-cell houses (SCH) where families cook, heat, sleep, and perform daily activities in a single shared space. Firewood and other biomass fuels are commonly used for cooking and heating, especially during cold seasons. This combustion process releases harmful pollutants, such as carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), significantly degrading indoor air quality (IAQ) and posing serious health risks to residents. This study aims to assess indoor air quality and evaluate pollutant exposure and associated health risks among occupants of SCHs.Continuous real-time monitoring of IAQ parameters was conducted for 24 h over five consecutive days in each house under varying ventilation conditions. CO and PM2.5 concentrations were found to be 25.11 ± 14.24 ppm and 793.8 ± 117.36 μg/m3, respectively—exceeding international health guidelines by up to 3.6 times for CO and 32 times for PM2.5.

 Extreme precipitation events are among the most damaging hydroclimatic hazards, particularly in monsoon-dominated, topographically complex, and data-scarce regions of South Asia. Despite advances in global and regional climate modeling, accurate simulations of such extreme events remain challenging due to the nonlinear interactions between deep convection, orography, and large-scale circulation. This study evaluates the performance of the Regional Climate Model RegCM5, developed by the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), and reproduces two severe monsoon-driven precipitation events: July 2010 and August 2022. High-resolution simulations were conducted using convection-permitting (3 km) non-hydrostatic cores (MOLOCH and MM5) and are compared with coarser hydrostatic (12 km, MM4) simulations employing parameterized convection. Model outputs were validated against ERA5 and ERA5-Land reanalysis, satellite-based GPM precipitation, the Gloh2 ensemble product, and in-situ observations. Results indicate that the 3 km MOLOCH configuration significantly improves the simulation of precipitation intensity, spatial distribution, and temporal variability relative to hydrostatic runs. Notably, RegCM5-MOLOCH effectively captures the 500 hPa geopotential height patterns associated with the extreme event of the 2010 Russian blocking ridge, underscoring its utility in resolving key synoptic drivers.RegCM5-MOLOCH reproduces the large-scale moisture transport while capturing terrain-induced convergence along the Sulaiman mountain ranges of Balochistan. Diagnostics of Moisture Flux Convergence (MFC) and Integrated Vapor Transport (IVT) further reveal strong southwesterly moisture inflow from the Arabian Sea converging over Sindh and Balochistan during August 2022, consistent with the flood-affected areas. Furthermore, Spearman rank correlation analysis reveals robust linkages between simulated precipitation and sea surface temperature-related changes in La Niña and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). This highlights the combined influence of large-scale ocean-atmosphere modes on monsoon extremes. Whilst, overall, convection-permitting simulations reduce biases, some persistent wet biases remain, likely due to the unresolved uncertainties in cloud microphysics, land–atmosphere coupling, and moisture transport. These findings enhance the application of high-resolution regional modeling for enhanced flood risk assessment, improved early warning systems, and more effective climate adaptation strategies in monsoon-affected regions."

 Investigating atmospheric boundary layer height (ABLH) holds significant value for the understanding and numerical simulations of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). Based on the 20 years (2003−2022) of radiosonde data and 10 years (2013−2022) of microwave radiometer observations, this study applied two methods to determine the ABLH and comprehensively investigated the ABLH characteristics over Hong Kong, a densely populated subtropical city strongly influenced by tropical cyclones (TC). The analysis includes the interannual and seasonal variability of ABLH, as well as its relationships with atmospheric stability and wind shear exponent (WSE) under both TC and non-tropical cyclone (NTC) conditions. The results indicate higher ABLH in summer and autumn compared to spring and winter, and higher ABLH under weakly unstable boundary layer conditions. Nevertheless, the interannual variation in the ABLH is insignificant. Notably, the relationships between ABLH, atmospheric stability, and WSE exhibit distinct differences under TC and NTC conditions. It is revealed that on NTC days, the ABLH increases with the WSE under neutral or weakly stable stratification, while this increase is not significant during TC days due to turbulence saturation. The findings of this study are expected to enhance the understanding of ABL dynamics and provide scientific insights for wind energy assessment, urban pollutant dispersion modeling, and thermal comfort evaluation."

 Despite playing a crucial role in regulating Earth's radiative balance and driving the hydrological cycle, clouds remain inadequately characterised by both models and observations due to their substantial spatiotemporal variability. In tropical urban environments, cloud characteristics are further complicated by anthropogenic heat, abundance of aerosols, and local atmospheric dynamics. The present study characterises the clouds over an Urban region, Hyderabad, India, by studying the seasonal and diurnal variability of cloud base height (CBH) using long-term Ceilometer observations (July 2019–March 2025). The monsoon season had the highest cloud occurrence frequency (70.5 %), followed by postmonsoon (28.1 %), premonsoon (12.5 %), and winter (7.8 %). Single-layer clouds dominated (≈ 67.8 %) irrespective of seasons, and the multi-layer clouds were more prevalent during the monsoon. Most clouds occurred below 2 km, with noticeable bimodal distributions during the monsoon and premonsoon seasons. While the primary mode at 1–2 km is closely linked to the planetary boundary layer (PBL) height, the second prominent cloud vertical mode is associated with the 0 °C isotherm level. The diurnal variation of primary cloud mode closely follows the PBL evolution, especially during the monsoon and postmonsoon seasons. The cloud occurrence frequency also shows a strong diurnal cycle with high occurrence of clouds during the daytime in all the seasons, probably associated with daytime heating by insolation. The efficacy of reanalysis datasets in producing accurate cloud characteristics is assessed by comparing ERA5 products with long-term statistics obtained in the present study. It is noted that ERA5-derived CBH overestimates (underestimates) low (high)-level clouds."
