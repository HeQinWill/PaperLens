Conventional paradigms generally describe the relationship between MLD and stratification for the subsurface layer or the upper ocean below 5 m, where a weak stratification is associated with a deeper MLD, and a strong stratification with a shallower MLD. In this study, satellite-based and in situ-based monthly data from 2011 to 2021 reveal a positive relationship between monthly-averaged near-surface stratification (above the bulk layer) and MLD. That is, on a monthly timescale, a weaker near-surface stratification co-occurs with a shallower MLD, and vice versa. This observed pattern deviates from the conventional expectation. Analysis shows that this phase synchronization is primarily driven by density variations in the bulk layer, which exceed those in the subskin layer. Further investigation using wind stress and buoyancy flux data indicates that MLD deepening aligns with enhanced stratification above the bulk layer. These findings refine the traditional understanding by emphasizing the distinct roles of vertical layers (subskin vs bulk). They underscore the necessity to incorporate layer-specific dynamics when using satellite-derived stratification to parameterize MLD dynamics in climate models. Such refinement is critical for optimizing predictions of ocean-atmosphere interactions and climate variability. Future work should leverage the fusion of satellite and in situ data to advance multi-layer ocean stability diagnostics."

However, air pollutant concentrations reductions are not observable, and the related environmental benefits provided by the train service might be underestimated. Our research quantifies the emission reductions attributable to regional rail services by exploiting a natural experiment. We leverage an unexpected accident in Florence that temporarily disrupted part of the Tuscan railway network. We find that affected areas experienced, on average, a 25% increase in NO₂ pollution compared to counterfactual areas where train services remained operational. This increase was most pronounced during peak commuting hours. These findings are consistent with the assumption of substitutability between public and private transport: when regional trains were unavailable, more people had to switch to private vehicles to commute, causing a rise in local pollution. Our study provides an indirect measure of the positive environmental impact of public transport."

Leveraging the recently homogenized daily Rs data at ∼2600 stations across China and Europe during 1961–2022, this study provided the first quantification of long-term variations in extremely low (Rs10p) and high (Rs90p) Rs and their contributions to Rs trends. During the dimming period, increasing Rs10p and decreasing Rs90p frequencies, along with increased magnitudes, jointly led to the dimming over China and Europe. Europe began to steadily brighten after 1980, due to early air pollution emission controls and reduced cloud cover, which reversed the frequency trends of Rs10p and Rs90p and intensified the severities of both extremes. In contrast, dimming in China persisted until 2014, only transitioning to brightening after the implementation of stricter emission controls which increased Rs90p frequencies but attenuated the severities of both extremes. Overall, Rs extremes jointly regulated Rs trends: China’s brightening was positively contributed by both extremes, while Europe’s brightening was dominated by Rs90p but partially offset by Rs10p. These findings underscore the pivotal role of extremes in shaping overall Rs trends and highlight their importance for accurately assessing regional solar energy availability under global climate change."

Accurately quantifying drought impacts is challenging and critical for mitigation. Here, we use a high-resolution, bottom–up assessment framework to analyze drought impacts on yields of four major crops—maize, soybean, rice, and wheat—at county, provincial, and national levels over 1997–2021. Results show yield losses escalate dramatically with spatial granularity, from 3.3% at the national level to 10.8% at the county level, with soybeans (16.3%) and maize (11.4%) being the most vulnerable. Despite an increase in drought frequency, drought-induced crop losses declined significantly, owing to the improvements in irrigation. Notably, a 10% increase in agricultural water use was significantly associated with a 1.71% reduction in yield losses. Our findings not only highlight the critical importance of scale-dependent risk assessments but also provide robust evidence and spatial pattern for the significant role of irrigation in mitigating drought risks."

Here, we show that a colder winter tends to be followed by a hotter summer over Eurasia. This winter-summer extreme temperature reversal is linked to the phase switch of the Arctic oscillation (AO) from winter to summer, which is driven by the North Atlantic air–sea interaction and Arctic sea ice-atmosphere coupling. Specifically, a negative AO in winter weakens high-latitude westerlies, causing cold extremes over Eurasia. Negative AO also induces a tripolar sea surface temperature anomaly in the North Atlantic that persists into the following summer and triggers positive AO-like atmospheric anomalies, leading to a hotter summer across Eurasia. Moreover, winter atmospheric anomalies reduce the Barents–Kara sea ice through horizontal moisture transport. This sea ice loss persists into summer and contributes to the formation of positive AO-like atmospheric anomalies. These processes establish a cross-seasonal transition from extreme cold winters to extreme hot summers over Eurasia, offering new insight into the prediction of summer extreme events."

The sea-to-air transfer of DOC is driven by the synergy of biological and the interaction between DOC and bubble rupture. This synergistically-driven DOC flux affects aerosol properties and climate, highlighting the ocean–atmosphere link in organic carbon cycling. 
 The formation of sea spray aerosol (SSA) is linked to wave-breaking events at the sea surface and is widely recognized as an important pathway for the transfer of marine substances to the atmosphere. Although climate change and sea eutrophication have led to the expansion and intensification of coastal phytoplankton blooms, systematic studies on the sea-to-air transfer of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) via SSA during phytoplankton blooms are still lacking, which hinders the understanding of SSA's atmospheric chemistry and climate impacts. In this study, we induced a phytoplankton bloom using coastal seawater and employed various characterization tools to investigate the sea-to-air transfer of DOC. During the phytoplankton bloom, the dynamic accumulation of DOC in coastal seawater led to fluctuations in the number concentration and mean geometric diameter of SSA by approximately 60 % and 30 %, respectively; in the meantime, the enrichment factors of DOC in the sea surface microlayer, supermicron SSA, and submicron SSA can increase up to ∼5-fold, 10-fold, and 30-fold, respectively. The sea-to-air transfer of DOC depended on its selective enrichment as well as the fractionation process at the air-water interface. Interestingly, the particulate property of operationally defined DOC still needed to be considered during SSA formation. Additionally, the sea-to-air transfer of DOC was influenced by the synergistic effects of phytoplankton production and heterotrophic microbial processing, rather than being solely dependent on chlorophyll a concentration. Compared to previous studies, this work focuses on the sea-air interface, systematically and comprehensively elucidating the relationships between DOC's transfer mechanisms, biological activity, and SSA formation. This will further improve our understanding of the ocean-atmosphere carbon cycle and provide insights into its impact on global climate change."

Warmer SST reduces cloud cover; increases size, elongation; hydrometeors shift to ice. Sharper Gradients boost liquid water (cold upwind); reduces ice; disrupts organization. Also, SST changes alter cloud-top properties via entrained airmass origin. Resolving ocean-atmosphere coupling in global models is essential for accurate cloud feedback projections. 
 Understanding how Gulf Stream variation influences cloud morphology is critical for evaluating cloud feedback in the western North Atlantic Ocean and beyond, where mesoscale air-sea interactions dominate. This study investigates the impact of altered mean sea surface temperature (SST) and SST gradients on post-frontal cloud characteristics during cold-air outbreaks, using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Three sensitivity experiments are conducted: a control simulation (default SST), Plus4 (uniform SST increase of 4 K), and Gradplus (SST gradient enhanced by 25 %, centered around mean SST). Results reveal distinctly different responses in boundary layer dynamics and cloud macro-physics. In Plus4, a warmer and moister boundary layer reduces total cloud cover but promotes larger cloud sizes and elongated cloud streets, with diminished liquid water and enhanced ice-phase hydrometeors. Conversely, Gradplus amplifies impacts in the upwind colder SST regions, yielding a drier, colder boundary layer, weaker energy transport, and higher liquid water path but reduced ice water content and cloud lines. Tracer analysis highlights that SST modifications alter airmass sources near cloud tops due to the entrainment of ambient air, with Plus4 amplifying boundary layer contributions to cloud-top regions. These findings underscore the spatially varying effects of SST gradients and mean SST on cloud organization and microphysics, emphasizing the need to resolve ocean-atmosphere coupling in global models to improve the prediction of marine cloud feedback under warming scenarios."

The results highlight the importance of near-real-time aerosol inputs for improving prediction of aircraft icing environments. 
 Aerosol-cloud interactions profoundly influence the formation and evolution of supercooled liquid water, a key factor in in-flight icing. However, accurately quantifying aerosol emission inventories and their spatiotemporal distributions, as well as simulating supercooled liquid water and predicting in-flight icing, remains a major challenge, particularly in high-aerosol environments such as the Sichuan Basin in China. In this study, the Thompson–Eidhammer aerosol-aware microphysics scheme is applied to a high-aerosol icing event to quantitatively assess the sensitivity of supercooled liquid water properties to different aerosol inputs. Three aerosol configurations are examined: the scheme's default settings representing clean conditions; climatological aerosol values representing polluted conditions; and aerosol fields from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), representing near-real-time polluted conditions. The CAMS aerosol mass concentrations are converted to number concentrations using typical densities and size parameters of major East Asian aerosol species. All simulations reproduce the synoptic-scale supercooled liquid water and temperature distribution when compared with ERA5. Relative to clean conditions, polluted-environment simulations produce higher supercooled liquid water content, larger cloud droplet number concentrations, smaller median volume diameters, and longer cloud lifetimes. The experiments also reveal that stronger auto-conversion in clean conditions suppresses supercooled liquid water formation, whereas enhanced riming in polluted environments promotes supercooled liquid water depletion. In situ aircraft observations further indicate that the CAMS-driven experiment performs best in capturing the high supercooled liquid water content and large median volume diameters. These findings underscore the importance of near-real-time aerosol inputs for improving simulations of aerosol-cloud interactions and predicting aircraft-icing environments."

Ryan,Quantifying and addressing the uncertainties in tropospheric ozone and OH in a global  chemistry transport model,"This study provides a self-consistent quantitative analysis of how a wide range of physical, chemical and meteorological processes influence tropospheric ozone and oxidation as represented in global chemistry transport models. It identifies the largest sources of uncertainty in our current understanding and demonstrates the use of observations for formally constraining models and providing information on uncertainty at a process level. 
 The major physical and chemical processes governing the abundance of atmospheric oxidants such as ozone and hydroxyl radicals (OH) are largely understood, but quantitative assessment of their importance in different environments remains challenging. Atmospheric chemistry transport models allow exploration of these processes on a global scale, but weaknesses in process representation in these models introduces uncertainty, and model intercomparisons show considerable diversity even in representing current atmospheric composition. Formal constraint of models with atmospheric observations is needed to provide more critical insight into the causes of model weaknesses. In this study we perform a global sensitivity analysis on a chemistry transport model using Gaussian process emulation and identify the processes contributing most to uncertainty in tropospheric ozone and OH. We then explore the use of atmospheric measurements to calibrate the model and identify weaknesses in process representation and understanding. We find that the largest uncertainties are associated with photochemical kinetic data and with factors governing photolysis rates and surface deposition. Calibration constrains the uncertainty in key processes, improving comparisons with observations and informing model development, but we show that it is also valuable in identifying structural errors in models. We show that surface ozone measurements alone provide insufficient constraint, and we highlight the importance of applying a broad range of different observational metrics. While this study is exploratory in nature, focussing on a limited number of constraints, we clearly demonstrate the value of rigorous calibration for providing important new insight into key processes and their representation in atmospheric models."

Through laboratory experiments, it was found that sulfuric acid dominates the growth of smaller particles, while organics play an increasingly important role as particle size increases. Elevated humidity also significantly enhances the contribution of organics. These findings further our understanding of new particle formation and subsequent growth. 
 Organic compounds play an important role in atmospheric particle initial growth along with sulfuric acid (SA). However, the detailed composition of newly formed particles remains limited due to analytical challenges. In this study, we conducted flow tube experiments to investigate the nanoparticle growth processes of SA and oxygenated organic molecules (OOMs, from α-pinene oxidation) system. Utilizing a custom-built scanning flow condensation particle counter (SFCPC), we report, for the first time, size-resolved measurements of the hygroscopicity parameter (κ) and organic mass fraction (forg) for particles in the 3–10 nm size range within this atmospherically relevant system. The hygroscopicity of SA decreased 49 % as particle size increased (from 0.413±0.011 at 3 nm to 0.209±0.004 at 10 nm) and declined by up to 18 % with increasing RH, which may be explained by hydration effects. In contrast, the κ values of OOMs increased with RH by as much as 57 %, potentially involving changes in oxidation product. Size-resolved forg revealed that larger particles contained a greater proportion of organics, indicating OOMs contribute more significantly to growth at larger sizes. Moreover, elevated humidity enhanced the organic contribution to particle growth by up to 81 %. Compared to 3–5 nm, this enhancement was more pronounced for 5–10 nm particles associated with the incorporation of increased yields of more volatile oxidation products and Kelvin effect. These valuable information on hygroscopicity and chemical composition of 3–10 nm particles during new particle formation and subsequent growth could further the understanding of related atmospheric mechanisms."

Despite a high proportion of marine air masses, molecular and isotopic analyses of aerosols show strong terrestrial characteristics. Biomass burning contributes 60–80 % of carbonaceous aerosols, while marine sources account for only ~ 20 %. The findings highlight that controlling coastal emissions within ~ 260 km is crucial for mitigating marginal sea pollution. 
 Aerosols originating from marginal seas significantly contribute to regional and global air pollution burdens and climate regulation. However, the responses of marine aerosols to terrestrial transport remain uncertain. In this work, we investigated chemical composition and properties of aerosols over Bohai Sea (BS) and Yellow Sea (YS). Our observation results indicate that in the BS and YS regions in summer, the proportion of terrestrial boundary layer air masses is lower than that of marine boundary layer air masses. But the terrestrial characteristics of aerosols in these two regions are still apparent. The characteristics of carbon component ratios (mean: 5.58–12.11 for OC/EC, 0.48–0.58 for WSOC/OC) in aerosols are similar to those in coastal cities, and the proportion of non-sea salt ions (>80 %) is significantly higher than that of sea salt ions. Humic–like substances (HULIS) and water–insoluble organic compounds (WISOC) mainly contain anthropogenic components (oxygenated aromatic compounds, nitrogen-containing aromatic compounds, anthropogenic surfactants, fossil fuel-derived SOA). The δ13CTC characteristics and positive matrix factorization model (PMF) reveal that biomass burning contributes 60 %–80 % to carbonaceous species and marine primary emissions contribute 20 % to aerosols. According to the height of air mass trajectories and the half-life (15–20 h) of light-absorbing components, we determined the coastal region within 190–260 km of the coastline and the coastal waters as key regions controlling the composition of BS and YS aerosols. Our results emphasize that during summer when the influence of marine air masses increases, the terrestrial characteristics of BS and YS aerosols remain evident, being related to air mass transport from coastal terrestrial regions."

This technique more clearly reveals wave patterns than older methods and gives more accurate energy estimates, especially high up near the stratopause. Our approach helps scientists understand how these waves behave and interact across different scales, improving knowledge of atmospheric dynamics. 
 Extracting gravity wave (GW) perturbations from atmospheric observations relies on background removal techniques whose results may differ depending on the observational type and the spectral characteristics of the chosen method. This variability complicates the intercomparison of GW properties across instruments, sites, and studies. Nighttime averaging provides a simple estimate of the background but may smooth out smaller-scale structures. Spectral filtering enables targeted wavelength extraction, though it can be sensitive to noise and edge effects. Sliding polynomial fit offers flexibility but may suppress relevant signals depending on the polynomial degree. To address this issue, we implement and evaluate a processing method based on multiresolution analysis (MRA), designed to better extract and characterize the background and the multi-scale structures of GWs in lidar temperature and wind profiles. The MRA approach is then evaluated in comparison to these techniques and applied to lidar temperature and wind measurements collected on the night of 20 November 2023 at La Réunion. By decomposing the signal into dyadic vertical wavelength bands and an appropriate choice of corresponding details, the MRA can improve the detection of GW-induced perturbations in the spectral range of 0.8 to 12.8 km vertical wavelength by simultaneous background removal and denoising. We use the variance method as a benchmark for determining gravity waves potential energy (GWPE) and ask the question: “How well do the different filtering techniques compare with the variance method?” Given an overall agreement between our developped MRA and the variance method, we conclude that the MRA can also be used to determine reliable gravity wave kinetic energy (GWKE).Beyond energy estimation, MRA provides a unique capability to compute kinetic and potential energy profiles for tunable vertical wavelength bands, enabling the characterization of vertical and temporal evolution and interactions between different GW scales. These results establish MRA as a robust and complementary tool for improving GW analyses from lidar measurements, with promising applications to long-term climatologies and multi-instrument observational strategies."

Pepijn Veefkind;Parker Case;Thomas Schroeder;Pawan K. Bhartia,Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (BUV) retrievals of mid-stratospheric aerosols from the 2022 Hunga Eruption,"The submarine eruption of the Hunga volcano released water vapor and sulfur dioxide directly into the stratosphere. The sulfur dioxide formed sulfuric acid aerosols leading to increased scattering of solar ultraviolet radiation (UV), interfering with satellite ozone retrievals. We present a new satellite technique for deriving the amount and height of Hunga aerosols from UV measurements, revealing an unusually low sulfuric acid concentration due to the water-rich conditions in the fresh plume. 
 On 15 January 2022, a highly explosive eruption of the submarine Hunga volcano (Kingdom of Tonga) generated the largest stratospheric hydration event ever observed and the largest aerosol perturbation since the 1991 Pinatubo eruption. Here, we develop a novel method for satellite retrieval of stratospheric aerosol optical depth (AOD) and layer peak height (zp) using solar backscattered ultraviolet (BUV) radiation; this is made possible by the exceptional mid-stratospheric altitude of the Hunga aerosols. We analyze BUV observations of the Hunga stratospheric aerosol cloud on 17 January 2022 (47 h after the eruption), using BUV band 1 measurements from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board the ESA/Copernicus Sentinel-5 precursor (S5P) satellite, and the Ozone Mapping and Profiling Suite- Nadir Profiler (OMPS-NP) on board the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-20 satellite. We retrieve AOD and zp by fitting hyperspectral BUV radiance ratios in a narrow spectral window restricted to 289–296 nm, chosen in order to reduce interference from tropospheric clouds while highly sensitive to stratospheric aerosols located above ozone peak altitude. The retrieval employs radiative transfer calculations from the Vector Linearized Discrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer (VLIDORT) forward model. We assume a single Hunga aerosol layer composed of polydisperse sulfuric acid spherical particles embedded in a Rayleigh atmosphere with a known ozone profile. The ozone profile is supplied from a version of the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) Stratospheric Composition Reanalysis of the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on board NASA Earth Observing System-chemistry (EOS Aura) satellite – produced by NASA's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office using a stratospheric chemistry model and MERRA-2 meteorology. We also include a sulfur dioxide SO2 layer, which coincides spatially with the retrieved aerosol vertical profile, and with the total loading normalized to the stratospheric SO2 vertical column density from the operational TROPOMI SO2 product. We validate our AOD retrievals against ground-based AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) direct-sun AOD measurements, and zp retrievals against Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) overpasses using Lagrangian trajectory modeling. We estimate the total Hunga stratospheric wet aerosol mass (sulfuric acid solution droplets, including water uptake) to be Maer∼0.5±0.05 Tg. This value is consistent with our previous BUV estimates of Hunga SO2 emissions (∼ 0.4–0.5 Tg SO2) and rapid conversion of SO2 to sulfate aerosol. Based on these BUV retrievals we can also estimate the sulfuric acid (H2SO4) mass fraction w∼0.4 and H2SO4/H2O solution density: ρ∼1.34 g cm−3. These new values represent an extreme departure from the stratospheric background sulfate aerosol (Junge layer), which is typified by values of w∼0.75 and ρ∼1.7 g cm−3 supported by decades of observations of the lower stratosphere during both quiescent and volcanically impacted periods. The new low values, inferred from BUV observations and backed up by microphysical modeling, are a result of the uniquely water-rich conditions in the early Hunga plume. Relative humidity in the plume, as modeled by the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System Chemistry-Climate Model with the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA), reached values as high as 60 %, compared to background values closer to 1 %. These findings are unique in the long-term observational record of the stratosphere; similar relative humidities only otherwise occur in overshooting clouds or cold winter hemisphere vortices."

These clouds trap heat and contribute to warming the planet. The laser-based system precisely measures water molecules in air, enabling accurate predictions of contrail formation to help reduce aviation's climate impact. 
 We present a state-of-the-art humidity probe for in situ airborne water vapor measurements tailored to the humidity range relevant for the formation of persistent aviation contrail cirrus clouds. Our probe is based on tunable infrared laser direct absorption spectroscopy (TILDAS). We scan a laser in wavelength across an isolated water (H2O) absorption line at 7205.246 cm−1 (1.39 µm) to obtain the H2O volume mixing ratio in sample air at 1 Hz in real time. Our optical design features a combination of single-mode optical fibers and a short-path absorption cell with integrated focusing optics and detector to avoid any absorption path outside of the sample volume. A parallel fiber path and detector capture the laser power profile during the wavelength scan for spectral-baseline normalization. We have built and tested two prototypes and tested them side-by-side in the laboratory against a humidity standard as well as against each other. Without any calibration, we found agreement against the humidity standard of better than 98 % for the relevant H2O range below 200 ppm. The agreement between both instruments when operated in series measuring the same sample air was 99.7 %. The stability of both instruments was quantified to be ±1 % (1σ) during a 5 d long period where both prototypes operated without any temperature control. We show that our probes can measure H2O with linear response over 4 orders of magnitude."

In response to this challenge, our new 2003–2023 dataset integrates top-down and bottom-up methods with multi-source data. This provides a plausible emissions range to quantify uncertainty, revealing that the greatest uncertainty is not in traditional hotspots but in regions with infrequent, extreme fires. This work offers vital data for more robust climate models. 
 Large discrepancies among existing inventories hinder a consensus on the true magnitude and long-term trends of global biomass burning emissions. To address this, we developed the Multi-ensemble Biomass-burning Emissions Inventory (MBEI), a framework integrating bottom-up and top-down approaches with multi-source data to generate eight sub-inventories for the period 2003–2023. This ensemble approach allows for the explicit quantification of emission uncertainty at a 0.1° grid scale. We estimate global annual CO2 emissions at 7304 (4400–9657) Tg, with the maximum estimate exceeding the minimum by over two-fold. The uncertainty exhibits significant spatial heterogeneity: it is highest in low-emission regions like Australia and the Middle East (6.0–7.0 fold difference), whereas traditional hotspots like Africa show lower divergence (Approximately 2 fold). Temporally, a distinct decadal shift was identified: global emissions declined from 2003 to 2013 due to reduced tropical burning, but reversed to an increasing trend from 2013 to 2023, driven by intensified fires in northern high-latitudes and extreme events. Comparisons confirm that the MBEI mean provides a robust central estimate, while its max-min range effectively encompasses other major inventories. By providing explicit uncertainty bounds, MBEI enhances the reliability of atmospheric modeling and climate assessments. The dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18104830 (Liu and Yin, 2025)."

Our product depicts earlier and later planting dates for certain crops, increased use of cover crops, increased synthetic fertilizer and manure Nitrogen application, and shifts towards reduced tillage intensities over time. The data set can inform agricultural studies regarding greenhouse gas emissions, environmental impacts, and food production. 
 Agricultural land management practices affect environmental variables including greenhouse gas emissions, carbon and nitrogen cycles, soil profiles, water quality, and air pollution. To better understand agricultural land management practices, we compiled a land management history for the conterminous United States (CONUS) from 1980–2023. We used the National Resources Inventory as the basis for our sample-based approach to impute planting and harvest dates, synthetic N fertilizer and manure N and C application rates and timing, tillage systems and intensity, and cover crop adoption. We aggregated the imputations to a 0.25-degree grid and compiled a comprehensive dataset detailing the management practices used on agricultural lands across CONUS. From 1980–2023, we found trends towards later planting dates for cotton and spring grains and trends towards earlier planting dates for soybeans. Synthetic N fertilizer rates increased steadily from 1980–2000 and then stabilized from 2000–2023, while manure N amendments were low between 1980 and 2000 and then increased rapidly from 2000–2023. Generally, there were increases in no-till and reduced-till systems across CONUS, with more notable increases in central and eastern regions. Cover crop adoption increased across CONUS from 1980–2023, with the highest level of adoption occurring in the Northeast. The results from this product align with previously published histories, although our work provides a more comprehensive representation of cropland management practices than previous works. Our dataset is available on Dryad under public domain license (Hoskovec et al., 2025) and can be used to inform studies of agricultural lands that evaluate processes such as greenhouse gas emissions, environmental impacts, and food production."

The new net phosphorus gain/loss maps allow us to assess sources, drivers, and model fidelity, thereby supporting future research and management of phosphorus contamination. 
 Excess riverine phosphorus represents a preeminent catalyst for water quality degradation. Spatial mapping and characterization of the net gain and loss of riverine phosphorus help discern the critical source areas. Here, we developed a dataset encompassing phosphate (PO43-) and total phosphorus (TP) gain and loss across catchments in the conterminous United States (CONUS). We compiled 51,394 PO43- and 285,675 TP concentration data points and estimated PO43- and TP loads at 963 and 2,317 stations, respectively. Next, we leveraged the upstream-downstream topology information from the National Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHDPlus) catchment map at the Hydrologic Unit Catalogue-12 (HUC12) level to derive the net gain and loss of riverine phosphorus across catchments in the CONUS. Such maps can be used to estimate potential contributions of point and non-point sources to riverine phosphorus pollution at refined spatial scales, identify different major factors controlling local riverine P gain and loss compared to P loads, and evaluate watershed model’s fidelity for representing riverine P cycling.

However, ground observations in China are often incomplete and short. We created the first seamless half-hourly dataset covering China from 2000 to 2024 by carefully filling data gaps and extending observations in time. The dataset closely matches measurements and provides a reliable foundation for climate, water, and environmental research. 
 Latent heat flux (LE) provides a direct representation of terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) and plays a critical role in hydrological cycle studies, land surface model development, and the evaluation of remotely sensed evapotranspiration products. Although flux observations based on the eddy covariance technique are widely regarded as essential benchmark data for evapotranspiration estimation, existing ChinaFlux observations are generally limited by short observation periods and extensive data gaps, which substantially constrain their applicability in long-term change analyses and multi-scale studies. To address these limitations, we developed a gap-filling and temporal prolongation framework specifically designed for half-hourly LE and established a continuous ground-based benchmark dataset covering China for the period 2000–2024 based on observations from 50 ChinaFlux sites. The framework is built upon an automated machine learning approach (AutoML-H2O) and integrates ERA5-Land reanalysis data with MODIS vegetation indices, enabling accurate gap-filling within observation periods and reliable prolongation beyond observation intervals. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that the AutoML framework achieves high accuracy at the half-hourly scale across different gap-length scenarios, with an overall correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.862 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 33.75 W m-2, and it substantially outperforms conventional methods under long-gap conditions of 7 d and 30 d. The forward and backward prolongation results show high consistency (CC values of 0.902 and 0.896, respectively) and exhibit robust temporal stability under varying training data lengths. Multi-timescale validations further indicate that the prolonged LE data reasonably reproduce diurnal variations, seasonal cycles, and interannual variability from half-hourly to daily and monthly scales. Comparisons with ChinaFlux observations under strict quality control reveal good consistency across different temporal scales, underlying surface types, and climate zones. SHAP-based interpretability analysis indicates that energy supply consistently dominates LE variability, while vegetation state and water availability modulate their relative importance under different environmental conditions. Overall, we present the first continuous half-hourly ground-based LE benchmark dataset covering China for the period 2000–2024. This dataset provides essential data support for the evaluation of remotely sensed ET products, land surface model validation, and studies of regional water–energy cycles and climate change, and it is freely available via the following repository: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18194590 (Qian et al., 2026)."

Our results show that the step heating approach is fast and accurate, comparable to other more complex methods. This method can potentially be applied in different areas of interest where wall surface temperatures are important, e.g. modeling of outdoor thermal comfort, building energy and urban energy balance. 
 The urban climate is highly influenced by its building geometry, material characteristics, street orientation and high fraction of impermeable surfaces. All of these influence the microclimate and the resulting outdoor thermal comfort. Mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) is often used as an estimator for heat exposure as it is one of the most important variables governing outdoor human thermal comfort on clear, calm and warm days. The highest values of Tmrt are commonly found in front of sunlit facades where a human is exposed to high levels of direct and reflected shortwave radiation from the sun, as well as high levels of longwave radiation emitted from surrounding sunlit walls. As a consequence, outdoor thermal comfort modelling requires accurate simulation of wall surface temperatures (Ts).The aim of this study is to present a step heating approach for calculating wall Ts in the SOlar and LongWave Environmental Irradiance Geometry model (SOLWEIG) and quantify how it influences Tmrt. This method requires information on material characteristics, i.e. specific heat capacity, density, thermal conductivity, albedo and thickness of the outer layer of the wall, as well as radiation balance at the wall surface, and ambient air temperature. Simulated Ts is compared to observed Ts of two white walls (albedo = 0.5) in Gothenburg, Sweden; one wooden wall and one plaster brick wall. The simulations show high agreement with the 15 394 observations, with R2=0.93 and RMSE = 2.09 °C for the wooden wall and R2=0.94 and RMSE = 1.94 °C for the plaster brick wall. For the walls presented here, this new parameterization scheme results in differences in Tmrt of up to 2.5 °C compared to the previous version of SOLWEIG.With this new approach, SOLWEIG can be used to evaluate the effect of building materials on outdoor thermal comfort. The speed and accuracy of this approach suggests that it also could be applied in other areas where Ts of walls are important, for example building energy models and urban energy balance models."

Evans;Andréa S. Taschetto;Chiara Holgate,Refining the Lagrangian approach for moisture source identification through sensitivity testing of assumptions using BTrIMS1.1,"Lagrangian approaches have been increasingly employed due to their suitability for extreme events and climatological studies in finding moisture sources of precipitation. However, as these approaches track independent air parcels carrying moisture – rather than simulate processes based on governing physical equations – they rely on several underlying assumptions. This study tests these assumptions and refines the approaches to enhance their broader applicability. 
 Moisture is the fundamental basis for precipitation, and understanding the sources of moisture is crucial for comprehending changes in precipitation patterns. Lagrangian models have been employed for moisture tracking in both extreme weather events and climatological studies as a means to gain insight into driving physical processes. Lagrangian moisture tracking models follow independent air parcels based on a set of defined assumptions. Despite the existence of many Lagrangian models and studies applying them for moisture tracking, these assumptions are seldom thoroughly tested.In this study, we use the Lagrangian model BTrIMS to demonstrate the impact of these assumptions on the results of moisture source identification. In particular, we test the method's dependence on the number of parcels released; the height that parcels are released; the vertical movement of air parcels; the vertical well-mixed assumption that lead to different moisture identification methods along trajectories, the within-grid interpolation method and the back-trajectory time step. We find that releasing approximately 200 air parcels per day from each grid point, is necessary to obtain accurate results for a region of 10 grid points or more (an area of ∼ 9000 km2 in this case). The distribution among different time steps in a day is determined based on precipitation rates. Additionally, the vertical movement of air parcels, their release height, and along-trajectory identification method of moisture substantially affect the identified moisture sources, whereas within-grid interpolation and back-trajectory time step within a reasonable range have a relatively minor role on the results. The theoretical basis of these assumptions involve precipitation formation height, vertical mixing of surface evapotranspiration, and numerical noise, all of which must be carefully considered for realistic results.Based on the results of sensitivity tests and analysis of underlying mechanisms behind the assumptions, we improve the Lagrangian model BTrIMS1.0 to a new version (BTrIMS1.1) for broader applicability. The findings of this study provide critical information for improving Lagrangian moisture source identification methods in general and will benefit future research in this field, including studies examining changes in moisture sources due to climate change."

It is designed to flexibly include new glacier data as it becomes available. We tested the method with idealized experiments and found promising results in terms of accuracy and efficiency, showing strong potential for real-world applications. 
 The growing availability of glacier observations poses a challenge for models to integrate this heterogeneous information in a dynamically consistent way. At the same time, estimates of current glacier volume and area remain uncertain, as many global inventories and thickness datasets date back to the early 2000s. We present the Open Global Glacier Data Assimilation Framework, named AGILE, a time-dependent variational method inspired by 4D-Var data assimilation. AGILE is built on a reimplementation of the OGGM flowline glacier evolution model in PyTorch, enabling full differentiability through automatic differentiation (AD). We test AGILE v0.1 in a series of idealized experiments designed to reflect common initialization and calibration scenarios in global glacier modeling. The goal is to recover glacier bed topography and distributed ice volume in 2020 through transient calibration, based on dynamical simulations starting in 1980. In these experiments, we assume a perfectly known mass balance and fixed ice dynamics parameters. While this setup simplifies real-world complexity, it allows us to isolate and evaluate the core functionality of the approach. Our results show that AGILE efficiently optimizes multiple control variables by leveraging AD-derived gradients, requiring only a few iterations to substantially improve upon initial guesses. We also examine the potential to reconstruct earlier glacier states (e.g., in 1980) without direct observations and find that this is fundamentally limited because glacier dynamics are governed by a diffusion equation, which leads to a loss of information about past states over time, even in an idealized setting. Overall, our experiments demonstrate AGILE’s potential as a flexible and efficient data assimilation framework. Its ability to integrate diverse datasets in a dynamically consistent manner makes it a promising tool for future real-world glacier modeling applications."

The model reveals strong regional differences and large annual swings in economic impacts, offers insights for climate policy discussions, and provides a strong foundation for future model development. 
 Global warming poses substantial risks to natural and human systems worldwide. Understanding the complex interactions between climate change and the economy is essential for designing effective policies and mitigation strategies. Yet, existing modeling tools are often limited by coarse spatial aggregation, simplified climate representation, or lack of interaction between climate and the economy. To address these gaps, we develop a novel framework that couples an Earth System Model (ESM) – the Norwegian Earth System Model version 2 (NorESM2) – with a spatially disaggregated Integrated Assessment Model (IAM), the Disaggregated Integrated Assessment Model (DIAM). The resulting modeling tool, NorESM2–DIAM, incorporates state-of-the-art climate and weather dynamics, allows economic impacts to depend on the full distribution of weather outcomes, and captures realistic spatial heterogeneity. To our knowledge, it is the first framework to fully couple an ESM with a high-resolution cost-benefit IAM. The primary contribution of this paper is to develop and implement the methodology that enables this coupling. We demonstrate the utility of NorESM2–DIAM through a baseline simulation. The results show that the economic impacts of global warming vary dramatically across space and that internal climate variability generates substantial volatility in regional GDP, highlighting the importance of high-resolution economic impact assessments. Although the baseline simulation focuses on regional temperature, the framework can be easily extended to incorporate additional variables such as precipitation and extreme events. It can also be applied to study a wide range of climate policies. NorESM2–DIAM represents an important step towards improving the understanding of economic impacts of climate change and can ultimately become an important source of information for decision-makers."

Dirmeyer;Sunlae Tak,Implementation of a multi-layer snow scheme in the GloSea6 seasonal forecast system: impacts on land–atmosphere interactions and climatological biases,"This study examines a multi-layer snow scheme in seasonal forecasts. Compared to a single-layer scheme, it better captures snow insulation, delaying spring snowmelt by 1–2 weeks. This postpones evaporation and slows soil moisture depletion, which promotes evaporative cooling due to increasing energy partitioning into latent heat flux and enhances precipitation occurrence. This leads to realistic land-atmosphere interactions and reduced biases across Northern Hemisphere mid- and high-latitudes. 
 This study explores the influence of implementing a multi-layer snow scheme on the climatological bias within a seasonal forecast system. Traditional single layer snow schemes in land surface models, particularly those utilising a composite snow-soil layer, often inadequately represent the insulating effect of snowpack, resulting in cold and warm biases during winter and snowmelt seasons, respectively. By contrast, multi-layer snow schemes improve the simulation of energy exchange between the land surface and atmosphere by realistically capturing snowpack thermal processes. To examine this impact, two sets of LSM offline experiments are conducted, using either a single-layer or a multi-layer snow scheme. Results show that the multi-layer configuration better reproduces the observed Northern Hemisphere snow seasonality. To further assess the role of snow insulation in coupled forecast systems, two sets of experiments with the Global Seasonal Forecast System (GloSea) version 6 are compared over 24 years (1993–2016) corresponding to the incorporation of single- (G6single) and multi-layer (G6multi) snowpack schemes. In G6multi, the onset of snowmelt is delayed by approximately 1–2 weeks, postponing springtime evaporation, slowing soil moisture depletion, and improving the memory of soil moisture. Increased soil moisture enhances the partitioning of available energy into latent heat flux, thereby promoting evaporative cooling and suppressing excessive water-limited land–atmosphere coupling. The improved model fidelity of land-atmosphere interactions, particularly over mid-latitude regions, mitigate near-surface warming biases across the entire diurnal period and reduce the sensitivity of atmospheric conditions to land surface variability. The model performance in simulating precipitation is also improved with the increase in precipitation occurrence over snow-covered regions. Above all, this study demonstrates the value of implementing a multi-layer snowpack scheme in seasonal forecast models, not only during the snowmelt season but also for the subsequent summer season, for model fidelity in simulating temperature and precipitation along with the reality of land-atmosphere interactions."

These shifts led to notable adjustments in the strength of their mutual interactions, resulting in substantial alterations in their combined impact on the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM). Using the RegCM-Chem-YIBs regional climate-chemistry-ecosystem model, we analyzed the effects of PM2.5, O3, and CO2 interactions on the EASM climate from 2008 to 2018. Our findings indicate that these interactions reduced surface downward shortwave radiation flux by 20–30 W/m2 across East Asia from 2008 to 2012, lowering near-surface temperatures by 0.5–1 K and weakening the EASM. Conversely, surface downward shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes from 2014 to 2018, increased by 2–4 W/m2 and 2–8 W/m2, respectively, in northern and southeastern China, raising near-surface temperatures by 0.5–1 K, and intensifying the EASM. This study highlights the importance of thorough consideration for the interactions among PM2.5, O3, and CO2 in regional climate projections, particularly over East Asia, where atmospheric pollutant concentrations fluctuate significantly, to precisely elucidate their combined impact on the summer monsoon system."

It has been suggested that photochemical processes taking place on mineral particles could reduce large fractions of Fe(III) to Fe(II), which is a more bioavailable form of Fe. Moreover, soluble Fe(III) is also bioavailable. Here, we carried out atmospheric observations and laboratory simulations to show that dust aging processes influenced Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox cycling and enhanced the Fe solubility during long-range transport. Our results show one contrast phenomenon: increasing Fe solubility accompanied by more soluble Fe(III) enrichment in aged dust aerosols. The increasing NOX-to-SO2 ratios and thus the increasing availability of HNO3 enhance soluble Fe(III)-to-Fe(II) ratios. The dissolution experiment of Fe-containing dust demonstrated that high nitrate concentrations suppressed soluble Fe(II) formation at low pH. This enrichment is likely due to a surface-mediated redox mechanism involving nitric acid and Fe(II) when dust plumes are mixed with urban air pollutants. This mechanism is potentially the major mechanism for enhancing Fe solubility in aged dust aerosols and should be included by modeling to better understand the effect of Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox cycling on ocean biological productivity and atmospheric oxidation capacity."

Quorum sensing (QS) represents the microbial communication mechanism that coordinates population-level behaviors. It has emerged as a novel strategy to enhance microbial performance. Currently, most studies investigate the positive performances of exogenous quorum-sensing molecules (QSMs) in lab-scale batch bioreactors. However, full-scale engineering lacks sufficient operational guidance. This Perspective proposes a translational framework to bridge the gap between laboratory insights and practical application. The following four points are of great concern: standardized QSM quantification, targeted regulatory design, operational optimization, and ecological risk assessment. First, this Perspective elucidates the dose–response relationship between QSM concentrations and activation thresholds, subsequently proposing targeted intervention strategies. Then, high-efficiency regulation requires the development of cost-efficient QSM analogues and microbial consortia with productive QSM secretion capabilities. Next, operational strategies must counter the short half-life of the QSM through pulsed dosing or attenuation suppression. Finally, ecological assessments should evaluate pathogenicity risks, ecosystem disruption potential, and the probability of gene transfer. Advancing QS-based regulatory strategies demands integrated efforts across microbiology, chemical engineering, and environmental risk science to ensure safe and effective deployment in wastewater biotreatment."

However, mechanisms underlying F-53B-induced ASD-like pathology and oligodendrocyte dysfunction remain unclear. In this study, we exposed Sprague–Dawley rats to F-53B (0, 8, 80, 800 μg/kg/d from preconception through postweaning) and compared adverse outcomes to a valproic acid-induced ASD model. We found that F-53B crossed the blood-brain barrier, deposited in offspring brain, and induced ASD-like neurobehaviors, including social deficits, stereotypic behaviors, memory impairments, and reduced novelty preference. Neuropathologically, F-53B triggered hippocampal and callosal hypomyelination, delayed oligodendrocyte maturation, and disrupted neuronal mitochondrial cristae. Interestingly, plasma oligodendrocytes-derived exosomes (ODEXs) from F-53B-exposed offspring failed to restore neuronal adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels and mitochondrial membrane potential in vitro. Proteomic profiling of ODEXs identified suppression of ATP synthesis-related proteins, notably chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 8 (an ASD-characterized biomarker) and ATP citrate lyase. Molecular docking suggested F-53B could bind to their amino acid residues.

However, the mechanisms by which these pressures undermine ecological stability remain poorly understood. Here, we combined environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding across six trophic groups with a meta-food-web framework to assess multitrophic biodiversity and food-web structure in two Chinese river basins representing contrasting degradation regimes, which together span a gradient of anthropogenic impacts commonly observed in river systems worldwide. Our results revealed pervasive biotic homogenization in the high-stress basin across all trophic levels, along with a structurally simplified food-web characterized by increased modularity but markedly reduced nestedness and stability. Stress responses were stage-dependent: in the lower-stress basin, diversity and network properties tracked gradients of land-use intensity and water pollutants, whereas in the high-stress basin, further increases in stress produced muted structural changes, consistent with a saturation-like degraded state. Food-web destabilization was primarily driven by indirect effects of environmental stress mediated through changes in biodiversity and network topology. Specifically, diversity loss was the dominant cause of reduced stability, while increased predator niche overlap was linked to the erosion of network complexity, particularly through declines in species richness and nestedness. These findings demonstrate that environmental stressors destabilize riverine ecosystems by degrading both the multitrophic biodiversity and the integrity of ecological interactions. Conservation strategies must therefore move beyond species-centric approaches to protect multitrophic networks and support freshwater ecosystem resilience under accelerating global change."

This study characterizes the photoinactivation of two enveloped viruses (Phi6 and influenza A virus, IAV), and a nonenveloped virus (MS2) in clear and colored surface waters using simulated sunlight. We measured light-screening corrected decay rate constants (k^) using infectivity assays. k^ values were greater, especially for IAV, in colored surface water versus clear water. k^ values were generally greatest for IAV, followed by Phi6, then MS2, suggesting greater susceptibility of enveloped viruses to sunlight. Most k^ values for IAV and Phi6 did not differ with UV irradiance variations in colored surface water, indicating dominance of indirect, photochemically produced reactive intermediate–mediated inactivation pathways. Additional experiments with Phi6 as a representative enveloped virus suggest the importance of hydroxyl radicals, indicate adsorption of NOM promotes photoinactivation, and sublethal damage of the virus may occur. For IAV, modeled time for 99% inactivation in a well-mixed 1 m deep wetland water column is 1.2 h, compared to 1.8 h in clear water. These findings, particularly those for IAV, can inform human and animal health protection strategies."

Here, we identified an unprecedented O3 reduction at a high rate of 2.79 ± 0.08 ppbv yr–1 during 2018–2023, contrasting with the long-term rise in the level of O3 at the same site. We found that this change was unlikely to be caused by COVID-19 lockdowns. Carbon monoxide and some volatile organic compounds (e.g., formaldehyde and toluene) also decreased. Significant O3 reductions occurred in the summer and autumn, with summer showing a higher percentage decline (9.51% yr–1). An ensemble machine learning model was developed to eliminate meteorological impacts on the O3 trends, which was shown to explain 24.5% of the year-round O3 reduction rate. The Weather Research and Forecasting model, coupled with Community Multiscale Air Quality, quantified the meteorological contribution of 54.0% to significant O3 reduction in August 2018 to 2023. While the model well reproduced O3 in August 2018, it overestimated the level of O3 in August 2023 when using emissions derived from simple extrapolation. Nevertheless, the remaining half of the O3 reduction rate in August was likely attributed to changes in anthropogenic emissions on land. This study also highlights the need for timely updates to emission inventories for effective air quality policy evaluations."

The model can be seamlessly integrated into the parameterizations of the microphysics of precipitation and is tested on an extensive disdrometer data set.

We studied Appalachian (Eastern U.S.) ridgelines across a paleoclimate gradient, controlling for bedrock and structure, to test if colder periglacial conditions led to flatter hilltops and longer hillslopes, features typical of permafrost landscapes. We find that hilltop curvature and hillslope length vary with paleotemperature, not modern climate or uplift. Despite gentler slopes, erosion rates near the Last Glacial Maximum ice margin are similar or higher than southern sites for resistant bedrock units, suggesting frost cracking and solifluction enhanced hilltop lowering and valley infilling. Hillslope morphometry patterns resemble landscapes responding to modern Arctic climate gradients, implying a long‐lived geomorphic signature of permafrost‐driven processes. This cold‐climate legacy can remain imprinted in modern mid‐latitude terrain, complicating efforts to link current climate with landscape form where erosion rates are slow."

Here we use a beach‐deployed distributed acoustic sensing array co‐located with an ocean‐bottom node to directly measure the conversion efficiency from wave impacts to Rayleigh‐type ground motion at 4–12 Hz. Frequency–wavenumber analysis, beamforming, and local back‐projection consistently locate sources along a fixed, wave‐breaking coastal segment, while particle‐motion ellipticity confirms the Rayleigh character. Calibrating distributed acoustic sensing strain to ground velocity and combining nearshore wave energetics yields an energy‐conversion efficiency on the order of 10−6. The efficiency is strongly modulated by tide, with high‐tide conditions enhancing coupling even though the source region remains stationary.

However, the dynamics and uncertainty in vertical coupling are not fully resolved. By applying the linear inverse model (LIM) to daily, multi‐level NAM indices from reanalysis and CMIP6 models, we show that the leading eigenmode of NAM displays a deep structure extending from the stratosphere to the surface, with an e‐folding timescale of about 30 days in reanalysis data. This stratospheric mode captures the downward propagation of NAM anomalies during weak polar vortex events, further supported by the LIM simulations forced by white noise. Analysis of inter‐model spread suggests that the LIM‐based estimates can reduce the uncertainty in the surface response to stratospheric extreme events by more than 50%.

Relatively dry conditions occurred in westerlies‐dominated regions and extended to marginal monsoon regions before ∼6,000 a BP, followed by wetting transitions during ∼6,000–5,000 a BP, despite contrasting temperature variations between two regions.

We find that when interactive melt increases, it primarily accelerates the evolution of a spatial pattern of continental shelf warming and cooling that is initiated by freshening and sea‐ice formation decline due to projected atmospheric warming. The competition between enhanced warming at depth from reduced ventilation and enhanced continental shelf cooling from reduced dense water export leads to net ∼ ${\sim} $35% reduction in ice‐shelf meltwater input into the Southern Ocean over the 21st century.

UMorNet achieves an average test accuracy of 0.55 and captures spatial patterns of climatology and long‐term trends. Out‐of‐sample test with a marine heatwave event further demonstrates the model's performance.

Here we quantify the Na‐re relationship by using in situ aircraft measurements, together with a re decomposition method. Our analysis reveals that the cloud‐planetary boundary layer (PBL) coupling plays a pivotal role on the Na‐re relationship. Quantitative re decomposition indicates that the contrasting Na‐re relationships in two cloud‐PBL coupling regimes result from different balances of four distinct aspects.

We estimate ∼95% of the lower glacial oxygen occurred in the deep EEP.

We propose combining granular and continuum mechanics to form a testable theory for conditioning, triggering, and propagation of firnquakes consistent with scarce data. A central condition for collapse events is unconsolidated firn at depth. As firn grains compact, stresses are transmitted along force chains which carry the overburden and transition into a continuous medium by pressure sintering. This granular legacy creates solid‐like supports of denser layers that keep the material below unconsolidated. Dynamic amplification triggers local brittle failure of the supports, which induces a cascade of collapse propagation. Using bulk density from ice cores as proxy for stiffness, we find the flexural wave speed by collapsing supports matches the recorded firnquake velocities on the order of 100 m/s. Our theory is to be tested in firn sheets and other compacting granular materials."

Here, over a decade of upper‐ocean surface velocity data, collected from high‐frequency radar within the Santa Barbara Channel, are used to estimate cross‐scale KE transfer.

Yet, accurately predicting AR impacts on precipitation remains a challenge. This study investigates the influence of dropsonde data from AR Reconnaissance (AR Recon) on improving weather forecasts in winter 2022, specifically AR‐related precipitation forecasts for the U.S. West Coast. Using operational Global Forecast System version 16 (GFSv16) simulations with and without assimilated dropsonde observations, we evaluated the impact of dropsondes on forecasting key meteorological fields like geopotential height, horizontal wind and water vapor transport, and precipitation. The results demonstrate that assimilating dropsonde data can improve the forecast accuracy of landfalling AR characteristics and associated precipitation, although mixed results were obtained in water vapor transport forecasts. Forecast improvement was achieved for medium to strong AR events, especially when dropsondes targeted the AR cores, showing a large error reduction in integrated vapor transport (approximately 20 kg m−1 s−1) and precipitation (by >5 mm d−1 or ∼20%–40%) for strong AR conditions. The analysis indicates that the effectiveness of dropsonde data is influenced by AR characteristics, such as intensity and track, as well as the complex terrain of the U.S. West Coast. These findings highlight the value of targeted field campaigns in improving AR precipitation forecasts and underscore the need for continued research to address remaining uncertainties, ultimately enhancing water resource management and extreme weather preparedness on the West Coast."

Tobin,First Aircraft‐Based VOC Measurements Using Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing: Mapping Fire Plumes With the Scanning High‐Resolution Interferometer Sounder (S‐HIS),"Wildfires emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that contribute to ozone and aerosol pollution. Quantification is challenged by the diversity of emitted species and by their complex dependence on fire characteristics, with scarce field observations available for model evaluation. Remote sensing in the thermal infrared (IR) is a powerful tool for detecting fire VOCs: many compounds exhibit distinct signatures at these wavelengths, and measurements are unaffected by fine aerosols prevalent in smoke. Here, we develop the first thermal IR VOC measurements from an aircraft‐based platform, using radiance observations from the Scanning High‐resolution Interferometer Sounder (S‐HIS) deployed aboard the NASA ER‐2 during the 2019 FIREX‐AQ campaign. We focus on methanol and ethene, and employ a neural network retrieval adapted from Cross‐track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) algorithms. The S‐HIS retrievals achieved high precision (R2 = 0.95–0.99) and accuracy (median absolute bias <5.5 × 1015 molec./cm2) versus the full training data set. However, at low‐to‐moderate concentrations, retrieval performance is degraded by instrument noise. When considering scenes below the median methanol signal encountered during FIREX‐AQ, 30‐fold aggregation is needed to achieve R2 = 0.8, and no amount of aggregation yields the performance that would be achievable for a single pixel with the 10× lower noise of CrIS. The S‐HIS VOC observations exhibit clear enhancements over and downwind of fires that align with those seen by CrIS. Our results provide a foundation for future aircraft‐based VOC measurements in the thermal IR, and emphasize the critical importance of instrument noise for the design of future airborne and spaceborne sounders."

 Earth’s energy uptake—defined as the global mean net incoming radiation at the top of the atmosphere—surged in 2022–2023, contributing to record global surface temperatures and widespread climate extremes in 2023–2024. Yet, the causes of this extreme energy uptake remain unclear, reflecting limited knowledge of how internal climate variability shapes Earth’s energy imbalance. Here we investigate the drivers of the observed extreme energy uptake by using multi-model climate simulations and satellite-based observations. We show that the transition from the multi-year La Niña to El Niño was key to Earth’s extreme energy uptake in 2022–2023, upon the externally forced positive imbalance. Our sampling analyses from the multi-model simulation dataset highlight the dominant influence of the La Niña-to-El Niño sequence on enhanced energy uptake, with crucial importance of multi-year persistence in preceding La Niña. When combined with estimates of the externally forced component derived under Shared Socio-economic Pathway scenarios, the contribution associated with the La Niña-to-El Niño transition explains about 75% of the observed extreme energy uptake. Our finding underscores the role of internal climate variability in shaping Earth’s energy budget and its potential amplification under a warming climate.

 Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials with strong in-plane anisotropy are emerging as fertile platforms for nanophotonics beyond conventional isotropic noble metals and dielectrics. Here, we demonstrate hyperbolic localized plasmon resonances (H-LPRs) in MoOCl2, a representative anisotropic 2D crystal. Unlike conventional plasmons, H-LPRs arise directly from the crystal anisotropy and show unprecedented properties: (i) one-dimensional resonances in circularly symmetric nanodisks, (ii) Z-gap independence in metal–insulator–metal heterostructures, and (iii) twist-induced chirality with circular dichroism values exceeding 0.65. The H-LPRs are characterized by both far-field spectra and near-field imaging. By stacking twisted MoOCl2 flakes, we bridge H-LPRs with concepts of moiré photonics and twistronics, introducing a new degree of freedom in plasmonic design. These findings establish H-LPRs in anisotropic 2D materials as a generalizable and versatile platform for polarization engineering, ultrasensitive chiral sensing, and integration into compact on-chip and quantum nanophotonic devices.

It operates without sorting or downcycling for circular, low-emission aluminium recovery. 
 The global transition to a circular economy hinges on the development of sustainable recycling processes for end-of-life vehicles. Ongoing electrification and material choices over the recent decades hinder their integration in existing recycling pathways. This results in a large surplus of low-grade aluminium scraps and forfeits substantial energy, emissions, and cost savings, making the need for novel recycling approaches an urgent problem. This study presents a process for directly upcycling mixed end-of-life vehicles scrap into a high-performance aluminium alloy under realistic industrial conditions. It is compatible with existing infrastructure and dispenses the need for sorting, dilution or downcycling. By leveraging metallurgical principles and accelerated precipitation, the produced alloys achieve yield strengths that even surpass the commercial automotive alloy spectrum. This approach establishes a circular, low-emissions route to high-value aluminium recovery and offers a strategic model for transforming today´s and future´s critical raw material streams into next-generation structural alloys.

 Flexible thermoelectric materials hold great promise for sustainable energy supply in flexible electronics. However, beyond the long-standing champion Bi2Te3-based flexible films, high-performance alternatives remain scarce. Here, we report a promising flexible thermoelectric material based on eco-friendly MgAgSb, a bulk-proven high-performance system whose development in flexible form has long been hindered by its intrinsic brittleness and phase complexity. Using molecular beam deposition, we manage to precisely stabilize MgAgSb within its α-phase range and finely control its stoichiometry. As a result, we successfully fabricate the α-MgAgSb film with exceptional performance, achieving a room temperature zT of 0.8 and a peak power factor of 19.3 μW cm-1 K-2, ranking among the promising flexible thermoelectric materials developed. Moreover, the α-MgAgSb film is revealed to exhibit notable flexibility and stability under repeated bending and heating. Leveraging this high-performance stable α-MgAgSb film, the flexible thermoelectric device delivers a maximum normalized power density of 4.9 μW cm-2 K-2. This work opens a pathway for flexible MgAgSb applications and offers strong potential for realizing self-powered flexible technologies.

Fitting a dynamical systems model to fMRI data, Song and colleagues show that the geometry of neural dynamics along the attractor landscape reflects changes in attention. 
 Large-scale brain activity reflects changes in attention. To understand how, we tested a hypothesis that the geometry of neural dynamics on the cortical attractor landscape, or movement along its “hills and valleys”, reflects attentional states. A dynamical systems model separating intrinsic dynamics from stimulus-driven influences was fit to fMRI data collected during rest, tasks, and movie-watching. Model simulations revealed a set of attractors aligned with canonical functional brain networks. The speed and direction of neural trajectories toward these attractors varied systematically with attentional states over time and across contexts. When participants were paying attention to effortful tasks, neural dynamics converged fast and directly toward a task-relevant attractor. In contrast, when participants were engaged in sitcom episodes, neural dynamics occupied a flatter region of the landscape, directed away from attractors. These findings demonstrate that while attractor locations are largely determined by cortical organization, the geometry of neural dynamics changes systematically across attentional states and contexts. Attention fluctuates over time and across contexts—how is this reflected in the brain?

Lactate influx via MCT1 triggers histone lactylation in fibroblasts to activate profibrotic genes. 
 Hypertrophic scar (HS) is a fibroproliferative disorder characterized by fibroblast hyperactivation and aberrant extracellular matrix deposition. This study identifies macrophage-derived lactate as a key mediator of fibroblast phenotypic remodeling via monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1)-mediated histone H3 lysine 23 lactylation (H3K23la) in HS. Elevated lactate levels and MCT1 expression were observed in HS tissues, with macrophages in stiff mechanical microenvironments identified as the primary lactate source. Lactate influx through MCT1 upregulated H3K23la, thereby promoting transcriptional activation of profibrotic genes HEY2 and COL11A1. Mechanistically, HEY2 activated YAP1/SMAD2 signaling, while COL11A1 stabilized MCT1 to enhance lactate transport, forming a positive loop that amplified fibrosis. Fibroblast-specific Mct1 deletion or pharmacological inhibition of Mct1 in male mice reduced collagen deposition, accelerated wound healing, and attenuated scar formation. Our findings redefine the macrophage-fibroblast crosstalk in HS and establish the MCT1-H3K23la-HEY2/COL11A1 axis, particularly its self-reinforcing loop, as a novel therapeutic target.

 Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) continuously circulates through the brain and surrounding tissues to remove metabolic waste, a process that becomes less efficient with ageing and in neurodegenerative disease. Visualizing this drainage in living animals has been difficult because existing imaging tools either lack depth, require radioactive tracers, or are too slow to capture dynamic flow. Here, we show that whole-body photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) enables three-dimensional, real-time tracking of CSF transport in mice using indocyanine green. We visualize CSF movement from the spinal canal into the brain, quantify its efflux under different anesthesia conditions, and detect impaired clearance in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Compared with healthy animals, diseased mice retain the tracer in the brain for several days, indicating reduced waste removal. These results establish PACT as a non-invasive platform for measuring CSF and glymphatic function in vivo, providing a way to study how brain fluid transport is altered in ageing and neurological disorders. This study develops photoacoustic computed tomography, which enables real-time, whole-body 3D imaging of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathways in mice and captures anesthesia-dependent CSF flow changes and impaired CSF clearance in an Alzheimer’s disease model."

A study now finds that future hydrogen production could overlap with resource and infrastructure constraints, with consequences for the success of a sustainable transition. 
 As European countries transition to fuels with lower climate change impact, distinct challenges may arise. Electrolytic hydrogen is central to planned developments in transportation and industry, but large-scale hydrogen production could have energy and environmental consequences. Here we simulate site-specific hydrogen demand distribution for Europe in 2050, to assess possible effects on local water use risks, regional electricity generation composition and cost, and total land use. Results show that around 20% of annual water use for hydrogen production is simulated to happen in areas with ‘extremely high’ projected risk of water stress, and local water stress caused by hydrogen production could become severe. Widespread electrolytic hydrogen use requires large investments in electricity generation, but the impacts on the marginal electricity cost to consumers could be small. The electricity generation system required for producing hydrogen or e-fuels would require less land than cultivating biomass for biofuels. The findings highlight the need for coordinated policy action to ensure that hydrogen deployment aligns with local water availability, regional electricity system development, land constraints and broader sustainability goals. Europe’s shift to low-carbon fuels raises concerns about water, land and energy pressures from large-scale hydrogen use.

This perspective reduces the quiet influence of methodological choices on jets’ long-term evolution. 
 Accurately locating jet streams is key to understanding climate variability and regional weather patterns. However, the conventional Eulerian view of jets as fast winds overlooks their continuous meandering, favoring spurious streaks to the detriment of weaker but persistent features that shape large-scale transport. Here we make the case for a Lagrangian view of jets as maxima of isentropic displacement. We introduce a new identification scheme, called JetLag, whose two parameters are set by theory. JetLag recovers familiar features of the historical record (1941-2024) without ad hoc parameter tuning. Remarkably, the resulting estimates of jet latitude and variability are robust to parameter choice, supporting a unified view of jets across latitudes and climates.  Jet streams are more than strong winds: they are persistent, meandering wind patterns. This perspective reduces the quiet influence of methodological choices on jets’ long-term evolution."

Comparison between simulated methane mole fraction contributions and observed increments indicate that summer advection of methane-rich air masses was not fully captured by the model, and most pollution events were underestimated in magnitude. The Po Valley, just below the Alps and with major urban and industrial activities, is the region affecting most pollution events, mainly from agriculture, while contributions from fuel exploitation increased when air originated from Germany, Poland, Czechia, the Netherlands, and the UK. Atmospheric transport models coupled with methane fluxes underestimate methane pollution events in the Alpine region, according to analysis of continuous methane measurements from the Plateau Rosa observatory in the Italian Alps."

 Many oceanic and some continental transform faults host coupled tectonic shear and magmatism, complicating seismic and volcanic hazards. Here we integrate high-resolution seismic tomography and three-dimensional finite-element modelling to investigate fault–magma interactions along the eastern North Anatolian Fault Zone. Tomography reveals two shallow magma reservoirs beneath the Erzincan Basin and the Karlıova Triple Junction, characterised by high Vp/Vs (>1.85). The western reservoir is largely aseismic while the eastern reservoir has persistent seismicity. Time-dependent models demonstrate that right-lateral shear focuses tensile stresses around both reservoirs that encourage reservoir rupture and dyke injection. This stress concentration occurs even when the initial magma-generated excess pressure is zero, and may gradually expand towards the surface. Upward stress transfer is enhanced within the fractured damage zone, facilitating dyke propagation. The results may apply to many transform faults and are of great importance for evaluating the coupled earthquake–volcano hazards in such fault zones. The interplay between tectonic transform loading and evolving magma reservoirs in the eastern North Anatolian Fault Zone is potentially responsible for generating volcanic and seismic hazards, according to geophysical analysis and finite-element modelling."

 Over 100 countries have announced net-zero emissions goals. Although these net-zero emissions goals may be consistent with global 2 °C climate stabilization, their impacts on equity between developing and developed regions remain poorly understood. Here, we used an integrated assessment model and developed scenarios based on the National Determined Contributions and Net Zero Emissions targets, aiming to achieve the 2 °C goals, along with a baseline scenario that followed the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2 baseline projections. Moreover, we show the extent to which individual national net-zero emissions goals are far from equitable and explored potential measures. The results indicate that net-zero emissions without financial support causes large macroeconomic losses in developing countries. The financial transfer of approximately 2.7 trillion US dollars per year to developing regions equivalent to 5% of household consumption in developed regions is sufficient to alleviate such economic burdens. If developed countries should undertake additional physical emissions reductions, the required carbon dioxide removal will scale to 26 Gigatons of carbon dioxide per year, equivalent to over 10% of household consumption. This result suggests that rather than pursuing additional net-negative emissions in developed countries, international financial transfer could be a more pragmatic approach to attain the global net-zero emissions goal. Current national net-zero pledges risk large economic losses in developing regions, and international financial transfers of about 2.7 trillion US dollars per year could effectively offset these impacts, according to a computable general equilibrium model and scenario analysis."

 The Gulf Stream is important for the climate system through its transport and air-sea exchange of heat. What is less well accepted is the role of the Gulf Stream in the carbon cycle. Here we examine how the Gulf Stream provides a “biogeochemical stream”, a sub-surface horizontal flux carrying waters with high concentrations of nutrients and low concentrations of anthropogenic carbon. Model experiments reveal particles released in dense layers at the start of the Gulf Stream follow trajectories extending into the subpolar gyre, while particles released at the surface are confined to the subtropics. Following a pathway to the subpolar gyre, the biogeochemical stream carries older, nutrient-rich and anthropogenically carbon-depleted waters along density layers and, when those dense layers outcrop into the mixed layer, enhances the subpolar drawdown of atmospheric carbon. This connectivity is supported by model sensitivity experiments revealing the subpolar upper ocean carbon content and upstream dense waters in the Gulf Stream connecting on timescales of 4 to 8 years. The likely effect of climate change on the biogeochemical stream is a decrease in the delivery of these older waters, both high in concentrations of nutrients and depleted in anthropogenic carbon, to the subpolar mixed layer, so weakening future North Atlantic carbon uptake from the atmosphere. The Gulf Stream provides a sub-surface horizontal flux carrying high concentrations of nutrients and low concentrations of anthropogenic carbon affecting the subpolar North Atlantic carbon, according to data analyses, model and adjoint simulations."

 World Meteorological Organization baselines used to identify climate extremes are routinely updated to reflect recent climate conditions. Yet the implications of these updates for the characterization, trends, and detectability of climate extremes remain poorly understood, particularly in data-sparse and highly vulnerable regions such as Africa. Here, we quantify how updating the reference period from 1981–2010 to 1991–2020 systematically alters the characterization of temperature and precipitation extremes across the continent. Using multiple observational and reanalysis datasets (BEST, ERA5, MERRA-2, CHIRPS), we assess the sensitivity of percentile-based thresholds, long-term trends, and the Time of Emergence (ToE) to changes in the reference period. ToE is employed here as a diagnostic of detectability rather than a definitive marker of anthropogenic signal onset. Our results show that the updated baseline leads to higher temperature thresholds, resulting in a reduced frequency and slower trends for warm extremes (TX90p, TN90p), and a concurrent increase in cold extremes (TX10p, TN10p). Precipitation extremes exhibit more heterogeneous and dataset-dependent responses: trends in extreme precipitation totals (R95pTOT, R99pTOT) generally weaken, whereas intensity-based metrics (R95pINT, R99pINT) often strengthen, particularly in MERRA-2. Moreover, the choice of baseline strongly influences the estimated ToE. Warm extremes emerge 2–8 years later under the newer baseline, while cold extremes emerge earlier (by up to 15 years) due to enhanced signal-to-noise ratios. For precipitation, ToE responses vary widely across datasets and regions. In CHIRPS, the ToE of intense rainfall events is delayed, whereas in MERRA-2 it advances by over 2 decades in some regions. These results indicate that ToE estimates derived from recent decades are highly sensitive to baseline selection. By explicitly isolating the effect of baseline choice, this study provides a critical framework for interpreting extremes, reconciling dataset discrepancies, and improving the robustness of climate monitoring and risk communication across Africa."

In this study, we found that early damage in zebrafish and rodent demyelination models is characterized by myelin swelling. We show, through live imaging, that myelin swelling does not always lead to myelin loss and that swellings can sometimes resolve, allowing sheaths to remodel. Increased neuronal activity during early demyelination exacerbates myelin damage, whereas reducing neuronal activity mitigates myelin swelling in both zebrafish and mice. In human multiple sclerosis tissue, myelin swelling is also dynamic and is prominent around active lesions. Our data indicate that myelin swelling is a conserved feature of demyelination and that damage to myelin sheaths can resolve, opening opportunities for targeting human disease."

Etv3-deficient migDCs up-regulated multiple costimulatory molecules, including OX40 ligand (OX40L/TNFSF4), whose blockade partially rescued the Tregcell abnormalities.

We evaluate the effectiveness of this large-scale conservation action by assessing fish communities across mainstem habitats before and after the ban (2018 to 2023). The seven-decadal biodiversity loss was halted with improvements in fish biomass, body condition, species diversity, and initial recovery of threatened species. Eliminating fishing pressure was likely key to this recovery, in addition to actions targeting water quality improvement, hydrological and riparian habitat restoration, and vessel traffic reduction.

However, progress has been slow because of the complex genetic architecture of resistance. To better understand blight resistance, we compared reference genomes, gene expression responses, and stem metabolite profiles of the resistant Chinese and susceptible American chestnut species. To accelerate resistance breeding, we conducted large-scale phenotyping and genotyping in hybrids of these species. Simulation and inoculation experiments suggest that significant resistance gains are possible through selectively breeding trees with an average of 70 to 85% American chestnut ancestry. The resources developed in this work are foundational for breeding to create diverse restoration populations with sufficient disease resistance and competitive growth."

We identified a poxvirus effector, myxoma virus M3.1, which elicited an antiviral nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) response. NF-κB was unleashed by an ETI pathway that sensed M3.1 attack of two antiviral complexes: zinc finger antiviral protein and TBK1. NF-κΒ activation occurred because the proteins inhibited by M3.1—N4BP1, ZC3H12A, and TBK1—are negative regulators of NF-κB.

Christopher Garcia,Structural ontogeny of protein-protein interactions,"Understanding how protein binding sites evolve interactions with other proteins could hold clues to targeting “undruggable” surfaces. We used synthetic coevolution to engineer new interactions between naïve surfaces, simulating the de novo formation of protein complexes. We isolated seven distinct structural families of protein Z-domain complexes and found that synthetic complexes explore multiple shallow energy wells through ratchet-like docking modes, whereas complexes formed by natural binding sites converged in a deep energy well with a relatively fixed geometry. Epistasis analysis of a machine learning–estimated fitness landscape revealed “seed” contacts between binding partners that anchored the earliest stages of encounter complex formation. Our results suggest that “silent” surfaces have a shallower energy landscape than natural binding sites, disfavoring tight binding, likely owing to evolutionary counterselection."

A common viewpoint is that NPF hinges thermodynamically on the volatility of condensing species and is unfavorable at high temperatures. From an intensive field campaign, we observed frequent NPF events during a heat wave. Size-resolved chemical composition of nanoparticles down to 3 nanometers was first measured, unraveling a dominant presence of carboxylic acids. Our work uncovers a spontaneous mechanism to produce supramolecular nanoparticles through self-assembly of organic acids. This discovery explains not only the unexpected NPF at high temperatures but also its ubiquitous occurrence under diverse atmospheric conditions. As global warming leads to more frequent and intense heat waves, our findings open avenues for assessing the impacts of aerosols on cloud formation, public health, and climate."

Besides dietary sources of animal origin, carnitine biosynthesis from trimethyllysine (TML) is essential, particularly for those who consume plant-based diets; however, its molecular regulation and physiological role remain elusive. Here, we identify SLC25A45 as a mitochondrial TML carrier that controls carnitine biosynthesis and fuel switching. SLC25A45 deficiency decreased the carnitine pool and impaired mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, shifting reliance to carbohydrate metabolism.Slc25a45-deficient mice were cold-intolerant and resistant to lipid mobilization by glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), rendering them resistant to adipose tissue loss. Our study suggests that mitochondria serve as a regulatory checkpoint in fuel switching, with implications for metabolic adaptation and the efficacy of GLP-1RA–based anti-obesity therapy."

How cytoplasmically generated mRNA fragments affect nuclear transcription remains poorly understood. Using genome-wide CRISPR screens, we uncover ILF3 as an RNA binding protein connecting cytoplasmic mRNA decay and transcription during TA and show that it is required for a range of TA substrates. ILF3 is enriched at adapting genes’ RNAs, and its artificial recruitment through dCas13 promotes gene expression. Using tiling oligonucleotide screens, we identify trigger RNA fragments that activate adapting genes when introduced into cells. Further functional dissection reveals a critical role for homology between trigger and target sequences. These findings enhance our molecular understanding of TA and inform the design of programmable oligonucleotides for gene expression augmentation."

Here we report the experimental realization of single-crystalline θ-phase tantalum nitride (θ-TaN), a metastable transition metal nitride predicted to overcome this limitation. We measured a room-temperature thermal conductivity of ~1100 watts per meter-kelvin, nearly three times that of copper. Synchrotron-based inelastic x-ray scattering revealed a distinctive phonon band structure with a large acoustic-optical gap and phonon bunching, which suppress phonon-phonon scattering. Ultrafast optical spectroscopy confirmed exceptionally weak electron-phonon coupling and validated first-principles calculations. These findings redefine the thermal transport limits of metallic materials and open new opportunities for advancing thermal management in electronics and power systems."

These appressoria develop semipermeable cell walls and accumulate osmolytes internally to create turgor by osmosis. Although melanin is known to be important for turgor generation, the mechanism underlying wall semipermeability remains unclear. By using reverse genetics, we identified that the enzymes PKS2 and PBG13 are required for forming the semipermeable barrier in fungi causing anthracnose and rice blast diseases. These enzymes synthesize 3,5-dihydroxyhexanoic acid polymers that are essential for pathogenicity. These polymers reduce cell wall permeability and generate turgor, independently of melanization. Our findings uncover a mechanism of fungal turgor generation, linking enzyme function to pathogen penetration and disease potential, presenting new targets for disease control."

A sufficiently strong shock ejects the envelope, producing a supernova. If the shock fails to eject it, the envelope is predicted to fall back onto the collapsing core, producing a stellar-mass black hole (BH) and causing the star to disappear. We report observations of M31-2014-DS1, a hydrogen-depleted supergiant in the Andromeda Galaxy. In 2014, it brightened in the mid-infrared, then from 2017 to 2022, it faded by factors of≳104in optical light (becoming undetectable) and≳10in total light.

InArabidopsis, the polyamine thermospermine (tSpm) affects xylem cell fate. tSpm induces translation of SUPPRESSOR-OF-ACAULIS51 (SAC51) and SAC51-LIKEs (SACLs), which inhibit heterodimerization of the xylem development proteins LONESOME-HIGHWAY (LHW) and TARGET-OF-MONOPTEROS5. Here, we report a methyltransferase, OVERACHIEVER, that methylates the peptidyl transferase center of the 25Sribosomal RNA (rRNA). Residue m3U2952 promotes functional tSpm binding to a specific site connecting the P-site transfer RNA (tRNA) with rRNA residues in the peptidyl transferase center. This interaction enhances the translation of SACLs but inhibits that of LHW. Our study uncovers the dependency between a conserved rRNA base methylation and a polyamine in orchestrating cell fate decisions, highlighting a role for the ribosome chemical landscape in translational regulation."

Mammalian whiskers are elongated keratin rods attached to tactile skin structures that extend the animal’s sensory volume. We investigated the whiskers that cover Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) trunks and found that they are geometrically and mechanically tailored to facilitate tactile perception by encoding contact location in the amplitude and frequency of the vibrotactile signal felt at the whisker base. Elephant whiskers emerge from armored trunk skin and shift from a thick, circular, porous, stiff base to a thin, ovular, dense, soft tip. These functional gradients of geometry, porosity, and stiffness independently tune the neuromechanics of elephant trunk touch to facilitate highly dexterous manipulation while ensuring whisker durability."

However, NH3productivity is often limited by sluggish Li-ion desolvation and diffusion at the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Here, we present a concerted desolvation:diffusion layered SEI architecture that provides abundant Li-ion flux for efficient N2conversion toward NH3production at high current densities. The SEI comprises stacked inorganic layers with low ion-binding affinity and high ion-conductivity functionalities that increase Li-ion flux by two orders of magnitude. This design strategy achieved N2electroreduction in a 2 M lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate electrolyte with a Faradaic efficiency of 98% and an energy efficiency of 21% for NH3production at 100 milliamperes per square centimeter (mA cm−2).

In this Review, we discuss the scale-dependent mechanisms through which forests regulate climate, highlighting their contributions to global mitigation and local adaptation. Locally, forests tend to buffer temperatures, cooling in warm conditions and warming in cold ones. In regions that naturally support dense forest cover, trees contribute to global cooling primarily through carbon uptake, with some offsetting from albedo-related warming. By enhancing rainfall interception, evapotranspiration, and cloud formation, forests also influence the hydrological cycle, lowering flood risks in humid regions but often reducing downstream water availability, especially in drier climates. Collectively, these interacting processes show that the greatest climate benefits occur where forests are native, highlighting their importance for both climate adaptation and mitigation."
