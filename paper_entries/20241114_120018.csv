10.1088/1748-9326/ad8a71,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文利用Sentinel-1卫星的合成孔径雷达（SAR）数据研究了2023-2024年亚马逊河流域严重干旱期间开放水域面积的变化。研究发现，与月平均值相比，2023年11月和12月的开放水域面积减少了约8%，部分湖泊的减少幅度甚至高达80%。 这项研究关注的是地表水变化，而非大气成分，因此与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。研究使用了卫星遥感技术，但其目标是监测水资源，而非大气质量或大气成分。,"['Satellite observation', 'Remote sensing', 'SAR', 'Sentinel-1', 'Water extent', 'Drought monitoring', 'Amazon basin']",Daniel A Maciel;Fellipe Lousada;Alice Fassoni-Andrade;Renata Pacheco Quevedo;Claudio Clemente Faria Barbosa;Marie Paule-Bonnet;Evlyn Márcia Leão de Moraes Novo,Sentinel-1 data reveals unprecedented reduction of open water extent due to 2023-2024 drought in the central Amazon basin,"In 2023, an intense drought impacted the Amazon basin triggered by climate change and a strong El Niño event, with the Negro River reaching its lowest water level in 120 years. However, the spatiotemporal open water extent (OWE) during this drought remains unclear. This study comprehensively evaluates OWE variability in the central Amazon using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data since 2017. Monthly OWE masks were generated through an empirical threshold classification with accuracy >95%. Overall, the central Amazon experienced a reduction of ∼8% in OWE in the 2023 dry season months (November and December) when compared to monthly-average. However, reductions of up to 80% in OWE were observed in several specific lakes. Our analysis underscores the unprecedented severity of the 2023/2024 drought on rivers and floodplains. Utilizing SAR remote sensing technologies, this study emphasizes the urgent need for proactive conservation measures to safeguard the Amazon’s ecological integrity amid escalating environmental challenges.

10.5194/acp-24-12537-2024,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文主要关注的是利用地面观测数据评估UKESM1大气化学模型在模拟热带地区表面臭氧浓度方面的表现。它分析了模型模拟结果与地面监测站数据的偏差，并着重强调了模型在模拟臭氧的季节变化和小时变化方面的能力。虽然研究涉及大气成分分析（表面臭氧）和空气质量监测，但它并没有直接使用遥感技术（如卫星观测）获取数据，而是依赖于地面监测站的实测数据来评估模型的准确性。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,"['surface ozone', 'air quality monitoring', 'ground-based measurements', 'atmospheric chemistry model', 'UKESM1']",Flossie Brown;Gerd Folberth;Stephen Sitch;Paulo Artaxo;Marijn Bauters;Pascal Boeckx;Alexander W.

Ozone monitoring sites in the tropics are limited, so models are often used to understand ozone exposure. We use measurements from the tropics to evaluate ozone from the UK Earth system model, UKESM1. UKESM1 is able to capture the pattern of ozone in the tropics, except in southeast Asia, although it systematically overestimates it at all sites. This work highlights that UKESM1 can capture seasonal and hourly variability. 
 Surface ozone monitoring sites in the tropics are limited, despite the risk that surface ozone poses to human health, tropical forest and crop productivity. Atmospheric chemistry models allow us to assess ozone exposure in unmonitored locations and evaluate the potential influence of changing policies and climate on air quality, human health and ecosystem integrity. Here, we utilise in situ ozone measurements from ground-based stations in the pan-tropics to evaluate ozone from the UK Earth system model, UKESM1, with a focus on remote sites. The study includes ozone data from areas with limited previous data, notably tropical South America, central Africa and tropical northern Australia. Evaluating UKESM1 against observations beginning in 1987 onwards, we show that UKESM1 is able to capture changes in surface ozone concentration at different temporal resolutions, albeit with a systematic high bias of 18.1 nmol mol−1 on average. We use the diurnal ozone range (DOR) as a metric for evaluation and find that UKESM1 captures the observed DOR (mean bias of 2.7 nmol mol−1 and RMSE of 7.1 nmol mol−1) and the trend in DOR with location and season. Results from this study reveal that hourly ozone concentrations from UKESM1 require bias correction before use for impact assessments based on human and ecosystem health. Indeed, hourly surface ozone data have been crucial to this study, and we encourage other modelling groups to include hourly surface ozone output as a default."

The work shows that smoke plumes have a significant impact by increasing the low-cloud fraction, decreasing the ocean and continental surface temperature and reducing the precipitation of coastal western Africa. It also highlights the role of the ocean temperature response and its feedbacks for the September–November season. 
 The impact of biomass burning aerosols (BBA) emitted in central Africa on the tropical African climate is studied using the ocean–atmosphere global climate model CNRM-CM, including prognostic aerosols. The direct BBA forcing, cloud feedbacks (semi-direct effects), effects on surface solar radiation, atmospheric dynamics and precipitation are analysed for the 1990–2014 period. During the June–July–August (JJA) season, the CNRM-CM simulations reveal a BBA semi-direct effect exerted on low-level clouds with an increase in the cloud fraction of ∼5 %–10 % over a large part of the tropical ocean. The positive effect of BBA radiative effects on low-level clouds is found to be mainly due to the sea surface temperature response (decrease of ∼0.5 K) associated with solar heating at 700 hPa, which increases the lower-tropospheric stability. Over land, results also indicate a positive effect of BBA on the low-cloud fraction, especially for the coastal regions of Gabon and Angola, with a potentially enhanced impact in these coupled simulations that integrates the response (cooling) of the sea surface temperature (SST). In addition to the BBA radiative effect on SST, the ocean–atmosphere coupled simulations highlight that the oceanic temperature response is noticeable (about −0.2 to −0.4 K) down to ∼80 m depth in JJA between the African coast and 10° W. In parallel to low-level clouds, reductions of ∼5 %–10 % are obtained for mid-level clouds over central Africa, mainly due to BBA-induced surface cooling and lower-tropospheric heating inhibiting convection. In terms of cloud optical properties, the BBA radiative effects induced an increase in the optical depth of about ∼2–3 over the ocean south of the Equator. The result of the BBA direct effect and feedback on tropical clouds modulates the surface solar radiation over the whole of tropical Africa. The strongest surface dimming is over central Africa (∼-30 W m−2), leading to a large reduction in the continental surface temperature (by ∼1 to 2 K), but the solar radiation at the oceanic surface is also affected up to the Brazilian coast. With respect to the hydrological cycle, the CNRM-CM simulations show a negative effect on precipitation over the western African coast, with a decrease of ∼1 to 2 mm d−1. This study also highlights a persistent impact of BBA radiative effects on low-level clouds (increase in cloud fraction, liquid water content and optical depth) during the September–October–November (SON) period, mainly explained by a residual cooling of sea surface temperature over most of the tropical ocean. In SON, the effect on precipitation is mainly simulated over the Gulf of Guinea, with a reduction of ∼1 mm d−1. As for JJA, the analysis clearly highlights the important role of the slow response of the ocean in SON and confirms the need to use coupled modelling platforms to study the impact of BBA on the tropical African climate."

The results of a measurement campaign on a glacier in the Swiss Alps demonstrate the potential of the new measurement technique and reveal characteristic insights into glacier-atmosphere interactions and the mountain-valley wind circulation. 
 Glaciers are an integral part of the high mountain environment and interact with the overlying atmosphere and surrounding terrain in a complex and dynamic manner. The energy exchange between the glacier surface and the overlying atmosphere controls ice melt rates and promotes the formation of a low-level katabatic jet that interacts with other, often thermally driven winds in alpine terrain. Information on the structure of the atmospheric boundary layer over glaciers is crucial for studying the characteristics of the katabatic jet, its broader cooling effect, and its susceptibility to be broken up by strong valley or synoptic winds that promote heat advection from the ice- and snow-free periphery towards the glacier. While the number of ground-based measurements from weather stations and meteorological towers installed on glaciers for boundary layer research has increased in recent years, a lightweight and mobile measurement technique for atmospheric sounding over alpine glaciers has not yet been available. Here we describe a new measurement technique based on a low-cost and open-source fixed-wing UAV, which allows sounding the atmospheric boundary layer over glaciers up to several hundred metres above the surface. Vertical profiles of air temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, wind direction and turbulence can be derived from the meteorological and flight recorder data collected by the UAV. The results of a measurement campaign on the Kanderfirn in the Swiss Alps on 16 June 2021 demonstrate the potential of the technique and highlight typical features of the boundary layer above a melting glacier surface. The soundings reveal a persistent low-level katabatic jet, characterised by a pronounced surface-based inversion, relatively dry air, high wind speeds and enhanced turbulence, and a warmer and more humid valley wind aloft."

 This paper presents a high-resolution gridded dataset of daily minimum (TN), mean (TG) and maximum (TX) near-surface air temperatures over Poland, covering the period from 1951 to 2020, with a spatial resolution of 1 km2. PL1GD-T dataset was developed using radial basis functions (RBFs) applied to quality-controlled observations from ground weather stations from the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management – National Research Institute. Cross-validation methods evaluated the gridding procedure on a monthly basis. The linear RBF was employed by hold-out cross-validation (HO-CV) as the most suitable for the gridding procedure among other RBFs. The leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) was performed to ensure the ability to reproduce the original characteristics variability. The values of the scores averaged over all stations for individual months are in range 0.3–0.2, 0.3–0.2, 0.1–0.2 for the bias, in range 1,23–1,46, 0.69–0.92, 0.84–0.99 the root-mean-squared difference (RMSD) and in range 0.91–0.97, 0.98–0.99, 0.98–0.99 for the correlation for TN, TG and TX, respectively. The RSMD is clearly altitude dependent, increasing from low-land to mountainous regions. The dataset's scope and resolution allowed robust estimation of local climate variability characteristics and observed trends. The availability of high-resolution datasets in both spatial and temporal contexts is essential for climate change impact analysis on a smaller scale. This new dataset provides a quality-validated, high-resolution, and open-access dataset that could be utilised by society, administrative bodies, or research institutions for further analysis.

The first version presented here gathers hydroclimatic data and physical attributes for a set of 654 catchments in France. These catchments cover a wide spectrum of hydroclimatic conditions (from oceanic to continental, mountainous or Mediterranean conditions), and are considered to have limited human influence. Data include time series of daily streamflow (with at least 30 years over the 1970–2021 period; also aggregated to monthly and yearly time steps) and of eleven catchment-scale daily climate variables (including precipitation, potential evaporation, and air temperature), as well as a total of 255 catchments attributes organised in ten classes (e.g. geology, soil, land cover, etc.). River flow time series were quality-checked. Along with the database itself, two graphical tools are proposed, namely dynamic graphs to visualize time series and graphical fact sheets to summarize the main catchments characteristics.

Despite the successful applications of catalytic combustion of VOCs as the core technology of VOCs removal in industry, the development of efficient catalysts that can mineralize VOCs into nontoxic CO2 and H2O at low temperatures remains a great challenge. Recent studies show that spinel-based materials as efficient catalysts were extensively used in the catalytic oxidation VOCs field due to their synergistic effect, manifold compositions, and electron configurations. However, most of the pollutants are complex, consisting of multiple VOCs, water vapor, CO2, SO2 and other substances, which presents a significant challenge in constructing highly active and stable catalysts. To meet the future demand for efficient catalysts capable of removing various types of VOCs, it is urgent to rationally design and scientifically prepare spinel catalysts based on existing knowledge. This work reviews the research and development of various spinel catalysts with an emphasis on their catalytic performance in VOCs oxidation. The catalytic performance of spinel-based catalysts for different sorts of VOCs was summarized and compared. Moreover, the effects of the reaction conditions on the catalytic performance of spinel-based catalysts were examined to accommodate complicated operating conditions. Subsequently, the regulation of spinel oxides in structure and defect was coherently reviewed to guide the development and design of efficient catalysts. Especially, the research techniques for the reaction mechanism over spinel catalysts were displayed to better deepen the understanding of catalytic oxidation of VOCs. Finally, the current development and challenges were proposed and put forward for future research.

The results revealed that sulfate exceedance in groundwater was widespread in 156 countries. Approximately 194 million people use water with sulfate levels exceeding 250 mg/L. Among them, around 17 million people face groundwater sulfate concentrations surpassing 500 mg/L, with 82% of these individuals residing in ten specific countries.

Herein, we exposed the radishes to single and mixed foliar doses of CeO2 NPs and deuterated polystyrene (DPS), investigating the trophic transfer of NPs from radish shoots/roots to snails. Compared to single treatments, mixture treatments increased Ce uptake by plants but had no effect on DPS uptake. Additionally, mixture treatments did not affect the movement of Ce and DPS from shoots to roots. Under NP mixture exposure, trophic transfer efficiencies (TTF) for Ce (2.09 × 10–2) and DPS (2.54 × 10–2) significantly decreased in shoot-feeding snails. In root-feeding snails, TTF for Ce (3.32 × 10–1) also showed a significant decrease, while TTF for DPS remained unchanged. Mixture treatments exhibited differential impacts on different snail body parts, particularly leading to biomagnification of DPS in the digestive glands and soft tissues (TTF > 1) of snails consuming roots exposed to mixtures. Both CeO2 and DPS displayed a sudden increase in assimilation efficiency following translocation to the roots. This study provides insights into changes during trophic transfer due to coexposure and plant translocation processes associated with nanoparticles, enhancing our comprehension regarding their environmental risks."

However, significant gaps remain in the knowledge of these processes in glacier-fed rivers of the northeast Tibetan Plateau (NETP). This study determined the isotopic compositions (δ66Zn) of dissolved and particulate Zn in three alpine rivers fed by the Laohugou Glacier (LHG), the Lenglongling Glacier (LG), and the Yuzhufeng Glacier (YG) in the NETP. Results show that the δ66Zn of particulate Zn varies from −0.01 ± 0.04 to +0.97 ± 0.12‰, generally higher than that of dissolved Zn (−0.82 ± 0.06 to +0.19 ± 0.03‰). This suggests a migration behavior in which isotopically lighter Zn is enriched in the dissolved phase and isotopically heavier Zn preferentially adsorbs onto the particulate matter. Moreover, the δ66Zn in the dissolved phase exhibits obvious spatial variation, with an upward trend from the LHG-fed river to the YG-fed river and subsequently to the LG-fed river. In contrast, this trend is less pronounced in the particulate phase due to an anomalously high δ66Zn value (0.97 ± 0.12‰). This isotopic anomaly is primarily attributed to anthropogenic impacts. A comparison with global terrestrial aquatic environments emphasizes the unique response of Zn isotope variability in NETP glacier-fed rivers to both migration processes and anthropogenic impacts."

However, the precise mechanism underlying this effect remains unclear. Here, the mechanism by which Mn induces dysfunction of autophagy–lysosomal pathway-mediated tauopathy by activating the cGAS–STING pathway was explored both in vitro and in vivo. Mn exposure induced tauopathy in microglia and in mice while activating the cGAS–STING pathway, inducing type I interferon production, and impairing the degradation function of the autophagy–lysosomal pathway. Importantly, inactivation of the cGAS–STING pathway rescued the degradation activity of the autophagy–lysosomal pathway, while tauopathy was markedly attenuated, as shown in both cGAS-knockout and STING-knockout BV2 microglia and in mice. Moreover, the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) restored the impaired degradation activity of the autophagy–lysosomal pathway by inactivating the cGAS–STING pathway, thereby clearing Tau aggregation. Taken together, these results indicate that Mn exposure induces tauopathy by impairing the function of the autophagy–lysosomal pathway through the activation of the cGAS–STING pathway. Thus, this study identifies a novel mechanism by which Mn exposure induces Tau aggregation, which in turn triggers potential neurotoxicity, providing a foundation for future drug target research."

Hotchkiss;Sydney Shelton,Toward a Universal Model of Hyporheic Exchange and Nutrient Cycling in Streams,"In this paper we demonstrate that several ubiquitous hyporheic exchange mechanisms can be represented simply as a one‐dimensional diffusion process, where the diffusivity decays exponentially with depth into the streambed. Based on a meta‐analysis of 106 previously published laboratory measurements of hyporheic exchange (capturing a range of bed morphologies, hydraulic conditions, streambed properties, and experimental approaches) we find that the reference diffusivity and mixing length‐scale are functions of the permeability Reynolds Number and Schmidt Number. These dimensionless numbers, in turn, can be estimated for a particular stream from the median grain size of the streambed and the stream's depth, slope, and temperature. Application of these results to a seminal study of nitrate removal in 72 headwater streams across the United States, reveals: (a) streams draining urban and agricultural landscapes have a diminished capacity for in‐stream and in‐bed mixing along with smaller subsurface storage zones compared to streams draining reference landscapes; (b) under steady‐state conditions nitrate uptake in the streambed is primarily biologically controlled; and (c) median reaction timescales for nitrate removal in the hyporheic zone are ≈ ${\approx} $0.5 and 20 hr for uptake by assimilation and denitrification, respectively.

These data were extracted from the longest data set of high‐resolution and continuous in situ observations of water vapor isotopes globally. Based on these data, we identified four evolution patterns of δ18Ov during heavy rainfall events, corresponding to different weather systems: slow‐declining (tropical cyclone interacting with mid‐ and high‐latitude system), W‐shaped (tropical cyclone), U‐shaped (cold vortex system), and inclined L‐shaped (upper‐level trough system). The isotopic variations suggest that heavy rainfall events in eastern China were mainly sustained by moisture from adjacent oceans (including the South China Sea and the East China Sea) and terrestrial environment rather than from the distant Indian Ocean as previously suggested. In addition, for some heavy rainfall events with an intermittent period, the nearby oceanic moisture transport alters before and after the intermittent period due to an intensity change or overall transition of low‐level weather systems.

Goodkin,Uncovering Below Cloud Rain‐Vapor Interactions During Tropical Rain Events Through Simultaneous and Continuous Real‐Time Monitoring of Rain and Vapor Isotopes,"Due to limited water vapor measurements, vapor isotopes have been traditionally estimated under the assumption of isotopic equilibrium between rain and vapor below cloud base. However, recent advancements in analytical instruments allow more vapor isotopic measurements that have challenged this assumption. To enhance our understanding of rain‐vapor interactions below cloud base in tropical regions, we established an automated system to measure rain and vapor isotopes simultaneously and continuously in real time at minute intervals in Singapore. Among 324 rain events monitored from 2016 to 2019, 81% exhibited a substantial departure of rain and vapor isotopes from the expected equilibrium. This departure suggests that raindrop evaporation plays a larger role in determining their isotopes. The conclusion is supported by the generally lower slopes of the local meteoric water line. Seasonal variations in rain event characteristics indicate changing influences of rain‐vapor interactions: during monsoons, more frequent heavy rainfall maintains relatively high humidity below cloud base, favoring rain‐vapor isotopic equilibrium, whereas during inter‐monsoons, more light rain events lead to pronounced rain evaporation and larger isotopic differences. Furthermore, rain‐vapor interactions below cloud base significantly modulated their isotope evolution during individual events. As events progressed, reduced humidity favored evaporation, increasing rain isotope values and decreasing its d‐excess, whereas vapor isotope values decreased and its d‐excess increased. Our study introduces a new approach to capturing real‐time high‐resolution rain and vapor isotopes at minute intervals to understand the dynamics of rain‐vapor interactions below cloud base. Findings underscore the crucial role of these interactions in influencing rain and vapor isotopes during tropical rain events."

We identified the synoptic circulation patterns affecting the changes of R95p over the northern and southern TP by using k‐means clustering. The patterns featured with a 500 hPa trough, 200 hPa wind divergence and low transient geopotential height are identified.

 Thiazoles and isothiazoles are privileged motifs in drug and agrochemical discovery.1,2 The synthesis of these derivatives is generally approached, designed and developed on a case-by-case basis. Sometimes, the lack of robust synthetic methods to a given target can pose significant difficulties or even thwart the preparation of specific derivatives for further study.3,4 Here, we report a conceptually different approach whereby photochemical irradiation can be used to alter the structure of thiazoles and isothiazoles in a selective and predictable manner. Upon photoexcitation, these derivatives populate their π,π* singlet states that undergo a series of structural rearrangements leading to an overall permutation of the cyclic system and its substituents. This means that once the initial heteroaromatic scaffold has been prepared, it can then function as an entry point to access other molecules by selective structural permutation. This approach operates under mild photochemical conditions which tolerate complex scaffolds and chemically distinct functionalities. Preliminary findings also indicate the potential for extending this method to other azole systems, including benzo[d]isothiazole, indazole, pyrazole and isoxazole. This strategy establishes photochemical permutation as a powerful and convenient method for the preparation of complex and difficult-to-access derivatives from more available structural isomers."

 The dangerous chemical hydrogen fluoride sits at the apex of the fluorochemical industry, but the substantial hazards linked to its production under harsh conditions (above 300 degrees Celsius) and transport are typically contracted to specialists. All fluorochemicals for applications, including refrigeration, electric transportation, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals, are prepared from fluorspar (CaF2) through a procedure that generates highly dangerous hydrogen fluoride1–5. Here we report a mild method to obtain fluorochemicals directly from fluorspar, bypassing the necessity to manufacture hydrogen fluoride. Acid-grade fluorspar (more than 97 per cent CaF2) is treated with the fluorophilic Lewis acid boric acid (B(OH)3) or silicon dioxide (SiO2), in the presence of oxalic acid, a Brønsted acid that is highly effective for Ca2+ sequestration. This scalable process carried out in water at low temperature (below 50 degrees Celsius) enables access to widely used fluorochemicals, including tetrafluoroboric acid, alkali metal fluorides, tetraalkylammonium fluorides and fluoro(hetero)arenes. The replacement of oxalic acid with sulfuric acid gave comparable results for B(OH)3, but was not as effective when the fluorophilic Lewis acid was SiO2. A similar process also works with the lower-purity metspar. The production of fluorochemicals directly from fluorspar offers the possibility of decentralized manufacturing—an attractive model for the fluorochemical industry. With the renewed interest in innovative methods to synthesize oxalic acid via carbon dioxide capture and biomass6,7, and the challenges posed by our dependence on fossil fuels for sulfur and therefore sulfuric acid supply8,9, our technology may represent a departure towards a sustainable fluorochemical industry.

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has an atypical, highly stromal tumour microenvironment (TME) that profoundly contributes to its poor prognosis1. Here, to better understand the intercellular signalling between cancer and stromal cells directly in PDAC tumours, we developed a multidimensional proteomic strategy called TMEPro. We applied TMEPro to profile the glycosylated secreted and plasma membrane proteome of 100 human pancreatic tissue samples to a great depth, define cell type origins and identify potential paracrine cross-talk, especially that mediated through tyrosine phosphorylation. Temporal dynamics during pancreatic tumour progression were investigated in a genetically engineered PDAC mouse model. Functionally, we revealed reciprocal signalling between stromal cells and cancer cells mediated by the stromal PDGFR–PTPN11–FOS signalling axis. Furthermore, we examined the generic shedding mechanism of plasma membrane proteins in PDAC tumours and revealed that matrix-metalloprotease-mediated shedding of the AXL receptor tyrosine kinase ectodomain provides an additional dimension of intercellular signalling regulation in the PDAC TME. Importantly, the level of shed AXL has a potential correlation with lymph node metastasis, and inhibition of AXL shedding and its kinase activity showed a substantial synergistic effect in inhibiting cancer cell growth. In summary, we provide TMEPro, a generically applicable clinical functional proteomic strategy, and a comprehensive resource for better understanding the PDAC TME and facilitating the discovery of new diagnostic and therapeutic targets.

 A critical challenge in glioma treatment is detecting tumour infiltration during surgery to achieve safe maximal resection1–3. Unfortunately, safely resectable residual tumour is found in the majority of patients with glioma after surgery, causing early recurrence and decreased survival4–6. Here we present FastGlioma, a visual foundation model for fast (<10 s) and accurate detection of glioma infiltration in fresh, unprocessed surgical tissue. FastGlioma was pretrained using large-scale self-supervision (around 4 million images) on rapid, label-free optical microscopy, and fine-tuned to output a normalized score that indicates the degree of tumour infiltration within whole-slide optical images. In a prospective, multicentre, international testing cohort of patients with diffuse glioma (n = 220), FastGlioma was able to detect and quantify the degree of tumour infiltration with an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 92.1 ± 0.9%. FastGlioma outperformed image-guided and fluorescence-guided adjuncts for detecting tumour infiltration during surgery by a wide margin in a head-to-head, prospective study (n = 129). The performance of FastGlioma remained high across diverse patient demographics, medical centres and diffuse glioma molecular subtypes as defined by the World Health Organization. FastGlioma shows zero-shot generalization to other adult and paediatric brain tumour diagnoses, demonstrating the potential for our foundation model to be used as a general-purpose adjunct for guiding brain tumour surgeries. These findings represent the transformative potential of medical foundation models to unlock the role of artificial intelligence in the care of patients with cancer.

 Making adaptive decisions in complex environments requires appropriately identifying sources of error1,2. The frontal cortex is critical for adaptive decisions, but its neurons show mixed selectivity to task features3 and their uncertainty estimates4, raising the question of how errors are attributed to their most likely causes. Here, by recording neural responses from tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri) performing a hierarchical decision task with rule reversals, we find that the mediodorsal thalamus independently represents cueing and rule uncertainty. This enables the relevant thalamic population to drive prefrontal reconfiguration following a reversal by appropriately attributing errors to an environmental change. Mechanistic dissection of behavioural switching revealed a transthalamic pathway for cingulate cortical error monitoring5,6 to reconfigure prefrontal executive control7. Overall, our work highlights a potential role for the thalamus in demixing cortical signals while providing a low-dimensional pathway for cortico-cortical communication.

 The relaxation behaviour of isolated quantum systems taken out of equilibrium is among the most intriguing questions in many-body physics1. Quantum systems out of equilibrium typically relax to thermal equilibrium states by scrambling local information and building up entanglement entropy. However, kinetic constraints in the Hamiltonian can lead to a breakdown of this fundamental paradigm owing to a fragmentation of the underlying Hilbert space into dynamically decoupled subsectors in which thermalization can be strongly suppressed2–5. Here we experimentally observe Hilbert space fragmentation in a two-dimensional tilted Bose–Hubbard model. Using quantum gas microscopy, we engineer a wide variety of initial states and find a rich set of manifestations of Hilbert space fragmentation involving bulk states, interfaces and defects, that is, two-, one- and zero-dimensional objects. Specifically, uniform initial states with equal particle number and energy differ strikingly in their relaxation dynamics. Inserting controlled defects on top of a global, non-thermalizing chequerboard state, we observe highly anisotropic, subdimensional dynamics, an immediate signature of their fractonic nature6–9. An interface between localized and thermalizing states in turn shows dynamics depending on its orientation. Our results mark the observation of Hilbert space fragmentation beyond one dimension, as well as the concomitant direct observation of fractons, and pave the way for in-depth studies of microscopic transport phenomena in constrained systems. Using quantum gas microscopy, Hilbert space fragmentation and fractonic excitations are observed in a two-dimensional tilted Bose–Hubbard model."

 Lower-limb exoskeletons have the potential to transform the way we move1–14, but current state-of-the-art controllers cannot accommodate the rich set of possible human behaviours that range from cyclic and predictable to transitory and unstructured. We introduce a task-agnostic controller that assists the user on the basis of instantaneous estimates of lower-limb biological joint moments from a deep neural network. By estimating both hip and knee moments in-the-loop, our approach provided multi-joint, coordinated assistance through our autonomous, clothing-integrated exoskeleton. When deployed during 28 activities, spanning cyclic locomotion to unstructured tasks (for example, passive meandering and high-speed lateral cutting), the network accurately estimated hip and knee moments with an average R2 of 0.83 relative to ground truth. Further, our approach significantly outperformed a best-case task classifier-based method constructed from splines and impedance parameters. When tested on ten activities (including level walking, running, lifting a 25 lb (roughly 11 kg) weight and lunging), our controller significantly reduced user energetics (metabolic cost or lower-limb biological joint work depending on the task) relative to the zero torque condition, ranging from 5.3 to 19.7%, without any manual controller modifications among activities. Thus, this task-agnostic controller can enable exoskeletons to aid users across a broad spectrum of human activities, a necessity for real-world viability.

 The ionosphere is a layer of weakly ionized plasma bathed in Earth’s geomagnetic field extending about 50–1,500 kilometres above Earth1. The ionospheric total electron content varies in response to Earth’s space environment, interfering with Global Satellite Navigation System (GNSS) signals, resulting in one of the largest sources of error for position, navigation and timing services2. Networks of high-quality ground-based GNSS stations provide maps of ionospheric total electron content to correct these errors, but large spatiotemporal gaps in data from these stations mean that these maps may contain errors3. Here we demonstrate that a distributed network of noisy sensors—in the form of millions of Android phones—can fill in many of these gaps and double the measurement coverage, providing an accurate picture of the ionosphere in areas of the world underserved by conventional infrastructure. Using smartphone measurements, we resolve features such as plasma bubbles over India and South America, solar-storm-enhanced density over North America and a mid-latitude ionospheric trough over Europe. We also show that the resulting ionosphere maps can improve location accuracy, which is our primary aim.

 Epigenetic inheritance of silent chromatin domains is fundamental to cellular memory during embryogenesis, but it must overcome the dilution of repressive histone modifications during DNA replication1. One such modification, histone H2A lysine 119 monoubiquitination (H2AK119Ub), needs to be re-established by the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) E3 ligase to restore the silent Polycomb domain2,3. However, the exact mechanism behind this restoration remains unknown. Here, combining cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and functional approaches, we characterize the read–write mechanism of the non-canonical PRC1-containing RYBP (ncPRC1RYBP). This mechanism, which functions as a positive-feedback loop in epigenetic regulation4,5, emphasizes the pivotal role of ncPRC1RYBP in restoring H2AK119Ub. We observe an asymmetrical binding of ncPRC1RYBP to H2AK119Ub nucleosomes, guided in part by the N-terminal zinc-finger domain of RYBP binding to residual H2AK119Ub on nascent chromatin. This recognition positions the RING domains of RING1B and BMI1 on the unmodified nucleosome side, enabling recruitment of the E2 enzyme to ubiquitinate H2AK119 within the same nucleosome (intra-nucleosome read–write) or across nucleosomes (inter-nucleosome read–write). Collectively, our findings provide key structural and mechanistic insights into the dynamic interplay of epigenetic regulation, highlighting the significance of ncPRC1RYBP in H2AK119Ub restoration to sustain repressive chromatin domains.

 The combination of decreasing food intake and increasing energy expenditure represents a powerful strategy for counteracting cardiometabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes1. Yet current pharmacological approaches require conjugation of multiple receptor agonists to achieve both effects2–4, and so far, no safe energy-expending option has reached the clinic. Here we show that activation of neurokinin 2 receptor (NK2R) is sufficient to suppress appetite centrally and increase energy expenditure peripherally. We focused on NK2R after revealing its genetic links to obesity and glucose control. However, therapeutically exploiting NK2R signalling has previously been unattainable because its endogenous ligand, neurokinin A, is short-lived and lacks receptor specificity5,6. Therefore, we developed selective, long-acting NK2R agonists with potential for once-weekly administration in humans. In mice, these agonists elicit weight loss by inducing energy expenditure and non-aversive appetite suppression that circumvents canonical leptin signalling. Additionally, a hyperinsulinaemic–euglycaemic clamp reveals that NK2R agonism acutely enhances insulin sensitization. In diabetic, obese macaques, NK2R activation significantly decreases body weight, blood glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol, and ameliorates insulin resistance. These findings identify a single receptor target that leverages both energy-expending and appetite-suppressing programmes to improve energy homeostasis and reverse cardiometabolic dysfunction across species. In mouse and nonhuman primate models, treatment with selective, long-acting neurokinin 2 receptor agonists aids weight loss by suppressing appetite and increasing energy expenditure, as well as by increasing insulin sensitivity."

 Experiments on quantum materials have uncovered many interesting quantum phases ranging from superconductivity to a variety of topological quantum matter including the recently observed fractional quantum anomalous Hall insulators. The findings have come in parallel with the development of approaches to probe the rich excitations inherent in such systems.

 In tomato, sugar content is highly correlated with consumer preferences, with most consumers preferring sweeter fruit1–4. However, the sugar content of commercial varieties is generally low, as it is inversely correlated with fruit size, and growers prioritize yield over flavour quality5–7. Here we identified two genes, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) calcium-dependent protein kinase 27 (SlCDPK27; also known as SlCPK27) and its paralogue SlCDPK26, that control fruit sugar content. They act as sugar brakes by phosphorylating a sucrose synthase, which promotes degradation of the sucrose synthase. Gene-edited SlCDPK27 and SlCDPK26 knockouts increased glucose and fructose contents by up to 30%, enhancing perceived sweetness without fruit weight or yield penalty. Although there are fewer, lighter seeds in the mutants, they exhibit normal germination. Together, these findings provide insight into the regulatory mechanisms controlling fruit sugar accumulation in tomato and offer opportunities to increase sugar content in large-fruited cultivars without sacrificing size and yield.

 With large wildfires becoming more frequent1,2, we must rapidly learn how megafires impact biodiversity to prioritize mitigation and improve policy. A key challenge is to discover how interactions among fire-regime components, drought and land tenure shape wildfire impacts. The globally unprecedented3,4 2019–2020 Australian megafires burnt more than 10 million hectares5, prompting major investment in biodiversity monitoring. Collated data include responses of more than 2,000 taxa, providing an unparalleled opportunity to quantify how megafires affect biodiversity. We reveal that the largest effects on plants and animals were in areas with frequent or recent past fires and within extensively burnt areas. Areas burnt at high severity, outside protected areas or under extreme drought also had larger effects. The effects included declines and increases after fire, with the largest responses in rainforests and by mammals. Our results implicate species interactions, dispersal and extent of in situ survival as mechanisms underlying fire responses. Building wildfire resilience into these ecosystems depends on reducing fire recurrence, including with rapid wildfire suppression in areas frequently burnt. Defending wet ecosystems, expanding protected areas and considering localized drought could also contribute.

 Motor skill repertoire can be stably retained over long periods, but the neural mechanism that underlies stable memory storage remains poorly understood1–8. Moreover, it is unknown how existing motor memories are maintained as new motor skills are continuously acquired. Here we tracked neural representation of learned actions throughout a significant portion of the lifespan of a mouse and show that learned actions are stably retained in combination with context, which protects existing memories from erasure during new motor learning. We established a continual learning paradigm in which mice learned to perform directional licking in different task contexts while we tracked motor cortex activity for up to six months using two-photon imaging. Within the same task context, activity driving directional licking was stable over time with little representational drift. When learning new task contexts, new preparatory activity emerged to drive the same licking actions. Learning created parallel new motor memories instead of modifying existing representations. Re-learning to make the same actions in the previous task context re-activated the previous preparatory activity, even months later. Continual learning of new task contexts kept creating new preparatory activity patterns. Context-specific memories, as we observed in the motor system, may provide a solution for stable memory storage throughout continual learning. Long-term tracking of learned actions in mouse motor cortex shows that learned actions are retained with their context, and learning new tasks creates new memories, which do not overwrite or modify existing representations."

 Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revealed an unexpected abundance of massive-galaxy candidates in the early Universe, extending further in redshift and to lower luminosity than what had previously been found by submillimetre surveys1–6. These JWST candidates have been interpreted as challenging the Λ cold dark-matter cosmology (where Λ is the cosmological constant)7–9, but, so far, these studies have mostly relied on only rest-frame ultraviolet data and have lacked spectroscopic confirmation of their redshifts10–16. Here we report a systematic study of 36 massive dust-obscured galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts between 5 and 9 from the JWST FRESCO survey. We find no tension with the Λ cold dark-matter model in our sample. However, three ultra-massive galaxies (logM★/M⊙ ≳ 11.0, where M★ is the stellar mass and M⊙ is the mass of the Sun) require an exceptional fraction of 50 per cent of baryons converted into stars—two to three times higher than the most efficient galaxies at later epochs. The contribution from an active galactic nucleus is unlikely because of their extended emission. Ultra-massive galaxies account for as much as 17 per cent of the total cosmic star-formation-rate density17 at redshifts between about five and six.

 Human life history is characterized by an extended period of immaturity during which there is a disjunction between cerebral and somatic growth rates1. This mode of ontogeny is thought to be essential for the acquisition of advanced cognitive capabilities in a socially complex environment while the brain is still growing2. Key information about when and how this pattern evolved can be gleaned from the teeth of fossil hominins because dental development informs about the pace of life history3–5. Here we show that the first evolutionary steps towards an extended growth phase occurred in the genus Homo at least 1.77 million years ago, before any substantial increase in brain size. We used synchrotron phase-contrast tomography6 to track the microstructural development of the dentition of a subadult early Homo individual from Dmanisi, Georgia. The individual died at the age of 11.4 ± 0.6 years, shortly before reaching dental maturity. Tooth growth rates were high, similar to rates in living great apes. However, the Dmanisi individual showed a human-like delayed formation of the posterior relative to the anterior dentition, and a late growth spurt of the dentition as a whole. The unique combination of great-ape-like and human-like features of dental ontogeny suggests that early Homo had evolved an extended growth phase before a general slow-down in life history, possibly related to biocultural reproduction7 rather than brain growth.

 Quantum computation and simulation rely on long-lived qubits with controllable interactions. Trapped polar molecules have been proposed as a promising quantum computing platform, offering scalability and single-particle addressability while still leveraging inherent complexity and strong couplings of molecules1–5. Recent progress in the single quantum state preparation and coherence of the hyperfine-rotational states of individually trapped molecules allows them to serve as promising qubits6–11, with intermolecular dipolar interactions creating entanglement12,13. However, universal two-qubit gates have not been demonstrated with molecules. Here we harness intrinsic molecular resources to implement a two-qubit iSWAP gate using individually trapped X1Σ+ NaCs molecules. By allowing the molecules to interact for 664 μs at a distance of 1.9 μm, we create a maximally entangled Bell state with a fidelity of 94(3)% in trials in which both molecules are present. Using motion–rotation coupling, we measure residual excitation of the lowest few motional states along the axial trapping direction and find them to be the primary source of decoherence. Finally, we identify two non-interacting hyperfine states within the ground rotational level in which we encode a qubit. The interaction is toggled by transferring between interacting and non-interacting states to realize an iSWAP gate. We verify the gate performance by measuring its logical truth table.

 Climate change affects marine organisms, causing migrations, biomass reduction and extinctions1,2. However, the abilities of marine species to adapt to these changes remain poorly constrained on both geological and anthropogenic timescales. Here we combine the fossil record and a global trait-based plankton model to study optimal temperatures of marine calcifying zooplankton (foraminifera, Rhizaria) through time. The results show that spinose foraminifera with algal symbionts acclimatized to deglacial warming at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 19–21 thousand years ago, ka), whereas foraminifera without symbionts (non-spinose or spinose) kept the same thermal preference and migrated polewards. However, when forcing the trait-based plankton model with rapid transient warming over the coming century (1.5 °C, 2 °C, 3 °C and 4 °C relative to pre-industrial baseline), the model suggests that the acclimatization capacities of all ecogroups are limited and insufficient to track warming rates. Therefore, foraminifera are projected to migrate polewards and reduce their global carbon biomass by 5.7–15.1% (depending on the warming) by 2100 relative to 1900–1950. Our study highlights the different challenges posed by anthropogenic and geological warming for marine plankton and their ecosystem functions.

 Rising carbon dioxide emissions are provoking ocean warming and acidification1,2, altering plankton habitats and threatening calcifying organisms3, such as the planktonic foraminifera (PF). Whether the PF can cope with these unprecedented rates of environmental change, through lateral migrations and vertical displacements, is unresolved. Here we show, using data collected over the course of a century as FORCIS4 global census counts, that the PF are displaying evident poleward migratory behaviours, increasing their diversity at mid- to high latitudes and, for some species, descending in the water column. Overall foraminiferal abundances have decreased by 24.2 ± 0.1% over the past eight decades. Beyond lateral migrations5, our study has uncovered intricate vertical migration patterns among foraminiferal species, presenting a nuanced understanding of their adaptive strategies. In the temperature and calcite saturation states projected for 2050 and 2100, low-latitude foraminiferal species will face physicochemical environments that surpass their current ecological tolerances. These species may replace higher-latitude species through poleward shifts, which would reduce low-latitude foraminiferal diversity. Our insights into the adaptation of foraminifera during the Anthropocene suggest that migration will not be enough to ensure survival. This underscores the urgent need for us to understand how the interplay of climate change, ocean acidification and other stressors will impact the survivability of large parts of the marine realm.

 Pangenomes are collections of annotated genome sequences of multiple individuals of a species1. The structural variants uncovered by these datasets are a major asset to genetic analysis in crop plants2. Here we report a pangenome of barley comprising long-read sequence assemblies of 76 wild and domesticated genomes and short-read sequence data of 1,315 genotypes. An expanded catalogue of sequence variation in the crop includes structurally complex loci that are rich in gene copy number variation. To demonstrate the utility of the pangenome, we focus on four loci involved in disease resistance, plant architecture, nutrient release and trichome development. Novel allelic variation at a powdery mildew resistance locus and population-specific copy number gains in a regulator of vegetative branching were found. Expansion of a family of starch-cleaving enzymes in elite malting barleys was linked to shifts in enzymatic activity in micro-malting trials. Deletion of an enhancer motif is likely to change the developmental trajectory of the hairy appendages on barley grains. Our findings indicate that allelic diversity at structurally complex loci may have helped crop plants to adapt to new selective regimes in agricultural ecosystems.

 Radioactive nuclei with lifetimes on the order of millions of years can reveal the formation history of the Sun and active nucleosynthesis occurring at the time and place of its birth1,2. Among such nuclei whose decay signatures are found in the oldest meteorites, 205Pb is a powerful example, as it is produced exclusively by slow neutron captures (the s process), with most being synthesized in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars3–5. However, making accurate abundance predictions for 205Pb has so far been impossible because the weak decay rates of 205Pb and 205Tl are very uncertain at stellar temperatures6,7. To constrain these decay rates, we measured for the first time the bound-state β− decay of fully ionized 205Tl81+, an exotic decay mode that only occurs in highly charged ions. The measured half-life is 4.7 times longer than the previous theoretical estimate8 and our 10% experimental uncertainty has eliminated the main nuclear-physics limitation. With new, experimentally backed decay rates, we used AGB stellar models to calculate 205Pb yields. Propagating those yields with basic galactic chemical evolution (GCE) and comparing with the 205Pb/204Pb ratio from meteorites9–11, we determined the isolation time of solar material inside its parent molecular cloud. We find positive isolation times that are consistent with the other s-process short-lived radioactive nuclei found in the early Solar System. Our results reaffirm the site of the Sun’s birth as a long-lived, giant molecular cloud and support the use of the 205Pb–205Tl decay system as a chronometer in the early Solar System.

 The bone marrow microenvironment is a critical regulator of haematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and fate1. Although it is appreciated that ageing, chronic inflammation and other insults compromise bone marrow function and thereby negatively affect haematopoiesis2, it is not known whether different bone compartments exhibit distinct microenvironmental properties and functional resilience. Here we use imaging, pharmacological approaches and mouse genetics to uncover specialized properties of bone marrow in adult and ageing skull. Specifically, we show that the skull bone marrow undergoes lifelong expansion involving vascular growth, which results in an increasing contribution to total haematopoietic output. Furthermore, skull is largely protected against major hallmarks of ageing, including upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, adipogenesis and loss of vascular integrity. Conspicuous rapid and dynamic changes to the skull vasculature and bone marrow are induced by physiological alterations, namely pregnancy, but also pathological challenges, such as stroke and experimental chronic myeloid leukaemia. These responses are highly distinct from femur, the most extensively studied bone marrow compartment. We propose that skull harbours a protected and dynamically expanding bone marrow microenvironment, which is relevant for experimental studies and, potentially, for clinical treatments in humans.

Here, using an expenditure database that includes up to 201 consumption groups across 168 countries, we investigate the distribution of 6 environmental footprint indicators and assess the impact of specific consumption expenditures on planetary boundary transgressions. We show that 31–67% and 51–91% of the planetary boundary breaching responsibility could be attributed to the global top 10% and top 20% of consumers, respectively, from both developed and developing countries. By following an effective mitigation pathway, the global top 20% of consumers could adopt the consumption levels and patterns that have the lowest environmental impacts within their quintile, yielding a reduction of 25–53% in environmental pressure. In this scenario, actions focused solely on the food and services sectors would reduce environmental pressure enough to bring land-system change and biosphere integrity back within their respective planetary boundaries.

 Transition metal carbide shows excellent performance in selective hydrogenation of acetylene, however, the carburization of Pd-based intermetallic compounds remains infeasible. Here we report the successful synthesis of an unprecedented Pd3ZnCx intermetallic carbide, via co-infiltration of zinc and carbon in one-step carburization by syngas.

A unique transitional state (Pdt) with low content of Zn/C co-infiltration is clearly identified facilitating phase transition and sustain incorporation of carbon and zinc at elevated temperatures. The Pd3ZnCx carbide shows by far the best catalytic performance in the selective hydrogenation of acetylene with a high selectivity (>90%) even at a high H2/C2H2 ratio.

They find non-reciprocal microwave transmission can be achieved within the broken symmetry phase in the few-photon regime. 
 Non-Hermitian physical systems have attracted considerable attention in recent years for their unique properties around exceptional points (EPs), where the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the system coalesce. Phase transitions near exceptional points can lead to various interesting phenomena, such as unidirectional wave transmission. However, most of those studies are in the classical regime and whether these properties can be maintained in the quantum regime is still a subject of ongoing studies. Using a non-Hermitian on-chip superconducting quantum circuit, here we observe a phase transition and the corresponding exceptional point between the two phases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that unidirectional microwave transmission can be achieved even in the few-photon regime within the broken symmetry phase. This result holds some potential applications, such as on-chip few-photon microwave isolators. Our study reveals the possibility of exploring the fundamental physics and practical quantum devices with non-Hermitian systems based on superconducting quantum circuits.

Here, the authors report the tuning of Weyl nodes and associated magnetotransport in MnSb2Te4 by diffusion-controlled ionic hydrogen insertion. 
 Chirality — a characteristic handedness that distinguishes ‘left’ from ‘right’—is a fundamental property of quantum particles under broken symmetry intimately connected to their spins. Chiral fermions have been identified in Weyl semimetals through their unique electrodynamics arising from ‘axial’ charge imbalance between pairs of chiral Weyl nodes—the topologically protected ‘relativistic’ crossings of electronic bands. Chiral magnetotransport phenomena critically depend on the details of electronic band structure. However, the putative emergence of chiral electronic channels through shape altering of Weyl nodes is yet to be revealed. Here, we detect chirality-endowed linear conduction channels promoted by a tilt of Weyl bands in inversion-symmetric Weyl ferromagnet MnSb2Te4. The tuning of Weyl nodes is controlled with ionic hydrogen, which heals the system’s (Mn-Te) bond disorder and lowers the internode scattering. The reshaped Weyl states feature a doubled Curie temperature  ≳50 K and a strong angular transport chirality synchronous with a rare field-antisymmetric longitudinal resistance—a low-field tunable ‘chiral switch’ that is rooted in the interplay of Berry curvature, chiral anomaly and a hydrogen-mediated form of Weyl nodes.

 In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), the IL-1β pathway is upregulated, and previous studies using mouse models of founder MDS mutations demonstrated that it enhances hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells’ (HSPCs’) aberrant differentiation towards the myeloid lineage at the expense of erythropoiesis. To evaluate whether targeting the IL-1β signaling pathway can rescue ineffective erythropoiesis in patients with MDS, we designed a phase 2 non-randomized single-arm clinical trial (NCT04239157) to assess the safety profile and efficacy of the IL-1β inhibitor canakinumab in previously treated lower-risk MDS patients. We enrolled 25 patients with a median age of 74 years; 60% were male, 16% had lower-risk MDS, 84% had intermediate-1 risk MDS according to the International Prognostic Scoring System score, and 80% failed hypomethylating agent therapy. The study met the primary endpoint of defining the clinical activity of canakinumab, and the secondary objective of determining the safety profile, including the rate of transfusion independence, the duration of response, progression-free survival, leukemia-free survival, and overall survival. The overall response rate was 17.4%, with all responses including hematological improvement. Sequential post-hoc prospective single-cell RNA sequencing analyses of HSPCs and bone marrow mononuclear cells at different time points during therapy showed that canakinumab’s on-target effects in hematopoietic populations expressing the IL-1β receptor decreased the TNF-mediated inflammatory signaling pathway but rescued ineffective erythropoiesis only in the context of lower genetic complexity. This study demonstrates that better stratification strategies could target lower-risk MDS patients more effectively. The IL-1β pathway is upregulated in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).

 A critical step in tackling climate change involves structural, system-level changes facilitating action. Despite their ubiquity, little is known about how internet search algorithms portray climate change, and how these portrayals impact concern and action. In a sample of 49 countries, we found that nationwide climate concern, but not nation-level climate impact, predicted the emotional arousal caused by climate change Google Image Search outputs, as rated by a naive sample (n = 383). In a follow-up experiment we randomly assigned another sample (n = 899) to receive the climate change image outputs resulting from searches conducted in countries high or low in pre-existing climate concern, and found that participants exposed to images from countries with high pre-existing concern (compared to low) became more concerned about climate change, supportive of climate policy and likely to act pro-environmentally, suggesting a cycle of climate sentiment propagation systemically facilitated by internet search algorithms.

 The widespread retreat of Svalbard glaciers has been frequently interrupted by short-lived surge advances. In the case of marine-terminating glaciers this is often expressed in the remodelling of coastal zones. Here, we analyzed the coastal zone changes in front of the recently surging Recherchebreen. The glacier advanced ca 1200 m since 2018 and suddenly stopped in June 2020 followed by the rapid formation of a delta system in front of its subglacial meltwater outlet. The delta advanced by ca 450 m with probably the fastest progradation rate ever detected in the Arctic region (ca 7 m/day). The synchroneity of the final slow-down of the glacier with the delta building indicates that this event records the release of stored water and sediments from beneath the glacier and thus provides direct evidence of drainage reorganisation at the termination of a surge. Such behaviour is likely common among Svalbard surging glaciers, but it only rarely leaves any direct geomorphic evidence.

 Volcanic heating is predicted by theory to affect the velocity of nearby glaciers. However, conclusive studies on a large scale are lacking. Here, we conduct a global comparison of the velocities of glaciers near active volcanoes (i.e. within 5 km) and those located elsewhere ( > 5 km from an active volcano). Our findings show that, when considered over an annual scale (e.g. 2017-2018) and controlling for other factors, glaciers near volcanoes flow 46% faster than those located elsewhere (based on median values). This finding strongly suggests that volcanic heating impacts glacier velocity at a global scale, and supports the idea that glacier velocity monitoring could be a valuable indirect tool to help volcano monitoring and eruption prediction, particularly where volcanic heating (and therefore subglacial melt) intensifies months or years prior to eruptions.

 Organic compounds exuded by plant roots can form organo-mineral associations through physico-chemical interactions with soil minerals but can disrupt existing organo-mineral associations by increasing their microbial decomposition and dissolution. The controls on these opposing processes are poorly understood, as are the chemical and spatial characteristics of these associations which may explain gain or loss of organic matter at the root-soil interface termed the rhizosphere. By pulse-labeling with 13C-carbon dioxide, we found that maize root exudates increased organic matter in the rhizosphere clay size fraction and decreased organic matter in the silt size fraction, and that organic matter loss was mitigated by dry conditions. Organic matter associated with rhizosphere clay particles was linked to microbial metabolism of exudates and was more spatially and chemically heterogeneous than non-rhizosphere clay particles. Our findings show that root exudates can simultaneously form and disrupt organo-mineral associations, mediated by mineral size and composition, and soil moisture.

 Plant functional traits are key drivers of ecosystem processes. However, plot-based monitoring of functional composition across both large spatial and temporal extents is a time-consuming and expensive undertaking. Airborne and satellite remote sensing platforms collect data across large spatial expanses, often repeatedly over time, raising the tantalising prospect of detection of biodiversity change over space and time through remotely sensed methods. Here, we test the degree to which in situ measurements of taxonomic and functional β-diversity, defined as pairwise dissimilarity either between sites, or between years within individual sites, is detectable in airborne hyperspectral imagery across both space and time in an alpine vascular plant community in the Front Range, Colorado, USA. Functional and taxonomic dissimilarity were significantly related to spectral dissimilarity across space, but lacked robust relationships with spectral dissimilarity over time. Biomass showed stronger relationships with spectral dissimilarity than either taxonomic or functional dissimilarity over space, but exhibited no significant associations with spectral dissimilarity over time. Comparative analyses using NDVI revealed that NDVI alone explains much of the variation explained by the full-range spectra. Our results support the use of hyperspectral data to detect fine-scale changes in vascular plant β-diversity over space, but suggest that methodological limitations still preclude the use of this technology for long-term monitoring and change detection."

 Terrestrial vegetation is a crucial component of Earth's biosphere, regulating global carbon and water cycles and contributing to human welfare. Despite an overall greening trend, terrestrial vegetation exhibits a significant inter-annual variability. The mechanisms driving this variability, particularly those related to climatic and anthropogenic factors, remain poorly understood, which hampers our ability to project the long-term sustainability of ecosystem services. Here, by leveraging diverse remote sensing measurements, we pinpointed 2020 as a historic landmark, registering as the greenest year in modern satellite records from 2001 to 2020. Using ensemble machine learning and Earth system models, we found this exceptional greening primarily stemmed from consistent growth in boreal and temperate vegetation, attributed to rising CO2 levels, climate warming, and reforestation efforts, alongside a transient tropical green-up linked to the enhanced rainfall. Contrary to expectations, the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns had a limited impact on this global greening anomaly. Our findings highlight the resilience and dynamic nature of global vegetation in response to diverse climatic and anthropogenic influences, offering valuable insights for optimizing ecosystem management and informing climate mitigation strategies."

 Hyperspectral unmixing is of vital importance within the realm of hyperspectral analysis, which is aimed to decide the fractional proportion (abundances) of fundamental spectral signatures (endmembers) at a subpixel level. Unsupervised unmixing techniques that employ autoencoder (AE) network have gained significant attention for its exceptional feature extraction capabilities. However, traditional AE-based methods lean towards focusing excessively on the information of spectral dimension in the data, resulting in limited ability to extract endmembers with meaningful physical interpretations, and achieve uncompetitive performance. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-domain dual-stream network, called MdsNet, which enhances performance by incorporating high-rank spatial information to guide the unmixing process. This approach allows us to uncover pure endmember data that is hidden within the original hyperspectral image (HSI). We first apply superpixel segmentation and smoothing operations as preprocessing steps to transform the HSI into a coarse domain. Then, MdsNet efficiently handles multi-domain data and employs attention generated from the approximate domain to learn meaningful information about the endmembers’ physical characteristic. Experimental results and ablation studies conducted on Synthetic and real datasets (Samson, Japser, Urban) outperform state-of-the-art techniques by more than 10% in terms of root mean squared error and spectral angle distance, illustrating the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.

 The Mongolian Plateau hosts one of the world's most fragile ecosystems, characterized by high volatility and frequent natural disasters due to rapid climate change and human activities in recent decades. Frequent dust storms notably mark spring in this region. Through observational analysis and numerical modeling, this study investigates the impacts of comprehensive ocean and land processes—including sea surface temperature (SST) in the North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as well as Eurasian land conditions—on the interannual fluctuations of spring precipitation in the Mongolian Plateau (SPMP) from 1979 to 2020. The ocean-land processes involve: a tripole pattern of North Atlantic SST anomalies triggers an eastward-propagating continental-scale wave train; Increased snow cover in Central Asia induces significant anomalous low pressure through the albedo effect; El Niño-Southern Oscillation initiate a teleconnection pattern over the upstream region of the Indian-western Pacific Ocean. These anomalous ocean and land conditions interact with large-scale atmospheric circulations, altering dynamical and hydrological conditions around the Mongolian Plateau, thereby contributing to SPMP variation. Further corroboration from numerical model experiments supports the observational analysis results. The combined effects of multiple ocean-land factors effectively explain precipitation variability across extensive areas of the Mongolian Plateau. A regression model constructed using these land-ocean factors captures the time evolution of the SPMP well."

 Winter temperatures in the North America (NA) exhibit evident intraseasonal variation, which has become more pronounced under global climate change. In particular, the wintertime relationship between NA temperatures and long-lasting positive sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) in the Northeast Pacific (NEP), known as warm blobs, has been hotly debated in recent years. However, their relationship on intraseasonal timescales remains unclear. Using reanalysis data and an Atmospheric General Circulation Model, this study reveals that the intraseasonal variation of atmospheric circulation is the primary factor to induce intraseasonal temperature anomalies in NA after classifying warm SSTA events based on their different evolutions. Moreover, the atmospheric circulation anomalies over the mid-to-high-latitude regions are in part contributed by the feedback of NEP warm SSTAs to the atmosphere. Specifically, for early-winter warm SSTA events (peaking in November), there are two intraseasonal reversals in geopotential height anomalies over the NEP and NA, corresponding to a “cold-warm-cold” temperature change in NA. However, for mid-winter warm SSTA events (peaking in January), the atmospheric circulation pattern is relatively stable, mainly characterized by a “west high-east low” dipole, associated with persistent cold anomalies in NA. Then, the role of warm SSTAs over the NEP in the intraseasonal temperature variation is generally verified by the numerical simulations. Hence, although the NEP warm SSTAs may not be the dominant driver of the intraseasonal variations of winter NA temperatures, we emphasize the implication of their evolutionary differences in reflecting the NA temperature variations, which contributes to better predictability."

 The frequency and duration of heatwaves are rapidly increasing worldwide under the background of global warming. This trend is also observed in the mid–lower reaches of the Yangtze River valley (MLYRV), raising great public concern due to its significant impacts. This study identifies a wave train involving the positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Ural blocking (UB), and an anticyclone over the MLYRV, which is closely linked to MLYRV heatwaves during 1970–2023. Our findings indicate that the development of the anticyclone over the MLYRV is associated with the energy dispersion of the UB under the regulation of the North Atlantic jet (NAJ). Further analyses reveal that the correlation of heatwave frequency with the NAO index and UB days is significantly stronger during 2001–2023 (P2) compared to 1970–2000 (P1). This strengthening may be attributable to the northeastward extension of the NAJ to northern Eurasia during P2, modulated by the positive phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). Such strong zonal winds over high latitudes of Eurasia are expected to favor low-latitude UB, and its robust downstream energy dispersion enhances the development of heatwaves during P2. In contrast, the weaker zonal winds over high latitudes of Eurasia during P1 favor high-latitude UB under the regulation of the negative phase of the AMO, and the correlation between the UB and heatwaves is less significant due to weak energy dispersion from the high-latitude UB to the MLYRV. Consequently, the UB acts as a crucial bridge within this wave train, facilitating the energy transfer necessary for heatwave formation."

 Recently, extreme precipitation has occurred frequently in the Tarim Basin, which has a fragile ecological environment, arousing widespread concern. Using daily precipitation observations from 42 stations in the Tarim Basin during the spring of 1980–2021 and monthly circulation reanalysis data from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5, as well as statistical analyses and physical diagnostic methods, this study investigated the abnormal modes and the evolution characteristics and differences in atmospheric circulation. The results show that the spring precipitation anomalies in the Tarim Basin can be divided into two independent precipitation modes: the first (EOF1) is a precipitation pattern that is uniform throughout the region and the second (EOF2) is an east–west inverse pattern. Thus, there are distinct differences in the atmospheric circulation characteristics responsible for abnormal spring precipitation modes in the basin. When the precipitation across the entire basin is consistently excessive, the 500 hPa geopotential height is affected by the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation related circulation, and anomalous negative geopotential height at 500 hPa and anomalous cyclone at 700 hPa control the entire Tarim Basin, favoring anomalous upward motion, and western and southwestern water vapor transport. This leaves the Tarim Basin with a net water vapor budget and abnormally high atmospheric precipitable water. The opposite situation occurs when the precipitation across the entire basin is consistently lower than normal. When there is a west-to-east precipitation gradient,  the western part of the Tarim Basin is affected by the anomalous cyclone while the eastern part is affected by the amomalous anticyclone, leading to the east-west discrepancy. The western region of the Tarim Basin is dominated by upward airflow, whereas the eastern region is dominated by downward airflow, providing dynamic conditions for the west-to-east precipitation gradient. Under the influence of anomalous water vapor transport from the southwest and water vapor convergence, water vapor conditions favorable for precipitation can occur. The net water vapor in the basin also exhibited an abnormal west-to-east transport pattern. Moreover, the atmospheric precipitable water demonstrated an inverse phase distribution under the EOF2 atmospheric precipitation mode in the Tarim Basin."

The crystal structure and physicochemical properties of CML18 indicate that this protein senses pH shifts. Interaction of CML18 with tonoplast exchangers NHX1 and NHX2 was favored at acidic pH, a physiological condition elicited by K+starvation in Arabidopsis roots, whereas excess K+produced cytoplasmic alkalinization and CML18 dissociation.

Here, we track the pathways and fate of these fresh water masses by initializing synthetic particles in the East Greenland Coastal Current on the Southeast Greenland shelf and running them through altimetry-derived surface currents from 1993 to 2021. We report that the majority of waters (83%) remain on the shelf around the southern tip of Greenland. Variability in the shelf-basin exchange of the remaining particles closely follows the number of tip jet wind events on seasonal and interannual timescales. The probability of a particle exiting the shelf increases almost fivefold during a tip jet event. These results indicate that the number of tip jets is a close proxy of the shelf-basin exchange around Southern Greenland."

TET2 also enforced a terminally differentiated state in the early bifurcation between TEFFand TEX, indicating broad roles for TET2 in acquisition of effector biology. To exploit the therapeutic potential of TET2, we developed clinically actionableTET2-targeted CAR T cells by disruptingTET2via knock-in of a safety switch alongside CAR knock-in at theTRAClocus.TET2-targeted CAR T cells exhibited restrained terminal exhaustion in vitro and enhanced antitumor responses in vivo.

A key question is whether the disease is caused by gain-of-function effects on INF2 or loss of function (haploinsufficiency). Despite established roles in multiple cellular processes, neither INF2 knockout mice nor mice with a disease-associated point mutation display an evident kidney or neurologic phenotype. Here, we compared responses to puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)–induced kidney injury between INF2 R218Q and INF2 knockout mice. R218Q INF2 mice are susceptible to glomerular disease, in contrast to INF2 knockout mice. Colocalization, coimmunoprecipitation analyses, and cellular actin measurements showed that INF2 R218Q confers a gain-of-function effect on the actin cytoskeleton. RNA expression analysis showed that adhesion and mitochondria-related pathways were enriched in the PAN-treated R218Q mice. Both podocytes from INF2 R218Q mice and human kidney organoids with an INF2 mutation (S186P) recapitulate adhesion and mitochondrial phenotypes.

CREB acts through a cascade of transcription factors to control expression of an atypical cadherin protein, FMI-1/Flamingo/CELSR. During postembryonic development, FMI-1 promotes and maintains synaptic connectivity of PHB to a command interneuron, AVA, in both sexes, but a serotonin-dependent transcriptional regulatory cassette antagonizes FMI-1 expression in males, thereby establishing sexually dimorphic connectivity between PHB and AVA. A critical regulatory node is the CREB-target LIN-29, a Zn finger transcription factor that integrates four layers of information: sexual specificity, past experience, time and cell-type specificity.

Recent studies have shown that the NPC may dilate and constrict, but how altering the NPC diameter affects its selective barrier properties remains unclear. Here, we build DNA nanopores with programmable diameters and nup arrangements to model the constricted and dilated NPCs. We find that Nup62 proteins form a dynamic cross-channel barrier impermeable to hepatitis B virus (HBV) capsids when grafted inside 60-nm-wide nanopores but not in 79-nm pores, where Nup62 cluster locally. Furthermore, importin-β1 substantially changes the dynamics of Nup62 assemblies and facilitates the passage of HBV capsids through the 60-nm NPC mimics containing Nup62 and Nup153.

This makes them incompatible with (sub)femtosecond temporal resolution and applications that demand the absence of labeling. Here, we introduce harmonic deactivation microscopy (HADES) for breaking the diffraction limit in nonfluorescent samples. By controlling the harmonic generation process on the quantum level with a second donut-shaped pulse, we confine the third-harmonic generation to three times below the original focus size of a scanning microscope. We demonstrate that resolution improvement by deactivation is more efficient for higher harmonic orders and only limited by the maximum applicable deactivation-pulse fluence.

Decreasing SSA in the NH middle and high latitudes can notably warm the troposphere there, thus reducing the equator-to-pole temperature gradient, increasing static stability in mid-latitude regions, and leading to the widening and weakening trends of NH HC. Further analysis of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) aerosol forcing–only simulations also supports the importance of SSA trends in perturbing NH HC through the above mechanism."

However, the task of creating these systems—which are simultaneously easy to operate, rapid in detection, and cost-effective—remains a challenge. In this study, we present a compact highly sensitive photothermal reverse transcriptase–loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) chip (SPRC) designed for the detection of multiple diseases. The nucleic acid (NA) amplification on the chip is achieved through LAMP driven by either LED illumination or simple sunlight focusing. SPRC performs sample addition and amplification within a limited volume and autonomous enrichment of NA during the sample addition process, achieving a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 0.2 copies per microliter. Through 120 clinical samples, we achieved an accuracy of 95%, with a specificity exceeding 97.5%. Overall, SPRC has achieved promising progress in the application of point-of-care testing (POCT) by using light energy to simultaneously detect multiple diseases."
10.1126/sciadv.adp6303,False,Science Advances,这篇研究论文主要关注病毒感染对心脏组织的长期适应性反应。研究人员通过分析近1000个人的心脏RNA测序数据，寻找病毒感染的证据以及宿主转录组的适应性变化。他们发现三种与炎症、NF-κB信号通路和p38-MK2通路相关的宿主转录组适应性变化，这些变化与感染病毒的类型无关，并在人类、动物心脏和培养的心肌细胞中重复出现。该研究属于病毒感染和心脏病学领域，与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等，没有任何关系。,[],Cameron D. Griffiths;Millie Shah;William Shao;Cheryl A. Borgman;Kevin A. Janes,Three modes of viral adaption by the heart,"Viruses elicit long-term adaptive responses in the tissues they infect. Understanding viral adaptions in humans is difficult in organs such as the heart, where primary infected material is not routinely collected. In search of asymptomatic infections with accompanying host adaptions, we mined for cardio-pathogenic viruses in the unaligned reads of nearly 1000 human hearts profiled by RNA sequencing. Among virus-positive cases (~20%), we identified three robust adaptions in the host transcriptome related to inflammatory nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling and posttranscriptional regulation by the p38-MK2 pathway. The adaptions are not determined by the infecting virus, and they recur in infections of human or animal hearts and cultured cardiomyocytes. Adaptions switch states when NF-κB or p38-MK2 is perturbed in cells engineered for chronic infection by the cardio-pathogenic virus, coxsackievirus B3. Stratifying viral responses into reversible adaptions adds a targetable systems-level simplification for infections of the heart and perhaps other organs."
10.1126/sciadv.adq5703,False,Science Advances,这篇论文使用生物考古学的方法研究中世纪伦敦人口的健康状况差异，特别是男性和女性之间的差异。研究者结合了两种方法来衡量“脆弱性”：一是基于风险的死亡率分析，二是累积表型分析。通过分析十个生物标志物与死亡率和生存率的关系，构建了人口特异性的脆弱性和恢复力指数，并应用于成年个体，以探讨中世纪伦敦男性和女性之间的脆弱性和恢复力差异。研究发现，在中世纪伦敦，现代社会中观察到的男女发病率-死亡率悖论可能并不存在，这可能与在这种父权制的城市环境中对男性的文化性偏好保护有关。总而言之，这是一项关于历史人口健康状况的生物考古学研究，与大气环境遥感技术没有直接关系。,[],Samantha L. Yaussy;Kathryn E. Marklein;Sharon N. DeWitte;Douglas E. Crews,Frailty or resilience? Hazard-based and cumulative phenotype approaches to discerning signals of health inequality in medieval London,"Bioarchaeology uses human skeletal remains to reconstruct varied experiences of individuals and populations in the past, including patterns of health across time periods and cultural contexts. In the past three decades, bioarchaeological studies have highlighted the concept of “frailty,” operationalizing it as increased risk of mortality or cumulative phenotypes. Using data from medieval London cemeteries, we integrate these two approaches to frailty in past populations. First, we estimate the risks of mortality and survivorship (hazard and survival analyses) associated with 10 biomarkers and use these results to construct population-specific frailty and resilience indices. Then, we apply the indices to adult individuals to explore frailty and resilience differentials between males and females in medieval London. Findings suggest that the male-female morbidity-mortality paradox observed in modern populations may not have existed in this context, which may be explained by preferential cultural buffering of men in this patriarchal, urban setting."

However, electrically switchable chiral nonlinear optics has not yet been realized because of the difficulty in electrically manipulating chiral structures. Here, we demonstrate that chiral second-harmonic generation (SHG) can be electrically induced and switched in an achiral biaxial ferroelectric 2D RPP. We observe reversible and continuous electrical switching of SHG circular dichroism and large nonlinear chiroptical activity. Polarization-resolved SHG imaging reveals that electrical poling induces the ferroelectric multidomain structure arising from the biaxial nature of the material, and the planar chirality appears. Our findings show a simple electrical control of the nonlinear chiroptical responses and establish chiral nonlinear optics based on ferroelectric 2D RPPs."

PARPi exert their cytotoxic effect by both trapping PARP1 on the damaged DNA and by restraining its enzymatic activity (PARylation). How PARP1 is recruited and trapped at the DNA damage sites and how resistance to PARPi could be overcome are still matters of investigation. Here, we described PARP1 as a substrate of the deubiquitinase USP1. At molecular level, USP1 binds PARP1 to remove its K63-linked polyubiquitination and controls PARP1 chromatin trapping and PARylation activity, regulating sensitivity to PARPi. In both Pt/PARPi-sensitive and -resistant cells, USP1/PARP1 combined blockade enhances replicative stress, DNA damage, and cell death. Our work dissected the biological interaction between USP1 and PARP1 and recommended this axis as a promising and powerful therapeutic choice for not only sensitive but also chemoresistant patients with ovarian cancer irrespective of their HR status."
10.1126/sciadv.adk6693,True,Science Advances,这篇论文研究了夏季北大西洋涛动（SNAO）与北极海冰浓度（SIC）之间的相互作用。研究者利用耦合模式比较计划第六阶段（CMIP6）的耦合和大气模式比较计划（AMIP）气候模型、动力学分析和观测数据，重点关注西伯利亚东部到加拿大北极地区（ESAC）的SIC变化对SNAO的影响。结果表明，ESAC地区的SIC变化可以通过影响大气环流，特别是罗斯贝波，对SNAO产生影响，这种影响存在几周的超前时间。然而，研究发现，仅使用AMIP模式（只模拟大气，不考虑海冰对大气的反馈）无法重现观测到的现象，这表明耦合模式对于研究这种相互作用至关重要。该研究使用了卫星观测数据和气候模型数据，与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是卫星观测和大气环流分析。,"['Arctic sea ice concentration', 'Atmospheric circulation', 'Satellite observations', 'Climate models', 'Rossby waves', 'North Atlantic Oscillation']",Chris K.

Observations suggest that SIC-SNAO relationships mainly come from the East Siberian to Arctic Canada (ESAC) region where a weak atmospheric jet stream exists in summer. Twelve CMIP6 models with the most realistic atmospheric climatologies over the North Atlantic and Europe agree well with reanalyses on relationships between SIC and Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation. CMIP6 model data indicate that ESAC SIC influences the SNAO with a lead time of several weeks. However, AMIP simulations do not reproduce the observed atmospheric circulation when observed sea ice is prescribed. Rossby wave analyses do though support observed ESAC SIC influences on the SNAO. We conclude that ESAC Arctic SIC modestly influences the SNAO, and such investigations require the use of coupled models."
