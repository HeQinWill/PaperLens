Sporre;Johan Friberg,Impact of SO2 injection profiles on simulated volcanic forcing for the 2009 Sarychev eruptions – investigating the importance of using high-vertical-resolution methods when compiling SO2 data,"We investigate the importance of using high-vertical-resolution (HR) SO2 data when simulating volcanic eruptions' impact on the stratospheric aerosol load and climate, using WACCM, and compare simulations with aerosol observations from CALIOP. Simulations with HR SO2 data match the observations well, whereas simulations with the model's default low-resolution (LR) data underestimate the aerosol load by ~ 50 %. The resulting climate cooling is twice as high for the HR than the LR SO2 data. 
 Aerosols from volcanic eruptions impact our climate by influencing the Earth's radiative balance. The degree of their climate impact is determined by the location and injection altitude of the volcanic SO2. To investigate the importance of utilizing correct injection altitudes, we ran climate simulations of the June 2009 Sarychev eruptions with three SO2 datasets in the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2), Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model Version 6 (WACCM6). We have compared simulations with WACCM6 default 1 km vertically resolved dataset M16 with our two 200 m vertically resolved datasets, S21-3D and S21-1D. S21-3D is distributed over a large area (30 latitudes and 120 longitudes), whereas S21-1D releases all SO2 in one latitude and longitude grid box, mimicking the default dataset M16.For S21-1D and S21-3D, 95 %  of the SO2 was injected into the stratosphere, whereas M16 injected only 75 % into the stratosphere. This difference is due to the different vertical distributions and resolutions of SO2 in the datasets. The larger portion of SO2 injected into the stratosphere for the S21 datasets leads to more than twice as high sulfate aerosol load in the stratosphere for the S21-3D simulation compared to the M16 simulation during more than 8 months. The temporal evolution in aerosol optical depth (AOD) from  our two simulations, S21-3D and S21-1D, follows the observations from the spaceborne lidar instrument CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) closely, while the AOD in the M16 simulation is substantially lower. This indicates that the injection altitude and vertical resolution of the injected volcanic SO2 substantially impact the model's ability to correctly simulate the climate impact from volcanic eruptions.The S21-3D dataset with its high vertical and horizontal resolution resulted in global volcanic forcing of −0.24 W m−2 during the first year after the eruptions, compared with only −0.11 W m−2 for M16.  Hence, our study highlights the importance of the vertical distribution of SO2 injections in simulations of volcanic climate impact and calls for a re-evaluation of further volcanic eruptions."

Because of food demand, NH3 emissions are projected to rise by 2100. Using a global model, we analyzed the impact of present and future NH3 emissions generated from a land model. Our results show improved ammonia patterns compared to a reference inventory. Future scenarios predict up to 70 % increase in global NH3 burden, with significant changes in radiative forcing that can greatly elevate N2O. 
 Agricultural practices are a major source of ammonia (NH3) in the atmosphere, which has implications for air quality, climate, and ecosystems. Due to the rising demand for food and feed production, ammonia emissions are expected to increase significantly by 2100 and would therefore impact atmospheric composition such as nitrate (NO3-) or sulfate (SO42-) particles and affect biodiversity from enhanced deposition. Chemistry–climate models which integrate the key atmospheric physicochemical processes with the ammonia cycle represent a useful tool to investigate present-day and also future reduced nitrogen pathways and their impact on the global scale. Ammonia sources are, however, challenging to quantify because of their dependencies on environmental variables and agricultural practices and represent a crucial input for chemistry–climate models. In this study, we use the chemistry–climate model LMDZ–INCA (Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique–INteraction with Chemistry and Aerosols) with agricultural and natural soil ammonia emissions from a global land surface model ORCHIDEE (ORganising Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic Ecosystems), together with the integrated module CAMEO (Calculation of AMmonia Emissions in ORCHIDEE), for the present-day and 2090–2100 period under two divergent Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP5-8.5 and SSP4-3.4). Future agricultural emissions under the most increased level (SSP4-3.4) have been further exploited to evaluate the impact of enhanced ammonia emissions combined with future contrasting aerosol precursor emissions (SSP1-2.6 –  low emissions; SSP3-7.0 – regionally contrasted emissions). We demonstrate that the CAMEO emission set enhances the spatial and temporal variability in the atmospheric ammonia in regions such as Africa, Latin America, and the US in comparison to the static reference inventory (Community Emissions Data System; CEDS) when assessed against satellite and surface network observations. The CAMEO simulation indicates higher ammonia emissions in Africa relative to other studies, which is corroborated by increased current levels of reduced nitrogen deposition (NHx), a finding that aligns with observations in west Africa. Future CAMEO emissions lead to an overall increase in the global NH3 burden ranging from 59 % to 235 %, while the NO3- burden increases by 57 %–114 %, depending on the scenario, even when global NOx emissions decrease. When considering the most divergent scenarios (SSP5-8.5 and SSP4-3.4) for agricultural ammonia emissions, the direct radiative forcing resulting from secondary inorganic aerosol changes ranges from −114 to −160 mW m−2. By combining a high level of NH3 emissions with decreased or contrasted future sulfate and nitrate emissions, the nitrate radiative effect can either overcompensate (net total sulfate and nitrate effect of −200 mW m−2) or be offset by the sulfate effect (net total sulfate and nitrate effect of +180mWm-2). We also show that future oxidation of NH3 could lead to an increase in N2O atmospheric sources from 0.43 to 2.10 Tg N2O yr−1 compared to the present-day levels, representing 18 % of the future N2O anthropogenic emissions. Our results suggest that accounting for nitrate aerosol precursor emission levels but also for the ammonia oxidation pathway in future studies is particularly important to understand how ammonia will affect climate, air quality, and nitrogen deposition."

The annual carbon emission flux provides a robust historical baseline for assessing terrestrial ecosystem carbon budgets at national and provincial scales, both in the present and future. 
 Long-term land-use changes have profound impact on terrestrial ecosystem and the associated carbon balance. Current estimates of China’s historical carbon emissions induced by land-use change varies widely, where in the magnitude of China for 1950–2021 exhibit great uncertainties reaching as large as 150 % in global estimates, while the national-scale estimates for a longer time period of past 300 years show a relative uncertainty of 102 %. Here, we utilized bookkeeping method to quantify China’s annual carbon budget resulting from land-use change between 1000 and 2019, driven by a millennial dataset of land-use change in China in provincial level, assisted with comprehensive soil and vegetation carbon density datasets. This approach, supported by high-confidence land-use change data, extensive soil and vegetation carbon field sampling, and an updated disturbance-response curve, enhanced the accuracy of carbon budget estimations. The results revealed that cumulative carbon emissions from land-use change in China reached 19.61 Pg C over the past millennium. Moreover, critical turning points occurred in the early 18th century and early 1980s, with emissions accelerating in the 18th century and transitioning from carbon source to carbon sink in the early 1980s. Our findings revealed values 68 %–328 % higher than previous 300-year estimates, suggesting that historical carbon emissions from land-use change in China may have been significantly underestimated. This study provides a robust historical baseline for assessing terrestrial ecosystem carbon budgets at national and provincial scales, both in the present and future.

Traditional models use parameters that are often poorly defined. The new approach uses machine learning to fine-tune these parameters by comparing simulated ice drift with satellite data. The method identifies optimal settings for the model by analysing patterns in ice deformation. This results in more accurate simulations of sea ice drift forecasting. 
 We developed a new method for tuning sea ice rheology parameters, which consists of two components: a new metric for characterising sea ice deformation patterns and a machine learning (ML)-based approach for tuning rheology parameters. We applied the new method to tune the brittle Bingham–Maxwell rheology (BBM) parameterisation, which was implemented and used in the next-generation sea ice model (neXtSIM). As a reference dataset, we used sea ice drift and deformation observations from the RADARSAT Geophysical Processing System (RGPS).The metric characterises a field of sea ice deformation with a vector of values. It includes well-established descriptors such as the mean and standard deviation of deformation, the structure–function of the spatial scaling analysis, and the density and intersection of linear kinematic features (LKFs). We added more descriptors to the metric that characterises the pattern of ice deformation, including image anisotropy and Haralick texture features. The developed metric can describe ice deformation from any model or satellite platform.In the parameter tuning method, we first run an ensemble of neXtSIM members with perturbed rheology parameters and then train a machine learning model using the simulated data. We provide the descriptors of ice deformation as input to the ML model and rheology parameters as targets. We apply the trained ML model to the descriptors computed from RGPS observations. The developed ML-based method is generic and can be used to tune the parameters of any model.We ran experiments with tens of members and found optimal values for four neXtSIM BBM parameters: scaling parameter for compressive strength (P0≈5.1 kPa), cohesion at the reference scale (cref≈1.2 MPa), internal friction angle tangent (μ≈0.7) and ice–atmosphere drag coefficient (CA≈0.00228). A neXtSIM run with the optimal parameterisation produces maps of sea ice deformation visually indistinguishable from RGPS observations. These parameters exhibit weak interannual drift related to changes in sea ice thickness and corresponding changes in ice deformation patterns."

Here, we reported high-resolution (2 h interval) measurements of NO2 isotopic compositions in a megacity in Central China. Δ17O(NO2) exhibited a clear diurnal cycle with elevated values during the day versus night. Daytime Δ17O(NO2) varying from 20.2 to 40.1‰ can be explained by variations in ozone (O3) versus peroxyl radical oxidation of nitric oxide (NO). The estimated peroxyl radicals were positively correlated with photochemical oxidants (Ox = O3 + NO2), revealing the ability of Δ17O(NO2) to reflect changes in the atmospheric oxidation environment. Nighttime Δ17O(NO2) variations (12.9 to 29.8‰) can be categorized into three regimes: the first regime when Δ17O(NO2) stabilized at approximately 20‰ can be well explained by Δ17O transfer from O3; the increases of Δ17O(NO2) above 20‰ were attributed to the vertical mixing of residual layer air with elevated Δ17O(NO2) and the exchange process between NO2 and dinitrogen pentoxide; and as low as 12.9‰ Δ17O(NO2) can be explained by primary NO2 emissions and the exchange process between NO and NO2. The NO–NO2 exchange also elevated δ15N(NO2), consistent with the observed negative relationships between Δ17O(NO2) and δ15N(NO2) at night."

However, the high persistence, toxicity, and bioaccumulation potential of PFAS have led to rising public concerns and stringent regulations, especially after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) announced legally enforceable maximum contamination levels for six PFAS species in April 2024. In this paper, we provide our perspective that the use of PFAS can be avoided in the fabrication of textured omniphobic and superomniphobic surfaces, which display high wetting resistance against not only high surface tension liquids but also more importantly low surface tension liquids. We first discuss the role of PFAS in the design of conventional wetting-resistant surfaces. We then discuss the state-of-the-art strategies for creating PFAS-free textured omniphobic and superomniphobic surfaces with high wetting resistance while elucidating the underlying mechanism. Further, we emphasize that PFAS are indeed not always needed for textured surfaces with a sufficiently high wetting resistance in specific environmental applications such as desalination and wastewater treatment. We envision that this paper will motivate the scientific community to rethink and revolutionize the design framework toward more sustainable wetting-resistant surfaces, thereby circumventing the use of PFAS and the consequent health and environmental risks."

However, limited knowledge of emerging OPCs beyond organophosphate esters (OPEs) hinders a thorough understanding of the environmental occurrence and exposure risks. Through target, suspect, and nontarget screening analysis, 64 OPCs were successfully identified in Chinese estuarine waters, including 24 known OPEs and 40 emerging analogues (i.e., quaternary phosphonium, phosphine oxide, organophosphonate, and organothiophosphate esters). Domestic wastewater and agricultural and industrial discharges were factors influencing the OPC distribution patterns. In particular, quaternary phosphoniums and phosphine oxides accounted for over 50% of the total OPC loading in the Yellow and Jia Rivers, which were likely polluted by phosphorus-related industries. Risk quotient (RQ) calculations showed that tetrabutylphosphonium contributed the most to algae toxicity due to the biocidal effects of onium salts, while chloroalkyl OPEs dominated the ecological risks for daphnia and fish. The multicriteria decision analysis approach was further introduced for relative chemical ranking by considering the variations in hazard criteria of environmental occurrence, fate, and toxicity of the OPCs. The results indicate that aryl phosphoniums and aryl phosphine oxides have a hazard priority similar to that of the OPEs and, therefore, require more attention."

However, whether anammox bacteria could directly use and how to uptake Fe(III) have been long-time ignored. Here, we found that micrometer-scale magnetite with the size of 10–20 μm significantly promoted the anammox bacterial activity by iron core and iron uptake. Anammox bacteria cannot utilize Fe(III) directly as they are unable to secrete siderophore for the extracellular Fe(III) transfer to intracellular. In anaerobic anammox consortia at the presence of magnetite, siderophore synthesis bacteria belonging to Alphaproteobacteria, Candidate phylum, and Chloroflexi secreted abundant siderophores, which combined with Fe(III) ionized from magnetite to form siderophore-Fe(III) complexes. These complexes were then used by anammox bacteria via a specific outer membrane receptor and transported by the transporter protein to the periplasm, further releasing Fe(III). Cytochrome c was then formed by the siderophore-Fe(III) complex reduction, for assimilation and synthesis of Fe–S protein and heme B in anammox bacteria to increase electron transfer capability.

However, the impact of clay minerals on the transformation of ferrihydrite under anoxic conditions remains elusive. This study systematically investigated the effect of distinct clay minerals on the Fe(II)-catalyzed transformation of ferrihydrite and clarifying the underlying nanoscale mechanisms for the first time. Our results demonstrated that clay minerals could affect the production and recrystallization of labile Fe(III) (an active Fe(III) intermediate species formed by oxidation of Fe(II) at the ferrihydrite surface) by dispersing ferrihydrite aggregates. This modulation led to different transformation rates, higher crystallinity of formed lepidocrocite, and enhanced goethite formation in the heteroaggregates. Importantly, montmorillonite can accommodate Fe(II) and labile Fe(III) within its interlayer spaces, which further led to the inhibited crystallization of Fe(II) to magnetite and long-term preservation of labile Fe(III). Additionally, clay minerals served as templates for forming dendritic goethite and hexagonal magnetite nanoplates.

Through a community-engaged sampling effort, we collected 244 groundwater samples and measured major/trace element concentrations. Long-term land subsidence and depth-resolved sediment texture were computed at the same locations. We tested three plausible geochemical processes responsible for As release: (1) overpumping-induced dewatering of As-bearing clays (proxied by land subsidence), (2) pH-promoted desorption as well as reductive dissolution of As(V)/Fe(III) (hydr)oxides, and (3) incursion of higher-As geothermal fluids (proxied by lithium, boron, tungsten, and molybdenum) into groundwater. We find that statistics, statistical/machine learning, and aqueous thermodynamics all agree that geothermal fluid mixing within the aquifer is the main source of dissolved As. Our findings suggest that overpumping draws higher-As thermal fluid from the bottom of the aquifer to pumping depth, leading to increased concentrations of As in drinking/irrigation water supplies at wells."

We performed an experimental study of mixing and settling dynamics of slurry electrodes within an electrochemical flow cell during continuous operations. The electrochemical cell consisted of two horizontal co-flowing channels, separated by a cation-exchange membrane (CEM). We used high-speed optical imaging of planes parallel to gravity and simultaneous electrochemical measurements. At low flow rates, dense yet dynamic particle beds formed on the bottom electrode in each channel, which unexpectedly yielded the highest currents. This approach enables the operation of the flow cell at low system-average particle concentrations while leveraging gravity-driven particle settling to locally enhance carbon concentrations precisely at the current collector sites. Conversely, high flow rates were characterized by thin particle beds and well-mixed particle flows. In the latter case, the electrodes in closest proximity (located on either side of the CEM) achieved a current higher than the other electrode pairs.

The study further clarified that fatty acids generated the fragment ion [C4H5O2]− (85.0296 Da), which overlapped with the [CF3O]− (84.9907 Da) ion of PFECA compounds under low-resolution conditions, causing signal interference. Analysis of river water and fish samples revealed that this interference  led to a 24-fold overestimation of PFO4DA bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms. These findings are essential for improving the selectivity of environmental exposure assessments for PFECA compounds."

Romanias,Real-World Asphalt Pavement Emissions: Combining Simulation Chamber Measurements and City Scale Modeling to Elucidate the Impacts on Air Quality,"In this paper, the role of asphalt pavement emissions in urban air quality was assessed combining laboratory experiments and city-scale air-quality modeling. In particular, the emission factors (EFs) of volatile and intermediate volatility organic compounds (VOCs and IVOCs) of asphalt pavements were determined in an atmospheric simulation chamber. Relative humidity (RH) and simulated solar light UV-A radiation were found to play a key role in the emission of VOCs and IVOCs. RH significantly increased  the EFs, and predominantly those of oxygenated VOCs, due to changes in the microphysical properties of the materials. Under UV-A radiation, EFs were enhanced, due to the photochemical process induced on the asphalt–air interface. IVOCs were found to account for up to 30% of the Total EFs measured. Considering Paris as a case study, asphalt emissions in air-quality simulations lead to an increase in organic aerosol concentrations of at least 3%, during average summer daytime conditions. We estimate this impact significantly higher, in case all the IVOCs emissions are included in the model. This highlights the significant influence of solar radiation on emissions from old asphalt when exposed to UV radiation and the impact on air quality during the summer."

However, a lack of efficient means and incomplete monitoring data are the main obstacles impeding soil pollution management and prevention in China. Moreover, it is rare to examine the possibility and reliability of using  field-collected earthworms to assess the pollution degree of soil heavy metals in real-world situations at a large field scale. In this study, we investigate the potential use of field-collected earthworms as bio-indicators to assess the pollution characteristics and risks of heavy metals (Zn, Pb, Cu, As, Cd, and Cr) across three typical regions (Xiaokeng Reservoir, Dabaoshan Mine, and Smelter/Steel Plants) in Shaoguan, one of six trial zones identified for the Soil Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan in China. Our results unveil the existence of significant differences in the spatial distribution and bioavailability of heavy metals in soils and earthworms across these regions. The average contents of Zn, Pb, Cu, As, Cr, and Cd in soils were 329.7 ± 476.5, 180.9 ± 262.4, 82.9 ± 197.8, 66.6 ± 61.6, 53.3 ± 53.6, and 7.2 ± 8.2 mg/kg, while those in earthworms were 113.6 ± 112.1, 99.4 ± 106.8, 90.0 ± 126.9, 24.7 ± 30.8, 8.8 ± 9.4, and 5.1 ± 3.4 mg/kg, respectively. The internal exposure dose of heavy metals in earthworms is found to more accurately reflect their bioavailability under true environmental conditions than the external exposure dose in soils. The bioaccumulation factor (BAF) exhibited the highest values for Cd (0.01–24.40), followed by those for Pb (0.06–9.94), Cu (0.12–5.23), Cr (0.02–1.90), As (0.02–1.18), and Zn (0.06–1.17). Further principal component analysis (PCA) and random forest (RF) classification ascertain that earthworms are more capable of differentiating heavy metal pollution in different regions than soil alone. Compared to the routine analysis of the total heavy metal content in soils, our novel strategy demonstrates the superiority of employing field-collected earthworms as bio-indicators for monitoring heavy metal pollution and discriminating potential sources of soil pollution in a real scenario."

This study examines the association between temperature and suicide in Thailand’s tropical climate, focusing on Chiang Mai and Bangkok provinces, and quantifies the attributable burden. Daily suicide and meteorological data from 2002 to 2021 were analyzed using a time-stratified case-crossover approach with a distributed lag nonlinear model, adjusted for relative humidity. Province-specific estimates were pooled through a multivariate meta-regression model. The study found a positive, mostly linear association between temperature and suicide risk, with a relative risk (RR) of 1.70 (95% CI: 1.35, 2.15) across the temperature range. Approximately 24.61% of suicides were attributable to temperature, with 12.05% due to hot temperatures above the 66th percentile. The pooled attributable fractions were higher in the 0–64 age group compared to those aged ≥65, while differences between sexes were not statistically significant. This study highlights the significant association between higher ambient temperatures and increased suicide risks in Thailand, emphasizing the need to integrate climate considerations into mental health and suicide prevention policies.

Results showed El Niño reduced CH4 emission anomalies, whereas La Niña increased them. Both ENSO and IOD phases greatly altered climatic variables, which in turn affected CH4 emission anomalies. The global mean sensitivities of CH4 emission anomalies to ENSO and IOD were −0.17 and −0.08 mg CH4 m−2 month−1, respectively, which exhibited pronounced temporal and spatial variability, mainly driven by soil moisture and temperature. This study underscored the pronounced temporal and spatial variability of CH4 emission anomalies under ENSO and IOD phases, which would improve the accuracy of predictive CH4 models and inform strategies for mitigating climate change."

 The discovery of bilayer nickelate superconductors under high pressure has opened a new chapter in high-transition temperature (high-TC) superconductivity1-8. However, the high-pressure condition and presence of impurity phases have hindered comprehensive investigations into their superconducting properties and potential applications. Here, we report ambient-pressure superconductivity onset above the McMillan limit (40 K) in bilayer nickelate epitaxial thin films. Three-unit-cell (3UC) thick La2.85Pr0.15Ni2O7 pure-phase single-crystal films are grown using the gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy (GOALL-Epitaxy) on SrLaAlO4 substrates9. Resistivity measurements and magnetic-field responses indicate onset TC = 45 K. The transition to zero resistance exhibits characteristics consistent with a Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless (BKT)-like behavior, with TBKT = 9 K. Meissner diamagnetic effect is observed at TM = 8 K via a mutual inductance setup, in agreement with the BKT-like transition. In-plane and out-of-plane critical magnetic fields exhibit anisotropy. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images and X-ray reciprocal space mappings (RSMs) reveal that the bilayer nickelate films adopt a tetragonal phase under ~2% coherent epitaxial compressive strain in the NiO2 planes relative to the bulk. Our findings pave the way for comprehensive investigations of nickelate superconductors under ambient pressure conditions and for exploring superconductivity at higher transition temperature through strain engineering in heterostructures."

 The peripheral nervous system (PNS) orchestrates organ function in health and disease. Most cancers including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are infiltrated by PNS neurons, contributing to the complex tumor microenvironment (TME)1,2. However, neuronal cell bodies reside in various PNS ganglia, far from the tumor mass. Thus, cancer or healthy organ-innervating neurons elude current tissue sequencing datasets. To molecularly characterize pancreas- and PDAC-innervating neurons at single cell resolution, we developed “Trace-n-seq”. This method employs retrograde tracing of axons from tissues to their respective ganglia followed by single-cell isolation and transcriptomic analysis. By characterizing >5.000 individual sympathetic and sensory neurons with about 4.000 innervating PDAC or healthy pancreas we reveal novel neuronal cell types and unique molecular networks distinct to pancreas, pancreatitis, PDAC, or melanoma metastasis. We integrate single-cell datasets of innervating neurons and the TME to establish a neuro-cancer-microenvironment interactome, delineate cancer-driven neuronal reprogramming and generate a pancreatic cancer-nerve signature. Pharmacological denervation induces a proinflammatory TME and increases immune-checkpoint inhibitor effectiveness. Nab-Paclitaxel causes intra-tumor neuropathy which attenuated PDAC growth and in combination with sympathetic denervation results in synergistic tumor regression. Our multi-dimensional data reveal new insights into the networks and functions of PDAC-innervating neurons, supporting inclusion of denervation in future therapies."

 Reactive organic carbon species are important fuel for atmospheric chemical reactions, including the formation of secondary organic aerosol. However, in parallel to atmospheric oxidation processes, deposition can remove compounds from the atmosphere and impact downstream environments. To understand the impact of deposition on atmospheric oxidation, we present a framework for predicting and visualizing the fate of a molecule on the basis of the physicochemical properties of compounds (Henry’s law constant, vapour pressure and reaction rate constants), which are used to estimate timescales for oxidation and deposition. By implementing our deposition rates in chemical models, we show that deposition substantially suppresses atmospheric reactivity and aerosol formation by removing early-generation products and preventing the formation of large fractions (up to 90%) of downstream, late-generation compounds. Deposition is frequently missing in the laboratory experiments and detailed chemical modelling, which probably biases our understanding of atmospheric composition.

 The effectiveness of the hepatitis E vaccine in high-risk groups, such as chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, remains understudied. A key clinical manifestation of CHB is the persistent positivity of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). We conducted a test-negative design study involving 2,926 HBsAg-positive individuals (born 1941–1991; median age 49.0; male-to-female ratio of 1.4), identified through a hepatitis surveillance system, as part of the phase 3 trial (NCT01014845) of the recombinant hepatitis E vaccine HEV 239 (Hecolin). This system monitored suspected hepatitis cases and performed diagnoses across 11 townships in Dongtai, Jiangsu, China, from 2007 to 2017. Vaccine effectiveness of HEV 239 was assessed by comparing vaccination status between confirmed 96 hepatitis E cases and 2830 test-negative controls, using logistic regression adjusted for sex and age. We found that HEV 239 vaccination was associated with a reduced risk of hepatitis E among HBsAg-positive individuals, with an estimated effectiveness of 72.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 11.2–91.2], and 81.5% (95% CI 35.9–94.6) among phase 3 trial participants.

Moreover, cathepsin B activity is inhibited by monomeric CST3 but activated by dimeric CST3. 
 Acute pancreatitis (AP) is characterised by self-digestion of the pancreas by its own proteases. This pathophysiological initiating event in AP occurs inside pancreatic acinar cells where intrapancreatic trypsinogen becomes prematurely activated by cathepsin B (CTSB), and induces the digestive protease cascade, while cathepsin L (CTSL) degrades trypsin and trypsinogen and therefore prevents the development of AP. These proteases are located in the secretory compartment of acinar cells together with cystatin C (CST3), an endogenous inhibitor of CTSB and CTSL. The results are based on detailed biochemical analysis, site-directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations in combination with an experimental disease model of AP using CST3 deficient mice. This identifies that CST3 is a critical regulator of CTSB and CTSL activity during AP. CST3 deficient mice show a higher intracellular CTSB activity resulting in elevated trypsinogen activation accompanied by an increased disease severity. This reveals that CST3 can be cleaved by trypsin disabling the inhibition of CTSB, but not of CTSL. Furthermore, dimerised CST3 enhances the CTSB activity by binding to an allosteric pocket specific to the CTSB structure. CST3 shifts from an inhibitor to an activator of CTSB and therefore fuels the intrapancreatic protease cascade during the onset of AP. Here, the authors show that cystatin C (CST3) regulates the activity of cathepsin B during pancreatitis in a pH dependent manner.

 The observation of a superconducting phase, an intertwined insulating phase, and a continuous transition between the two at a commensurate filling of ν = 1 in bilayers of twisted WSe2 at θ = 3.650 raises a number of intriguing questions about the origin of this phenomenology. Here we report the possibility of a displacement-field induced continuous transition between a superconductor and a quantum spin-liquid Mott insulator at ν = 1, starting with a simplified three-orbital model of twisted WSe2, including on-site, nearest-neighbor density-density interactions, and a chiral-exchange interaction, respectively. By employing parton mean-field theory, we discuss the nature of these correlated insulators, their expected evolution with the displacement-field, and their phenomenological properties.

 Diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction (DACD) is increasingly recognized as a critical complication of diabetes. The complex pathology of DACD remains unknown. Here, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to demonstrate unique cellular and molecular patterns of the hippocampus from a mouse model of diabetes. More in-depth analysis of oligodendrocytes (OLs) distinguished five subclusters, indicating different functional states of OLs and transcriptional changes in each subcluster. Based on the results of snRNA-seq and experiments in vivo, we observed demyelination and disharmony of oligodendroglial lineage cell composition in male diabetic mice. Serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) expression was significantly increased in the hippocampus OLs of male diabetic mice, and SGK1 knockdown in hippocampus reversed demyelination and DACD via N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1)-mediated pathway. The findings illustrated a transcriptional landscape of hippocampal OLs and substantiated impaired myelination in DACD. Our results provided direct evidence that inhibition of SGK1 or the promotion of myelination might be a potential therapeutic strategy for DACD.

Raphael,Resolving discrepancies between chimeric and multiplicative measures of higher-order epistasis,"Epistasis can be quantified using the chimeric formula, which mixes additive and multiplicative scales. Here, the authors show that this formula does not appropriately quantify higher-order epistasis. 
 Epistasis - the interaction between alleles at different genetic loci - plays a fundamental role in biology. However, several recent approaches quantify epistasis using a chimeric formula that measures deviations from a multiplicative fitness model on an additive scale, thus mixing two scales. Here, we show that for pairwise interactions, the chimeric formula yields a different magnitude but the same sign of epistasis compared to the multiplicative formula that measures both fitness and deviations on a multiplicative scale. However, for higher-order interactions, we show that the chimeric formula can have both different magnitude and sign compared to the multiplicative formula. We resolve these inconsistencies by deriving mathematical relationships between the different epistasis formulae and different parametrizations of the multivariate Bernoulli distribution. We argue that the chimeric formula does not appropriately model interactions between the Bernoulli random variables. In simulations, we show that the chimeric formula is less accurate than the classical multiplicative/additive epistasis formulae and may falsely detect higher-order epistasis. Analyzing multi-gene knockouts in yeast, multi-way drug interactions in E. coli, and deep mutational scanning of several proteins, we find that approximately 10% to 60% of inferred higher-order interactions change sign using the multiplicative/additive formula compared to the chimeric formula. Epistasis can be quantified using the chimeric formula, which mixes additive and multiplicative scales.

 Deciphering the driving forces behind spatial heterogeneity of regional hydroclimate changes is significant for developing strategies for water management. This study presents speleothem δ18O, δ13C and Mg/Ca records spanning the last deglaciation from Yingpan Cave, northeastern Yunnan in southwestern China. Speleothem δ13C and Mg/Ca indicate a gradual drying trend in northeastern Yunnan, aligning well with the variations in central China but contrasting with those of central-southern Yunnan. We propose that a decreased zonal sea surface temperature (SST) gradient in tropical Pacific (El Niño-like) shifted the West Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) southwestward, leading to wetter conditions in northeastern Yunnan. Meanwhile, decreased precipitation in central-southern Yunnan was driven by weakened Indian summer monsoon rainfall associated with El Niño-like conditions, creating a dipolar hydrological pattern in Southwest China.

 InSAR and optical pixel offset tracking (POT) are two efficient tools for monitoring landslide displacements, but limitations in resolving 3D displacements constrain the full exploration of kinematic behaviors, especially for complex landslides exhibiting diverse movement types. In this study, we propose a technical route that combines SAR and optical images to reveal the spatiotemporal evolution of the Lanuza landslide (Spain). In the temporal domain, ascending and descending Sentinel-1 SAR images were acquired to retrieve the line-of-sight (LOS) displacements. STL and cross wavelet transform were integrated to calculate the time lag between displacements and environmental factors. In the spatial domain, a two-stage method combining feature point matching and DeepFlow (FPM-DF) was proposed to retrieve the non-rigid horizontal displacements from optical images. A strain model and Bayesian inversion framework (SM-BIF) were integrated to invert 3D displacement fields. The mass conservation method was subsequently applied to estimate the landslide thickness. The results indicate that (1) the periodic terms of displacement are in phase with the freeze-thaw cycle of solifluction, which can intensify earthflow movement. (2) FPM-DF method is more efficient than the traditional POT method, especially for small-scale displacement fields, achieving reductions of standard deviations by 38 % and 51 % in the EW and NS directions, respectively. (3) the SM-BIF method reduces the maximum standard deviations of the 3D displacement field compared to the SM-VCE method, and the maximum thickness of the earthflow is approximately 22 m.

 This study introduces a method for optimizing flight modes using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology, aiming for the efficient and accurate estimation of crop phenotypes in wide-narrow row planting patterns, for cotton. It proposes specialized flight plans that take into account the unique growth stages of cotton and recommends the s-along flight path, which is derived from a detailed analysis of the cross flight path, to facilitate effective and precise data collection. A comprehensive phenotypic index, labeled as ‘P', and a fitting function are developed to describe the relationship between flight parameters, paths, and digital elevation model (DEM) data. The study also introduces two flight strategies, one focusing on accuracy and the other on efficiency, utilizing a sophisticated multi-objective optimization method. Comparative analyses show that the s-along flight path significantly improves efficiency without sacrificing accuracy, compared to traditional cross flight path techniques. The use of high-precision prior DEM data greatly enhances the precision in estimating critical phenotypic parameters such as plant height (PH) and leaf area index (LAI), especially during key stages of canopy growth. By carefully adjusting flight height, speed, and overlap during different growth stages, an ideal balance is achieved between the precision and efficiency of data collection. These strategies markedly increase the accuracy of estimating phenotypic features (P > 0.75) and efficiency (by 42 %–44 %). This research highlights the potential of these approaches in facilitating large-scale phenotypic data collection for precision agriculture, demonstrating their ability to simultaneously improve data quality and operational efficiency. Future research will aim to expand the applicability and robustness of these methods across various planting conditions and crops, further enhancing essential tools for the advancement of precision agriculture practices and development."

 In recent years, the precise identification of an insect pest infestation has become increasingly critical for effective management in agricultural fields. This research addresses the imperative need for an advanced and integrated approach to mapping insect pest infestation in agricultural crops, utilising unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), multispectral (MS) imagery, and deep learning (DL). The existing literature reveals a limited number of studies that harness the potential of UAV-based MS imagery in conjunction with DL models for mapping and managing insect pest infestations. The primary aim is to enhance the precision and efficiency of insect pest infestation mapping through the synergistic analysis of spectral bands, vegetation indices (VIs), and textural features using DL techniques. The aerial imagery and ground truth information were collected in crop field for mapping of insect pest infestation. The investigation comprised three specific analyses; first is about establishing correlations between insect pest pupal count versus spectral bands and VIs. Second, the performance comparison of three DL models including U-Net, DeepLabV3+, Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) to segment three classes including insect pest infestation patches, other vegetation (weeds), and crops. Finally, the third analysis evaluated the efficacy of textural features against spectral features in mapping an insect pest infestation using DL techniques. The results indicate that, concerning the correlation between pupal count in the field and spectral bands or VIs, the Simple Ratio Index (SRI), and Red Edge Chlorophyll Index (RECI) demonstrated a positive correlation of 0.7, whereas the Green Chlorophyll Index (GCI) displayed a positive correlation of 0.6. Another key finding shows that spectral features outperformed textural features across all DL models for insect pest infestation segmentation. The research highlights the effectiveness of spectral features, particularly with the FCN model, which demonstrated best performance metrics for insect pest segmentation in the study field. The FCN model achieved scores with a precision (P) of 93%, recall (R) of 97%, F1-score (F1) of 95%, and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 90%, underscoring its excellence in accurately identifying and delineating pest infestations in the field. The proposed methodology and its findings offer implications such as enhanced pest surveillance, timely intervention, precision pest management, and optimised resource allocation that can be extended to optimise insect pest infestation mapping in various crop lands, enabling precise control strategies aimed at enhancing crop yield."

 Climate change and recurrent extreme climatic events have intensified the vulnerability of water-stressed regions like Tunisia to droughts, severely impact agriculture, the economy, and society. This study analyzes hydro-meteorological drought patterns using the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite-derived Groundwater Drought Index (GGDI), alongside traditional indices, including Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), and Standardized Runoff Index (SRI). A stochastic analysis of monthly SPEI-GGDI values was conducted using a first-order Markov chain model, to investigate regional drought hazards formation, persistence, and evolution. Pearson’s correlation coefficient and wavelet coherence were applied to evaluate interactions among indices and their teleconnections with large-scale climate patterns. Results reveal persistent droughts, with extreme events exhibiting high stability and low recovery probabilities. The most severe groundwater drought occurred in 2014–2015, averaging a GGDI value of −1.36, while 2002–2003 was the driest based on SPEI, SPI, and SRI, averaging −1.9.

 During the month of September, biomass burning activities peak in the southern part of Southeast Asia or the Maritime Continent. The emission and longevity of aerosols in the atmosphere depend on the rainfall, which in turn is largely dependent on the phase of El Niño–Southern Oscillation over this region. The results of a set of cloud-resolving simulations by a meteorology-chemistry model reveal that the large amount of fire aerosol particles emitted in this area acted to enhance the rainfall in September 2009, an otherwise dry El-Niño month. This enhancement was found to stem from increased ice and snow mass, likely due to reduced fallout of cloud water mass earlier in the development stage. This finding is in agreement with our previous finding from another El Niño year of 2015, indicating the microphysical effects of those fire particles slightly mitigating the dry conditions over the area in these El Niño years. The magnitude of the rain enhancement was larger for September of 2015 when the stronger El Niño led to a drier condition than September of 2009. Especially over land where the aerosol effect was most pronounced, the percentage increase of rainfall in 2015 was twice as large as that in 2009. Given the comparable aerosol optical depths between the two years in our simulations, we attribute the difference in the aerosol effect in 2009 and 2015 to the mid- and upper-tropospheric dryness that may or may not leave room for the convective invigoration by aerosols."
