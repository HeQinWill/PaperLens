 Aerosols and clouds play essential roles in the global climate system, and aerosol–cloud interactions have a significant impact on the radiation balance, water cycle, and energy cycle of the Earth–atmosphere system. To understand the effect of aerosols on the vertical distribution of stratocumulus microphysical quantities in southwest China, we analyzed data from nine aircraft observations over Guangxi from 10 October to 3 November 2020. This analysis focused on the daylight variation characteristics and formation mechanisms of stratocumulus microphysical profiles, considering the influence of aerosol number concentration in relation to the source of air mass and individual cases. Aerosol number concentration (Na) and cloud droplet concentration (Nc) decreased gradually with an altitude increase below 1500 m and did not change with a height between 1500 and 3300 m. The temperature inversion layer at the top of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) hindered the increase in the cloud droplet particle size. The lower layer of the stratocumulus cloud in Guangxi mainly contained small-sized cloud droplets (effective diameter of a cloud droplet (Ed) < 15 µm), and the middle and upper layers of cloud droplets were large-particle-size cloud droplets (Ed > 20 µm). The vertical distribution of cloud microphysical quantity had apparent daylight variation. When aerosols in the PBL were transported to the upper air (14:00 to 20:00 Beijing time, BJT), Nc in the lower layer decreased, and the small-particle-size cloud droplets (Ed < 20 µm) in the middle layer and upper layer increased. Aerosols from the free atmosphere were transported into the PBL (10:00 to 13:00 BJT), providing an abundance of cloud condensation nuclei, which increased the number of small-particle-size cloud droplets in the lower layer of the cloud (near the top of the PBL). The characteristics of cloud microphysical quantities (Nc and Ed) were also affected by the source of air mass and the height of the PBL. Na and Nc were high under the influence of land air mass or aerosols within the PBL, and the cloud droplet number concentration spectrum was unimodal. Na and Nc were low under the influence of marine air mass or above the boundary layer, and the cloud droplet number concentration spectrum was bimodal. The relationship between stratocumulus and aerosol in this region is consistent with the Twomey effect. Ed and Na remain negatively correlated in different liquid water content ranges, and the FIE (aerosol first indirect effect) ranged from −0.07 to −0.58."

This study introduces a discrimination algorithm based on polarimetric radar networks only. Exploiting the unique opportunity to link fall velocities from Doppler spectra to polarimetric variables in an operational setting enables us to set up and evaluate a well-performing machine learning algorithm. 
 The distinction between riming and aggregation is of high relevance for model microphysics, data assimilation, and warnings of potential aircraft hazards due to the link between riming and updrafts as well as the presence of supercooled liquid water in the atmosphere. Even though the polarimetric fingerprints for aggregation and riming are qualitatively similar, we hypothesize that it is feasible to implement an area-wide discrimination algorithm based on national polarimetric weather radar networks only. Quasi-vertical profiles (QVPs) of reflectivity (ZH), differential reflectivity (ZDR), and estimated depolarization ratio (DR) are utilized to learn about the information content of each individual polarimetric variable and their combinations for riming detection. High-resolution Doppler spectra from the vertical (birdbath) scans of the C-band radar network of the German Meteorological Service serve as input and ground truth for algorithm development. Mean isolated spectra profiles (MISPs) of the Doppler velocity are used to infer regions with frozen hydrometeors falling faster than 1.5 m s−1 and accordingly associated with significant riming. Several machine learning methods have been tested to detect riming from the corresponding QVPs of polarimetric variables. The best-performing algorithm is a fine-tuned gradient-boosting model based on decision trees. The precipitation event on 14 July 2021, which led to catastrophic flooding in the Ahr valley in western Germany, was selected to validate the performance. Considering balanced accuracy, the algorithm is able to correctly predict 74 % of the observed riming features; thus, the feasibility of reliable riming detection with national radar networks has been successfully demonstrated."

Bradley;Barbara Dix;Fergus Mackenzie;J. Pepijn Veefkind;Joost A. de Gouw,Deep transfer learning method for seasonal TROPOMI XCH4 albedo correction,"Currently, measurement of methane from the TROPOMI satellite is biased with respect to surface reflectance. This study demonstrates a new method of correcting for this bias on a seasonal timescale to allow for differences in surface reflectance in areas of intense agriculture where growing seasons may introduce a reflectance bias. We have successfully implemented this technique in the Denver–Julesburg basin, where agriculture and methane extraction infrastructure is often co-located. 
 The retrieval of methane from satellite measurements is sensitive to the reflectance of the surface, and in many regions, especially those with agriculture, surface reflectance depends on the season. Existing corrections for this effect do not take into account a changing relationship between reflectance and the methane correction value over time. It is an important issue to consider, as agricultural emissions of methane are significant and other sources, like oil and gas production, are also often located in agricultural lands. In this work, we use a set of 12 monthly machine learning models to generate a seasonally resolved surface albedo correction for TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) methane data across the Denver–Julesburg basin. We found that land cover is important in the correction, specifically the type of crops grown in an area, with drought-resistant-crop-covered areas requiring a correction of 5–6 ppb larger than areas covered in water-intensive crops in the summer. Additionally, the correction over different land covers changes significantly over the seasonally resolved timescale, with corrections over drought-resistant crops being up to 10 ppb larger in the summer than in the winter. This correction will allow for more accurate determination of methane emissions by removing the effect of agricultural and other seasonal effects on the albedo correction. The correction may also allow for the deconvolution of agricultural methane emissions, which are seasonally dependent, from oil and gas emissions, which are more constant in time."

Wendler;Marquette Rocque;Aifang Zhou;Zeen Zhu;Edward Luke;Die Wang,Wet-radome attenuation in ARM cloud radars and its utilization in radar calibration using disdrometer measurements,"A relative calibration technique is developed for the cloud radar by monitoring the intercept of the wet-radome attenuation log-linear behavior as a function of rainfall rates in light and moderate rain conditions. This resulting reflectivity offset during the recent field campaign is compared favorably with the traditional disdrometer comparison near the rain onset, while it also demonstrates similar trends with respect to collocated and independently calibrated reference radars. 
 A relative calibration technique has been developed for the US Department of Energy's (DOE's) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) user facility Ka-band ARM Zenith Radars (KAZRs). This method uses the signal attenuation caused by water on the radome to estimate reflectivity factor (Ze) offsets. The wet-radome attenuation (WRA) is assumed to follow a log-linear relationship with rainfall rate during light and moderate rain, as measured by a collocated surface disdrometer. The technique has an uncertainty of approximately 3 dB, due to factors such as disdrometer measurement error, rain variability between radar and disdrometer sample volumes, and the fitting function's uncertainty for the WRA behavior. A practical advantage of this WRA-based approach to shorter-wavelength radar monitoring is that, while it requires a reference disdrometer, it proves feasible for a wider range of collocated disdrometer measurements compared to traditional direct disdrometer comparison at the onset of light rain. This technique thus offers a cost-effective monitoring tool for remote or long-term radar deployments.This calibration technique was applied during the ARM Tracking Aerosol Convection Interactions Experiment (TRACER) from October 2021 through September 2022. The estimated Ze offsets were compared against traditional radar calibration and monitoring methods using available datasets from this campaign. Results show that the WRA-based offsets align closely with mean offsets found between cloud radars and from direct disdrometer comparison near the onset of rain, while also reflecting similar offset and campaign-long trends when compared to collocated, independently calibrated radar wind profilers. Nevertheless, overall, the KAZR Ze offsets estimated during TRACER remained stable at approximately 2 dB lower than the disdrometer estimates from the campaign start until the end of June 2022; afterward, the offsets increased to around 7 dB by the campaign's end. This increase is linked to a drop of about 1 dB in transmitter power toward the end of the project."

Compared to nadir-only retrievals, the tomography technique provides a detailed reconstruction of ice clouds’ inner structure with high spatial resolution and significantly improves retrieval accuracy. Also, the technique effectively increases detection sensitivity for small ice cloud particles. 
 The submillimeter-wave radiometer operating in the along-track scanning mode continuously collects brightness temperature (TB) data over a two-dimensional (2D) cloud cross-section as the platform moves forward. TB observations from multiple positions and viewing angles show great promise in better constraining the 2D cloud microphysical properties compared to single-angle observations. In this study, we develop two types of tomographic reconstruction algorithms to retrieve 2D ice water content (IWC) profiles using multi-angle TB observations. The one-dimensional (1D) tomographic algorithm performs 1D retrievals beam by beam using each TB observation at a specific sensor position and viewing angle to derive cloud properties along the propagation path. It then integrates the 1D retrieval results to construct 2D cloud cross-section. The 2D tomographic algorithm directly constrains the 2D cloud microphysical properties using multi-angle scanning TB observations. Starting with an initial assumption, the algorithm iteratively refines the 2D cloud microphysical quantities by minimizing discrepancies between TB simulations and observations under prior constraints. Both tomographic algorithms are developed based on a hybrid of Bayesian Monte Carlo integration (MCI) and the optimal estimation method (OEM). A simulation experiment is conducted to evaluate the performance of two tomographic reconstruction algorithms. The experiment demonstrates stable convergence of both tomographic methods, with the 2D tomographic algorithm exhibiting superior performance. The experiment results highlight the significant advantage of using multi-angle observations to constrain 2D cloud structure. Compared to nadir-only retrievals, the tomographic technique provides a detailed reconstruction of ice clouds' inner structure with high spatial resolution. Also, the technique significantly improves retrieval accuracy by correcting systematic biases and reducing the derivation of retrieval errors. Furthermore, the tomography technique effectively increases detection sensitivity for small ice cloud particles."

In this paper, we propose the Geopotential-guided Attention Network (GeoAN) for downscaling which can produce high-resolution data using given low-resolution data. Quantitative and visual comparisons reveal our GeoAN produces better results with regard to most metrics. Using GeoAN, a historical meteorological dataset called MDG625 has been produced daily for the period since 1940. 
 The long-term and reliable meteorological reanalysis dataset with high spatial–temporal resolution is crucial for various hydrological and meteorological applications, especially in regions or periods with scarce in situ observations and with limited open-access data. Based on the fifth-generation reanalysis dataset (ERA5, produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 0.25°×0.25°, since 1940) and CLDAS (China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System, 0.0625°×0.0625°, since 2008), we propose a novel downscaling method Geopotential-guided Attention Network (GeoAN), leveraging the high spatial resolution of CLDAS and the extended historical coverage of ERA5, and produce the daily multi-variable (2 m temperature, surface pressure, and 10 m wind speed) meteorological dataset MDG625. MDG625 (0.0625° Meteorological Dataset derived by GeoAN) covers most of Asia from 0.125° S to 64.875° N and 60.125 to 160.125° E, and contains data starting in 1940. Compared with other downscaling methods, GeoAN shows better performance with R2 (2 m temperature, surface pressure, and 10 m wind speed reach 0.990, 0.998, and 0.781, respectively). MDG625 demonstrates superior continuity and consistency from both spatial and temporal perspectives. We anticipate that the GeoAN method and this dataset, MDG625, will aid in climate studies of Asia and will contribute to improving the accuracy of reanalysis products from the 1940s.

It was collected at sea in the Bay of Biscay (France) and comprises audio recordings of echolocation clicks, whistles and other social sounds, as well as visual observations of dolphin behaviour. This dataset could be used to improve the comprehension of dolphin communication by scientists, which could assist in the development of conservation strategies, particularly with regard to by-catches. 
 Dolphins are highly vocal cetaceans with a complex acoustic repertoire. These marine mammals rely heavily on sound for critical activities: echolocation clicks for navigation and prey detection, whistles for social communication, and pulsed sounds for less well-documented purposes. Understanding their acoustic behaviour is essential for insights into their ecology, social structure, and responses to anthropogenic noise. However, to date, there is a lack of open-access datasets of acoustic recordings of wild free-ranging short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis), coupled with observations data. Here, we present a dataset (DOI:10.5281/zenodo.14637674, Lehnhoff (2025)) of high resolution acoustic recordings of (D. delphis) observed during various behavioural states, including foraging, travelling, socializing, milling, and attraction to the boat. The dataset was collected in the northern Bay of Biscay, France, from summers of 2020 to 2022 during surveys conducted as part of the DOLPHINFREE project. The dataset contains acoustic recordings of wild free-ranging short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) observed during various behavioural states, including foraging, travelling, socializing, milling, and attraction to the boat. Audio recordings were performed during opportunistic encounters using two devices: a single high-quality hydrophone (sampling rate: 512 kHz, bit-depth: 32 bits) and a compact array of four hydrophones (256 kHz to 512 kHz, 16 to 24 bits) for localization purposes. The dataset comprises over 400 minutes of unedited audio recordings of D. delphis accompanied by visual observations. In total, we identified about 68,000 echolocation clicks, 4,600 whistle contours, and more that 350 pulsed sounds.

The GeoEcoKorea online platform, developed alongside this dataset, aims to enhance data accessibility and promote FAIR data sharing among researchers. 
 Ecological insights beyond human-observable time scales are derived from geologically preserved records in lake and wetland sediments around the world. Nonetheless, significant regional data gaps persist in global syntheses of these records as regional open data practices are still emerging. South Korean Quaternary paleoecology data remain underrepresented in these global efforts, despite a growing body of the relevant research. Here, we organize an inventory of 328 paleoecological study sites (72 paleo-sites for sediment records and 256 surface sites for surface pollen samples) in South Korea, compiled from 66 research articles published between 2003 and 2023. We have structured three datasets related to this inventory: (1) Publication Metadata, which provides citation details of the 66 articles; (2) Site Inventory, which contains geospatial, depositional environments, chronological ranges, proxies, and indexed publications; and (3) Chron-Depth Collection, which includes chronological details (dating methods, age, and depth points) for each site. The sites span latitudes from 33.2508° N to 33.4808° N and longitudes from 126.1486° E to 129.2132° E, with elevations from -156 m to 1867.5 m. Sediment samples were collected by coring or trenching from six depositional environments: Open-coastal zone, Estuary, Lagoon, River, Volcanic cone, and Others. A total of 784 chronological controls (14C, OSL, and U-Th) were analyzed from 72 sediment records, and the majority based on radiocarbon dating. Pollen, diatoms, grain-size analysis, and geochemical markers have been extensively used as paleoenvironmental proxies, with multiproxy analyses becoming increasingly common in recent studies. To enhance accessibility, we have developed GeoEcoKorea, an online platform archiving raw data of the compiled studies or linking to it through our metadata, site inventory, and chron-depth datasets if the data is made available elsewhere.

We find that tropical regions are mostly P-limited, while temperate and boreal areas face N limitations. Over time, P limitation increased, especially in the tropics, while N limitation decreased. These shifts are key to understanding global plant growth and carbon storage, highlighting the importance of including P dynamics in ecosystem models. 
 Phosphorus (P) is a critical macronutrient for plant growth, often limiting plant production in areas where plant demand is higher than soil supply. In contrast to nitrogen (N), P cannot be sourced from the atmosphere; therefore, where it is rare, it becomes a strong constraint on primary production. Due to this, most dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) are incorporating a prognostic P cycle in addition to N, improving their ability to correctly predict stocks and fluxes of carbon and how climate change may impact N and/or P limitations to soil processes and plant productivity.We included the P cycle into an individual-based DGVM, Lund–Potsdam–Jena General Ecosystem Simulator (LPJ-GUESS, v4.1, r10994), in order to improve model performance with regard to observations of vegetation and soil N and P stocks and fluxes in comparison to the N-only (LPJ-GUESS-CN) model version. The new model version (LPJ-GUESS-CNP v1.0) includes soil organic P dynamics, P limitation of organic matter decomposition, P deposition, temperature- and humidity-dependent P weathering, plant P demand and uptake, and P limitations to photosynthesis. Using the CNP version of LPJ-GUESS, we also estimated global spatial patterns of nutrient limitation to plant growth as well as the temporal change in plant N and P limitation during the 20th and early 21st century, evaluating the causes for these temporal shifts.We show that including the P cycle significantly reduces simulated global vegetation and soil C and N stocks and fluxes, in particular in tropical regions. The CNP model simulation improves the fit to global biomass observations in relation to the CN simulation. The CNP model predicts predominant P limitation of plant growth in the tropics, and N limitation in the temperate, boreal, and high-altitude tropical regions. The CNP model also correctly predicted the global magnitude (∼50 PgP) and the spatial pattern of total organic P stocks. P-limited regions cover less land surface area (46 %) than N-limited ones but are responsible for 57 % of the global gross primary productivity (GPP)  and 68 % of vegetation biomass, while N-limited regions store a larger portion of total carbon stocks (55.9 %). Finally, the model shows that globally, primary production limitation to N availability decreased and limitation to P increased from 1901 to 2018, with N being more responsive to temperature and P than CO2 changes. We conclude that including the P cycle in models like LPJ-GUESS is crucial for understanding global-scale spatial and temporal patterns in nutrient limitation and improving the simulated carbon stocks and fluxes."

In this study, we use the highest spatially resolved (∼2 km) measurements of emissions and concentrations ever reported of HAPs while covering a whole megacity and combine observations with US Census information. We observe higher concentrations and emissions of 17 measured HAPs, such as benzene, naphthalene, and p-chlorobenzotrifluoride (PCBTF), in California-designated Disadvantaged Communities (DACs) and census tracts with low-income Hispanics and Asians. These groups share an unequal burden from traffic-related emissions, with benzene, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations up to 60% higher. However, in DACs and census tracts with large Hispanic populations (>50%), we observe toluene-to-benzene emission ratios above 3, pointing to inequalities in other HAPs primarily caused by non-traffic emission sources such as industry and solvents. In these communities, regulatory inventories also significantly underestimate emissions. We find that efforts to address HAP inequalities and environmental justice concerns in Los Angeles will need to consider contributions from volatile chemical products, which represent a growing source of emissions driving inequalities in impacted communities."

This knowledge is of critical value in the management and conservation of the coastal seafloor. We therefore aimed to determine the relationships between seafloor microbiota and macrofauna on a regional scale. We compared prokaryote, macrofauna, chemical, and geographical data from 1546 seafloor samples, which varied in their exposure to aquaculture activities along the Norwegian and Icelandic coasts. We found that the seafloor samples contained either a network centralized by a sulfur oxidizer (42.4% of samples, n = 656) or a network centralized by an archaeal ammonium oxidizer (44.0% of samples, n = 681). Very few samples contained neither network (9.8% of samples, n = 151) or both (3.8% of samples, n = 58). Samples with a sulfur oxidizer network had a 10-fold higher risk of macrofauna loss (odds ratios, 95% CI: 9.5 to 15.6), while those with an ammonium oxidizer network had a 10-fold lower risk (95% CI: 0.068 to 0.11). The sulfur oxidizer network was negatively correlated to distance from Norwegian aquaculture sites (Spearman rho = −0.42, p < 0.01) and was present in all Icelandic samples (n = 274).

Based on 356 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), we found that bicarbonate-dependent carbon fixation and low-affinity oxygen respiration were associated with the ammonium oxidizer network, while the sulfur oxidizer network was associated with ammonium retention, sulfur metabolism, and high-affinity oxygen respiration. In conclusion, our findings highlight the critical roles of microbial networks centralized by sulfur and ammonium oxidizers in mild macrofauna deterioration, which should be included as an essential part of seafloor surveillance."

Leveraging a data set of 1,274 Kd entries for PFAS in soils and sediments, including compounds such as trifluoroacetate, cationic, and zwitterionic PFAS, and neutral fluorotelomer alcohols, the model incorporates PFAS-specific properties such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, and pKa, alongside soil characteristics like pH, texture, organic carbon content, and cation exchange capacity. Sensitivity analysis reveals that molecular weight, hydrophobicity, and organic carbon content are the most significant factors influencing sorption behavior, while charge density and mineral soil fraction have comparatively minor effects. The model demonstrates high predictive performance, with RPD values exceeding 3.16 across validation data sets, outperforming existing tools in accuracy and scope. Notably, PFAS chain length and functional group variability significantly influence Kd, with longer chain lengths and higher hydrophobicity positively correlating with Kd. By integrating location-specific soil repository data, the model enables the generation of spatial Kd maps for selected PFAS species. These capabilities are implemented in the online platform PFASorptionML, providing researchers and practitioners with a valuable resource for conducting environmental risk assessments of PFAS contamination in soils."

The dynamic nature of these environments affects eDNA distribution relative to its source organisms, complicating the interpretation of eDNA observations and challenging the field sampling design. Here, an eDNA fate and transport model, built on an ocean model with Lagrangian particle tracking, provided a spatiotemporal estimate of the rapidly diluted eDNA shed by rare targets in an estuary environment before sampling. Based on the predicted particle densities, over 70% of the preselected stations detected the target eDNA. Despite potential variations in source strength and patchy distributions, the model explained approximately 40% of the observed variation in eDNA abundance; by comparison, eDNA concentration was uncorrelated with straight-line distance from the source or with a simplified oceanographic model. Our study revealed the extent of advective transport in shaping eDNA distribution and abundance and demonstrated the utility of ocean models and particle tracking in integrating marine eDNA observations with degradation, transport, and dilution processes; thus, it suggests broader applications to enhance understanding of eDNA signals and dispersal and optimize sampling strategies in other estuarine or marine environments."

We identified 457 k-values, with 356 for nonenveloped viruses. Extracted rate constants were transformed into UV fluence-normalized k-values to isolate the most photobiologically relevant wavelengths in the solar spectrum and reported for the first time in terms of energy, rather than time, based units. Each spectral region was assessed independently, with UVB illumination reporting the highest inactivation rates, UVA contributing to inactivation both in the presence and absence of photosensitizers, and visible light demonstrating no biocidal activity. Inactivation mechanisms are reviewed identifying knowledge gaps in translating UVC mechanisms to longer wavelengths.

The content of sxt genes suggest that this organism can produce STX, decarbamoyl and deoxy-decarbamoyl saxitoxins, and other congeners. The absence of sxtX indicates this organism is unable to produce neosaxitoxin, a potent congener. However, a distinct, lower abundance sxt operon from an unidentified organism did contain sxtX, indicating neosaxitoxin biosynthesis potential. Metatranscriptomic data confirmed STX biosynthesis gene expression. We also recovered highly similar Dolichospermum MAGs lacking sxt genes, implying gene loss or horizontal gene transfer. sxtA was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction during 47 of 76 sampling dates between 2015 and 2019, demonstrating higher sensitivity than metagenomic approaches. sxtA gene abundance was positively correlated with temperature and particulate nitrogen:phosphorus ratio and negatively correlated with ammonium concentration.

Flow-through experiments were conducted in unsaturated quartz and goethite-coated quartz sands equilibrated with different background electrolyte concentrations to distinguish between air–water and goethite–water interfacial adsorption contributions to PFOS retardation. Measurements of PFOS breakthrough curves at column outlets allowed tracking the differences in spatio-temporal evolution of the PFOS plumes between the two porous media. Process-based reactive transport simulations, incorporating a thermodynamic framework of mass-action reactions accounting for multiple interfacial retention processes, allowed the quantitative interpretation of physical and geochemical processes. Experimental and modeling results reveal that multiprocess retention causes nonideal PFOS transport, with plume retardation and spatio-temporal mass transfer between the different phases determined by the relative contribution of the individual retention processes and their electrostatic interplay driven by solution counterions.

Open-source tools were used to predict biotransformation products, predict potential PAH-TP structures from mass spectra, and estimate health hazards of potential PAH-TPs. The workflow developed in this study allowed for the tentative identification of 16 PAH-TPs (confidence levels 2a to 3), seven of which were not previously detected by targeted analysis. Several new potential transformation pathways for our bacterial pure culture were suggested by the PAH-TPs, including carboxylation, sulfonation and up to three hydroxylation reactions.

When the non‐occluding cyclones are selected such that they collectively have similar intensity and moisture amount distributions as the occluding cyclones, precipitation rates at peak intensity are still larger for occluding cyclones. This is because a particular type of forced, frontal‐scale, ascent in the occluded thermal ridge, unique to occluded cyclones by virtue of their thermal structure, favors more precipitation.

This study introduces a high‐resolution crustal structure derived from a cost‐effective short‐period dense seismic array across fossil suture zones between the Xing'an and the Songnen‐Xilinhot blocks in the eastern Central Asian Orogenic Belt. Our imaging reveals clear southward and northward subduction remnants of the fossil subducted slabs in the Solonker suture, along with weak subduction signatures in the Heihe‐Hegenshan suture. Combined with geological evidence, these findings indicate that the bi‐directional subduction remnants were related to the closure of the Paleo‐Asian Ocean in the Solonker suture from the Ordovician to the Early Triassic. Therefore, the identification of the fossil suture zones underscores the utility of dense short‐period seismic arrays in providing cost‐effective constrains on “frozen‐in” crustal information pertinent to tectonic evolution."

 Accurately predicting species’ responses to anthropogenic climate change is hampered by limited knowledge of their spatiotemporal ecological and evolutionary dynamics. We combine landscape genomics, demographic reconstructions, and species distribution models to assess the eco-evolutionary responses to past climate fluctuations and to future climate of an Afro-Palaearctic migratory raptor, the lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni). We uncover two evolutionarily and ecologically distinct lineages (European and Asian), whose demographic history, evolutionary divergence, and historical distribution range were profoundly shaped by past climatic fluctuations. Using future climate projections, we find that the Asian lineage is at higher risk of range contraction, increased migration distance, climate maladaptation, and consequently greater extinction risk than the European lineage. Our results emphasise the importance of providing historical context as a baseline for understanding species’ responses to contemporary climate change, and illustrate how incorporating intraspecific genetic variation improves the ecological realism of climate change vulnerability assessments.

 Developing ruthenium-based oxide catalysts capable of suppressing lattice oxygen participation in the catalytic reaction process is crucial for maintaining stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under acidic conditions. Herein, we delicately construct a RuO2 nanoparticle-anchored LiCoO2 nanosheet electrocatalyst (RuO2/LiCoO2), achieving dynamic optimization of RuO2 during the reaction process and improving catalytic stability. Benefiting from the unique electrochemical delithiation characteristics of the LiCoO2 support, the covalency of the Ru-O bond is effectively regulated during the OER process. The weakened Ru-O covalent bond inhibits the participation of lattice oxygen in the catalytic reaction and ensures the continuous operation of the Ru active sites. Moreover, the extended Ru-O bond in the optimized RuO2/LiCoO2 catalyst reduces the formation energy barrier of the *OOH intermediates, accelerating the progress of the OER. As a result, the RuO2/LiCoO2 catalyst requires only an overpotential of 150 ± 2 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and operates stably for 2000 h at 1 A cm−2 in a proton exchange membrane water electrolysis.

 Populations facing lethal environmental change can escape extinction through rapid genetic adaptation, a process known as evolutionary rescue. Despite extensive study, evolutionary rescue is largely unexplored in mutualistic communities, where it is likely constrained by the less adaptable partner. Here, we explored empirically the likelihood, population dynamics, and genetic mechanisms underpinning evolutionary rescue in an obligate mutualism involving cross-feeding of amino acids between auxotrophic Escherichia coli strains. We found that over 80% of populations overcame a severe decline when exposed to two distinct types of abrupt, lethal stress. Of note, in all cases only one of the strains survived by metabolically bypassing the auxotrophy. Crucially, the mutualistic consortium exhibited greater sensitivity to both stressors than a prototrophic control strain, such that reversion to autonomy was sufficient to alleviate stress below lethal levels. This sensitivity was common across other stresses, suggesting it may be a general feature of amino acid–dependent obligate mutualisms. Our results reveal that evolutionary rescue may depend critically on the specific genetic and physiological details of the interacting partners, adding rich layers of complexity to the endeavor of predicting the fate of microbial communities facing intense environmental deterioration.

 The gut microbiota is a key modulator of human health and the status of major diseases including cancer, diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease. Central to microbiota survival is the ability to metabolise complex dietary and host-derived glycans, including intestinal mucins. The prominent human gut microbe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (B. theta) is a versatile and highly efficient complex glycan degrader thanks to the expansion of gene clusters termed polysaccharide utilisation loci (PULs). While the mechanism of action for several singular dietary glycan-induced PULs have been elucidated, studies on the unusually high number of mucin-inducible PULs in B. theta significantly lag behind. Here we show that a mucin inducible PUL BT4240-50 encodes activities consistent with the processing and metabolism of mucin O-glycoproteins and their core sugar N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc). PUL BT4240-50 was also shown to be important for competitive growth on mucins in vitro, encoding a kinase (BT4240) critical for GalNAc metabolism. Additionally, BT4240-kinase was shown to be essential for glycosaminoglycan metabolism, extending the PULs function beyond mucins.

Here Elliott et al. show that conformational rigidity determines agonistic activity of antibodies targeting CD40 and 4-1BB and demonstrate further enhancement of agonism through disulfide engineering. 
 A promising strategy in cancer immunotherapy is activation of immune signalling pathways through antibodies that target co-stimulatory receptors. hIgG2, one of four human antibody isotypes, is known to deliver strong agonistic activity, and modification of hIgG2 hinge disulfides can influence immune-stimulating activity. This was shown for antibodies directed against the hCD40 receptor, where cysteine-to-serine exchange mutations caused changes in antibody conformational flexibility. Here we demonstrate that the principles of increasing agonism by restricting antibody conformation through disulfide modification can be translated to the co-stimulatory receptor h4-1BB, another member of the tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily. Furthermore, we explore structure-guided design of the anti-hCD40 antibody ChiLob7/4 and show that engineering additional disulfides between opposing F(ab’) arms can elicit conformational restriction, concomitant with enhanced agonism. These results support a mode where subtle increases in rigidity can deliver significant improvements in immunostimulatory activity, thus providing a strategy for the rational design of more powerful antibody therapeutics.

 Marine anoxia is widely proposed as a kill mechanism for the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary mass extinction commonly linked to the end-Devonian Hangenberg Crisis (~359.3 Ma), but the exact connections between primary drivers, marine redox conditions, and biotic turnover are not well constrained. Mercury concentrations and isotopes from multiple sections in South China and western Canada show no significant signature of enhanced volcanism during the end-Devonian Hangenberg Crisis. Rather, the distinct negative shifts of Δ199Hg coupled with positive shifts of δ202Hg across the end-Devonian Hangenberg Crisis provide compelling evidence for development of photic zone euxinia, as supported by covariant pyrite framboid data and Ce/Ce* values of carbonate. The photic zone euxinia was likely driven by increased nutrient delivery given its coincidence with carbon isotopic perturbations and enhanced weathering immediately before the end-Devonian Hangenberg Crisis. Our data highlight the possibility that photic zone euxinia played a pivotal role in the extinction of marine biota during the end-Devonian Hangenberg Crisis by limiting the habitable space and by increased hydrogen sulfide toxicity, especially for organisms living in shallow water.

Here, we show that self-secondaries are scarce on Mars, possessing minor effect on crater chronology. Recognized self-secondaries primarily occur on rim deposits and are largely absent on layered ejecta deposits, suggesting that the emplacement of self-secondaries and layered ejecta deposits occurred in a narrow time window. Comparison with model-predicted distributions of self-secondaries suggests that fragments forming self-secondaries did not uniformly have near-vertical ejection angles and may have slightly larger angles than those of normal excavation flows, explaining their common occurrence on airless planetary bodies. The double-layered ejecta of Steinheim ceased emplacement earlier than single- and multiple-layered ejecta, possibly due to the higher volatile content in pre-impact target materials. Self-secondary impact craters are rare on Mars relative to airless bodies and are almost absent in layered ejecta deposits, according to satellite observations of Martian surface geology which suggest the two deposit types form largely contemporaneously."

 Conventional Palmes Diffusion Tubes (PDTs) are extensively employed by UK Local Authorities for measuring NO2 in air quality monitoring studies. These devices are known to suffer from biases due to from the effects of wind speed. Modified PDTs with wind protective filters have also been developed for deployment in the UK Urban NO2 Network (UUNN) with an improved measurement accuracy and repeatability. We report the performance of the two designs and also when enclosed in additional shelters. The comparison was carried out against simultaneous reference measurements and was evaluated through a statistical and modelled uncertainty. The model incorporated the individual components of the measurement uncertainty to provide an estimate of the total measurement uncertainty and identified which elements could be reduced across mean values of multiple measurements.We found that conventional PDTs could be adversely affected by wind speed and that the incorporation of shelters delivered improved repeatability and better accuracy across multiple diffusion tube measurements. The UUNN style diffusive samplers were more accurate than the PDTs and had better repeatability. The additional use of shelters with UUNN style samplers made no discernible difference to the measurements."

 Caused by an unprecedented East Asian high-pressure, the Yangtze River Valley (YRV) in China suffered an extreme heat dome with record-breaking heatwaves and droughts in August 2022. Concurrently, extra-tropical oceans recorded unprecedented warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs). However, the combined influence of these warm SSTs on the YRV's extreme heatwaves remains unclear. By using observational data, simulations from the Community Earth System Model-Large Ensemble project, and numerical sensitivity experiments, we highlight the joint contributions of intensified air-sea interaction in the North Pacific and North Atlantic to the YRV's extreme heatwave. Further analysis indicates that the East Asian high-pressure exhibits a non-linear response to the intensity of SSTs in the North Pacific and North Atlantic, with a significant response only to the extreme warm SSTs. In addition, the uncertainty within the simulation of August high-pressure is explored, and the result indicates that the uncertainty could be physically rooted in the model's inability to initiatively simulate the coupled air-sea situation over the North Atlantic in July. To improve the simulation for the influence of mid-latitude SSTs, a coordinated coupled air-sea initial condition should be used to constrain the simulation. Moreover, such warm SSTs and the associated air-sea interaction can cause extreme high-pressures over Europe and western North America, offering an explanation for the compound extreme heatwaves over these two regions and China in 2022."

Labban;Khan Alam,"Climatology, trend and correlations of aerosol, cloud and meteorology over the climatologically important monsoon and adjacent northern regions of Pakistan","•An increasing trend in AOD and AI is observed over R1 region, while decreasing trends are observed over R2 region. •AE shows a decreasing trend over both the regions. •Seasonal changes in cloud properties are relatively high in spring and summer over both the R1 and R2 regions. •AI shows significant negative correlations with COT/CER/LWP in R1 but weak positive correlations in R2. •The correlation between aerosols, clouds, and meteorological factors is stronger in R1 compared to R2. 
 Quantifying changes in aerosols, cloud characteristics, and their correlations on both spatial and temporal scales is essential for understanding future climate changes. In this study, 11 years (2009–2019) of aerosol, meteorological, and cloud datasets are analyzed to evaluate climatology, trends, and their relationships over the climatologically important core monsoon- (R1) region and the adjacent high-altitude northern (R2) region of Pakistan. The study utilizes Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) data for aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom Exponent (AE), CLARA-A3 data for liquid cloud properties such as cloud droplet effective radius (CER), cloud optical thickness (COT), cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), cloud geometrical thickness (CGT), and liquid water path (LWP), and ERA-5 data for meteorological variables at a spatial resolution of 0.25° × 0.25°. Negative trend in AE over both the R1 and R2 regions (−5 % and −10 %) are observed which could be due to deforestation, increasing temperature, and changing precipitation patterns that may disturb the dust activity and monsoon circulations. The concurrent increasing trend in AOD (12.4 %) and Aerosol Index (AI) (3.2 %) is observed over R1, likely driven by rapid urbanization, industrialization, and biomass burning. Conversely, a decreasing trend in AOD (−7.0 %) and AI (−14.14 %) is observed over R2, possibly due to anthropogenic emission control policies in China, that reduces aerosol inflow in remote areas, including the high-altitude R2 region. Positive trends are observed in CDNC, CER, CGT, COT, and LWP, with percent changes of 9.2 %, 20.7 %, 4.06 %, 6.7 %, and 10.7 % over R1 region and 34.7 %, 5.4 %, 16.98 %, 21.9 %, and 24.8 % over R2 region, respectively. Meteorological variables, including mixing ratio (q), geopotential (z), convective available potential energy (CAPE), horizontal wind speed at 10 m above the surface (si10m), dew point temperature at 2 m (d2m) and temperature at 2 m (t2m), show positive trends over both R1 and R2 regions. Correlation analysis reveals positive AOD-CDNC and negative AOD-CER relationships in both regions. In contrast, AI-COT, AI-CGT and AI-LWP correlations are negative (−0.13, −0.26 and −0.20) over R1 region but insignificant weak negative AI-CGT (−5.7 × 10−6) and positive AI-COT (0.099) and AI-LWP (0.061) are observed over R2 region. The contrasting behavior of AI-COT and AI-LWP correlations can be attributed to the difference in cloud regime and meteorological conditions over the R1 and R2 regions. The results of this study provide critical insights into aerosol-cloud-meteorology interactions, with implications for regional climate modeling, monsoon variability, and future climate projections. The findings also contribute to global aerosol-cloud research by emphasizing the importance of region-specific mechanisms in shaping aerosol-cloud interactions."

Distinguishing their nature (interstitial- or vacancy-type) is a long-standing challenge with great implications for understanding radiation damage. Here, we demonstrate that the morphology of radiation-induced Frank loops can unveil their nature in face-centered cubic (fcc) structure: Circular loops are interstitial-type in all fcc materials, while segmented loops are vacancy-type in high stacking fault energy (SFE) alloys but varied-type in low SFE and high-entropy alloys. The polygonal shape is attributed to the dissociation of ana0/3<111> dislocation into ana0/6<112> Shockley partial and ana0/6<110> stair-rod dislocation. The dissociation of vacancy loops is energetically favorable, whereas interstitial loops require external stimuli to promote dislocation propagation. This “morphology-nature” correlation not only highlights the asymmetry of vacancy/interstitial loops but also offers an efficient way to distinguish loop nature for a wide range of materials."

We report the role of astrocyte-specific, ADAR1-mediated RNA editing in neuroinflammation in Parkinson’s disease (PD). We generated human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived astrocytes, neurons and cocultures and exposed them to small soluble alpha-synuclein aggregates. Oligomeric alpha-synuclein triggered an inflammatory glial state associated with Toll-like receptor activation, viral responses, and cytokine secretion. This reactive state resulted in loss of neurosupportive functions and the induction of neuronal toxicity. Notably, interferon response pathways were activated leading to up-regulation and isoform switching of the RNA deaminase enzyme, ADAR1. ADAR1 mediates A-to-I RNA editing, and increases in RNA editing were observed in inflammatory pathways in cells, as well as in postmortem human PD brain. Aberrant, or dysregulated, ADAR1 responses and RNA editing may lead to sustained inflammatory reactive states in astrocytes triggered by alpha-synuclein aggregation, and this may drive the neuroinflammatory cascade in Parkinson’s."

Light, too, can evolve like a vortex. Optical vortex beams are exploited in light-matter interaction, free space communications, and imaging. Here, we introduce optical rotatum, a behavior of light in which an optical vortex beam experiences a quadratic chirp in its orbital angular momentum along the optical path. We show that such an adiabatic deformation of topology is associated with the accumulation of a Gouy phase factor, which, in turn, perturbs the propagation constant (spatial frequency) of the beam. The spatial structure of optical rotatum follows a logarithmic spiral—a signature that is commonly seen in the pattern formation of seashells and galaxies. Our work expands the previous literature on structured light, offers new modalities for light-matter interaction, communications, and sensing, and hints at analogous effects in condensed matter physics and Bose-Einstein condensates."

Two general types of synaptic plasticity, associative plasticity to change synaptic weights and homeostatic plasticity to maintain an excitatory balance, are so far thought to be expressed at individual canonical sites in principal neurons of the cortex. Here, we report two separate types of transmission sites, termed silenceable and idle-able, each participating distinctly in evoked or miniature transmission in the mouse visual cortex. Both sites operated with a postsynaptic binary mode with different unitary sizes and mechanisms. During postnatal development, silenceable sites were unsilenced by associative plasticity with α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA)-receptor incorporation, increasing evoked transmission. Concurrently, miniature transmission remained constant, where AMPA-receptor state changes balanced unsilencing with increased idling at idle-able sites. Thus, individual cortical spine synapses mediated two parallel, interacting types of transmission, which predominantly contributed to either associative or homeostatic plasticity."

Using classical molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the α-alumina(0001) surface exhibits an affinity of 4kBTfor individual glycine or GG dipeptide molecules due to hydrogen bonds. In simulations with multiple glycine molecules, surface-bound glycine enhances further adsorption, leading to the formation of long chains connected by hydrogen bonds between the carboxyl and amine groups of glycine molecules. We find that the likelihood of observing chains longer than 10 glycine units increases by at least five orders of magnitude at the surface compared to the bulk. This surface-driven assembly is primarily due to local high density and alignment with the alumina surface pattern. Together, these results propose a model for how mineral surfaces can induce configuration-specific assembly of amino acids, thereby promoting condensation reactions."

How cells balance dynamic mitochondrial processes to achieve homeostasis is incompletely understood. Here, we show that ARMC1 partitioning between distinct mitochondrial protein complexes is a key determinant of mitochondrial distribution. In one complex, the mitochondrial trafficking adaptor MIRO recruits ARMC1, which mediates the assembly of a mitochondrial fission regulator (MTFR). MTFR stability depends on ARMC1, and MIRO-MTFR complexes specifically antagonize retrograde mitochondrial movement. In another complex, DNAJC11 facilitates ARMC1 release from mitochondria. Disrupting MIRO-MTFR assembly fails to rescue aberrant mitochondrial distributions clustered in the perinuclear area observed with ARMC1 deletion, while disrupting ARMC1 interaction with DNAJC11 leads to excessive mitochondrially localized ARMC1 and distinct mitochondrial defects. Thus, the abundance and trafficking impact of MIRO-MTFR complexes require ARMC1, whose mito-cytoplasmic shuttling balanced by DNAJC11 tunes steady-state mitochondrial distributions."
