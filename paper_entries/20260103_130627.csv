In this study, we simulate idealized large-scale AD in an Earth system model of intermediate complexity with different acid injection depths and downwelling intensities and find a maximum marine CDR (mCDR) potential for continuous AD (0.25 Pmol yr−1) of 320 Pg C until the end of the millennium under an extended RCP 4.5 CO2 emissions scenario. However, the acidity temporarily stored at depth resurfaces primarily around the Southern Ocean via ocean circulation and causes regional CO2 outgassing. Furthermore, too intense downwelling of warm surface water leads to an increase in ocean interior temperatures causing further Earth system feedbacks and accelerates the re-emergence of downwelled acidity to the surface. However, the extent to which this re-emergence causes CO2 outgassing into the atmosphere is emissions scenario dependent. This study highlights that large-scale ocean circulation, the investigated time frame, and the future CO2 emission scenario all need to be considered in order to determine the mCDR potential of AD."

Accurate assessments of these levees are crucial in flood hazard maps, which underpin federal floodplain regulations and insurance rates provided by the National Flood Insurance Program. However, when the federal government digitized California’s flood maps in the 2000s, it used a simplistic binary procedure that assessed levees as either meeting the minimum standards for accreditation or not. This study investigates the consequences of the ‘without levee’ procedure, which mapped flood risk as if non-accredited levees did not exist and shaped the 100 year flood zone in California. We combine publicly available datasets on levee systems, flood insurance enrollment, and demographics behind levees. We find that non-accredited levees outnumber accredited levees by a factor of 10-to-1, but accredited levees are concentrated in urban areas and protect more people and assets. Our results demonstrate that households behind non-accredited levees effectively cross-subsidize flood insurance costs in leveed areas—between 2009 and 2020, households behind non-accredited levees paid twice as much for flood insurance premiums than if their levee were accredited and they were removed from the flood zone. While Risk Rating 2.0 insurance pricing is narrowing the premium gap, accreditation continues to shape the 100 year flood zone, with enduring economic implications."

Yet research offers limited insight into how societal pressures shape the responsiveness and effectiveness of CSR in this sector. Empirical study is further constrained by selective corporate disclosure, inconsistent datasets, and unreliable interview evidence. To address these challenges, this study applies topic modeling, a form of natural language processing, to stakeholder communication data. Focusing on the Chilean lithium mining industry from 2010 to 2022, the analysis examines how a leading mining company pursued and operationalized CSR through its annual sustainability reports. The findings show that the company’s CSR efforts appear linked to societal pressures, particularly regulatory fines, activism, environmental scrutiny, and investor demands. Persistent drivers included water conflicts, legal actions, and policy changes. The study also demonstrates that topic modeling offers a useful tool for identifying and tracking CSR priorities over time, yielding insights less accessible through conventional research approaches."

Utilizing satellite observations from 2000 to 2023, here we show that a significant poleward shift in the multiyear ice replenishment occurs in the north pole region (NPR) of the Arctic (north of 80˚N). The large-scale atmospheric circulation mode, characterized by an extensive and persistent high-pressure (low-pressure) pattern on the Siberia (North America) side, is responsible for the poleward shift of multiyear ice (MYI) replenishment. Associated with the poleward expansion of the multiyear sea ice replenishment, a significant decline in sea ice thickness over the central Arctic and reduced sea ice volume flux via the Fram Strait are identified. Moreover, a strengthened (weakened) connection between summer melting (winter freezing) conditions and MYI replenishment variability is outlined. This indicates that the Arctic sea ice is less resilient to warming than previous reports."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae2b89,True,Environmental Research Letters,该论文研究的是如何通过优化低成本PM2.5传感器网络的布局来监测空气质量，这与大气环境遥感技术中的空气质量监测密切相关。论文中提到的PM2.5监测、传感器网络设计、以及多模态数据融合等技术都与大气环境遥感技术相关。,"['PM2.5', 'sensor networks', 'air quality monitoring', 'value of information', 'multimodal data fusion']",Byeongseong Choi;Michelle A Hummel,Optimal sensor placement in low-cost PM2.5 sensor networks using value of information and multimodal data fusion,"Monitoring of air pollutants such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5) supports improved understanding of trends, assessment of exposure, and development of strategies to protect public health. However, determining the optimal placement of pollutant sensors is an ongoing challenge, as different sensor configurations may yield varied insights into regional air quality. In this study, we propose a quantitative framework that integrates a stochastic advection-diffusion (SAD) model with the value of information (VoI) to design a sensor placement strategy for regional PM2.5 monitoring. Predictions from the SAD model are used to compute the VoI based on a cost function that penalizes misclassifications between model-assigned and observed air quality index values. We apply the framework to the Coastal Bend Region of Texas, where increased development is creating new air quality concerns. We compare three weighting strategies: (1) combined weighting, which accounts for both population density and social vulnerability; (2) vulnerability-focused weighting, which emphasizes socially vulnerable communities regardless of population density; and (3) unweighted VoI, which solely focuses on minimizing assignment error without demographic weighting. With a 10-sensor installation, the combined strategy covered areas with 22%–88% higher population density than the other schemes, whereas the vulnerability-focused strategy reduced uncovered social vulnerability by 6%–19%. Prediction accuracy differed by less than 1.5% across strategies. While differences in outcomes are expected given the distinct objectives, the framework adds value by quantifying these trade-offs and enabling a systematic sensor placement strategy that best aligns with policy goals. The proposed framework is scalable to different sensor types and capable of balancing information gain, population exposure, and social vulnerability, providing a versatile tool to guide sensor network design under resource constraints."

Few have examined how multiple burdens are concentrated and distributed among the American population. The objective of this study was to examine how multiple (13) environmental burdens are concentrated and how concentrated burdens are associated with where vulnerable populations reside. We utilized nationally consistent data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s EJScreen database. EJScreen includes 13 environmental burden indicators and five racial/ethnic and socioeconomic indicators. The concentration of environmental burdens was examined by taking into account both the intensity of individual burdens and the count of burdens exceeding specified intensity thresholds. Graphical and statistical analyses were used to determine how percentages of vulnerable populations varied as the intensity levels and counts of burdens exceeding specified intensity thresholds increased. We found that concentrations of vulnerable populations increase as intensity levels of individual environmental burdens increase and as the number of burdens exceeding specified intensity thresholds increases. In most cases these increases are monotonic and highly statistically significant. Among the five demographic categories examined, the strongest relationships were found for percent people of color, followed by percent with limited English. Weaker but statistically significant relationships were found between other socioeconomic categories and increases in the intensities and counts of environmental burdens. Until recently, nationally consistent data for multiple environmental burdens were not available. Applying the 13 environmental indicators in EJScreen demonstrates that a strong relationship exists between where multiple burdens are simultaneously concentrated and where vulnerable populations reside. That this relationship is stronger for racial/ethnic categories than for other socioeconomic categories reflects outcomes of a history of public policies that have segregated and disadvantaged certain populations in the U.S."

Ex-post evaluation of agri-environmental outcomes of these grant programs, however, is limited. We use satellite data to monitor changes in field-level consumptive water use and greenness (i.e. normalized difference vegetation index), a proxy for agricultural productivity, for the most frequently funded crop-types (almonds, grapes, and walnuts) in two California Department of Food and Agriculture programs. Nearly 600 fields receiving funding during the 2014–2022 period were analyzed using two causal inference methods. Fields that received grants to both upgrade irrigation systems and install irrigation water management sensors showed reduced consumptive water use and greenness by an average of 3.5% and 4.2%, respectively (significant at the 10% level). In contrast, we find that the adoption of only irrigation water management sensors, which are designed to inform irrigation scheduling and management, resulted in an average increase of 4.1% and 4.8% in consumptive water use and greenness respectively (significant at the 5% level). We find negligible effects for either consumptive water use or greenness when both pump efficiency upgrades and sensors were implemented. We further find that grants for compost addition and cover cropping led to small greenness increases of 1.7% and 2.8% respectively (significant at the 10% level) and had insignificant effects on consumptive water use. Our analysis of five agri-environmental program interventions reveals that several practice outcomes may be at odds with stated program goals of reducing water use while maintaining or improving agricultural productivity."

Rapid afforestation with commercial tree plantations is transforming fire-prone savannas and grasslands globally and particularly in tropical South America, yet its effects on fire dynamics remain poorly understood. Using hierarchical models, we analyzed trends in annual burned area within concentric buffers (1–6 km) around each of 44 plantation and 52 grassland sites in Colombia’s Orinoquia region—a savanna grassland forest mosaic undergoing major land-use transitions from the expansion of commercial tree plantations. Plantations reduced burned areas in two ways: order-of-magnitude increases in plantation area reduced burnt area by 15% and plantation sites reduced their burnt area by 2% each year; both results consistent with trees replacing more inflammable grassland vegetation. While the mechanisms behind divergent savanna/plantation fire dynamics remain unresolved and could involve active fuel management and fire response, increased canopy cover, or some combination thereof, this study provides spatially explicit, context-sensitive evidence on how land-use transitions interact with fire regimes with direct relevance for savannas and grasslands management and climate adaptation policy in South America."

This study examines uncertainties in Antarctic precipitation projections using simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 and investigates their underlying sources. We find that uncertainties in precipitation projections are substantially larger than those for surface temperature. Integrated precipitation uncertainties are strongly linked to uncertainties in both global and Antarctic surface temperatures, while atmospheric circulation—particularly the Pacific South American modes—plays a critical role in regional precipitation patterns of precipitation uncertainties. Further analysis reveals that tropical sea surface temperatures contribute to uncertainties in Antarctic precipitation patterns through atmospheric teleconnections. These findings highlight the need to improve polar processes in climate models to reduce uncertainties in Antarctic precipitation projections and better predict ice sheet contributions to sea level rise."

Computationally intensive snow reanalysis products and downscaled climate model projections allow for the estimation of historical and projected changes in snow over ∼4–10 km resolutions, but these resolutions are coarse relative to the scales needed for water supply and flood planning. Fine-scale digital elevation models (DEMs) are widely available but are underutilized to make first-order assessments of snow vulnerability. Here, we leverage DEMs at a 7.5 arc s (∼250 m) resolution, combining these with historical freezing level height estimates from ERA-5 to derive estimates of changes in the snow-receiving area (SRA) and its variability across global mountain ranges. Results show estimated SRA declines in 29% (1.9 million km2) of the global mountain area from 1982–2020; 66% of the mountainous areas had no change over the historical period. At +1.5 °C of warming relative to the pre-industrial control, global mountain SRA would decline by 9.5% (1.0 million km2) relative to recent conditions. This loss would be approximately doubled with +2 °C of warming. In a +4 °C warming scenario, an additional 34% (3.6 million km2) of SRA would be lost beyond the +2 °C case. Across individual mountain ranges, SRA losses can occur nonlinearly with warming, with some locations that have historically had relatively minor SRA losses at risk of substantially larger losses in warmer climates. Analysis using coarser-resolution DEMs can underestimate or overestimate SRA and its rate of loss, with the largest impacts in relatively warm, low-elevation mountain ranges. Results of this work provide estimates of projected loss in SRA at policy-relevant warming levels; inform the resolutions needed for process-based snow modeling; identify snow vulnerability hotspots; and provide a new integrated approach to snow vulnerability assessment that is achievable at global scales and highlights potential nonlinearities from recent trends to a variety of future warming scenarios."

However, the key drivers of UGS development and the extent to which their relative importance in different urban contexts remain unclear. This study provides a global analysis of the socio-economic, geographical, and climate determinants of UGS inequality across 11 528 cities by assessing dynamic changes in UGS against the global average. We find that cities in Asia and Africa (6414 cities of 78 countries) are generally converging toward the global mean from below, while those in North America and Europe (1416 cities of 46 countries) gradually lost their relative advantages in UGS development. The relative greenness in 13% of the study cities were mainly influenced by built-up area per capita, in 35% by night lightening index, in 9% by GDP per capita, and in 22% by precipitation. We identified three dominant typologies of drivers: those tied to economic intensity GDP per capita, urbanization pressure (nighttime light index), and biophysical constraints (biome & built-up area). These typologies align with urban developmental pathways from take-off to mature stabilization, revealing a spectrum of stage-specific challenges. These findings underscore that effective UGS strategies should be tailored to local contexts, make reasonable use of urban ecological endowments, adapt to climate constraints, and integrate green space planning into the specific stage of urban development."

Identifying key actors is important for land use theory and for determining whether tree planting can improve rural livelihoods while contributing to environmental goals. To date, tree-planting analyses focus on obvious actors: large-scale businesses (plantations) and rural smallholders (woodlots). However, absentee, urban-based domestic investors are also engaged. Using southern Tanzania as a case study, we attribute tree planting across plantations and woodlots then analyze the potential contribution of the absentee landowners (absentee treefarms). We quantified plantations’ extent by creating and manually verifying a spatial database of planted areas (ca. 2019). We estimated woodlots’ extent by performing a bootstrap extrapolation of average woodlot area based on field surveys of 3436 smallholders across 163 villages. We estimated absentee treefarms’ extent based on interviews with village leaders (n = 36). We corroborated plantations, woodlots, and absentee treefarms against total planted tree cover as observed from remote sensing. The plantations database corresponded well to remote sensing (R = 0.82), but less so for woodlots (R = 0.48). A linear model with only plantations and woodlots explained 38% of the remotely sensed planted tree cover while one that included absentee treefarms explained 54%. Unexplained variation is partly due to omission errors for woodlots: 57% of villages (n = 88) had more woodlots based on interview estimates than based on remote sensing analysis. Villages with far more remotely sensed planted trees compared to interview estimates (11%, n = 17) included absentee treefarm sites. Our findings reveal the role of absentee, urban-based domestic investors in tree planting. More broadly, we show that trees planted in rural areas, even in small patches (5–500 ha) are not necessarily owned by rural residents. Land use attribution must incorporate absentee owners. Similarly, funding for tree planting, particularly when intended to alleviate rural poverty, must address who benefits and not just where tree planting occurs. We recommend triangulating remote sensing with field assessments to attribute ownership to improve the equity and efficacy of tree-planting campaigns."

In this study, we present a fragility-based modeling framework to estimate material replacement needs for building components damaged at specific flood depths. We develop fragility curves for each building component using a triangular cumulative distribution derived from expert judgment due to the lack of empirical data on flood losses, especially at the component level. By combining these estimates with life cycle GHG emissions for each component in a Monte Carlo simulation, we derive probabilistic, emissions-based damage curves for single-family residential structures which comprehensively account for uncertainty in the estimates. We then applied these damage curves to estimate the GHG emissions caused by a 100-year flood in two testbed regions in the Mississippi River Valley. Our results show that including the social costs of GHG emissions can increase the valuation of total flood damages by over 6%. Our results also show that flood impact estimates are highly uncertain our model can be used by planners in cost-benefit analyses of flood risk management projects to show that such projects are more economically efficient than current methods would report."

While previous studies have examined vegetation responses to individual historical ECEs, knowledge of future vegetation dynamics under combined extreme climate stressors remains limited. Here, we simulated historical net primary productivity (NPP) (1982–2020) using the Carnegie–Ames–Stanford model, identified key extreme climate factors through geographical detector method (GDM), and projected future NPP variations (2023–2100) under different climate scenarios using partial least squares regression. Results showed that 72.3% of IM experienced increasing NPP during 1982–2020, with 28.2% showing significant increase, mainly in northeastern and eastern regions. Consecutive wet days, heavy precipitation days, cold nights, and maximum temperature were identified as key contributors to NPP changes, with explanatory powers of 0.903, 0.781, 0.704 and 0.630, respectively. Projections under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios indicated NPP increases in southern IM, while eastern and western regions showed significant decreases under combined extreme climate stressors.

However, the magnitude of this thermal buffering is strongly influenced by forest structure and management, and remains understudied. Using a comprehensive dataset of in-situ microclimate time series and high-resolution forest inventory data in Finland, we provide the first country-wide estimate of microclimate temperature buffering in boreal forests. We found that only 17% of forestry land has buffered climatic conditions, while in one-quarter of the land, temperature variation is amplified primarily due to low canopy cover in young stands. The microclimatic buffering patterns vary with biogeographical gradients. The extensive impact of forestry on boreal microclimates highlights the enormous potential of forest management to maintain stable temperatures. Prioritizing management practices that preserve canopy cover can help promote buffered microclimates in boreal forests."

While aerosols constitute a significant air pollutant that impairs PV generation efficiency, few studies have examined how China’s clean air action (CAA) plan has influenced solar PV performance. To address this gap, we employ the PVLIB-Python model to quantify PV capacity factors and power generation changes across China, due to the CAA plan in China from 2013 to 2020. We find that improved air quality has substantially enhanced PV generation, particularly in eastern China, generating up to 41.3 TWh additional electricity per year, estimated with current PV capacity. The largest increases are in provinces such as Shandong and Henan, with heavier air pollution and higher PV installation. By employing multiple CMIP6 models, we also estimate potential future PV power generation changes in China. We find that with sustainable development and strong climate change mitigation policies, the reduced air pollution and increased solar radiation can potentially increase the PV power generation by 37.4–52.6 TWh per year by the 2050s, without even considering the newly installed PV facilities."

We summarize the evidence to date for borealization of plant and animal communities in tundra ecosystems and the different approaches that can be used to quantify borealization. We discuss how land-use change is interacting with climate change, leading to species and community reorganization in colder biomes, and the consequences of borealization for food webs, ecosystem functions and northern livelihoods.

In this study, we developed a probabilistic modeling framework to quantify the peak discharges and flood volumes of potential GLOFs with return periods ranging from 10 to 500 years for the eastern Tibetan Plateau with over 11 000 glacial lakes. The results indicate that the GLOF peak discharge increases from 0.5 × 103 m3 s−1 at a 10 year return period to over ∼8.6 × 103 m3 s−1 at a 500 year return period, whereas the flood volume increases from ∼1.42 × 106 m3 to ∼20.17 × 106 m3. Future climate change will likely increase the GLOF magnitude, with peak discharge (100 year return period) increasing from ∼3.3 × 103 m3 s−1 in 2015 to ∼3.8 × 103 m3 s−1 in 2100 under the RCP8.5. We further evaluated the GLOF magnitude along the Sichuan–Tibet Railway and identified railway segments crossing the Yarlung Zangbo, Salween, and Jinsha rivers as high hazard areas, where the projected peak discharge exceeded ∼2.5 × 103 m3 s−1 and flood volume surpassed ∼9.1 × 106 m3 in 2100 under RCP8.5. These results underscore the urgent need to integrate GLOF hazards into infrastructure design and enhance the predictive capacity for potential GLOF impacts on river ecosystems, water quality and landscape evolution."

However, the impacts of climate changes and human activities on historical and future GWS remain insufficiently quantified. Here, we integrate remote sensing, Earth system modeling, and artificial intelligence (AI) to assess historical trends and project future evolutions in GWS across HMA. Remote sensing reveals that approximately 69% of the regions experienced GWS declines during 2003–2020, with annual losses totaling −24.2 Gt, particularly in densely populated and irrigated downstream basins such as Ganges–Brahmaputra and Indus. Using a Transformer-based framework, we attribute 47% of GWS variability to direct climate drivers and an additional 15% to cryospheric processes, while human activities contribute up to 38% of declines. The identified GWS decline in downstream basins along with its intensifying pattern is further corroborated by 2554 in situ groundwater well observations. Our data-driven projections further indicate a sustained climate-induced threat to groundwater sustainability in high-risk basins through the end of the century when maintaining current water-use levels. While cryospheric melt may temporarily offset losses until the 2060s, this buffering effect will diminish over time and lead to accelerated depletion under climate warming. This study demonstrates the value of combining remote sensing with explainable AI to improve groundwater assessment and support climate-resilient water management in high mountain regions worldwide."

Addressing this dilemma requires quantitative methods to synthesize information across climate realizations, which are lacking in the energy systems community. This research presents a decision-making framework that centers a variability index to quantify resource adequacy (RA) contributions of investments across potential climate realizations. The research framework is applied to the Western U.S. power system, with a focus on California RA outcomes, by integrating dynamically downscaled data from five climate models with an RA model that simulates generator outages and optimizes transmission and storage operations. This framework finds investment portfolios can have highly variable RA contributions between climate models. For instance, a wind-and-battery portfolio reduces expected unserved energy by 78% in one climate model but by only 47% in another. This range of behaviors yields a variability index of 0.65 for the wind-and-battery investment, much higher than a variability index of 0.2 for a solar-only investment portfolio that achieves more consistent RA reductions. By combining the variability index with a benefit metric, this work shows a frontier of investment options that illuminate trade-offs for decision-makers and synthesize outcomes across plausible climate realizations."

This study demonstrates that converting associated gas into transportation fuels at wellheads can help mitigate climate change and improve sustainability. By employing cost–benefit analysis, life cycle assessment, and health impact evaluations, it compares benefits across the United States, Russia, Nigeria, and China. Valuing one billion cubic meters of associated gas reveals significant economic ($209–$639 million), climate (2.05 million metric tons CO2 averted), and health benefits (25–461 avoided deaths). This triple benefit underscores the potential for an industry shift from flaring to fuel production and encourages policymakers and financial institutions to support gas valorization initiatives."

This study presents two novel analytical methods for nitro compound quantification without the need for compound-specific standards: a batch UV254 photolysis coupled with colorimetry for total nitro, and liquid chromatography with postcolumn photolysis (LC-PCUV) for individual compounds. Both methods rely on photolytic nitrite formation as a proxy for nitro compounds, yielding average molar nitrite yields of 68 ± 17% for aliphatic compounds and 11 ± 11% for aromatic compounds. The methods demonstrated high sensitivity in complex matrices, achieving detection limits down to a few nM nitro-equivalent when combined with solid phase extraction. A proof-of-concept ozonation experiment with model amines and amino acids confirmed the applicability of the methods, providing new insights into γ-aminobutyric acid ozonation. Notably, it is reported here for the first time that over 20% of amine-containing moieties in extracted natural organic matter can be converted to nitro during ozonation. Significant nitro concentrations (140–180 nM) were also detected in wastewater effluents and found to further increase upon ozonation. Together, these methods offer valuable tools to investigate the fate of reactive nitrogen moieties and nitro formation, including (halo)nitroalkanes during oxidative water treatment."

This study investigated croplands across multiple tillage chronosequences by integrating dye tracing, 15N isotope tracing, and metagenomic techniques. The study shows that tillage-induced degradation of preferential flow structures homogenizes the vadose zone and reshapes N-cycling communities, shifting denitrifiers from nirK- to nirS-dominated assemblages. Consistent with this community turnover, gross nitrification rates in shallow preferential paths are 30.8% higher than in the adjacent matrix in short-term tillage, whereas in deep layers matrix denitrification and DNRA rates exceed those in preferential paths by 37.9 and 76.1%, and anammox appears only in the matrix at medium- and long-term tillage, indicating a concentration of reductive N processes in the matrix. Path analysis further shows that tillage-driven alterations in hydraulic properties (path coefficient = −0.91, p < 0.01), together with these community and process-rate shifts, redirect the dominant N pathway from hotspot-driven nitrification in preferential channels to matrix-driven reductive N loss, converting a nitrate-leaching-prone system into one with higher gaseous emission potential. This establishes a mechanistic link linking soil hydraulic degradation to N functional succession and supports targeted, stage-dependent farmland nitrogen management."

Tween 80 (P80) may trigger IBD; however, its underlying mechanism of action has not been fully clarified, especially with respect to diet-induced susceptibility. This study systematically investigated the effect of P80 on the IBD development in male mice on a normal diet and high-fat diet (HFD) at an acceptable daily intake level. After 6 weeks of oral exposure to P80 (0.1, 1, 6%), the high-dose group of mice exhibited a significant increase in the disease activity index, a significant body weight loss, and a severe inflammatory response, with HFD markedly augmenting these effects. Multiomics results indicated that P80 exposure disrupted intestinal tryptophan metabolism and significantly reduced indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) levels. In vivo intestinal inflammation was transcriptionally regulated by genes related to the AhR/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway. Supplementing with IAA can improve inflammatory effects. In vitro studies confirmed that P80 exposure inhibited Lactobacillus from producing IAA, leading to an increase in the level of intestinal inflammation. This study revealed the specific toxic mechanism of P80-induced IBD and found that dietary factors have a synergistic toxic effect, providing new insights into the health risk assessment of environmental pollutants."

However, the spatiotemporal evolution of environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) and their associated phytotoxicity remain poorly understood. This study addresses these knowledge gaps through a 60-day lettuce cultivation experiment conducted in soils amended with both pristine and photoaged TWPs of different particle sizes. Our results reveal a photoaging-dependent response in EPFR concentrations, peaking at moderate exposure (equivalent to 280 days of sunlight) before declining with extended aging (equivalent to 605 days of sunlight). Comparatively, stable EPFRs demonstrate higher persistence than reactive EPFRs. EPFR stability also exhibits strong particle size dependence, with TWP diameters <100 μm showing faster decay than larger particles (100–425 μm) under extended simulated irradiation (280 → 605 days). Comprehensive analyses of plant physiological parameters and antioxidant responses, combined with EPFR quenching experiments, demonstrate that the phytotoxicity of TWPs to lettuce is predominantly mediated by EPFR concentration dynamics and photoaging-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Interestingly, smaller TWPs show decreased ROS generation owing to restricted soil aeration but induce comparable or greater toxicity to lettuce and soil microorganisms than larger particles, highlighting particle size as a critical regulator of TWP toxicity beyond oxidative mechanisms."

Outdoor benzene concentrations peaked during Phase 1, with a median (interquartile range) of 0.38 (0.27) ppb, decreased over time, and remained below the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment health benchmarks. Compared with the active burning period, indoor-to-outdoor ratios of m,p-xylene (p = 0.004), carbon tetrachloride (p = 0.002), and heptane (p = 0.02) were significantly higher in the postfire period. Elevated VOC levels were particularly evident in uninhabited homes within burn zones, suggesting ongoing indoor emissions from smoke-impacted materials. These findings raise concerns about indoor air quality postwildfire and the potential for prolonged exposure, underscoring the need for targeted mitigation and ongoing monitoring to protect public health during recovery."

Z. Williams;Avner Vengosh,Discrepancies between pH and Corrosive Indices of Hypersaline Effluents,"Determining the pH of hypersaline wastewater is essential for regulatory compliance and the feasibility of geochemical and treatment processes. Hypersaline solutions have high ionic strength, which introduces deviations among measured proton activity, its concentration, and potential acidity. Here, we evaluate these deviations with theoretical simulations and by modeling hypersaline lithium brines from South America and produced waters from U.S. oil and gas operations (n > 60 000). We show that when the ionic strength increases above 2 m, proton activity coefficients steadily increase above unity. This causes the pH value to overestimate proton concentration. As this discrepancy increases, the pH alone cannot be used to accurately evaluate the solution’s corrosivity by features such as the saturation index (SI) or calcium carbonate precipitation potential (CCPP). Our analysis reveals that 5% of the investigated produced waters showed pH values of <6 but positive CCPP or SI values, undermining pH as a single regulatory indicator of corrosivity. Accurate evaluation of hypersaline effluent corrosivity requires the utilization of advanced tools such as the PHREEQC software with the Pitzer model. This approach ensures a more reliable characterization of the potential hypersaline effluent corrosivity and thus more efficient management and policy."

Using MODIS vegetation indices to trigger drought response, the $14 million program supported over 452,000 people. It generated $11.1 million in immediate emergency aid savings, achieving a total return on investment of approximately 2.9 and an Internal Economic Rate of Return of 28.2%. This commentary synthesizes lessons from program implementation, highlighting that institutional and financial barriers, rather than technical limitations, now constrain the scaling of this EO‐driven climate resilience mechanism. While the program successfully integrated satellite data with transparent triggers and financial instruments, its sustainability depended on financial commitment extending beyond experimental phases. As climate risks intensify globally, Uganda's experience demonstrates that data‐triggered financing can operate within government institutions, but successful replication requires prioritizing institutional architecture and sustained financing over technical perfection."

Here, we use two‐dimensional numerical simulations to investigate trace element transport during compaction‐driven flow involving porosity waves and channelization caused by decompaction weakening. We employ a small‐amplitude porosity perturbation to study fluid segregation. A data collapse of systematic numerical results quantifies how the increase in channelization intensity cancels out the decrease in trace element transport caused by retardation, showing that channelized porosity waves enable segregated trace element mass transport. We illustrate changes of trace element distributions during fluid migration using multi‐element (spider) and ternary diagrams as well as trace element profiles across channels."

ECAPE modifies traditional CAPE to account for the dependence of entrainment on the vertical wind shear, the lifted condensation level (LCL) height, and the properties of a cloud's surrounding atmosphere. ECAPE shows stronger pattern correlations with global regions of intense thunderstorms than previous metrics for updraft speed. In these regions, large CAPE, large shear, and high LCLs conspire to produce wide updrafts that are shielded from the negative effects of dry‐air entrainment. ECAPE more skillfully discriminates intense thunderstorms from their less intense counterparts than other metrics commonly used in climatology and climate change studies of thunderstorms. We provide evidence that the well‐known land‐sea contrast in thunderstorm intensity is a consequence of larger CAPE and higher LCL heights over land than over the ocean."

 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pose inconsistent yet increasing threats to freshwater reservoirs worldwide, with implications for ecosystem health and water security. Although local-scale contamination has been widely documented, a comprehensive global synthesis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon occurrence and drivers in reservoirs remains lacking. Here we developed a framework of data compilation, arrangement and statistics to integrate existing data to determine the geographical distribution and potential sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pollution in reservoirs globally. Statistical analyses revealed spatial heterogeneity in dominant components and pollution levels across continents. Almost 38% of water samples exceeded an ecologically relevant threshold (0.20 μg l−1), and 42% of sediment samples surpassed the threshold effect concentration, indicating widespread ecological risks. Cluster analysis and source apportionment of the reservoir-level data identified three distinct polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon patterns, each shaped by region-specific land-use practices, combustion sources and climatic factors.

 Nitrogen is indispensable for global food production and ecosystem carbon sequestration, but excess nitrogen leads to water eutrophication, soil acidification and air pollution. Atmospheric nitrogen deposition is a key yet uncertain component of the biogeochemical cycle. Currently, global networks monitoring particulate nitrogen dry deposition rely mainly on measured concentrations and modelled dry deposition velocities, which remain poorly constrained. Here we develop a spatially explicit dataset by integrating observation-constrained size distribution and dry deposition mechanisms to re-evaluate atmospheric nitrogen deposition across China. We reveal that atmospheric chemistry models underestimate the particle size of fine-mode nitrogen-containing aerosols in China by more than twofold. Additionally, dry particle deposition velocity estimates with different mechanisms diverge by up to two orders of magnitude. Our corrections indicate that atmospheric chemistry models and China’s observation network underestimate particulate nitrogen dry deposition by 2–5 times. Furthermore, most Earth system models underestimate particulate dry deposition of ammonium, a major nitrogen species, by 31%–98%. By integrating these corrections into the Community Land Model, we demonstrate that the effect of nitrogen deposition on China’s terrestrial net ecosystem productivity may have been underestimated by 9%–13%. As China contributes nearly 20% of global nitrogen deposition, its impact on terrestrial carbon sinks and ecosystem health could be greater than previously recognized. Atmospheric chemistry models and observation networks in China may underestimate particulate dry nitrogen deposition due to inadequate representation of the particle size distribution and dry deposition mechanisms, impacting nitrogen deposition modelling used for public health decisions and climate change projections."

 Variations in Earth’s orbit pace global ice-volume and sea-level changes, but the variability in the response for different sectors of the Antarctic Ice Sheet to orbitally forced climate change remains unclear. Here we present geological records of iceberg-rafted debris and other proxies from locations adjacent to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) with comparisons to an existing East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) record over the time interval ~3.3–2.3 million years ago. Iceberg calving events from the WAIS recorded in Ross Sea sediment cores show a linear response to orbital forcing at timescales corresponding to obliquity (~40,000 years) and precession (~23,000–19,000 years) modulated by eccentricity (~100,000 years). This contrasts with an existing record adjacent to the EAIS, which does not contain obliquity pacing. Combined with ice-sheet model sensitivity tests, the geological data show that the WAIS is highly dynamic and responsive to oceanic melt driven by changes in Southern Ocean circulation, together with atmospheric forcing through variations in local insolation. Conversely, the EAIS appears less responsive to oceanic forcing, despite being the dominant source of meltwater to the global ocean during the mid-Pliocene. Our results imply a substantial role for atmospheric warming on mid-Pliocene sea-level from both WAIS and EAIS.

 Climate change impinges on the Arctic Ocean, leading to sea-ice loss and potentially drastic cascading ecosystem changes. A recent process is atlantification, the growing influence of warm and salty waters from the Atlantic on the Arctic with increasing ocean volume transport from the Nordic Seas to the Barents Sea playing a key role. Despite its importance and a multitude of hypotheses that have been tested, this trend remains mainly unexplained. Here we explore nonlinear effects and successfully link the flow trend through the Barents Sea Opening to a frequency shift of atmospheric synoptic. We show that a part of the flow through Barents Sea Opening is driven by topographic Rossby waves, and that they have a very sensitive response to atmospheric frequency over the Nordic Seas. These findings highlight how anthropogenic changes to the atmosphere are altering ocean processes, with implications for sea-ice extent and ecosystems in the Arctic.

Using a high-resolution multiyear dataset in China, researchers show the historically massive contributions of these emissions during past decades of rapid urbanization and the potential risks for future climate goals. 
 Long-term effects of massive building material use in China, which experienced intense urbanization in the past two decades, remain insufficiently explored. Here, to fill these gaps, we developed a high-resolution time-series database of building material stocks from 2000 to 2019 and found that China held 15% of the global stock, which accounted for 19% of the country’s total carbon emissions. Although rapid urbanization generally increased per capita building material stock, the extent of this increase varied across cities and building types. We show that the growth rate has slowed since 2016; however, it remains challenging to simultaneously achieve both carbon-neutrality and urbanization goals. Future urbanization in China is projected to consume 12.5% of the nation’s total 1.5 °C carbon budget and 37.4% of its average annual budget allocation. Addressing these challenges requires targeted urban interventions, such as aligning low-carbon material production with projected regional demand and strategically planning materials recycling from future building demolitions. Reducing the embodied carbon emissions of building material stock is essential for mitigation. Using a high-resolution multiyear dataset in China, researchers show the historically massive contributions of these emissions during past decades of rapid urbanization and the potential risks for future climate goals."

A study now finds that emissions could be halved cost-effectively by 2050 through targeted and prioritized measures, with benefits far outweighing costs. 
 Excess ammonia (NH3) emissions from human activities pose severe threats to global ecosystems and human health. Although urgent control of NH3 emissions is needed, a comprehensive quantification of mitigation strategies and their cost-effectiveness is lacking on a global scale. Here we employ a multi-model framework to evaluate 32 mitigation measures across 7 sectors in 185 countries. Our analysis reveals that strategic implementation of technological and non-technological (policy and behavioural) measures could reduce global NH3 emissions by up to 60% at an average cost of US$7.4 per kilogram of NH3. The estimated implementation cost of US$274 ± 116 billion is far outweighed by the resulting environmental, health and resource benefits, which we indicatively estimate at US$722 ± 302 billion. Priority action in China and India could yield the largest net gains, whereas Sub-Saharan Africa faces limited cost-effectiveness owing to structural and economic barriers. Future scenarios indicate that ambitious implementation pathways could halve NH3 emissions by 2050, whereas weak climate action and inadequate nitrogen regulations would drive continued emission growth, leading to substantial environmental deterioration. These findings highlight both the feasibility and urgency of integrating NH3 control into multi-objective policies for food security, air quality and sustainable development.

 High spatiotemporal resolution land surface temperature (LST) is essential for climate-impact studies, particularly for urban thermal environment analyses and vegetation phenology tracking. However, current satellite sensors exhibit inherent hardware trade-offs: Sentinel-2 (S2) provides high-resolution (10 m/5 day) optical observations without thermal capability, whereas Landsat-8/9 (L8/9), equipped with both optical and thermal sensors, suffers from coarser resolution (30 m/16 day). This configuration fails to meet the demand for fine spatial and dense temporal surface thermal monitoring. To address this gap, we propose a novel fusion framework for high spatiotemporal resolution LST generation (fHiSTR-LST). It first applies a deep-learning-based spatiotemporal fusion to densify reflectance data, then performs a spatial-spectral fusion to generate high-resolution LST. By synergizing L8/9 and S2 data, our approach reliably produces 10 m spatial-resolution LST across three overpass scenarios (joint, L8/9-only, S2-only), thus achieving an effective ∼3-day temporal resolution. Cross-validations between upscaled LST predictions and native L8/9 LST demonstrate fHiSTR-LST's robust performance across eight study areas worldwide (mean R = 0.90, RMSE = 1.17 K). More significantly, ground-truth validation—previously unaddressed—confirms its satisfactory accuracy (mean R = 0.97, RMSE = 3.45 K). The combined validation shows that fHiSTR-LST outperforms the state-of-the-art by 13 % in R and reduces RMSE by 9 %. Finally, we illustrate two applications—small-area vegetation-phenology tracking and fine-scale urban thermal-pattern delineation—which collectively showcase fHiSTR-LST's capability to resolve subtle surface thermal variations. Our study bridges a critical gap in generating high spatiotemporal resolution LST from satellite imagery, a capability crucial for investigating the nuanced effects of global warming."

 Liangping District, located in the northeastern part of the Sichuan Basin (SCB), is a representative site for studying black carbon (BC) aerosol pollution within the basin. Field measurements of BC mass concentration were conducted continuously from March to May 2021 using an Aethalometer (AE33). The mean BC mass concentration was determined to be 2.4 μg m−3. The aerosol optical properties were derived through application of the Aethalometer model, yielding an average absorption coefficient of 36.7 ± 20.1 Mm−1 at 520 nm with a corresponding absorption Ångström exponent (AAE) of 1.40 ± 0.12. During the observation period, two six-day pollution events (designated as Event Mar and Event May) were recorded, with PM2.5 concentrations exceeding the first-class ambient air quality standards threshold of 35 μg m−3. The maximum AAE was 1.70 during Event Mar compared to 1.43 during Event May. The elevated AAE value in Event Mar suggested increased biomass burning constituted a significant pollution source, whereas the lower AAE during Event May reflected a mixed source dominated by fossil fuel combustion. Non-parametric wind regression (NWR) analysis revealed that high BC concentrations were spatially concentrated in the southwestern region during Event Mar, whereas during Event May, elevated BC levels originated from multiple directions. Concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) analysis indicated that during Event Mar, long-range transport played a more dominant role, whereas local emissions were the primary pollution source during Event May. The study of the two pollution events identified the primary sources of BC, providing a method for analyzing the characteristics of aerosol pollution in SCB and offering a basis for developing pollution control measures."

However, despite many years of intense research, no clear consensus on its mechanism has emerged. Here, we demonstrate that high survival under antibiotics may originate from two fundamentally different growth-arrest archetypes: either from a regulated growth arrest, leading to a protected dormant cellular state, or from a dysregulated disrupted growth arrest. Using modeling and experimental approaches including transcriptomics, microcalorimetry, and microfluidics, we unveil the characteristics and vulnerabilities of each growth-arrest archetype. In particular, disrupted bacteria show a general impairment of membrane homeostasis. This understanding resolves previous conflicting results regarding characteristics of persisters and allows tailoring treatments that target the different growth-arrested bacteria. The fundamental distinction between regulated and disrupted growth arrests should be broadly relevant for the description of cells under stress."

Although knocking down theTTRgene by CRISPR-Cas9 represents a promising strategy for treating ATTR amyloidosis, its efficiency and safety remain to be further investigated. Here, we report a systematic investigation of SpCas9-basedTTRediting. Besides the target site, wild-type SpCas9 and the reported variants induced extensive off-target edits. To improve the fidelity, we performed structural analysis and designed a series of SpCas9 variants. Studies demonstrated that SpCas9-Mut5 is an ultrahigh-fidelity variant, which induces extremely low levels of off-target edits and translocations without substantial impairment of on-target editing activity. SpCas9-Mut5 is compatible with the adenine base editor (ABE) system, markedly reducing off-target edits and narrowing the editing window. In conclusion, our study suggests that SpCas9-Mut5 is an excellent candidate forTTRgene editing.

Figueroa,Synergistic intragenic epigenetic deregulation by IDH2 and SRSF2 mutations causes mis-splicing of key transcriptional regulators,"Genes affecting DNA methylation (DNAme) are frequently comutated with splicing factors in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and associate with more aggressive phenotypes. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we deeply profiled wild-type andIDH2R140Q/SRSF2P95single- or double-mutant AMLs. We find a unique set of mis-spliced genes and differentially methylated CpGs in double mutants. Mis-spliced exons are enriched in CCNG splicing enhancers and in the corresponding DNAme changes. Using a machine learning model, we can accurately predict exon inclusion levels from proximal CpGs. These CpGs are more likely to overlap footprints of RNA binding and chromatin-modifying complexes but not transcription factors. We also report unique gene expression profiles associated with each genotype; however, the differentially expressed genes do not overlap with mis-spliced transcripts. Instead, the mis-spliced genes encode for proteins that interact with the complexes regulating these differentially expressed genes. Thus, aberrant DNAme and splicing lead to the mis-splicing of key regulatory complexes, resulting in the aberrant gene expression profiles characteristic of these AMLs."

The earliest putative hominin,Sahelanthropus tchadensis(~7 million years old), was originally represented by a cranium, the reconstruction of which suggested to its discoverers thatSahelanthropuscarried its head in a manner similar to known bipedal hominins. Recently, two partial ulnae and a femur shaft were announced as evidence in support of the contention thatSahelanthropuswas an early biped, but those interpretations have been challenged. Here, while we find that both limb bones are most similar in size and geometric morphometric shape to chimpanzees (genusPan), we demonstrate that their relative proportion is more hominin-like. Furthermore, we confirm two features linked to hominin-like hip and knee function and identify a femoral tubercle, a feature only found in bipedal hominins. Our results suggest thatSahelanthropuswas an early biped that evolved from aPan-like Miocene ape ancestor."

The structure of two-dimensional (2D) carbon materials, however, is mainly driven by the pyrolysis temperature, pressure, and organic gas flow rates. Here, we report the synthesis of a centimeter-sized nanocrystalline graphene monolayer from pyrolyzing a Langmuir monolayer of a hexa(terpyridine)hexaphenylbenzene polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) yielding a 2D carbon material with a thickness of 0.36 ± 0.07 nm. By designing the amphiphilic PAHs and reducing intermolecular π-π stacking interactions, a monolayer of horizontally aligned PAH was obtained at the water-air interface. During the pyrolysis, the monolayer served as a molecularly thin solid carbon source, leading to the controlled preparation of an electrically insulating nanocrystalline graphene monolayer. Our work proposes a 2D carbon material formed from the initial assembly of PAH monolayer at the water-air interface and subsequent pyrolysis and offers a modular strategy for designing nanocrystalline 2D films."

Here, we identify previously unknown pathways required for antigen (Ag)–specific tolerogenic immune-modifying particle/Cour nanoparticle (TIMP/CNP)–induced tolerance. The data show that myeloid cells phagocytose CNPs, undergo apoptosis, and release oxidized DNA [8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHG)]. Subsequently, Ag-specific CNP treatment increases the number of PD-L1+cDC2 dendritic cells and the number of FoxP3+, CTLA-4+, PD-1+, and IL-10+regulatory CD4+T cells via a stimulator of interferon genes (STING)/interferon-α/β receptor (IFNAR)–dependent pathway. In addition, these same pathways were found to be required for both Ag-coupled apoptotic leukocyte–induced and Ag-coupled red blood cell treatment–induced CD4+T cell tolerance. Together, these results show that Ag-specific tolerance induced by the presence of apoptotic cells, and by CNP-induced apoptosis, requires the STING/IFNAR pathway, thereby illustrating a previously unknown function of this pathway."

To reveal the mechanisms, we investigated cuticle morphogenesis inDrosophilaolfactory organs, where hundreds of ~50-nanometer nanopores in the cuticle covering the olfactory neurons permit selective odorant entry. We showed that zona pellucida domain (ZPD) proteins form the cell type–specific ECM compartments before cuticle secretion, and its disruption leads to less and irregularly sized nanopores. The ZPD protein Dusky-like controls the formation of the outermost layer of the cuticle, the envelope. Trynity, Nyobe, Neo, and Morpheyus form matrices with specific mixing and sorting properties, termed “cloud ECM,” which restrict cell growth and movement. This work identifies a previously unidentified role for ZPD proteins as modular units that establish the mechanical environment essential for nanoscale ECM morphogenesis, opening a previously unexplored context for these biomimetically important structures."

In contrast, certain magnetic semiconductors, such as chromium nitride (CrN), exhibit an increased thermal conductivity above its Néel temperature, predicted to be caused by strong spin-phonon coupling. However, this hypothesis lacks experimental verification and detailed understanding. Here, we present conclusive experimental evidence showing that the enhanced thermal conductivity in CrN arises from anomalous temperature-dependent acoustic phonon lifetimes, driven by a dynamic coupling between spin fluctuations and acoustic phonons in the system. Temperature-dependent inelastic x-ray scattering measurements reveal that acoustic phonon lifetimes in CrN are strongly suppressed near Néel temperature but anomalously increase at higher temperatures. In contrast, the optical phonon lifetime decreases with rising temperature, akin to a nonmagnetic semiconductor, as it remains unaffected by spin-phonon coupling. This finding unveils the microscopic origin of anomalous heat transport behavior in magnetostructurally coupled materials, offering a pathway for effective thermal management in magnetic material–based devices."

Our study investigates global changes in messenger RNA (mRNA) abundance in the THP-1 cell line, a monocyte-macrophage lineage known for plasticity and immune reprogramming features. We identified pathways positively enriched with genes affecting muscle and cardiac contraction, neuronal system, and sensory perception. Available computational models identified links with health issues, including cardiac, neurological, muscular, and renal disorders and alterations in senses. Specific mechanistic networks were identified: retinoid metabolism, cAMP (adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate)/CREB (cAMP response element–binding protein) signaling, and glutamatergic receptor signaling, which were associated with changes in vision, sleep, and movement, respectively. A considerable reduction is observed in E2F-regulated transcription of G2-M and DNA repair genes. A c-myc–regulated mRNA splicing pathway was identified and found commonly down-regulated in other mission datasets. Our results offer a stimulating framework for several health states encountered during spaceflight and can be further used as an accelerated disease and drug discovery model."

We present the first 11 ancient genomes of HHV-6A and HHV-6B, dating as far back as the 8th to 6th century BCE. We demonstrate that large fractions of current HHV-6 diversity were already established by the 14th century CE. Our data corroborate that HHV-6A/6B integrations stem from ancient founder events. In addition, we show that all known inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6A clades were already represented in historical populations, confirming that HHV-6A no longer integrates into the germ line within populations of European ancestry and likely endogenized in early human history."

Using 12-hour satellite-derived fire tracking data from 2012 to 2023, we show that the merging of separate ignitions into multi-ignition complexes is a key process amplifying fire size and destructive potential across temperate and boreal ecoregions. Multi-ignition fires account for 31% of the burned area in California and 59% in the Arctic-boreal domain, spread faster and persist longer than single-ignition fires, and disproportionately contribute to extreme fire years in California, Canada, and Siberia. They also generate stronger atmospheric feedbacks, produce more pyrocumulonimbus events, and strain firefighting capacity by dispersing suppression resources. Recognizing and accounting for fire-merging dynamics are critical for improving wildfire prediction, risk assessment, and management."

Compared with other types of micelles, our results demonstrated that amphiphilic micelles formed by DSPE-PCB [carboxybetaine polymer conjugated to 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DB)] exhibited superior physicochemical properties for mucus penetration. Furthermore, we found that incorporating a conformationally adaptive azobenzene (Azo) intermediate into DB further enhanced this effect by modulating mechanical properties of micelle. By tuning DB/DAB ratios during self-assembly, we generated a micelle library with adjustable deformability (1- to 40-fold). The enhanced mucus penetration ability led to a nearly fourfold reduction in the retention time of DSPE-Azo-PCB (DAB) micelles in respiratory mucus, significantly increasing drug accumulation in lung tissue and reducing irritation to the respiratory tract.

However, FOXN3 becomes unstable in response to profibrotic stimuli. This study identifies poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase–1 (PARP1) as a stabilizing partner of FOXN3, preventing its degradation by blocking p38-mediated phosphorylation. Lung-specific knockout (KO) of PARP1 promotes the development of pulmonary fibrosis by reducing the abundance of FOXN3. Conditional overexpression of FOXN3 notably mitigates pulmonary fibrosis resulting from PARP1 KO by impeding Smad signaling, underscoring the critical role of the PARP1-FOXN3 axis in pulmonary fibrosis. Mechanistically, p38 is a Smad response gene that is transcriptionally repressed by the PARP1/FOXN3 complex. The disruption of PARP1 or FOXN3 increases p38 expression, which in turn facilitates FOXN3 degradation through a feedback mechanism. This cascade activates Smad signaling, leading to a profibrotic response and myofibroblast activation. Notably, levels of PARP1 and FOXN3 are significantly reduced in patients with pulmonary fibrosis, highlighting PARP1’s crucial role in suppressing the disease by regulating FOXN3-mediated Smad signaling."

Protein condensates have been implicated in bacterial dormancy, yet how these assemblies orchestrate dormancy entry remains unclear. We evolved persisters that enter dormancy before the stationary phase, most harboring mutations inserS, encoding seryl-transfer RNA synthetase (SerRS). These variants recapitulated persistence induced by serine hydroxamate (SHX), a serine analog and SerRS inhibitor. Both theserSmutation and SHX treatment trigger SerRS sequestration into conserved DEAD-box adenosine triphosphatase–associated condensates, coinciding with growth arrest and dormancy. In vitro, the SerRS variant preferentially partitions into DeaD granules, consistent with its distinct in vivo localization. Microscopy revealed spatially restricted translation silencing within condensates upon SerRS partitioning. Together, these phase-separated condensates act as hubs that coordinate the transition from proliferation to dormancy, paralleling eukaryotic cell fate control via localized translation. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into bacterial persistence and suggest that targeting condensates could help combat antibiotic tolerance and delay resistance."

Fibrocartilage has poor self-repair capacity after OA, leading to restricted treatment strategies and unsatisfying clinical efficacy. Recently, we constructed the spatiotemporal multiomic landscape of fibrocartilage and connective tissue in human temporomandibular joint (TMJ)–OA, observing that adjacent connective tissue could transform to fibrocartilage in TMJ-OA. We found that theCOL5A1+fibroblast population, derived from perivascular niche, contributes to fibrocartilaginous extracellular matrix (ECM) transformation. Multijoint analysis showed that integrin αV/β5was universally activated in OA joints, which led to increased fibrocartilaginous transcription but disarranged ECM transformation in connective tissues. In OA mouse models and a TMJ-OA miniature pig model, inhibition of integrin αV/β5activity using cilengitide facilitated the transcriptional reprogramming ofCol5a1+fibroblast and functional remodeling of the connective tissues.

Intracavity generation of OAM beams, such as OAM lasers, efficiently produces high-power, high–beam-quality vortices. This scheme, however, remains rarely explored in acoustics. Here, we propose and demonstrate an acoustic intracavity OAM generation mechanism with tunable topological charges via a single nonreciprocal nonlinear boundary in a compact resonator ring. In the linear regime, the boundary creates non-Hermitian complex effective magnetic fields piercing the ring, leading to a non-Hermitian Zeeman-like effect that splits clockwise and counterclockwise eigenmodes. Upon incorporation of nonlinearity to the boundary, all resonators are mutually locked, producing a single-mode self-oscillatory OAM radiation exhibiting hysteresis and bistability. Moreover, the topological charge is tunable by manipulating the boundary. Our work reveals intriguing physics related to nonlinear, non-Hermitian boundaries and offers potentials in the next generation of acoustic self-oscillatory OAM sources, switchers, and memory devices."

Here, we unexpectedly find that DMTF1, a transcription factor that regulates the Arf/p53 axis in cancer, is down-regulated in the NSCs of a premature aging model driven by telomerase deficiency. DMTF1 up-regulation was able to rescue the impaired proliferation of telomere dysfunctional NSCs. Mechanistically, DMTF1 regulates the transcription of Arid2 and Ss18 genes, two subunits of the SWI/SNF complexes that mediate H3K27ac at E2F gene promoters to promote NSC proliferation. Accordingly, Arid2 or Ss18 depletion phenocopies DMTF1 loss in reducing H3K27ac levels, expression of E2F target genes, and NSC proliferation.

By measuring the dynamic changes in phycosphere carbonate chemistry around single diatom cells, we show that DIC uptake is rapidly modulated. We find that external carbonic anhydrase (eCA) plays a major role in DIC uptake in large centric diatoms at ambient seawater CO2, but there is a strong switch to direct HCO3−uptake under low CO2. Inhibition of eCA leads to rapid activation of HCO3−uptake, which can compensate for the loss of eCA activity under lower irradiances. These different modes of DIC uptake have distinct influences on phycosphere carbonate chemistry that may directly affect nutrient acquisition and biotic interactions. Our findings reveal that dynamic modulation of DIC uptake allows diatoms to rapidly respond to changes in CO2supply and demand."

For this purpose, unipolar perovskite x-ray detectors are carefully engineered to resolve the x-ray energies into seven channels using a customized algorithm. Combining machine learning and a comprehensive x-ray attenuation ratio database of common materials enables accurate recognition of low-density biological tissues composed of light elements with similar atomic numbers.

Herein, Mn single atoms (SAs) are constructed on the surface of NNSO, which induces spin polarization effect, thus promoting directional transfer of photothermal electrons, and improving electron density of Mn sites and adsorption ability of CO2. Meanwhile, Mn SAs act as new active sites enhancing the adsorption of intermediate*CO, thus suppressing CO production, lowering energy barriers of hydrogenation, and changing the reaction path. In addition, the hydrogen overflow energy barriers decrease under the effect of spin polarization, promoting the rapid transfer of active H from Ni atoms to Mn SAs. As a result, the rate of CO2methanation is 195.7 millimoles per gram per hour with near-unity selectivity, and the catalytic activity of 1.0%Mn/NNSO increases by approximately 140 times compared with NNSO. To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses the spin polarization effect to achieve efficient photothermal CO2methanation."

Current crystalline microporous membranes/films often suffer from limited molecular sieving performance due to intergranular boundary defects introduced during the prolonged conventional hydrothermal/solvothermal synthesis. Here, we report an active gel–enhanced synthesis route that markedly accelerates the fabrication of slow-crystallizing microporous high-silica zeolite membranes, reducing synthesis time from days to hours—approximately 20-fold faster than conventional methods. This achievement was made possible by combining a supersaturated, nucleus-rich active gel with a substantially enhanced crystallization rate, enabling uniform and sufficient nucleus loading on the support and the subsequent rapid formation of continuous zeolite membranes, regardless of support morphology or the presence of seeds. Using this strategy, we rapidly synthesized high-quality zeolite membranes that demonstrated record-breaking separation performance over previously reported counterparts—one order of magnitude higher in separation performance index.

However, how muscle activation length influences swimming performance remains poorly understood. We present a reconfigurable robotic fish that replicates all four gaits in a single platform by rapidly tuning its body stiffness. Vacuum-driven layer jamming muscles in four tensegrity joints enable quick (≤1 s) stiffness modulation (stiffness ratio of 46.6) and gait switching. In thunniform gait, the robot reaches 1.24 body lengths per second, whereas in anguilliform gait, it achieves agile maneuvering with a turning radius of 0.26 body lengths. Fluid simulations show that the thunniform gait generates stronger vortices and 142% more thrust compared with anguilliform motion at 5 Hz, explaining its high-speed performance. The robot dynamically adapts gaits during locomotion—using thunniform for fast traversal and anguilliform for obstacle negotiation—demonstrating environmental adaptability.

Here, using optogenetic stimulation of various brainstem, thalamic, and dopaminergic cell populations in mice trained on an action-timing task, we manipulated actions preceding the timing decision to causally test these hypotheses. Our findings show that bidirectional regulation of actions during the waiting period leads to corresponding temporal shifts in timing, with a consistent quantitative relationship between changes in the number of waiting-period actions and shifts in stop timing. Notably, nigrostriatal dopamine encodes actions, but not timing, directly, influencing timing only when waiting-period actions are modulated. These findings reveal a behavioral integration mechanism underlying action timing, in which actions performed during the waiting period function as a pacemaker for the internal clock."

Here, we present a stepwise vapor-phase growth strategy for synthesizing 2D OLHs with interfacial fluctuation, forming convex, flat, and concave architectures. During the lateral epitaxial growth processes, higher growth temperatures enhance molecular deposition, driving the transition of the secondary component from in-plane to out-of-plane growth. Consequently, the epitaxial layer thickness is precisely tuned from 20 to 800 nm by increasing the growth temperature. The resulting OLHs exhibit orthogonally polarized exciton conversion, with dual photoluminescence emission bands at 450 and 670 nm, functioning as multimode photonic converters.

Here, we report the 2.59- to 2.88-Å cryo–electron microscopy structure of native human PLC bound to the HCMV immune evasin US6. US6 inhibits the transporter associated with antigen processing 1/2 (TAP1/2) by laterally attaching its transmembrane helix to TAP2 using a disulfide-rich domain to mimic a translocating peptide.

Yet, its potential warming effects remain unquantified globally, with mechanisms unclear. Using high-resolution satellite and climate data, we provide the first global assessment of vegetation’s temperature regulation across 761 megacities across 105 countries, uncovering a paradox: cooling weakens in arid environments; and in 22% of cities with <1000-millimeter annual precipitation, vegetation, particularly grasslands and croplands, causes net warming. This results from lower albedo and reduced heat storage outweighing limited evapotranspiration in arid regions. During extreme heat, trees fail to cool 25% of cities, while grasslands and croplands fail in 71 and 82%, respectively, due to reduced evapotranspiration under high vapor pressure deficits and impeded canopy conductance.

Correlation analyses of observed and expected OG copy numbers, given proposed WGD(s), further refute an angiosperm WGD. Probabilistic retention modeling analysis corroborates these findings and shows that retention rates of dosage-sensitive genes from the putative angiosperm WGD are extremely low.

However, the proposal of the zero-error attack has critically undermined its security guarantees, and existing experimental implementations have not yet established security against coherent attacks. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an information–theoretically secure COW-QKD protocol that can resist source side-channel attacks, with secure transmission distances up to 100 kilometers. Our system achieves a secure key rate on the order of kilobits per second over 50 kilometers in the finite-size regime, sufficient for real-time secure voice communication across metropolitan networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the encrypted transmission of a logo with information-theoretic security over 100 kilometers of optical fiber. These results confirm that COW-QKD can simultaneously provide simplicity and security, establishing it as a strong candidate for deployment in small-scale quantum networks."

However, precise and efficient stimulation of nonadherent cells remains a major challenge, limiting the investigation of mechanotransduction pathways and the development of targeted therapeutics. Here, we developed an acoustofluidic platform named Suspension-cell Targeted Response to Excitation via Acoustofluidic Mechanomodulation (STREAM) to enable precise, high-throughput stimulation of suspension cells. STREAM accomplishes this using 101.14-megahertz high-frequency surface acoustic waves to deliver controlled mechanical stimulation at a throughput of 500,000 cells per minute. STREAM modulates intracellular calcium ion (Ca2+) signaling by activating mechanosensitive ion channels, triggering mitochondrial membrane disruption and tunable K562 leukemia cell apoptosis rates from 5.15 to 47.1%. STREAM provides a scalable, precise tool for studying mechanotransduction in suspension cells, with broad applications in cancer research, immunotherapy, and high-throughput drug screening."

Zuckerman;Subrata Munan;Markus K. Klose;Lin Wang;Valentin Cracan;Andrey A. Parkhitko,Perturbation of NAD(P)H metabolism with the LbNOX xenotopic tool extends lifespan and mitigates age-related changes,"Aging involves widespread metabolic dysregulation, including a decline in total nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) levels. While NAD precursor supplementation elevates total NAD levels, it does not reveal tissue-specific effects of an altered NADH [reduced form of NAD+(oxidized NAD)]/NAD+balance. To address this, we generated transgenicDrosophilaexpressing the genetically encoded xenotopic enzymeLbNOX, which converts NADH to NAD+.LbNOX expression modulated both NAD(H) and NADP(H) (reduced form of NAD phosphate) metabolites in a sex-dependent manner and rescued neuronal cell death induced by mutant αB-crystallin–associated reductive stress. We demonstrate that tissue-specific targeting of redox NAD metabolism shows distinct outcomes: Muscle-specificLbNOX expression confers stronger protection against paraquat-induced oxidative stress than whole-body expression, emphasizing tissue-dependent redox sensitivity. Notably,LbNOX expression in nonneuronal tissues restored youthful sleep patterns in aged flies. Together, these findings establishLbNOX as an efficient xenotopic tool for in vivo redox manipulation and reveal tissue- and sex-specific NAD(P)H mechanisms underlying aging, stress resilience, and sleep regulation, providing a framework for NAD-based interventions in aging."

Computational optics enhances optical encoding through algorithms but faces computational limits, while optical computing offers photonic parallelism yet struggles with hardware complexity. Metaoptics, using subwavelength nanostructures for multidimensional light-field control, resolves this tension by serving dual roles: as an efficient computational optics encoder offloading algorithmic burdens and as a nanoscale optical computing processor enabling ultrahigh-density parallelism. This synergy drives computational optical integration for next-generation optoelectronics. This review outlines computational optics and optical computing fundamentals, analyzes metaoptics’ advantages in multidimensional optical information encoding and processing, and details recent metaoptics-based advances and challenges in computational optics, optical computing, and their convergence. The conclusion provides a future roadmap, highlighting metaoptics-driven integration’s potential for chip-scale intelligent visual perception by bridging the hardware-software divide to enable miniaturized devices with real-time adaptability, massive parallelism, and energy efficiency."
