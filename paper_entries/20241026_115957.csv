10.1088/1748-9326/ad8246,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注地下水超采对农业灌溉的影响，以及农民如何通过调整策略来应对日益增长的水资源开采成本。它使用名为HELGA的微观经济启发式模型来评估不同适应策略的效果，例如改变作物类型或休耕部分土地。研究地点选取了美国本土的五个地区，结果表明，在大多数地区，地下水补给量足以避免经济限制；而在地下水过度开采的地区，抽水能耗的增加和水利基础设施成本的提高是限制地下水使用的主要因素。该研究与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等，几乎没有关系。,[],Sioux F Melo-León;Stijn Reinhard;Marc F P Bierkens;Rens van Beek,HELGA: a global hydro-economic model of groundwater-fed irrigation from a farmer’s perspective,"Overexploitation of groundwater for irrigation can ultimately threaten the viability of agriculture itself, because the falling groundwater levels become too deep to sustain the increasing costs of groundwater extraction, an economic limit is reached. In order to evaluate possible adaptation strategies to avoid or postpone reaching the economic limit, we developed the microeconomic heuristic model HELGA (hydro-economic limits as a global analysis). HELGA considers the interaction of groundwater with irrigation at the farm level with a global scale application in mind. HELGA evaluates the development of the costs and revenue of groundwater-fed irrigated agriculture from the farmer’s perspective. As long as the farm remains economically viable, the farmer can invest to access deeper groundwater, but in the long run the famer may have to adapt to keep farming profitable. We applied HELGA in five locations within the conterminous USA. In most cases, recharge is large enough to save a farmer from reaching the economic limit. Where groundwater is overexploited, the increasing energy cost of groundwater pumping is one of the main drivers limiting groundwater use. Additionally, the increasing costs of the water infrastructure (i.e. deeper wells) is a crucial factor that explains where and when the economic limit is reached. If farmers change crops wisely or fallow part of their land, they are able to access groundwater longer and postpone the moment the economic limit is reached. Using HELGA, we show that proper and timely adaptation measures increases the profitable lifetime of groundwater and helps to conserve this resource for future generations."

However, there are very few records from inland Northeast Asia, which obscures the spatial extent of or the boundary between the two domains and hinders the assessment of climate change impacts and consequences across the region. Here, we present a multi-proxy record that combines peat properties, plant macrofossils, and isotopic ratios of Sphagnum moss cellulose from a unique precipitation-fed peatland in northern Northeast China to fill this critical data gap. The results show major centennial-scale moisture anomalies at this site, with drier and wetter conditions during the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age, respectively, which resemble the pattern of moisture changes in ‘westerlies Asia’. During the period of rapid anthropogenic warming, the site is much drier, with isotopic evidence for threshold-like summer desiccation of peat-forming Sphagnum mosses. This study provides the long-term context and identifies the large-scale pattern of moisture variability in an inland region home to carbon-rich peatlands, forests, and permafrost soils, and highlights their potential vulnerability to future warming-enhanced drying that can be transmitted widely through atmospheric teleconnection."

Here we describe and implement a two-part modeling approach to estimate and map tall shrub (diameter at root collar > 2.5 cm) expected aboveground biomass, or E[SHB], across a 16.6 million ha boreal region where shrubification occurs in wetlands and subalpine ecosystems. Using n = 384 field plots nested within m= 11 study sites across southcentral Alaska, we constructed random forest models of the probability (pSH) that shrub wood volume surpasses tree wood volume, and generalized additive models of aboveground biomass of tall shrubs (SHB) using rasterized aerial lidar variables collected by NASA Goddard’s Lidar, Hyperspectral, and Thermal (G-LiHT) Airborne Imager, together with gridded climate data from a Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model 30-year normal climatology (PRISM). Applying those models to G-LiHT tiles, then averaging across tiles within n = 843 watersheds covering 9.2 million ha, we estimated that below 1000 m asl, the area-weighted mean value of E[SHB] = pSH x SHB = 6.6 Mg ha−1 with sd = 4.5 Mg ha−1. This is the first study to estimate current shrub biomass density at the regional scale in southcentral Alaska and serves as a biomass baseline for measuring and modeling aboveground carbon fluxes where plant communities are undergoing climate-driven change."

In particular, the palm oil industry generates palm oil mill (POM) effluent, which continuously emits methane into the atmosphere. Satellites are becoming a powerful tool to detect and quantify methane emissions, but there is no evidence of their ability to monitor those from POM ponds. In this work, we have tested the potential of methane-capable satellite instruments to detect and quantify emissions from these ponds. We have focused on the satellite missions with the highest sensitivity to methane emissions, namely the GHGSat commercial constellation and the PRISMA, EnMAP, and EMIT imaging spectroscopy missions. We have also tested the AVIRIS-NG airborne imaging spectrometer. We report three methane plumes from POMs in Indonesia with GHGSat and two in Colombia with AVIRIS-NG. In the cases of EnMAP, PRISMA and EMIT, we observed substantial methane concentration enhancements over several ponds in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Colombia. It remains unclear whether they are due to retrieval artifacts caused by the particular albedo of the ponds, although the low spatial correlation between those enhancements and the ponds suggests that at least a fraction of the enhancements is caused by real emissions. By leveraging advanced imaging techniques and satellite data, this research contributes to progressing strategies to address new methane emissions sources with high mitigation potential, providing a first step toward the satellite-based monitoring of methane emissions from POMs."

In particular, fisheries conflicts arise when a marine resource is contested or disputed between a minimum of two actors. Despite the potentially large impacts of fisheries conflicts on marine-based economies, it is difficult to quantify the impact of conflict on fisheries production or on long-standing cooperative relationships that can be vital to the long-term sustainability of a given fishery. Previous work addressing fisheries conflicts has had a limited focus on quantitative measurements of how changes in fishing effort can influence how communities fall into conflict or make concerted efforts to cooperate. To address this knowledge gap, instances of conflict and cooperation amongst fishers in Puerto Rico were documented and categorized into different intensity levels. A linear probability model was then developed to estimate the probability of a conflict event occurring in a specific region, month, and year from 2012 to 2017. The model includes catch per unit effort as a predictor variable and controls for environmental factors. We found that an increase in catch per trip from the previous month has a negative and significant relationship with the probability of a conflict event. This result provides quantitative evidence for the supply-induced scarcity hypothesis, highlighting the importance of managing fisheries sustainably, to avoid future fisheries conflicts."

 The vertical distribution of tropospheric O3 from ozonesondes is compared with that from In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS) measurements collected at 23 pairs of sites between about 30° S and 55° N from 1995 to 2021. Profiles of tropospheric O3 from IAGOS are generally in good agreement with ozonesonde observations from electrochemical concentration cells (ECCs), Brewer–Mast sondes, and carbon–iodine sensors, with average biases of 2.58, −0.28, and 0.67 ppb and correlation coefficients (R) of 0.72, 0.82, and 0.66, respectively. Agreement between aircraft and Indian-sonde observations is poor, with an average bias of 15.32 ppb and an R value of 0.44. The O3 concentration observed by ECC sondes is, on average, 5 %–10 % higher than that observed by IAGOS, and the relative bias increases modestly with altitude. For other sonde types, there are some seasonal and altitudinal  variations in the relative bias with respect to the IAGOS measurements, but these appear to be caused by local differences. The distance between the station and airport, when within 4° (latitude and longitude), has little effect on the comparison results. For the ECC ozonesondes, the overall bias with respect to the IAGOS measurements varies from 5.7 to 9.8 ppb when the station pairs are grouped by station–airport distances of <1° (latitude and longitude), 1–2°, and 2–4°. Correlations for these groups correspond to R=0.8, 0.9, and 0.7. These comparison results provide important information for merging ozonesonde and IAGOS measurement datasets. They can also be used to evaluate the relative biases of different sonde types in the troposphere, using the aircraft as a transfer standard."

The presented measurements and operational experience demonstrate that the CIC provides precise and robust long-term measurements of small ion concentrations of both polarities, with low noise, fast time response and excellent reliability. 
 A dilute plasma is continuously maintained in the troposphere by ionising particle radiation from galactic cosmic rays and radon decay. Small ions in the 1–2 nm size range play an important role in atmospheric processes such as ion-induced nucleation of aerosol particles. Consequently there is a need for precise and robust instruments to measure small ions both for atmospheric observations and for laboratory experiments that simulate the atmosphere. Here we describe the design and performance of the Cluster Ion Counter (CIC, Airel OÜ), which simultaneously measures the number concentrations of positively- and negatively-charged ions and particles below 5 nm mobility diameter, with low noise and fast time response. The detection efficiency is above 80 % for ions and charged particles between 1.2 and 2.0 nm, and above 90 % between 2.0 and 3.0 nm. The ion concentrations measured by the CIC agree well with reference instruments. The noise level (1 σ of background measurements) is typically between 20 and 30 ions cm-3 at 1 Hz sampling rate and an air flow rate of 7 l min-1 per analyzer. The noise level improves when higher flow rates and longer sampling periods are used. The CIC responds rapidly with 1 s time resolution to pulses of ionisation produced in the CLOUD chamber by a CERN particle beam."

 The irreversible trend for global warming underscores the necessity for accurate monitoring and analysis of atmospheric carbon dynamics on a global scale. Carbon satellites hold significant potential for atmospheric CO2 monitoring. However, existing studies on global CO2 are constrained by coarse resolution (ranging from 0.25° to 2°) and limited spatial coverage. In this study, we developed a new global dataset of column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of CO2 (XCO2) at 0.05° resolution with full coverage using carbon satellite observations, multi-source satellite products, and an improved deep learning model. We then investigated changes in global atmospheric CO2 and anomalies from 2015 to 2021. The reconstructed XCO2 products show a better agreement with Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) measurements, with R2 of 0.92 and RSME of 1.54 ppm. The products also provide more accurate information on the global and regional spatial patterns of XCO2 compared to origin carbon satellite monitoring and previous XCO2 products. The global pattern of XCO2 exhibited a distinct increasing trend with a growth rate of 2.32 ppm/year, reaching 414.00 ppm in 2021. Globally, XCO2 showed obvious spatial variability across different latitudes and continents. Higher XCO2 concentrations were primarily observed in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in regions with intensive anthropogenic activity, such as East Asia and North America. We also validated the effectiveness of our XCO2 products in detecting intensive CO2 emission sources.

This study accessed various setups of WRF-GHG simulations that ensure consistency between the model and driving reanalysis fields. We found that a combination of nudging and frequent re-initialization allows certain improvement by constraining the soil moisture fields and, through its impact on atmospheric mixing, improves atmospheric transport. 
 Atmospheric transport models are often used to simulate the distribution of greenhouse gases (GHGs). This can be in the context of forward modeling of tracer transport using surface–atmosphere fluxes or flux estimation through inverse modeling, whereby atmospheric tracer measurements are used in combination with simulated transport. In both of these contexts, transport errors can bias the results and should therefore be minimized.Here, we analyze transport uncertainties in the commonly used Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with the greenhouse gas module (WRF-GHG), enabling passive tracer transport simulation of CO2 and CH4. As a mesoscale numerical weather prediction model, WRF's transport is constrained by global meteorological fields via initialization and at the lateral boundaries of the domain of interest. These global fields were generated by assimilating various meteorological data to increase the accuracy of modeled fields. However, in limited-domain models like WRF, the winds in the center of the domain can deviate considerably from these driving fields. As the accuracy of the wind speed and direction is critical to the prediction of tracer transport, maintaining a close link to the observations across the simulation domain is desired. On the other hand, a link that is too close to the global meteorological fields can degrade performance at smaller spatial scales that are better represented by the mesoscale model. In this work, we evaluated the performance of strategies for keeping WRF's meteorology compatible with meteorological observations. To avoid the complexity of assimilating meteorological observations directly, two main strategies of coupling WRF-GHG with ERA5 meteorological reanalysis data were tested over a 2-month-long simulation over the European domain: (a) restarting the model daily with fresh initial conditions (ICs) from ERA5 and (b) nudging the atmospheric winds, temperatures, and moisture to those of ERA5 continuously throughout the simulation period, using WRF's built-in four-dimensional data assimilation (FDDA) in grid-nudging mode.Meteorological variables and simulated mole fractions of CO2 and CH4 were compared against observations to assess the performance of the different strategies. We also compared planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) with radiosonde-derived estimates. Either nudging or daily restarts similarly improved the meteorology and GHG transport in our simulations, with a small advantage of using both methods in combination. However, notable differences in soil moisture were found that accumulated over the course of the simulation when not using frequent restarts. The soil moisture drift had an impact on the simulated PBLH, presumably via changing the Bowen ratio. This is partially mitigated through nudging without requiring daily restarts, although not entirely alleviated. Soil moisture drift did not have a noticeable impact on GHG performance in our case, likely because it was dominated by other errors. However, since the PBLH is critical for accurately simulating GHG transport, we recommend transport model setups that tie soil moisture to observations. Our method of frequently re-initializing simulations with meteorological reanalysis fields proved suitable for this purpose."

This evaluation reveals the impact of these parameters on mixed-layer depth, sea surface temperature and salinity, and ocean stratification. Our findings demonstrate significant impacts on sea ice thickness and sea ice concentration, emphasizing the need for accurately representing ocean mixing to understand Arctic climate dynamics. 
 We evaluate the vertical turbulent-kinetic-energy (TKE) mixing scheme of the NEMO-SI3 ocean–sea-ice model in sea-ice-covered regions of the Arctic Ocean. Specifically, we assess the parameters involved in TKE mixed-layer-penetration (MLP) parameterization. This ad hoc parameterization aims to capture processes that impact the ocean surface boundary layer, such as near-inertial oscillations, ocean swells, and waves, which are often not well represented in the default TKE scheme. We evaluate this parameterization for the first time in three regions of the Arctic Ocean: the Makarov, Eurasian, and Canada basins.We demonstrate the strong effect of the scaling parameter that accounts for the presence of sea ice. Our results confirm that TKE MLP must be scaled down below sea ice to avoid unrealistically deep mixed layers. The other parameters evaluated are the percentage of energy penetrating below the mixed layer and the length scale of its decay with depth. All these parameters affect mixed-layer depth and its seasonal cycle, surface temperature, and salinity, as well as underlying stratification. Shallow mixed layers are associated with stronger stratification and fresh surface anomalies, and deeper mixed layers correspond to weaker stratification and salty surface anomalies.Notably, we observe significant impacts on sea-ice thickness across the Arctic Ocean in two scenarios: when the scaling parameter due to sea ice is absent and when the TKE mixed-layer-penetration process vanishes. In the former case, we observe an increase of several meters in mixed-layer depth, along with a reduction in sea-ice thickness ranging from 30 to 40 cm, reflecting the impact of stronger mixing. Conversely, in the latter case, we notice that a shallower mixed layer is accompanied by a moderate increase in sea-ice thickness, ranging from 10 to 20 cm, as expected from weaker mixing. Additionally, interannual variability suggests that experiments incorporating a scaling parameter based on sea-ice concentration display an increased mixed-layer depth during periods of reduced sea ice, which is consistent with observed trends. These findings underscore the influence of enhanced ocean mixing, through specific parameterizations, on the physical properties of the upper ocean and sea ice."

Because of the complexity of these systems, we must be careful when intervening in them; otherwise we may cause irreversible damage. Using computer models, we can gain insight about these complex systems without harming them. In this paper we describe how we connected an ecological model of forest insect infestation with a social model of cooperation and simulated an intervention measure to save a forest from infestation. 
 Engaging ecological resource users in intervention to protect resources is challenging for governments due to the self-interest of users and uncertainty about intervention consequences. Focusing on a case of forest insect infestations, we addressed questions of resource protection and environmentally responsible behavior promotion with a conceptual model. We coupled a forest infestation model with a social model in which a governing agent applies a mechanism for the recognition and promotion of environmentally responsible behavior among several user agents. We ran the coupled model in various scenarios with a reinforcement-learning algorithm for the governing agent as well as best-case, worst-case, and random baselines. Results showed that a proper recognition policy facilitates emergence of environmentally responsible behavior.

However, existing methods for detecting MPO in cells are limited. In this study, a DNAzyme nanorobot was developed using a scaffold of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) decorated with functional DNAzyme strands and their fluorophore-labeled substrate strands. The DNAzyme remains inactive due to a self-assembled hairpin structure, with a phosphorothioate (PT) modification inserted into the stem domain. When MPO is present, it triggers a halogenation process that generates hypochlorous acid (HClO). HClO specifically catalyzes the cleavage of the PT-site, releasing free DNAzyme strands to cleave their substrates and generating an increasing fluorescent signal. The detection limit for MPO and its primary product, HClO, were determined to be 0.038 μg/mL and 0.013 μM, respectively. The DNAzyme nanorobot can be readily introduced into cells and function autonomously to differentiate increased MPO/HClO levels caused by antibiotics. This approach was applied to image RAW264.7 cells exposed to four prevalent antibiotics found in the environment (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, erythromycin, penicillin, and tetracycline) as well as antibiotic production wastewater.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommends using emission factors (EFs) to estimate indirect N2O emission, but the EF for ditches (EF5g) is categorized as groundwater, which potentially introduces a significant bias. This study conducted a regional-scale campaign in the North China Plain, one of the world’s most intensive agricultural regions, and calculated the EF5g values from agricultural ditches by the concentration method (N2O–N/NO3––N). The results found that the regional-scale mean EF5g value (0.0028) was less than half of the IPCC default value (0.006), illustrating that the current IPCC methodology significantly overestimates N2O emissions from agricultural ditches. Despite the relatively small EF5g values, agricultural ditches exhibited a high mean N2O concentration (3.36 μg L–1) and a large regional emission (1.14 ± 0.86 Gg N2O–N yr–1), which is equal to 3.8 ± 2.9% of direct N2O emission from the croplands in the North China Plain. Since ditches are ubiquitous in agricultural regions and are likely to expand under climate change, refining EF5g is crucial to accurately assess their contribution to global N2O budgets."

We employed proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry with NH4+ ion sources (NH4+-CIMS) and a custom-built OH calibration source to quantify organic peroxy radicals (RO2) and closed-shell species.

Highly oxidized molecules primarily arise from RO2 autoxidation initiated by ozone, and at least 15% of ozone oxidation products follow the overlooked nonvinyl hydroperoxides pathway.

Here, we demonstrated a mechanism for enhancing salt tolerance in rice under salt stress via priming with nonstimulatory nanoparticles such as selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs), distinct from stimulatory nanomaterials. Due to the dynamic transformation ability of SeNPs, SeNP priming could enhance rice salt tolerance by mediating the glutathione cycle to eliminate excess reactive oxygen species (ROS). During priming, SeNPs penetrated rice seeds and transitioned into a soluble form (99.9%) within the embryo endosperm. Subsequently, the soluble selenium (Se) was transported to rice roots and metabolized into various Se-related derivatives, including selenomethionine (SeMet), Na2SeO3 (Se IV), selenocysteine (SeCys2), and methylselenocysteine (MeSeCys). These derivatives significantly enhanced the root activities of key enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), glutathione reductase (GR), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) by 24.97%, 47.98%, 16.23%, 16.81%, and 14.82%, respectively, thus reinforcing the glutathione cycle and ROS scavenging pathways.

By applying k‐means clustering to reanalysis data, we find that FLS formation in the Po valley is either based on radiative processes or moisture advection from the Mediterranean sea. Satellite‐based data on FLS persistence shows longer persistence of radiatively formed FLS events, likely due to air mass stagnation and a temperature inversion. Ground‐based aerosol optical depth observations further reveal that FLS event duration is significantly higher under high aerosol loading.

Using the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to interpret the ML results, we observe that plate age and subduction dip are the most influential variables. The results suggest that older, shallow‐dipping plates contribute to low b‐values, indicating higher megathrust stress. This pattern is attributed to the higher rigidity of older plates, increasing flexural strength, and generating a shallow penetration angle, increasing the frictional interplate area and intensifying the megathrust stress.

Our findings show that trees provide a higher flux to precipitation (∼777 mm year−1) than non‐tree vegetation (∼342 mm year−1). However, considering the smaller spatial extent of trees compared to non‐tree vegetation, precipitation in most watersheds effectively depends more on the latter.

Here, we developed a new technique for the identification of convective turbulent regions and deriving the vertical distribution of aerosol turbulent mass fluxes within PBL. The algorithm uses retrievals from coherent Doppler lidars and a high spectral resolution lidar. The technique was applied to study particle mass fluxes over 2 months (November–December 2020) during the campaign conducted at the DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Southern Great Plains (SGP) site in Lamont, Oklahoma. The algorithm developed here is capable of continuously deriving vertically resolved (curtains) aerosol mass fluxes. Our data analysis shows that at the site, the 30‐min averaged fluxes at 135 m above the surface were mainly positive (upward) at ∼1 μg m−2 s−1, suggesting that the surface is the primary source of the particle mass supplied to the boundary layer at the SGP site. Analyses of the individual case studies have revealed that not all the derived fluxes can be linked to surface emissions. Both positive and negative values in a range of ±5 μg m−2 s−1 can be caused by convective thermals interacting between the residual layer and the mixed layer and by rotation of the horizontal wind with the height. Large erroneous negative fluxes can also be caused by drizzling/precipitating clouds.

However, the inﬂuence of anthropogenic climate change (ACC) on these dry‐hot conditions and their impacts on SAD occurrences remains uncertain. Here, both observations and simulations show that an ACC‐driven T increase led to the greater likelihood of dry‐hot conditions from August to November 1901–2020 in MLRYR. Using the self‐calibrating Palmer drought index (scPDSI) to assess SAD severity, we find an increasing likelihood of SAD occurrence (from 33.3% in 1901–2000 to 85.7% in 2001–2020) in MLRYR associated with more frequent dry‐hot conditions. Under a business‐as‐usual scenario, future dry‐hot association is projected to be stronger, with exceptional dry‐hot conditions to increase by +10% per century.

The Antarctic vortex of October–December 2020 was the strongest on record in the satellite era for the season in the mid‐ to lower stratosphere. However, it was poorly predicted by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's operational seasonal climate forecast system of that time, ACCESS‐S1, even at a short lead time of a month. Using the current operational forecast system, ACCESS‐S2, we have, therefore, tried to find a primary cause of the limited predictability of this event and conducted forecast sensitivity experiments to understand the potential role of ozone in the event and its associated anomalies of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and rainfall over south–eastern Australia and western Patagonia. Here, we show that the 2020 strong vortex event did not follow the canonical dynamical evolution seen in previous strong vortex events in spring but suddenly appeared as a result of the record‐low upward propagating wave activity in September 2020. The ACCESS‐S2 forecasts significantly underestimated the negative wave forcing in September even at zero lead time, irrespective of the ozone configuration, therefore falling short in predicting the record strength of the polar vortex in late spring 2020. Nevertheless, ACCESS‐S2 with prescribed realistic ozone that had large anomalies in the Antarctic stratosphere significantly better predicted the strong vortex and the subsequent positive SAM and related rainfall anomalies over south–eastern Australia and western Patagonia in the austral summer of 2020–21. This highlights the potentially important role of ozone variations for seasonal climate forecasting as a source of long‐lead predictability."

This study investigates the physical processes behind extreme precipitation events (EPEs) in the Himalayas, notorious for causing frequent floods and significant loss of life and property. Due to the presence of complex terrain, understanding the driving factors of these EPEs is challenging. Here, we decipher the precipitation characteristics and their driving factors responsible for the occurrence of EPEs in the Western Himalayas (WH) for the period 1979–2020. EPEs are defined as events exceeding the 99th percentile threshold. The extreme precipitation in the WH is contributed by both large‐scale precipitation (accounting for 61%) and convective precipitation (39%). Moreover, 25.49% of EPEs in this region are directly associated with monsoon depressions. The presence of distinct upper‐tropospheric gyres flanking the WH, along with a prominent zonal wave pattern, promotes a southward extension of the trough. This intensifies the low‐level convergence of moisture‐laden winds from the adjoining seas, resulting in substantial moisture availability for the EPEs. An omega‐type blocking pattern emerges 4 days before EPEs, facilitating the intrusion of an extratropical cyclonic circulation. This circulation, characterized by its slow eastward and equatorward movement, leads to low‐level moisture flux convergence and ascending motions, which in turn trigger the EPEs. This highlights the crucial role of extratropical signals in driving EPEs and implies that tropical‐extratropical interactions play an important role in these EPEs. Furthermore, the shifting of the Intertropical Convergence Zone is strongly linked to the enhancement of the intensity of EPEs. Moreover, moisture budget analysis shows that EPEs over the WH are primarily driven by vertical advection, with the dynamic (thermodynamic) terms explaining 92% (8%) contribution. The intensified diabatic heating structure further enhances the convection, facilitating the development of deep convection which controls the local thermodynamics of these EREs. Lastly, our study demonstrated that most intensified and persistent EPEs over the Himalayas are found to be linked with Quasi‐Resonance Amplification, which is driven by baroclinic waves with 5 and 8 zonal wave numbers that contribute to these EPEs."

 The ocean annually absorbs about a quarter of all anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Global estimates of air–sea CO2 fluxes are typically based on bulk measurements of CO2 in air and seawater and neglect the effects of vertical temperature gradients near the ocean surface. Theoretical and laboratory observations indicate that these gradients alter air–sea CO2 fluxes, because the air–sea CO2 concentration difference is highly temperature sensitive. However, in situ field evidence supporting their effect is so far lacking. Here we present independent direct air–sea CO2 fluxes alongside indirect bulk fluxes collected along repeat transects in the Atlantic Ocean (50° N to 50° S) in 2018 and 2019. We find that accounting for vertical temperature gradients reduces the difference between direct and indirect fluxes from 0.19 mmol m−2 d−1 to 0.08 mmol m−2 d−1 (N = 148). This implies an increase in the Atlantic CO2 sink of ~0.03 PgC yr−1 (~7% of the Atlantic Ocean sink). These field results validate theoretical, modelling and observational-based efforts, all of which predicted that accounting for near-surface temperature gradients would increase estimates of global ocean CO2 uptake. Accounting for this increased ocean uptake will probably require some revision to how global carbon budgets are quantified. Accounting for near-surface temperature gradients leads to estimates for annual CO2 uptake in the North Atlantic that are 7% higher, based on a comparison of eddy covariance and bulk CO2 measurements, which is consistent with theory, laboratory assessments and model analysis."

Here, authors uncover the vital role of ER- associated degradation in preventing fibrinogen aggregation and ensuring its proper biogenesis. 
 Impaired secretion of an essential blood coagulation factor fibrinogen leads to hepatic fibrinogen storage disease (HFSD), characterized by the presence of fibrinogen-positive inclusion bodies and hypofibrinogenemia. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the biogenesis of fibrinogen in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) remain unexplored. Here we uncover a key role of SEL1L-HRD1 complex of ER-associated degradation (ERAD) in the formation of aberrant inclusion bodies, and the biogenesis of nascent fibrinogen protein complex in hepatocytes. Acute or chronic deficiency of SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD in the hepatocytes leads to the formation of hepatocellular inclusion bodies. Proteomics studies followed by biochemical assays reveal fibrinogen as a major component of the inclusion bodies. Mechanistically, we show that the degradation of misfolded endogenous fibrinogen Aα, Bβ, and γ chains by SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD is indispensable for the formation of a functional fibrinogen complex in the ER. Providing clinical relevance of these findings, SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD indeed degrades and thereby attenuates the pathogenicity of two disease-causing fibrinogen γ mutants. Together, this study demonstrates an essential role of SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD in fibrinogen biogenesis and provides insight into the pathogenesis of protein-misfolding diseases.

They show that macaque-derived host receptor homolog has multiple structural defects against virus binding. 
 Macaque restricts hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection because its receptor homologue, NTCP (mNTCP), cannot bind preS1 on viral surface. To reveal how mNTCP loses the viral receptor function, we here solve the cryo-electron microscopy structure of mNTCP. Superposing on the human NTCP (hNTCP)-preS1 complex structure shows that Arg158 of mNTCP causes steric clash to prevent preS1 from embedding onto the bile acid tunnel of NTCP. Cell-based mutation analysis confirms that only Gly158 permitted preS1 binding, in contrast to robust bile acid transport among mutations. As the second determinant, Asn86 on the extracellular surface of mNTCP shows less capacity to restrain preS1 from dynamic fluctuation than Lys86 of hNTCP, resulting in unstable preS1 binding. Additionally, presence of long-chain conjugated-bile acids in the tunnel induces steric hindrance with preS1 through their tailed-chain. This study presents structural basis in which multiple sites in mNTCP constitute a molecular barrier to strictly restrict HBV.

Here, we report that Sugar Transporter Protein 28 (OsSTP28) as a key regulator of N-responsive tillering and yield formation in rice. N supply inhibits the expression of OsSTP28, resulting in glucose accumulation in the apoplast of tiller buds, which in turn suppresses the expression of a transcriptional inhibitor ORYZA SATIVA HOMEOBOX 15 (OSH15) via an epigenetic mechanism to activate gibberellin 2-oxidases (GA2oxs)-facilitated gibberellin catabolism in shoot base. Thereby, OsSTP28-OSH15-GA2oxs module reduces the level of bioactive gibberellin in shoot base upon increased N supply, and consequently promotes tillering and grain yield. Moreover, we identify an elite allele of OsSTP28 that can effectively promote N-responsive tillering and yield formation, thus representing a valuable breeding target of N use efficiency improvement for agricultural sustainability.

 Candida auris is an emerging nosocomial fungal pathogen associated with life-threatening invasive disease due to its persistent colonization, high level of transmissibility and multi-drug resistance. Aggregative and non-aggregative growth phenotypes for C. auris strains with different biofilm forming abilities, drug susceptibilities and virulence characteristics have been described. Using comprehensive transcriptional analysis we identified key cell surface adhesins that were highly upregulated in the aggregative phenotype during in vitro and in vivo grown biofilms using a mouse model of catheter infection. Phenotypic and functional evaluations of generated null mutants demonstrated crucial roles for the adhesins Als4112 and Scf1 in mediating cell-cell adherence, coaggregation and biofilm formation. While individual mutants were largely non-aggregative, in combination cells were able to co-adhere and aggregate, as directly demonstrated by measuring cell adhesion forces using single-cell atomic force spectroscopy. This co-adherence indicates their role as complementary adhesins, which despite their limited similarity, may function redundantly to promote cell-cell interaction and biofilm formation. Functional diversity of cell wall proteins may be a form of regulation that provides the aggregative phenotype of C. auris with flexibility and rapid adaptation to the environment, potentially impacting persistence and virulence.

 Declining seasonal snow cover duration leads to changing conditions for plant recruitment and growth in temperate mountains. Yet capturing the intricacy of snow cover and vegetation dynamics at multidecadal scale in complex terrains poses a great challenge. Here we show that over the last four decades the greenness trend in European mountains increases with the annual date of the seasonal snow cover disappearance. By combining satellite data of high spatial resolution and downscaled climate re-analysis we show that the reduction in snow cover duration surpasses elevated temperatures in influencing heat accumulation during the growing season. This accumulation is a key driver of the pronounced greening observed in late snow-melting sites, particularly in sparsely vegetated, north-facing screes. Our results provide a comprehensive account of rapid vegetation changes in waning snowfields and highlight the pivotal role played by snow cover dynamics to unravel the complexity of greening within the temperate alpine zone.

Our study finds a significant negative correlation between the IPWP index and sea ice concentration in northeastern Canada during boreal autumn (October-December). Our results suggest that IPWP warming statistically accounts for 45% of sea ice loss observed in this region. We introduce the “Arctic capacitor effect of the IPWP”, a novel concept that expounds upon the distant connection between greenhouse gas emissions and Arctic sea ice loss. Specifically, as greenhouse gases elevate temperatures in the IPWP, increasing temperature gradient and tropical convection, a planetary wavetrain is initiated.

 Temperature variability has substantial socioeconomic impacts through its association with the frequency and severity of heat extremes. Under anthropogenic influence, climate models project seasonally-dependent amplifications of near-surface temperature variability over some sectors of the Southern Hemisphere, and robust positive trends have already been observed in recent decades. Here we show that the amplification of subweekly temperature variability simulated by the multi-model ensemble mean of the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) over South Africa, Australia, and South America is often substantially smaller than in reanalyses in recent decades, reaching a similar amplification only at the end of the 21st century due to a weaker amplification of subweekly variance generation efficiency. Analysis of a large model ensemble indicates that this discrepancy may be due to internal climatic variability suggesting that the recent rapid amplification seen in reanalyses may slow down or even temporarily reverse in the near future."

 Magmatic volatile phases play a major role in igneous systems, but indirect sampling of the magmatic fluid, especially for basic magmas, remains challenging to document. Here, we report compelling evidence of primary fluid inclusions trapped within magmatic ilmenite from two different basic intrusive settings: Armorican Massif (France) and Central Iberian Zone (Spain). Fluid inclusions have a solute chemistry dominated by sodium, calcium, chlorine, sulfur and iron, with detectable contents of metals and metalloids and thus likely record the onset of late-stage magmatic volatile saturation in these basic magmas. Hence, we argue the presence of fluid inclusions in ilmenite may be a good indicator for magma degassing in these settings and importantly records the magmatic-hydrothermal transition. Additionally, this study suggests that the trapping of the magmatic volatile phase during ilmenite (and other opaque minerals) crystallization may be more common but at present an underappreciated phenomenon in basic igneous magmatic systems.

 After a period of relative stability, the Antarctic sea ice extent has abruptly decreased in 2016 and has remained low since then. Both atmospheric and oceanic processes likely contributed to this drop but many questions remain regarding the underlying dynamics and it is unknown if this drop is unprecedented. Here we produce a new multi-variate spatial reconstruction covering 1958–2023 and show that a similar drop in sea ice extent occurred at the end of the 1970s, albeit with a smaller magnitude. Both drops show similar spatial patterns, with a higher sea ice loss in the East Antarctic sector than in the West Antarctic sector where the variability is strongly modulated by wind-driven changes. The ocean integrates the atmospheric forcing and provides memory that amplifies the magnitude of both drops.

 Marine heatwaves have attracted great attention for their devastating impacts on marine organisms. However, the influence of marine heatwaves on phytoplankton community structure, a key aspect of pelagic ecosystems, remains elusive, especially in the biologically productive eastern boundary upwelling systems. Here, using a combination of multi-satellite observations and model outputs, we discover that phytoplankton in these upwelling systems exhibit not only a marked reduction in biomass (~50%), but also a significant shift toward smaller species in community structures during marine heatwaves, featuring a substantially increased/decreased dominance in picophytoplankton/microphytoplankton. This change in community structure is positively related to the intensity and duration of marine heatwaves, and is likely a result of community competition under reduced nutrient supply due to weakened coastal upwelling associated with poleward wind anomalies. These findings invite us to rethink the dominance of phytoplankton in the eastern boundary upwelling systems under extreme conditions, and may have important implications for local fisheries and carbon cycle under the ongoing warming. Longer and more intense marine heatwaves are associated with a dominance of smaller plankton species and lower overall biomass, according to an analysis of ocean color satellite data and distribution modeling."

 Northern regions are warming faster than the rest of the globe. It is difficult to predict ecosystem responses to warming because the thermal sensitivity of their biophysical components varies. Here, we present an analysis of the authors’ expert judgment regarding the sensitivity of six ecosystem components – permafrost, peatlands, lakes, snowpack, vegetation, and endothermic vertebrates – across northern landscapes ranging from boreal to polar biomes. We identified 28 discontinuous component states across a 3700 km latitudinal gradient in northeastern North America and quantified sensitivity as the transition time from an initial to a contrasting state following a theoretical step change increase in mean annual air temperature of 5 °C. We infer that multiple interconnected state shifts are likely to occur within a narrow subarctic latitudinal band at timescales of 10 to more than 100 years, and response times decrease with latitude. Response times differ between components and across latitudes, which is likely to impair the integrity of ecosystems.

 Large-scale anticyclonic vortices forming along the Gulf of Alaska continental slope serve as fertile ecosystems for marine life, significantly shaping the distribution of primary productivity, with 40–80% of the gulf’s open ocean surface chlorophyll-a concentrated in their cores. Between 2013 and 2023, Alaska experienced some of the largest and longest marine heatwaves ever recorded in the world’s oceans, persistently altering its ecosystem and fisheries. Here, using 30 years of satellite and reanalysis data, we find that the coastal upwelling atmospheric forcing conditions associated with the heatwaves have also significantly suppressed the Gulf of Alaska’s ocean circulation and the formation of large anticyclones. Climate model simulations spanning from 1850 to 2100 suggest that future changes in the Aleutian Low pressure system will lead to a 60% increase in upwelling extremes (>2 standard deviations), further weakening the ocean anticyclones.

Disturbances on sub-pixel level. •minimum detectable forest disturbance area is around 40 m2. 
 Forests provide important ecosystem functions such as carbon sequestration and climate regulation, particularly in countries with high forest cover. Climate change-induced extreme weather events have a negative impact on many forest ecosystems. In Germany, for instance, the drought of the years 2018 until 2020 resulted in signs of damage in almost 80% of trees. This decline in forest vitality has additionally led to severe bark beetle infestations and widespread tree mortality, posing significant challenges to forest managers to obtain a complete picture of the state of their forests. Since a completely ground-based monitoring of forest condition is not feasible due to the forests' vast extent, remote sensing and particularly multispectral satellite image time series (SITS) analysis were suggested as efficient alternatives. Transformers, a state-of-the-art Deep Learning (DL) architecture, have shown promising results in the classification of multivariate SITS for other applications. Here, we use Transformers in combination with Sentinel-2 (S2) time series data to test if they can improve forest disturbance detection capabilities in comparison to conventional methods by automatically extracting relevant information from background variability throughout the whole time series. To match the large training data needs of Transformers, we use a two-step approach including pre-training and finetuning. During pre-training, we use outputs of earlier presented SITS approaches, while during finetuning, we use detailed reference data of known disturbances covering between 10 and 100% of a Sentinel-2 pixel as extracted from aerial images. We test three setups: DL base using ten S2 bands, DL IND using ten vegetation indices (VIs), and DL +IND utilising both as model input. F1-scores across all of our six study sites range between approx. 0.65 (DL +IND) and 0.72 (DL base) in a binary classification (undisturbed vs. disturbed) when considering both full and partial disturbances. DL base outperforms the other setups in forest disturbance detection, and detects disturbance extents as small as 40 m2 within pixels of 100 m2 size. Given the best performance of DL base, handcrafted vegetation indices (VIs) do not improve the model. Our model is competitive with existing approaches and slightly outperforms most earlier reported results, even though a direct comparison is challenging. Considering the option to further refine our trained model if additional reference data becomes available over time, we conclude that a combination of Transformers and Sentinel-2 time series can be developed into an effective tool for forest disturbance monitoring of Central European forests at fine spatial grain."

 Recently the applications of remotely sensed Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) in the study of photosynthesis, stress conditions, and gross primary production have increased significantly. The full SIF spectrum spans over a spectral region of 650 ∼ 850 nm with two characteristic peaks around 685 nm and 740 nm. Over recent decades, many retrieval algorithms have been developed to estimate SIF at Top-Of-Canopy (TOC) using in-situ measurements of solar irradiance and canopy radiance spectra. Although the majority of retrieval methods retrieve SIF at a narrow spectral window, there exists a potential for retrieval of SIF in the full emission spectrum. Moreover, solar irradiance and canopy radiance spectra should ideally be measured at the same time but are usually measured sequentially with a certain time lag, raising potential errors in SIF retrieval. In this study, an enhanced retrieval algorithm of the full SIF spectrum at TOC is proposed. The proposed algorithm attempts to minimize the errors owing to time mismatch in measurements of solar irradiance and canopy radiance spectra. As an improvement to the previous algorithm (advanced Fluorescence Spectrum Reconstruction, aFSR), this proposed algorithm (aFSR-SVE) models the SIF-free contribution with principal components using the singular value decomposition technique. The optimal parameter settings in the forward model were determined for the experimental data collected by spectrometers used in the study. Firstly, the proposed algorithm was used to reconstruct full SIF spectrum for simulated data. The results were compared with known reference SIF values. After achieving satisfying results from simulated data, the proposed algorithm was compared with retrievals from established algorithms using experimental data. The results show improved SIF retrieval accuracy, without the need to simultaneously measure solar irradiance and canopy radiance spectra. The retrieval values comply with the results of previous algorithms in terms of spectral shape, diurnal trend, and temporal variations. The induced errors in SIF retrievals due to non-simultaneous measurements of solar irradiance and canopy radiance spectra were also investigated and the proposed algorithm was found to be less prone to such errors. Hence, the proposed algorithm is an improvement in reconstructing the full SIF spectrum with near-ground measurements. With the help of the proposed algorithm, field measurements using sequential systems and automated measurements of multiple targets can be performed effectively as it relaxes the requirement of concurrent measurement of solar irradiance and canopy radiance spectra. For future work, the applicability of this method can be investigated under more variable illumination conditions, like high cirrus clouds, passing clouds or persistent thin clouds."

In this study, we employed AlexNet architecture, a classical convolutional neural network, combined with multiple variables related to meteorology, chemistry, emission and geography to establish a non-linear relationship between grid-scale input variables and site-scale hourly O3 forecast biases in Eastern China, aiming to realize accurate city-level ozone forecast based on a regional air quality prediction model (i.e., Nested Air Quality Prediction Model System, NAQPMS). By assigning weights to high-bias samples and high-concentration samples within the loss function, the proposed Weighted AlexNet model (W_AlexNet) effectively reduced forecast biases and enhanced its capability to predict O3 pollution levels. Compared to NAQPMS, W_AlexNet model demonstrated a 25.71% improvement in RMSE and a 7.17% increase in IOA averagely for hourly O3 (O3-1h) forecasts across four different lead times (24-h, 48-h, 72-h, and 96-h). Notably, W_AlexNet model alleviated the tendency of NAQPMS to underestimate high concentrations and showed a superior performance in improving O3-1h pollution level forecasts, particularly for the 72-h and 96-h lead times. W_AlexNet model can effectively mitigate the bias accumulation effect over increasing lead times, thereby enhancing the reliability of longer-term forecasts. Thus, the W_AlexNet model serves as a post-processing model that can calibrate forecast biases in air quality prediction models, significantly improving the accuracy of O3 high concentration forecasts and providing more precise early warnings of O3 pollution. This underscores its utility in air quality management."

Our analyses unveil a faunal turnover from early to late Palaeontinidae during the latest Jurassic–earliest Cretaceous, accompanied by a morphological adaptive shift and remarkable improvement in flight abilities including increased flight speed and enhanced maneuverability. The adaptive aerodynamic evolution of Palaeontinidae may have been stimulated by the rise of early birds, supporting the hypothesis of an aerial evolutionary arms race (Air Race) between Palaeontinidae and birds.
