Since theses gases can form new particles, they can influence Arctic climate. We show that the sources of these gases are associated with changes in the Arctic environment during the year, especially with respect to sea ice. Therefore, the concentration of these gases will likely change in the future as the Arctic continues to warm. 
 In this study, we present and analyze the first continuous time series of relevant aerosol precursor vapors from the central Arctic (north of 80° N) during the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition. These precursor vapors include sulfuric acid (SA), methanesulfonic acid (MSA), and iodic acid (IA). We use FLEXPART simulations, inverse modeling, sulfur dioxide (SO2) mixing ratios, and chlorophyll a (chl a) observations to interpret the seasonal variability in the vapor concentrations and identify dominant sources. Our results show that both natural and anthropogenic sources are relevant for the concentrations of SA in the Arctic, but anthropogenic sources associated with Arctic haze are the most prevalent. MSA concentrations are an order of magnitude higher during polar day than during polar night due to seasonal changes in biological activity. Peak MSA concentrations were observed in May, which corresponds with the timing of the annual peak in chl a concentrations north of 75° N. IA concentrations exhibit two distinct peaks during the year, namely a dominant peak in spring and a secondary peak in autumn, suggesting that seasonal IA concentrations depend on both solar radiation and sea ice conditions. In general, the seasonal cycles of SA, MSA, and IA in the central Arctic Ocean are related to sea ice conditions, and we expect that changes in the Arctic environment will affect the concentrations of these vapors in the future. The magnitude of these changes and the subsequent influence on aerosol processes remains uncertain, highlighting the need for continued observations of these precursor vapors in the Arctic."
10.5194/acp-24-12557-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了南极极地涡旋中冬季脱水和极低HCl值对春季臭氧损耗的影响。研究发现，即使考虑了南极冬季的脱水现象和观测到的HCl浓度降低，HCl的“零循环”（由Cl与CH4和CH2O的反应引发）仍然有效，导致HCl浓度保持很低，而破坏臭氧的氯（ClOx）浓度保持较高，从而导致臭氧快速损耗。模拟结果与南极洲春季臭氧观测值相符。 这项研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及臭氧和氯化合物的分析，这需要依赖卫星观测和大气成分分析技术来获取数据，并运用这些数据来监测和评估空气质量。,"['ozone', 'chlorine compounds', 'HCl', 'Antarctic stratospheric vortex', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'air quality monitoring']",Yiran Zhang-Liu;Rolf Müller;Jens-Uwe Grooß;Sabine Robrecht;Bärbel Vogel;Abdul Mannan Zafar;Ralph Lehmann,The impact of dehydration and extremely low HCl values in the Antarctic stratospheric vortex in mid-winter on ozone loss in spring,"HCl null cycles in Antarctica are important for maintaining high values of ozone-destroying chlorine in Antarctic spring. These HCl null cycles are not affected by (1) using the most recent recommendations of chemical kinetics (compared to older recommendations), (2) accounting for dehydration in the Antarctic winter vortex, and (3) considering the observed (but unexplained) depletion of HCl in mid-winter in the Antarctic vortex throughout Antarctic winter. 
 Simulations of Antarctic chlorine and ozone chemistry in previous work show that in the core of the Antarctic vortex (16–18 km, 85–55 hPa, 390–430 K) HCl null cycles (initiated by reactions of Cl with CH4 and CH2O) are effective.  These HCl null cycles cause both HCl molar mixing ratios to remain very low throughout Antarctic winter and spring. They cause ozone-destroying chlorine (ClOx) to remain enhanced so that rapid ozone depletion proceeds.  Here we investigate the impact of the observed dehydration in Antarctica, which strongly reduces ice formation and the uptake of HNO3 from the gas phase; however the efficacy of HCl null cycles is not affected.  Moreover, also when using the observed very low HCl molar mixing ratios in Antarctic winter as an initial value, HCl null cycles are efficient in maintaining low HCl (and high ClOx) throughout winter and spring.  Further, the reaction CH3O2+ClO is important for the efficacy of the HCl null cycle initiated by the reaction CH4+Cl.  Using the current kinetic recommendations instead of earlier ones has very little impact on the simulations.  All simulations presented here for the core of the Antarctic vortex show extremely low minimum ozone values (below 50 ppb) in late September to early October in agreement with observations."
10.5194/acp-24-12643-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了2021年3月发生在东亚的一次特大沙尘暴，使用了创新的方法来改进沙尘排放量的估算。研究人员利用地基气溶胶粒径信息（通过Ångström指数表示）和集合卡尔曼平滑器，对数值模式（WRF-Chem）进行数据同化，优化了沙尘排放模拟。文中比较了仅同化气溶胶光学厚度（AOT）和同时同化AOT和Ångström指数两种方案，结果表明，加入Ångström指数可以显著提高沙尘排放量估算的精度，减少模拟结果与独立观测数据（例如来自AERONET，SONET和CALIOP的观测）之间的误差。该研究对于量化沙尘暴造成的健康损害、航空风险以及对地球系统的影响具有重要意义，也揭示了沙尘暴的气候驱动因素和荒漠化过程。总的来说，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，利用了多种地面和卫星观测数据，以及数据同化技术来改进大气成分（沙尘气溶胶）的分析和模拟。,"['Aerosol optical thickness', 'Ångström exponent', 'Dust storm', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Ground-based observation', 'AERONET', 'SONET', 'CALIOP', 'WRF-Chem', 'Ensemble Kalman smoother']",Yueming Cheng;Tie Dai;Junji Cao;Daisuke Goto;Jianbing Jin;Teruyuki Nakajima;Guangyu Shi,Improving estimation of a record-breaking east Asian dust storm emission with lagged aerosol Ångström exponent observations,"In March 2021, east Asia experienced an outbreak of severe dust storms after an absence of 1.5 decades. Here, we innovatively used the time-lagged ground-based aerosol size information with the fixed-lag ensemble Kalman smoother to optimize dust emission and reproduce the dust storm. This work is valuable for not only the quantification of health damage, aviation risks, and profound impacts on the Earth's system but also revealing the climatic driving force and the process of desertification. 
 A record-breaking east Asian dust storm over recent years occurred in March 2021. The Ångström exponent (AE), which measures the wavelength dependence of aerosol optical thickness (AOT), is significantly sensitive to large aerosols such as dust. Due to the lack of observations during dust storms and the accuracy of the satellite-retrieved AE depending on the instrument and retrieval algorithm, it is possible to estimate the dust storm emission using the time-lagged ground-based AE observations. In this study, the hourly AEs observed by the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) are assimilated with the ensemble Kalman smoother (EnKS) and Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) to optimize simulated dust emissions from 14 to 23 March 2021. The results demonstrate that the additional inclusion of AE can optimize the size distribution of dust emissions and the associated total flux depending on the covariance between time-lagged AE observations and simulated dust emissions in each size bin. Compared to the experiment only assimilating AOT, validation by independent observations from the Skynet Observation NETwork (SONET) shows that assimilating additional AE information reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) of simulated AOT and AE by approximately 17 % and 61 %, respectively. The temporal variation in both simulated AOT and AE is improved through assimilating additional AE information. The assimilation of AOT and AE also makes the magnitude and variations in aerosol vertical extinctions more comparable to the independent Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) observations in both westward and eastward pathways of dust transport. The optimized dust emissions in the Gobi Desert during this period is estimated to be 52.63 Tg and reached a peak value of 3837 kt h−1 at 07:00 UTC on 14 March."
10.5194/acp-24-12661-2024,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文使用数值模型模拟了大量不同特征的海洋层积云，研究了其昼夜演变过程。重点关注的是自由对流层湿度和云与海洋表面的耦合程度对云发展的影响。研究发现，云的耦合程度和日出时的液态水路径会影响云的昼夜变化。耦合程度高的云，液态水路径和云覆盖率下降较少；而耦合程度低的云，尤其是在日出时液态水路径较高的云，液态水路径和云覆盖率下降较快。自由对流层湿度越高，夜间液态水路径越高。该研究主要关注的是海洋层积云的物理过程和数值模拟，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大，例如，没有涉及到具体的遥感传感器、卫星观测数据或大气成分分析。,"['cloud properties', 'cloud cover', 'radiation budget', 'large-eddy simulation', 'marine stratocumulus']",Yao-Sheng Chen;Jianhao Zhang;Fabian Hoffmann;Takanobu Yamaguchi;Franziska Glassmeier;Xiaoli Zhou;Graham Feingold,Diurnal evolution of non-precipitating marine stratocumuli in a large-eddy simulation ensemble,"Marine stratocumulus cloud is a type of shallow cloud that covers the vast areas of Earth's surface. It plays an important role in Earth's energy balance by reflecting solar radiation back to space. We used numerical models to simulate a large number of marine stratocumuli with different characteristics. We found that how the clouds develop throughout the day is affected by the level of humidity in the air above the clouds and how closely the clouds connect to the ocean surface. 
 We explore the cloud system evolution of non-precipitating marine stratocumuli with a focus on the impacts of the diurnal cycle and free-tropospheric (FT) humidity based on an ensemble of 244 large-eddy simulations generated by perturbing initial thermodynamic profiles and aerosol conditions. Cases are categorized based on their degree of decoupling and the cloud liquid water path (LWPc, based on model columns with cloud optical depths greater than one). A budget analysis method is proposed to analyze the evolution of cloud water in both coupled and decoupled boundary layers. More coupled clouds start with a relatively low LWPc and cloud fraction (fc) but experience the least decrease in LWPc and fc during the daytime. More decoupled clouds undergo greater daytime reduction in LWPc and fc, especially those with higher LWPc at sunrise because they suffer from faster weakening of net radiative cooling. During the nighttime, a positive correlation between FT humidity and the LWPc emerges, consistent with higher FT humidity reducing both radiative cooling and the humidity jump, both of which reduce entrainment and increase LWPc. The LWPc is more likely to decrease during the nighttime for a larger LWPc and greater inversion base height (zi), conditions under which entrainment dominates as turbulence develops. In the morning, the rate of the LWPc reduction depends on the LWPc at sunrise, zi, and the degree of decoupling, with distinct contributions from subsidence and radiation."
10.5194/acp-24-12575-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了韩国首尔地区大气中亚硝酸 (HONO) 的化学过程。HONO 是羟基自由基 (OH) 的主要前体物，而 OH 自由基参与了多种二次气态污染物的形成。研究者使用改进的 CMAQ 化学传输模式，逐步加入了气相反应、交通排放、土壤排放、气溶胶表面非均相生成、树叶和建筑物表面非均相生成以及硝酸盐再硝化等多种 HONO 来源和过程。通过与首尔奥林匹克公园站的观测数据对比，评估了改进模型的模拟性能。结果表明，考虑了完整 HONO 过程的 CMAQ 模型，其模拟的 HONO 浓度与实测值更接近，显著提高了模型的精度。该研究有助于改进大气化学模型，更好地理解和预测空气质量，对环境保护具有重要意义。它与大气环境遥感技术相关，因为研究使用了地面观测数据来验证模型，并且改进的模型可以用于结合卫星观测数据或其他遥感数据来更全面地监测和分析大气成分。,"['Atmospheric composition', 'Nitrous acid (HONO)', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Chemical transport model (CTM)', 'Ground-based observation']",Kiyeon Kim;Kyung Man Han;Chul Han Song;Hyojun Lee;Ross Beardsley;Jinhyeok Yu;Greg Yarwood;Bonyoung Koo;Jasper Madalipay;Jung-Hun Woo;Seogju Cho,An investigation into atmospheric nitrous acid (HONO) processes in South Korea,"We incorporated each HONO process into the current CMAQ modeling framework to enhance the accuracy of HONO mixing ratio predictions. These results expand our understanding of HONO photochemistry and identify crucial sources of HONO that impact the total HONO budget in Seoul, South Korea. Through this investigation, we contribute to resolving discrepancies in understanding chemical transport models, with implications for better air quality management and environmental protection in the region. 
 Nitrous acid (HONO) is a main precursor of hydroxyl radicals (OH), which contribute to the formation of numerous secondary air pollutants in the troposphere. Despite its importance in atmospheric chemistry, HONO chemistry has not been fully incorporated into many chemical transport models (CTMs). Due to the lack of atmospheric HONO processes, CTM simulations often tend to underestimate atmospheric mixing ratios of HONO. This study was undertaken because simulations with the current Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model have a strong tendency to underestimate the HONO mixing ratio. In search of missing sources of atmospheric HONO, we attempted to sequentially incorporate the following potential HONO sources and processes into the CMAQ modeling framework: (i) gas-phase HONO reactions, (ii) traffic HONO emissions, (iii) soil HONO emissions, (iv) heterogeneous HONO production on the surfaces of aerosols, (v) heterogeneous HONO formation on tree leaf and building surfaces, and (vi) photolysis reactions of particulates and deposited HNO3/nitrates called “renoxification”. The simulation performances of the modified CMAQ models were then evaluated by comparing the modeled HONO mixing ratios with the HONO mixing ratios observed at the Olympic Park station in Seoul, South Korea. When HONO processes were fully added to the CMAQ model, average daily HONO mixing ratios increased from 0.06 to 1.18 ppb. The daytime HONO mixing ratios produced from the CMAQ model run with a full account of atmospheric HONO processes were found to be in better agreement with observations than those from the original CMAQ model (CMAQv5.2.1) runs with improved statistical metrics (e.g., the index of agreement (IOA) increased from 0.59 to 0.68, while the mean bias (MB) decreased dramatically from −0.57 to −0.34 ppb). In addition, we investigated the contributions of individual atmospheric HONO processes to HONO mixing ratios, as well as the impacts of HONO atmospheric processes on the concentrations of other atmospheric species in South Korea. All these issues are also discussed in this paper."
10.5194/acp-24-12623-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了2019年春季和夏季平流层入侵对中国中东部近地面臭氧的影响。研究者提出了一种可追溯性评估方法，利用环境空气质量观测、全球臭氧再分析数据和定制的拉格朗日模拟，识别出平流层入侵的关键源区。结果表明，间接入侵对对流层臭氧的影响在月尺度上更为显著，而直接入侵的影响在日尺度上更为明显。东部平原地区受平流层入侵影响最为严重，近地面臭氧超标事件频繁发生。研究还揭示了西伯利亚西部和蒙古是间接和直接平流层入侵最重要的源区，罗斯贝波和东北冷涡是重要的驱动环流系统。该研究对预测和减轻平流层入侵对中国臭氧污染的影响具有重要意义，也为应对气候变化带来的挑战做出了贡献。  研究中使用了多种大气环境遥感技术，例如地面空气质量监测数据、全球臭氧再分析数据（这部分数据可能来自卫星观测），以及拉格朗日模拟等数值模拟方法，对大气成分（臭氧）进行分析，因此与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['Tropospheric ozone', 'Stratospheric ozone', 'Ozone pollution', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Satellite observations', 'Lagrangian simulations', 'Atmospheric composition analysis', 'Rossby waves', 'Source tracing', 'Critical source areas']",Kai Meng;Tianliang Zhao;Yongqing Bai;Ming Wu;Le Cao;Xuewei Hou;Yuehan Luo;Yongcheng Jiang,Tracing the origins of stratospheric ozone intrusions: direct vs. indirect pathways and their impacts on Central and Eastern China in spring–summer 2019,"We studied the impact of stratospheric intrusions (SIs) on tropospheric and near-surface ozone in Central and Eastern China from a stratospheric source tracing perspective. SIs contribute the most in the eastern plains, with a contribution exceeding 15 %, and have a small contribution to the west and south. Western Siberia and Mongolia are the most critical source areas for indirect and direct SIs, with the Rossby wave and northeast cold vortex being important driving circulation systems. 
 The impact of stratospheric intrusions (SIs) on Central and Eastern China (CEC) with severe ozone pollution presents a range of uncertainties, underscoring the imperative for sustained research endeavors. In this study, we propose a traceability assessment method that can derive high-resolution critical source areas (CSAs) of SIs by utilizing ambient air quality observations, global ozone (re)analysis data, and customized Lagrangian simulations. This approach enables us to facilitate a meticulous and systematic examination of the impact of direct and indirect SIs on tropospheric and near-surface ozone in six important sub-regions within the CEC during the spring and summer of 2019, as well as the unique circulations driving SIs, from a more refined and targeted tracing perspective. The findings reveal that impacts of indirect intrusions are more efficient at monthly scales, with contributions to tropospheric ozone reaching up to twice the magnitude of direct intrusions. The impacts of direct intrusions are more pronounced at daily scales, primarily occurring in May. In terms of contribution to near-surface ozone, the eastern plains frequently witness ozone exceedance events, with the most substantial impact from SIs observed (e.g., contributing 15.8 % and 16.7 % to near-surface ozone in North China and East China, respectively), showcasing a remarkable ability to capture descending lower-stratospheric air. In contrast, the Loess Plateau and Central China, situated in central and western high-altitude regions, receive more intrusive ozone into the troposphere but exhibit minimal contributions to near-surface ozone. The indirect intrusions that generate the above impact come from three to four CSAs located thousands of kilometers away, evenly distributed latitudinally within the westerlies between 40 and 70° N (spaced 70 longitudes apart). These CSAs are intricately linked to the evolution of synoptic-scale Rossby waves or subtropical westerly jets, with western Siberia or Europe and north Africa identified as the most significant CSAs. Conversely, the CSAs for direct intrusions are relatively concentrated, with those influencing the middle troposphere originating from the Tibetan Plateau and those influencing the lower troposphere predominantly located in Mongolia and central Russia, just a few hundred kilometers from the CEC. These sources are associated with typical atmospheric circulations such as the northeast cold vortex and the South Asian High, where the intensity of the intrusion system plays a more crucial role than its frequency of occurrence. This study provides valuable insights for forecasting and mitigating the impact of SIs on ozone pollution in China and contributes to addressing the broader challenges posed by climate change."
10.5194/amt-17-6517-2024,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这篇论文介绍了一种名为ODCOD的新算法，该算法利用CALIPSO卫星搭载的CALIOP激光雷达的海洋表面反向散射数据来反演大气总柱光学厚度。与CALIOP标准反演算法不同，ODCOD能够估算包含所有颗粒物（包括云和气溶胶）的全柱光学厚度，即使在没有探测到颗粒物层的情况下也能进行估算。论文比较了ODCOD结果与其他已验证数据集（例如HSRL、MODIS和SODA）的差异，结果表明ODCOD在白天与其他数据集吻合较好，但在夜间估算值较高。ODCOD算法的提出为改进CALIPSO数据记录，验证CALIOP标准估算结果以及改进消光系数反演提供了新的可能性，这对于大气环境遥感技术，特别是空气质量监测和大气成分分析具有重要意义。,"['Aerosol optical depth', 'CALIPSO', 'CALIOP lidar', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Atmospheric composition', 'Ocean surface backscatter']",Robert A.

Getzewich,Total column optical depths retrieved from CALIPSO lidar ocean surface backscatter,"We introduce Ocean Derived Column Optical Depth (ODCOD), a new way to estimate column optical depths using Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) measurements from the ocean surface. ODCOD estimates include contributions from particulates in the full column, which CALIOP estimates do not, making it a complement measurement to CALIOP’s standard estimates. We find that ODCOD compares well with other established data sets in the daytime but tends to estimate higher at night. 
 This paper introduces the Ocean Derived Column Optical Depth (ODCOD) algorithm. ODCOD is now being used to retrieve full-column optical depths from the 532 nm measurements acquired by the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aboard the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) spacecraft. ODCOD uses the lidar integrated attenuated backscatter from the ocean surface, together with collocated wind speed estimates from Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2), to estimate the full-column optical depths of particulates (i.e., clouds and aerosols) in the Earth's atmosphere. Unlike CALIOP's standard retrievals, which estimate optical depths only when particulate layers are detected, ODCOD retrievals deliver a comprehensive estimate that accounts for attenuation by all particulates present within the lidar profiles. This paper describes the ODCOD algorithm, develops random uncertainty estimates, and characterizes the systematic differences between ODCOD optical depths and those reported by previously validated data sets. This paper presents performance assessments of ODCOD cloud-free profiles to compare the ODCOD aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals to collocated measurements made by the airborne High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) instruments flown by NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC), to daytime estimates derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and to daytime and nighttime retrievals using the Synergized Optical Depth of Aerosols (SODA) algorithm. ODCOD AODs are biased high relative to LaRC HSRL AODs by 0.009 ± 0.043 (median ± median absolute deviation), with a correlation coefficient of 0.724, and biased low relative to MODIS by 0.009 ± 0.041, with a correlation coefficient of 0.834. Relative to SODA, which derives AOD from a combination of CALIOP and CloudSat ocean surface measurements, ODCOD is biased high in the daytime by 0.004 ± 0.035 and higher at night by 0.027 ± 0.034, with correlation coefficients of 0.887 and 0.891, respectively. Because ODCOD estimates are independent from the standard CALIOP optical depth retrievals, they offer potential for future advances in the CALIPSO data record, both in validating CALIOP's standard estimates and as a potential total column constraint to improve extinction coefficient retrievals."
10.5194/amt-17-6485-2024,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这篇论文介绍了一种名为NitroNet的机器学习模型，该模型能够利用TROPOMI卫星观测数据预测对流层NO2浓度剖面。模型使用区域化学传输模式WRF-Chem生成的合成数据进行训练，这是首个能够预测完整对流层NO2剖面的模型。研究对模型进行了全面的验证，涵盖了全球不同地区和季节。结果表明，在夏季，NitroNet与TROPOMI卫星数据、地面观测数据和MAX-DOAS测量数据具有很高的相关性和较小的偏差；冬季表现虽然有所下降，但仍优于传统区域化学传输模型。NitroNet的独特之处在于它使用了合成模型数据进行训练，克服了以往基于实测数据模型在预测完整对流层NO2剖面方面的局限性，并避免了实测数据中存在的偏差问题。总而言之，这项研究为利用卫星遥感技术进行大气环境监测，特别是对流层NO2浓度分析提供了新的方法和工具。,"['Tropospheric NO2', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Satellite observations', 'Atmospheric composition analysis', 'TROPOMI', 'WRF-Chem', 'Deep learning', 'Neural network', 'NO2 profile prediction']",Leon Kuhn;Steffen Beirle;Sergey Osipov;Andrea Pozzer;Thomas Wagner,NitroNet – a machine learning model for the prediction of tropospheric NO2 profiles from TROPOMI observations,"This paper presents a new machine learning model that allows us to compute NO2 concentration profiles from satellite observations. A neural network was trained on synthetic data from the regional chemistry and transport model WRF-Chem. This is the first model of its kind. We present a thorough model validation study, covering various seasons and regions of the world. 
 We introduce NitroNet, a deep learning model for the prediction of tropospheric NO2 profiles from satellite column measurements. NitroNet is a neural network trained on synthetic NO2 profiles from the regional chemistry and transport model WRF-Chem, which was operated on a European domain for the month of May 2019. This WRF-Chem simulation was constrained by in situ and satellite measurements, which were used to optimize important simulation parameters (e.g. the boundary layer scheme). The NitroNet model receives NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and ancillary variables (meteorology, emissions, etc.) as input, from which it reproduces NO2 concentration profiles. Training of the neural network is conducted on a filtered dataset, meaning that NO2 profiles showing strong disagreement (>20 %) with colocated TROPOMI column measurements are discarded.We present a first evaluation of NitroNet over a variety of geographical and temporal domains (Europe, the US West Coast, India, and China) and different seasons. For this purpose, we validate the NO2 profiles predicted by NitroNet against satellite, in situ, and MAX-DOAS (Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) measurements. The training data were previously validated against the same datasets. During summertime, NitroNet shows small biases and strong correlations with all three datasets: a bias of +6.7 % and R=0.95 for TROPOMI NO2 VCDs, a bias of −10.5 % and R=0.75 for AirBase surface concentrations, and a bias of −34.3 % to +99.6 % with R=0.83–0.99 for MAX-DOAS measurements. In comparison to TROPOMI satellite data, NitroNet even shows significantly lower errors and stronger correlation than a direct comparison with WRF-Chem numerical results. During wintertime considerable low biases arise because the summertime/late-spring training data are not fully representative of all atmospheric wintertime characteristics (e.g. longer NO2 lifetimes). Nonetheless, the wintertime performance of NitroNet is surprisingly good and comparable to that of classic regional chemistry and transport models. NitroNet can demonstrably be used outside the geographic and temporal domain of the training data with only slight performance reductions. What makes NitroNet unique when compared to similar existing deep learning models is the inclusion of synthetic model data, which offers important benefits: due to the lack of NO2 profile measurements, models trained on empirical datasets are limited to the prediction of surface concentrations learned from in situ measurements. NitroNet, however, can predict full tropospheric NO2 profiles. Furthermore, in situ measurements of NO2 are known to suffer from biases, often larger than +20 %, due to cross-sensitivities to photooxidants, which other models trained on empirical data inevitably reproduce."

SARAH-3 is a satellite-based climate data record of surface solar radiation parameters. It is generated and distributed by the EUMETSAT Climate Monitoring Satellite Application Facility (CM SAF).

 The amount of energy reaching Earth's surface from the Sun is a quantity of high importance for the climate system and for renewable energy applications. SARAH-3 (SurfAce Radiation DAtaset Heliosat,  https://doi.org/10.5676/EUM_SAF_CM/SARAH/V003, Pfeifroth et al., 2023) is a new version of a satellite-based climate data record of surface solar radiation parameters, generated and distributed by the European Organisation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Climate Monitoring Satellite Application Facility (CM SAF). SARAH-3 provides data from 1983 onwards, i.e. more than 4 decades of data, and has a spatial resolution of 0.05° × 0.05°, a temporal resolution of 30 min and daily and monthly means for the region covered by the Meteosat field of view (65° W to 65° E and 65° S to 65° N). SARAH-3 consists of seven parameters: surface irradiance, direct irradiance, direct normal irradiance, sunshine duration, daylight, photosynthetically active radiation and effective cloud albedo. SARAH-3 data between 1983 and 2020 have been generated with stable input data (i.e. satellite and auxiliary data) to ensure a high temporal stability; these data are temporally extended by operational near-real-time processing – the so-called Interim Climate Data Record. The data record is suitable for various applications, from climate monitoring to renewable energy. The validation of SARAH-3 shows good accuracy (deviations of ∼ 5 W m−2 from surface reference measurements for monthly surface irradiance), stability of the data record and further improvements over its predecessor SARAH-2.1.

These maps produced in this study provide critical datasets for forest sustainable management in China, including climate change mitigation (e.g., terrestrial carbon estimation), forest ecosystem assessment, and forest inventory practices. 
 Forest stand mean height is a critical indicator in forestry, playing a pivotal role in various aspects such as forest inventory, sustainable forest management practices, climate change mitigation strategies, monitoring of forest structure changes, and wildlife habitat assessment. However, there is currently a lack of large-scale, spatially continuous forest stand mean height maps. This is primarily due to the requirement of accurate measurement of individual tree height in each forest plot, a task that cannot effectively be achieved by existing globally covered, discrete footprint-based satellite platforms. To address this gap, this study was conducted using over 1117 km2 of close-range light detection and ranging (lidar) data, which enables the measurement of individual tree heights in forest plots with high precision. Apart from lidar data, this study incorporated spatially continuous climatic, edaphic, topographic, vegetative, and synthetic aperture radar data as explanatory variables to map the tree-based arithmetic mean height (ha) and weighted mean height (hw) at 30 m resolution across China. Due to limitations in obtaining the basal area of individual tree within plots using uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) lidar data, this study calculated the weighted mean height through weighting an individual tree height by the square of its height. In addition, to overcome the potential influence of different vegetation divisions at a large spatial scale, we also developed a machine-learning-based mixed-effects (MLME) model to map forest stand mean height across China. The results showed that the average ha and hw across China were 11.3 and 13.3 m with standard deviations of 2.9 and 3.3 m, respectively. The accuracy of mapped products was validated utilizing lidar and field measurement data. The correlation coefficient (r) for ha and hw ranged from 0.603 to 0.906 and 0.634 to 0.889, while the root mean square error (RMSE) ranged from 2.6 to 4.1  and 2.9 to 4.3 m, respectively. Comparing with existing forest canopy height maps derived using the area-based approach, it was found that our products of ha and hw performed better and aligned more closely with the natural definition of tree height. The methods and maps presented in this study provide a solid foundation for estimating carbon storage, monitoring changes in forest structure, managing forest inventory, and assessing wildlife habitat availability.

Here we present the data, covering over sixty years of daily observations, conducted along the East Atlantic coast, spanning from the tropics to the northern extratropics. 
 Tropospheric ozone (O3) plays a key role in the climate system. Studying pre-industrial tropospheric O3 implies two important challenges: i) the lack of observational records prior to the late 19th century, which hampers understanding long-term climate trends, given O3 crucial role, ii) and the uncertainties on their quantitative values in a non-polluted atmosphere across the planet. The ozonoscope was the first instrument used to measure ozone. It offers semi-quantitative estimates of surface O3 when no other measurements were available. Despite their potential value, the digitisation, curation and publication of ozonoscope data remains largely unexplored. In this work, we initiate an effort to rescue surface O3 ozonoscope records with a new data collection. We include data from 23 observatories covering Portugal and the African Atlantic regions, providing a latitudinal span from the extratropics in the northern hemisphere to the tropics in the southern hemisphere. This record represents the most extended ozonoscope data series to date, spanning 50 years of daily data and 58 years of monthly data, from 1855 to 1913."

Here, an effort has been made to improve the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model version 4.2.2 by introducing a unique theoretical framework under convective conditions. In addition, to enhance the potential applicability of the WRF modeling system, various commonly used similarity functions under convective conditions have also been installed. 
 The accurate parameterization of atmospheric surface layer processes is crucial for weather forecasts using numerical weather prediction models. Here, an attempt has been made to improve the surface layer parameterization in the Weather Research and Forecasting model version 4.2.2 (WRFv4.2.2) by implementing similarity functions proposed by Kader and Yaglom (1990) to make it consistent in producing the transfer coefficient for momentum observed over the tropical region (Srivastava and Sharan, 2015). The surface layer module in WRFv4.2.2 is modified in such a way that it contains the commonly used similarity functions for momentum (φm) and heat (φh) under convective conditions instead of the existing single functional form. The updated module has various alternatives of φm and φh, which can be controlled by a flag introduced in the input file. The impacts of utilizing different functional forms have been evaluated using the bulk flux algorithm as well as real-case simulations with the WRFv4.2.2 model. The model-simulated variables have been evaluated with observational data from a flux tower at Ranchi (23.412° N, 85.440° E), India, and the ERA5-Land reanalysis dataset. The transfer coefficient for momentum simulated using the implemented scheme is found to agree well with its observed non-monotonic behavior in convective conditions (Srivastava and Sharan, 2021). The study suggests that the updated surface layer scheme performs well in simulating the surface transfer coefficients and could be potentially utilized for the  parameterization of surface fluxes under convective conditions in the WRF model."

The best bias correction method for each grid is selected differently depending on the weighting case. The best bias correction method can vary depending on factors such as climate and terrain. 
 This study, conducted across six continents, evaluated and compared the effectiveness of three Quantile Mapping (QM) methods: Quantile Delta Mapping (QDM), Empirical Quantile Mapping (EQM), and Detrended Quantile Mapping (DQM) for correcting daily precipitation data from 11 CMIP6 General Circulation Models (GCMs). The performance of corrected precipitation data was evaluated using ten evaluation metrics, and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was applied to calculate performance-based priorities. Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) was used to quantify model-specific and ensemble prediction uncertainties. Subsequently, this study developed a comprehensive index by aggregating the performance scores from TOPSIS with the uncertainty metrics from BMA. The results showed that EQM performed the best on all continents, effectively managing performance and uncertainty. QDM outperformed other methods in specific regions and was selected more frequently than DQM when greater weight was given to uncertainty. It suggests that daily precipitation corrected by QDM is more stable than DQM. On the other hand, DQM effectively reproduces dry climate but shows the highest uncertainty in certain regions, suggesting potential limitations in capturing long-term climate trends. This study emphasizes that both performance and uncertainty should be considered when choosing a bias correction method to increase the reliability of climate predictions."

Herein, poly(vinyl chloride) microplastics (5% w/w) were weathered for 12 months in sandy soil, silty clay, and silt loam. The results showed that the continuous increase of C═O and O–H groups (rate constant, k = 0.080–0.424 m–1) with time was observed on the surface of MPs aging in sandy soil due to the leading role of •OH induced by light irradiation. In the loam soil, the abundant coating of aluminosilicates and iron oxides on the MP surface by the formation of mineral-hydroxyl groups inhibited the generation of the C═O group (k < 0.165 m–1). The k of the characteristic bond C–Cl during the first 9 months was 9.51 and 1.93 times higher in clay compared to that in sandy and loam soil, respectively, revealing that dechlorination triggered the first step of the aging process for MPs in clay owing to the participation of degrading bacteria (Phenylobacterium and Caulobacteraceae).

Tracking airport-related emissions is especially difficult, as a portion of emissions are elevated above the surface. While satellite-based NO2 observations show hot-spots near airports, near-source retrievals often have large biases related to uncertainties in the NO2 vertical distribution and resultant air mass factors (AMF). Here we use observations from UV–vis spectrometers (Pandora 1S, SciGlob) deployed near the Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International airport from April 2020–May 2021 to assess the impact of aviation on NO2 vertical profiles. We show the first near-airport sky-scanning Pandora observations, which are used to distinguish the airport plume from the urban background. We find that increasing aviation leads to higher NO2 over the airport, and the enhancement is distributed across the mixed layer near-equally. We compare observed profiles with those modeled by the Goddard Earth Observing System composition forecast (GEOS-CF) system. We find that modeled profiles attribute a larger portion of the column closer to the surface and underestimate the NO2 mixing height. Observed profiles typically exhibited greater NO2 concentrations up to 2.5 km above ground level. Air mass factors (AMF) calculated using observations (AMFFused) are similar over Hartsfield-Jackson to those calculated using GEOS-CF (AMFGEOS-CF). The unexpected similarity in alternative AMFs is attributed to the altitude-dependent sensitivity of AMFFused to changes in NO2 concentration. Using either AMFFused or AMFGEOS-CF to evaluate TROPOMI NO2 against independent direct-sun observations produces consistent normalized mean differences of −22% and −29%, respectively. Overall, these results demonstrate the benefits of a combined ground and satellite-based approach for probing a complex distribution of NOx emissions in an urban area."

Copper (Cu) is an essential metal involved in neural system, and its homeostasis is the key to maintain its proper function. Herein, the subcellular locations of Cu(I) and Cu(II) in  human neurodegenerative disease SH-SY5Y cells and AD mouse brains were imaged. We found that the content of Cu(II) decreased while that of Cu(I) increased under Aβ exposure, which were further verified in the brain tissues of the AD mouse model, strongly suggesting the disruption of Cu homeostasis under Aβ exposure or AD. Remarkably, the mitochondrial and lysosomal Cu(II) decreased significantly, whereas Cu(I) decreased in mitochondria but increased in lysosome. Lysosomes digested the damaged mitochondria via mitophagy to remove excess Cu(I) and maintain Cu homeostasis. The Aβ induced Cu(I) in mitochondria resulted in an overformation of reactive oxygen species and altered the morphology of this organelle. Due to the oxidative stress, glutathione (GSH) was converted into glutathione disulfide (GSSG), and Cu(I) bound with GSH was further released into the cytoplasm and absorbed by the lysosome. Transcriptomic analysis showed that genes (ATP7A/B) related to Cu transportation were upregulated, whereas genes related to mitochondrial complex were down-regulated, representing the damage of this organelle. This study demonstrated that Aβ exposure caused the disruption of intracellular homeostasis by reducing Cu(II) to Cu(I) and damaging the mitochondria, which further triggered  detoxification by the lysosome.

Four dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVar) enhances model states, relying on the prediction model to propagate observation to the initial field. Consequently, the initial fields from traditional DA are not optimal for ML‐based models, necessitating a customized DA system.

10.1029/2024GL109927,True,Geophysical Research Letters,这篇论文研究了韩国两次严重气象干旱期间土壤水分的差异化响应。虽然1994-1996年干旱的累积降水赤字略低于2013-2017年干旱，但前者土壤水分出现了创纪录的负异常，而后者的累积负异常却不到前者的一半。研究发现，1994-1996年干旱早期就出现了强烈的降水赤字，导致后续在干旱条件下降水短缺进一步加剧，且降水赤字不仅出现在湿季，也出现在旱季。这放大了土壤水分的响应，因为即使在干旱土壤条件下降水减少，径流量仍然相对恒定，最终导致土壤水分保持能力下降。相反，2013-2017年干旱的降水赤字出现在事件后期和湿季，导致土壤水分干燥信号较为温和。该研究利用土壤水分数据，结合降水数据分析了不同干旱事件下土壤水分的响应机制，这与利用卫星遥感技术监测干旱，特别是利用卫星观测土壤水分和降水数据密切相关。,"['soil moisture', 'precipitation', 'drought monitoring', 'satellite remote sensing', 'meteorological drought', 'agricultural drought', 'soil water retention']",Yoo‐Geun Ham;Yerim Jeong;Eunkyo Seo,Distinct Propagation to Agricultural Drought Between Two Severe Meteorological Droughts in the Korean Peninsula,"Distinct responses in the soil moisture (SM) between the two most severe meteorological droughts in Korea are examined. Although total accumulated precipitation deficit during 1994–1996 drought was slightly less than in the 2013–2017 drought, 1994–1996 drought showed a record‐breaking negative SM anomalies, while the accumulated negative SM anomalies during 2013–2017 were less than half of those in 1994–1996. In 1994–1996 case, robust precipitation deficits occurred early in the event, leading to subsequent precipitation shortages under dry conditions. In addition, precipitation deficit was observed not only during wet seasons but also throughout dry seasons. This amplifies the SM response, as the runoff volume remains relatively constant despite reduced precipitation in arid soil conditions, which eventually reduces soil water retention led by the precipitation deficit. Conversely, in 2013–2017 case, precipitation deficit occurred during later period of the event and wet seasons, which leads a moderate SM drying signals."

We hypothesize that part of this model bias comes from ignoring precipitation‐induced surface sensible heat flux (QP). To test this conjecture, we performed simulations with and without QP for April 2009 and June 2006. The inclusion of QP reduced the bias in diurnal peak precipitation amplitude by 83% in April 2009 and 23% in June 2006. Similarly, the bias in precipitation peak timing decreased by 26% and 15%, respectively. This bias reduction was even more prominent during periods of heavier rainfall. This improvement in both the amplitude and phase of diurnal precipitation also led to a reduction in bias for total precipitation by ∼10%. These findings suggest that QP cannot be neglected over the MC, particularly during heavy precipitation."

Gordillo‐Vazquez,Discerning TGF and Leader Current Pulse in ASIM Observation,Terrestrial gamma ray flash (TGF) observations made by the Atmosphere‐Space Interaction Monitor (ASIM) have demonstrated that these TGFs are accompanied by a prominent optical pulse from a hot leader channel. It is hard to confidently resolve the true sequence of the events in the source region due to temporal proximity of the involved processes. Here we report a bright long duration TGF together with its associated optical recordings showing clear temporal separation between the TGF and the optical pulse. In this observation the optical pulse is clearly distinct and subsequent relative to the TGF. The corresponding lightning discharge occurred at the very end of the TGF. We conclude that the current surge inside the lightning leader channel cannot be responsible for generation of this TGF. The current surge that produced the associated optical pulse can itself be conditioned by the TGF and may be responsible for the TGF termination.

We infer the relationship between unit‐cell volume, pressure and iron content directly from the data by training Mixture Density Networks and derive bulk modulus, density and bulk sound velocity from the outputs. This allows us to constrain the effect of the spin crossover on these properties and estimate their uncertainties for different iron contents.

This study investigates the propagation diversity of the 20–40‐day summer precipitation oscillation in MLYR and its underlying mechanism. The 20–40‐day oscillation events manifest as three types: northward propagation, southward propagation, and local oscillation. For northward and southward events, the propagation of precipitation is accompanied by the movement of 20–40‐day low‐frequency cyclonic vortices in the lower troposphere. Further investigation into the mechanism of anomalous vorticity propagation accompanying low‐frequency vortices reveals that positive relative vorticity advection in the north of the vortex facilitates its northward propagation. Moreover, the positive advection is primarily reliant on the background southerly winds to transport the low‐frequency vorticity. Diabatic heating dominates the southward propagation of low‐frequency precipitation. The center of the latent heating is located in the south of the low‐frequency vortex, which steers its southward migration. Furthermore, the uneven spatial distribution of latent heating across the vortex may be attributed to the non‐uniform distribution of mean humidity. Based on the above results, sensitivity experiments are conducted using a regional climate model (RegCM4.6). The results demonstrate that when the southerly winds are increased (decreased) or the specific humidity gradient is decreased (increased), the southward (northward) events weaken and disappear, or transitioned into local oscillations or northward (southward) events. This further validates the physical processes through which the basic flow and humidity inhomogeneities affect the meridional propagation of the 20–40‐day oscillations of precipitation."

Brumer,Impact of Surface Turbulent Fluxes on the Formation of Roll Vortices in a Mediterranean Windstorm,"Roll vortices can have a significant influence on the exchanges of momentum, sensible heat and moisture throughout the boundary layer. They have been shown to reinforce air‐sea interactions under strong wind conditions. This raises the question of how air‐sea exchanges can, in turn, affect the roll vortices. However, representing surface turbulent fluxes during extreme wind conditions is a major challenge in numerical weather prediction and can lead to large uncertainties in surface wind speed. The sensitivity of rolls to different representations of surface fluxes is investigated using large eddy simulations. The study focuses on Mediterranean windstorm Adrian, where rolls are responsible for the transport of strong winds to the surface. Considering the effects of sea spray increases surface heat fluxes and significantly influences the roll morphology. The rolls become narrower and extend over a greater height, while the downward transport of momentum is intensified and results in higher wind speed near the surface. Roll vortices vanish within a few minutes in the absence of momentum fluxes, which maintain the wind shear necessary for their organization. They also quickly weaken without sensible heat fluxes, which sustain the near‐neutral stratification required for their development. In contrast, latent heat fluxes play a minor role. These findings emphasize the necessity of precisely representing the processes occurring at the air‐sea interface, which do not only affect the thermodynamic surface conditions but also the vertical transport of momentum within the windstorm."

Most studies have linked these droughts to large‐scale modes of variability, whereas few studies have investigated droughts from the perspective of weather systems. The current study examines a wide range of weather systems focusing especially on heavy rainfall events, which are important to meteorological drought. Two distinct phases (development and recovery) are identified for the Millennium Drought based on the cumulative standardized precipitation index. Differences in precipitation from heavy rainfall events between the two drought phases are most pronounced in autumn and summer. The pronounced reduction in precipitation from autumn heavy rainfall events during the development phase is due to fewer, less intense, faster‐moving warm conveyor belts. In contrast, increased precipitation from autumn heavy rainfall events in the recovery phase is explained by an interaction between warm conveyor belts and upper‐level anticyclonic potential vorticity with a persistent anticyclonic circulation over the Tasman Sea acting to slow the eastward propagation of rainfall‐producing weather systems.

10.1029/2024JD041679,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文研究了人为源和生物源排放物相互作用对二次有机气溶胶（SOA）形成的放大效应，尤其关注人为排放物对中国南方珠江三角洲附近南岭山区森林中生物源SOA（BSOA）形成的影响。研究人员在南岭山顶和山脚同时测量了典型的生物源和人为源SOA示踪物，结果发现BSOA示踪物的浓度出乎意料的高，超过了世界上大多数其他背景地区。白天山脚的BSOA示踪物水平与夜间水平一致，而山顶的夜间浓度则显著高于白天。山顶夜间O3与BSOA示踪物之间的正相关性表明高浓度O3刺激了BSOA的形成，而山脚O3与异戊二烯衍生SOA示踪物之间的负相关性则表明其他氧化剂也可能影响SOAI的形成。研究还发现，随着人为污染物（例如SO2和NO2）的到来，BSOA示踪物浓度显著升高，表明人为污染通过增强气溶胶酸度放大了BSOA的形成。这种放大效应可能因NH3和相对湿度（RH）的增加而减轻。该研究结果为了解人为和生物排放物之间在SOA形成和垂直分布上的相互作用提供了宝贵的见解，与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、大气成分分析密切相关，虽然文中没有直接提及具体的卫星或传感器，但研究结果可为改进大气环境遥感模型和反演算法提供数据支持。,"['Secondary Organic Aerosol (SOA)', 'Biogenic SOA (BSOA)', 'Anthropogenic SOA', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Atmospheric composition', 'O3', 'SO2', 'NO2', 'NH3', 'Aerosol acidity', 'Satellite observation (implied)', 'Ground-based observation']",Fangyuan Ma;Hao Wang;Yaozhou Ding;Shenyang Zhang;Gengchen Wu;Yanlei Li;Daocheng Gong;Zoran Ristovski;Congrong He;Boguang Wang,Amplified Secondary Organic Aerosol Formation Induced by Anthropogenic–Biogenic Interactions in Forests Around Megacities,"The amplification effect of anthropogenic‐biogenic interactions on secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation remains debated, particularly regarding the impact of anthropogenic emissions on biogenic SOA (BSOA) formation in forests near megacities. This study concurrently measured typical biogenic and anthropogenic SOA tracers during day and night at the summit (1,690 m a.s.l.) and foot (200 m a.s.l.) of the Nanling mountains, a large subtropical forest adjacent to the Pearl River Delta (PRD) in southern China. Results revealed unexpectedly high concentrations of BSOA tracers (149.9 ± 70.5 ng m−3 at the summit and 109.7 ± 51.2 ng m−3 at the foot), surpassing those at most other background sites worldwide. Daytime BSOA tracer levels at the foot were consistent with nighttime levels, whereas the summit showed significantly higher concentrations at night. Nighttime correlations between O₃ and BSOA tracers at the summit suggest that high O₃ levels stimulate BSOA formation. Conversely, a negative correlation between O₃ and isoprene derived SOA (SOAI) tracers at the foot indicates that other oxidants may also influence SOAI formation. BSOA tracer concentrations rose significantly with the arrival of anthropogenic pollutants (e.g., SO₂ and NO₂), indicating that anthropogenic pollution amplifies BSOA formation by enhancing aerosol acidity (pH < 3). This amplification effect could be mitigated by the reduction of aerosol acidity due to increased NH₃ and relative humidity (RH). Our findings provide valuable insights into the interactions between anthropogenic and biogenic emissions on SOA formation and vertical distribution in forests surrounding megacities."

To date, a large uncertainty in the regional C dynamics still remains. Here we use a process‐based biogeochemical model by considering C exposure from thawed permafrost and observational data to quantify permafrost C emissions and ecosystem C budget in northern high latitudes in the 21st century. Permafrost degradation will make 119.3 Pg and 251.6 Pg C available for decomposition by 2100 under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP)126 and SSP585, respectively. However, only 4–8% of the newly thawed permafrost C is expected to be released into the atmosphere by 2100. Cumulatively, permafrost degradation will reduce ecosystem C stocks by 3.37 Pg and 15.37 Pg under the SSP126 and SSP585, respectively. Additionally, CO2 fertilization effects would stimulate plant productivity and increase ecosystem C stocks substantially. The combined effects of climate change, CO2 fertilization, and permafrost degradation on C fluxes are typically more profound than any single factor, emphasizing the intricate interplay between these elements in shaping permafrost C‐climate feedbacks. Our study suggests that the majority of the thawed C will remain sequestered in previously frozen layers in this century, posing a significant challenge to climate change mitigation efforts once any process accelerates the decomposition of this huge amount of thawed C."

 Despite recent advances in mammalian synthetic biology, there remains a lack of modular synthetic receptors that can robustly respond to soluble ligands and in turn activate bespoke cellular functions. Such receptors would have extensive clinical potential to regulate the activity of engineered therapeutic cells, but to date only receptors against cell surface targets have approached clinical translation1. To address this gap, we developed a receptor architecture called synthetic intramembrane proteolysis receptor (SNIPR), that has the added ability to be activated by soluble ligands, both natural and synthetic, with remarkably low baseline activity and high fold activation, through an endocytic, pH-dependent cleavage mechanism. We demonstrate the therapeutic capabilities of the receptor platform by localizing the activity of CAR T cells to solid tumors where soluble disease-associated factors are expressed, bypassing the major hurdle of on-target off-tumor toxicity in bystander organs. We further applied the SNIPR platform to engineer fully synthetic signaling networks between cells orthogonal to natural signaling pathways, expanding the scope of synthetic biology. Our design framework enables cellular communication and environmental interactions, extending the capabilities of synthetic cellular networking in clinical and research contexts."

Here, we investigate the RNA structurome alteration induced by DHX36 depletion. Our findings reveal that DHX36 binding induces structural remodeling not only at the localized binding sites but also on the entire mRNA transcript most pronounced in 3’UTR regions. DHX36 binding increases structural accessibility at 3’UTRs which is correlated with decreased post-transcriptional mRNA abundance. Further analyses and experiments uncover that DHX36 binding sites are enriched for N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification and YTHDF1 binding; and DHX36 induced structural changes may facilitate YTHDF1 binding to m6A sites leading to RNA degradation.

 Cognitive problem-solving benefits from cognitive maps aiding navigation and planning. Physical space navigation involves hippocampal (HC) allocentric codes, while abstract task space engages medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) task-specific codes. Previous studies show that challenging tasks, like spatial alternation, require integrating these two types of maps. The disruption of the HC-mPFC circuit impairs performance. We propose a hierarchical active inference model clarifying how this circuit solves spatial interaction tasks by bridging physical and task-space maps. Simulations demonstrate that the model’s dual layers develop effective cognitive maps for physical and task space. The model solves spatial alternation tasks through reciprocal interactions between the two layers. Disrupting its communication impairs decision-making, which is consistent with empirical evidence. Additionally, the model adapts to switching between multiple alternation rules, providing a mechanistic explanation of how the HC-mPFC circuit supports spatial alternation tasks and the effects of disruption.

Here, the authors report the development of a stimuli-responsive, self-regulating assembly of chiral and magnetically responsive nanorods, with control over the chirality of the system. 
 Most synthetic self-assemblies grow indefinitely into size-unlimited structures, whereas some biological self-assemblies autonomously regulate their size and shape. One mechanism of such self-regulation arises from the chirality of building blocks, inducing their mutual twisting that is incompatible with their long-range ordered packing and thus halts the assembly’s growth at a certain stage. This self-regulation occurs robustly in thermodynamic equilibrium rather than kinetic trapping, and therefore is attractive yet elusive. Until now, studies of self-regulating assemblies have focused on non-responsive systems, whose equilibrium point and corresponding size and shape are hardly changeable. Here, we demonstrate a stimuli-responsive, self-regulating assembly. This assembly consists of chiral and magnetically orientable nanorods, where the effective chirality can be changed by balancing chirality-induced twisting and magnet-induced flattening between nanorods. Consequently, the strength of self-regulation in the assembly is modulable by magnetic field intensity, allowing robust, tunable, and reversible control of its size and shape. Our strategy would provide more biomimetic materials with precision and responsiveness. The self-regulation of self-assembled systems is well understood for non-responsive systems, but responsive systems are less studied.

 The locomotive action involves diverse coordination, necessitating the integration of multiple motor neural circuits. However, the precise circuitry mechanism governing emotion-driven accelerated locomotion remains predominantly elusive. Here we dissect projections from the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) to subiculum (SUB) which promote alert-driven accelerated locomotion. We find that TMN histaminergic neurons respond to high-speed locomotion in both natural and alert acceleration. The TMN-SUB circuit is sufficient but not essential for amplifying accelerated locomotion from low to high-speed movement in basal condition, but it is both sufficient and necessary in alert condition for modulating accelerated locomotion during high-speed escape behavior. TMN histaminergic neuron activates SUB glutamatergic “fast locomotor cell” that projects to retrosplenial granular cortex (RSG) mainly through histamine H2 receptor (H2R).

Here the authors show that this increase in boreal fire aerosols results in a positive radiative forcing, leading to additional Arctic warming. 
 The Northern Hemisphere boreal region is undergoing rapid warming, leading to an upsurge in biomass burning. Previous studies have primarily focused on greenhouse gas emissions from these fires, whereas the associated biomass burning aerosols (BBAs) have received less attention. Here we use satellite-constrained modelling to assess the radiative effect of aerosols from boreal fires on the climate in the Arctic region. We find a substantial increase in boreal BBA emissions associated with warming over the past two decades, causing pronounced positive radiative effects during Arctic summer mostly due to increased solar absorption. At a global warming level of 1 °C above current temperatures, boreal BBA emissions are projected to increase 6-fold, further warming the Arctic and potentially negating the benefits of ambitious anthropogenic black carbon mitigation. Given the high sensitivity of boreal and Arctic fires to climate change, our results underscore the increasingly relevant role of BBAs in Arctic climate. Boreal fires are expected to increase with warming, but how the aerosols emitted in these fires affect the climate is not well understood.

Historically, extreme precipitation from tropical cyclones increased flood risk in about 14% and decreased in 7% of the basin. Future tropical cyclones may increase flood risk in about 7% and reduce in nearly 18% of the basin. Moreover, population exposure growth has historically increased flood risk in 3% of the basin and is projected to result in a 1% increase. These findings highlight the complex interactions of tropical cyclone hazards and socioeconomic factors influencing flood risk. The geographical distribution of flood risk in the Mekong Basin has changed as a result of shifts in extreme precipitation from tropical cyclones as well as population exposure and is projected to continue to evolve, according to simulations with a hydrological-hydrodynamic model and observations."

 Multi-millennial records of great megathrust earthquakes have highlighted differences in periodicity and recurrence behavior. Understanding tectonic processes responsible for these differences is relevant for fault mechanics and hazard models. Here, we present a paleoseismic record inferred from raised beach ridges in the 2010 Maule earthquake (Mw 8.8) segment in south-central Chile that includes 24 interseismic intervals over 4.5 kyr suggesting a weakly-periodic recurrence behavior. In turn, great earthquakes in the adjacent 1960 Valdivia earthquake (Mw 9.5) segment occurred with periodic recurrence over the same time span. Both segments have similar trench sediments thicknesses as well as rheological and geometrical boundary conditions, but Maule has a wider frontal accretionary wedge and several splay faults rooted in the seismogenic zone whereas Valdivia lacks splay faults and trench sediments are mostly subducted and underplated. These differences may have an impact on upper-plate compliance and megathrust friction, affecting earthquake size and recurrence periodicity.

 Separation of soil effects from top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectance is crucial for quantitative remote sensing of vegetation. Soil affects TOC reflectance via the soil-vegetation interaction and the direct reflection by soil. Various vegetation indices have been developed semi-empirically to mitigate the interferences caused by soil for specific applications, such estimating biomass and monitoring vegetation phenology. However, a practical approach to separate soil effects from the entire TOC spectral reflectance is still lacking. In this study, we investigate the radiative transfer process in a vegetation canopy with soil contamination and develop three methods to estimate the contribution of soil's direct reflection to TOC reflectance. Theoretical analysis reveals that the soil's direct reflection can be quantified and separated from TOC reflectance due to the distinct spectral characteristics of soil and vegetation. We identify three key features: a) Bands in the visible region where the reflectance of soil-uncontaminated green vegetation approaches zero due to strong pigment absorption. b) Two bands in the visible region where the vegetation reflectance is similar, but soil reflectance is distinguishable. c) Soil reflectance within the range of 400 nm to 1000 nm exhibits a near-linear dependence on wavelength. Using these features, we develop three methods to quantify the contribution of soil's direct reflection to TOC reflectance. For given soil reflectance, feature a) or b) alone allows estimating the fraction of soil that directly contributes to TOC reflectance, and thus the soil's direct reflection. Using all three features enables estimation of the soil's direct reflection without knowing soil reflectance.The proposed methods, along with certain assumptions made during their development, are tested and evaluated using field and synthetic datasets of soil, leaf, and canopy. The evaluation of the three methods demonstrates that the estimation of the soil's direct reflection can be achieved through: i) Using TOC reflectance at approximately 675 nm and soil spectral reflectance, termed the red-band-based method (Method-RBB). ii) Using TOC reflectance at approximately 675 nm and 438 nm, along with soil spectral reflectance, termed as the two-band-based method (Method-TBB). iii) Using TOC reflectance at approximately 675 nm and 438 nm, assuming linear dependence of soil reflectance on wavelength in the visible and near-infrared region, termed as the linear-assumption-based method (Method-LAB). Our evaluation indicates that the linearity from 400 nm to 1000 nm holds true for a wide range of soil types. The conditions outlined in features a) and b) are valid for green vegetation with moderate to high leaf chlorophyll content: when leaf chlorophyll content exceeds 20 μg cm−2, the leaf albedo at 675 nm is generally below 0.15, and the difference in leaf albedo at 675 nm and 438 nm is sufficiently small. The results reveal that when leaf albedo at 675 nm is less than 0.15 and NDVI is less than 0.8, all three methods perform satisfactorily, exhibiting an R2 value of approximately 0.9 between the true and estimated contribution of soil's direct reflection. The R2 values are 0.92 for both Method-RBB and Method-LAB, while Method-TBB has an R2 of 0.95. The performance of Method-RBB is particularly sensitive to leaf albedo at the red band, which correlates with leaf chlorophyll content. Canopies exhibiting higher red-band leaf albedo usually indicate lower chlorophyll content and less resemblance to typical green vegetation. The accuracy of Method-TBB diminishes as the differences in leaf albedo between the selected two bands increase. Similarly, deviations from the linear dependence of soil reflectance on wavelength negatively impact the accuracy of Method-LAB. Overall, these proposed methods work reasonably well for sparse canopies and healthy vegetation. Method-TBB exhibits the highest level of accuracy, followed by Method-RBB, while Method-LAB is more convenient to use as it does not require prior knowledge of soil reflectance. The proposed methods offer practical ways to estimate the contribution of soil's direct reflection to TOC reflectance. Utilizing TOC reflectance after the soil adjustment facilitates more direct monitoring of canopy structural characteristics, and biochemical and physiological information of leaves."

Crow;Andrew F. Feldman,Vegetation signal crosstalk present in official SMAP surface soil moisture retrievals,"•Remote sensing can clarify the relationship between soil moisture and vegetation. •This requires that algorithms separate soil moisture and vegetation signals. •Existing algorithms have crosstalk between retrieved soil moisture and vegetation. •This crosstalk skews our global view of soil moisture/vegetation coupling. 
 Successful surface soil moisture (SM) retrieval from space has been enabled by microwave satellite measurements of Earth's upwelling brightness temperature (TB). Nevertheless, correction for the impact of vegetation on TB emission remains a challenge for SM retrieval algorithms. Such correction is often performed in a simplified manner. For example, the Single Channel Algorithm (SCA) uses ancillary climatological normalized vegetation difference index values as a proxy for vegetation optical depth (τ) - resulting in SM retrievals that do not account for interannual τ variability. Official NASA Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) mission SM products are all based, to varying degrees, on the SCA. Here, we utilize an instrumental variable analysis and alternative SMAP SM retrievals derived from the Multi-Temporal Dual Channel Algorithm (MTDCA) – that better account for time variations in τ – as a benchmark for examining SMAP Level 3 SM retrievals for the presence of signal crosstalk associated with the neglect of interannual τ variability. Results suggest that failing to account for such variability introduces a spurious vegetation-based signal into monthly climatological SMAP SM anomalies. The SMAP Dual Channel Algorithm (DCA), which serves as the current SMAP baseline algorithm, reduces - but does not eliminate – this crosstalk. Results therefore suggest the need for caution when applying SMAP SM retrievals to science applications aimed at understanding SM coupling with the terrestrial biosphere.Plain language summarySatellite observations of natural microwave emission from Earth's land surface can be converted into estimates of both surface soil moisture and vegetation water content. Such estimates have a variety of applications. However, the separation of the vegetation signal from the soil moisture signal is challenging and often performed using only approximate methods. This paper uses a novel approach to evaluate how accurately state-of-the-art soil moisture retrieval algorithms perform such partitioning. Results suggests that spurious vegetation signals remain in existing soil moisture products - with some approaches removing it more than others. Such “crosstalk” between soil- and vegetation-based signals limits the value of existing satellite soil moisture products for agricultural and ecohydrological applications and motivates the development of improved retrieval algorithms."

 Road development has affected many remote tropical forests around the world and has accelerated human-induced deforestation, forest degradation and biodiversity loss. The development of roads in tropical forests is largely driven by industrial selective logging, which can provide a sustainable source of revenue for developing countries while avoiding more detrimental forms of forest degradation or deforestation. Understanding the dynamics and impacts of road development is challenging, because road inventories in remote tropical forests have been largely incomplete or outdated. In this study, we present novel remote sensing-based methods for automated monitoring of road development and apply them across the Congo Basin forest region, an area characterized by increasing road development rates driven by logging activities. We trained a deep learning model with Sentinel-1 and -2 satellite imagery to map road development on a monthly basis at 10 m spatial scale, leveraging the complementary value of radar and optical imagery. Applying the model across the Congo Basin forest, we present a vectorized map of road development from January 2019 until December 2022, demonstrating an F1-score of 0.909, a false detection rate of 4.2% and a missed detection rate of 14.9%. In total, we mapped 35,944 km of road development in the Congo Basin forest during the four years, with at least 78% apparently related to logging activities, mainly located in the western part of the region. We estimate that 30% of the detected road openings were previously abandoned logging roads that were reopened. In addition, 23% of detected road development was located in areas considered to be intact forest landscapes. The road monitoring methods demonstrated in this study can facilitate several crucial forest management and conservation objectives in the tropics, such as assessing ecological and climate impacts related to selective logging, monitoring illegal or unsustainable activities, and providing a basis for improved understanding and evaluation of human impacts on forests at large scale.

 Imaging spectroscopy has been a recognized and established remote sensing technology since the 1980s, mainly using airborne and field-based platforms to identify and quantify key bio- and geo-chemical surface and atmospheric compounds, based on characteristic spectral reflectance features in the visible-near infrared (VNIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR). Spaceborne missions, a leap in technology, were sparse, starting with the CHRIS/PROBA and EO1/Hyperion missions in the early 2000s, and providing spectroscopy data with limited spectral coverage and/or low data quality in the SWIR. Since 2019, several countries and agencies have successfully launched a number of spaceborne imaging spectroscopy systems into orbit or deployed them on the International Space Station (ISS) such as DESIS, PRISMA, HISUI, GF-5, EnMAP and EMIT. Among these recent missions, the German Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) stands for its long-term development, sophisticated design with on-board calibration, high data quality requirements, and extensive accompanying science program. EnMAP was launched in April 2022 and, following a successful commissioning phase, started its operational activities in November 2022. The EnMAP mission encompasses global coverage from 80° N to 80° S through on-demand data acquisitions. Data are free and open access with 30 m spatial resolution, a high spectral resolution with a spectral sampling distance of 6.5 nm and 10 nm in the VNIR and SWIR regions respectively, and a high signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we aim to present the mission's current status, coverage, science capabilities and performance two years after launch. We show the potential of EnMAP for space-based imaging spectroscopy to operate in various environments, including high and low light levels, dense forests, Antarctic glaciers, and arid agricultural areas. EnMAP enables various applications in fields such as agriculture and forestry, soil compositional, raw materials, and methane mapping, as well as water quality assessment, and snow and ice properties. The results show that EnMAP's performance exceeds the mission requirements, and highlights the significant potential for contribution to scientific exploitation in various geo- and biochemical sciences. EnMAP is also expected to serve as a key tool for the development and testing of data processing algorithms for upcoming global operational missions."

 Traditional methods for measuring asset wealth face limitations due to data scarcity, making it challenging to apply them on a large scale and over long periods with fine granularity. Publicly available satellite images, such as nighttime light imagery, have become an important alternative data source for estimating asset wealth. This study thoroughly exploited the spatial neighborhood information of nighttime light, combined with other remote sensing features and the cross-national, temporally comparable International Wealth Index (IWI), to construct long-term asset wealth estimation models for African countries with and without sample data. Based on these models, it generates asset wealth estimates for African settlements at a 500 m spatial resolution from 2012 to 2022.

 Supervised classification methods can distinguish between noise and signal in ice, cloud, and land elevation satellite-2 (ICESat-2) data across various feature perspectives and autonomously optimize parameters. Nevertheless, model generalization remains a significant limitation for practical applications. This study focuses on developing a universal denoising model for ICESat-2 using machine learning algorithms and analyzing its spatial transferability under various forest and terrain conditions. A photon-denoising feature parameter system is developed based on the analysis of the three-dimensional distribution of photons in forested regions. This system reduces the parameters dependent on absolute physical quantities and increases those that are less influenced by terrain and forest features to enhance the model’s transferability. Subsequently, automated machine learning algorithms (AutoML) are used for model selection and parameter optimization across six non-parametric regression models. We evaluate the accuracies of the local, global, and transfer models in estimating canopy height across four representative forested areas in China. Results show that the algorithm can effectively distinguish between signal and noise photons. The estimated canopy heights from signal photons are highly consistent with heights obtained using airborne laser scanning (ALS), exhibiting a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.89, root mean square errors (RMSE) of 3.75 m, relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of 0.27, relative bias (rBias) of −0.11 and mean Bias of −1.45 m. Notably, the accuracy of canopy height estimation by the global model has increased by an average of 21 % compared to ICESat-2 land-vegetation along-track products (ATL08). Furthermore, the model exhibits significant spatial transfer capabilities, with the accuracies of the transfer model exceeding those of ATL08 by margins ranging from 4 % to 41 %.

This study provides a detailed analysis of the trends in air pollutants, such as total nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHC), linked to oil and gas production changes in the Barnett shale region from 2000 to 2022.

DEN recorded the highest NMHC concentrations at an average of 210.27 ppb-C, significantly exceeding those at FWNW (83.14 ppb-C) and DAL (62.50 ppb-C).

 Characterizing the interaction between meteorological variables such as humidity, wind speed, cloud cover, and precipitation with the atmospheric electric field is vital for improving the nowcast of extreme weather events such as heavy precipitation. With this aim, we provide minute-scale electric field observations in southern Israel. These were taken during low-pressure weather systems in winter, often termed ‘Cyprus Lows.’ We focus only on precipitating (‘wet’) events, where rain was measured at the surface during and after the cold front's passage. The mean |PG| values for ‘wet’ Cyprus Lows are higher (Hundreds to thousands V m−1) compared with the mean fair-weather values (∼100–200 V m−1, and exhibit a sharp and rapid increase of the |PG| of up to tens of V m−1 min−1 during the arrival of the cold front and hundreds of V m−1 min−1 during precipitation. Then, we analyzed selected case studies in detail. The response of the |PG| to thunderstorm clouds, i.e., Cumulonimbus, is an increase to values of thousands of V m−1. The temporal evolution of the |PG| allowed us to identify the type of cloud and its life cycle stage. We suggest that using state-of-the-art 1 Hz measurements of the |PG| and deducing cloud patterns at strategic locations, such as in arid regions like southern Israel, may improve the nowcasting capabilities of localized heavy precipitation events."

 This study explores the impact of assimilating diverse observational data on forecasting extreme rainfall events (EREs) using a three dimensional variational (3D-Var) assimilation approach. It focuses on 38 EREs across three meteorological divisions in Karnataka, India, using a high-resolution (03-km) Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with three nested domains. Five distinct experiments were conducted, including a Control experiment without assimilation, and subsequent experiments integrating observations from various sources like atmospheric profiles from Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) and Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellites and radiosondes, ocean surface wind observations from Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSMI), and WindSAT satellites and buoys, ground observations from Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC), as well as a combined assimilation experiment with all available observations. The accuracy of rainfall forecasts is evaluated by comparing model outputs with high-resolution telemetric rain-gauge (TRG; 6480 stations) data and other meteorological parameters against telemetric weather station (TWS; 860 stations) data from KSNDMC. Assimilation experiments show positive improvements over control experiment in predicting rainfall. Results consistently indicate underprediction of rainfall in the intricate topographical region of the Western Ghats (WG) across all experiments, contrasting with overprediction along the coastal areas of Karnataka. The experiment involving Ocean Winds showcased a substantial 40 % reduction in rainfall overprediction (above 2 mm threshold). Both Ocean Winds and Station Data assimilation notably enhanced rainfall prediction accuracy over most of the regions in Karnataka, with Ocean Winds exhibiting the highest improvement (53 %), closely followed by Station Data (50 %). Importantly, assimilating Ocean Winds and Station Data aided in reducing overprediction, while assimilating Satellite Profiles reduced underprediction in the interior part of Karnataka but increased overprediction over the coastal region compared to the control experiment. Frequency of occurrence of rainfall is considerably enhanced along the coastline in all 3D-Var experiments. Bias score indicates maximum improvement in assimilation using Ocean Winds and Station Data. Simulation of basic meteorological parameters also improved with assimilation particularly during the day hours. The results underscore the crucial role of assimilation of satellite and in-situ observations in improving forecast accuracy of EREs during the monsoon season."

 The urban effects on the planetary boundary layer (PBL) wind structures of landfalling tropical cyclones (TCs) have rarely been explored. In this study, numerical simulations for Typhoon Lekima (2019), with and without multilayer building effect parameterization (BEP) and urban land cover, were executed to investigate the urban effects on TC PBL wind structures. Validations against observations demonstrate that the simulation incorporating BEP and urban surface replicates the track, intensity and 10-m wind field of Lekima better. Based on the comparison between the simulations with and without urban land cover, urban effects were analyzed, and the possible mechanisms were examined from the perspective of turbulent transport. Results show that urban surfaces have a deceleration effect on TC wind fields overall. This deceleration effect is most pronounced near the surface and decreases with height under 1 km above ground level. Urban surfaces reduce tangential winds and radial inflow in the near-surface layer, leading to a slight decrease in TC intensity. This is primarily attributed to the enhanced downward transfer of tangential momentum and upward transfer of radial momentum within the PBL, which results in larger magnitudes of negative tangential wind tendencies and positive radial wind tendencies induced by the divergence of subgrid-scale (SGS) momentum fluxes. Additionally, stronger tangential winds and radial outflow above the elevated PBL height correspond well to the increased tangential and radial wind tendencies in nearby areas. The analysis illustrates that turbulent transport provides insights into how urban surfaces affect the PBL wind structures of TCs."

Here, we describe a switch from glutamine catabolism to synthesis required for erythroid cell maturation. Glutamine synthetase (GS), one of the oldest functioning genes in evolution, is activated during erythroid maturation to detoxify ammonium generated from heme biosynthesis, which is up-regulated to support hemoglobin production. Loss of GS in mouse erythroid precursors caused ammonium accumulation and oxidative stress, impairing erythroid maturation and recovery from anemia. In β-thalassemia, GS activity is inhibited by protein oxidation, leading to glutamate and ammonium accumulation, whereas enhancing GS activity alleviates the metabolic and pathological defects.

Impaired splicing has been associated with diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and cellular responses remain poorly understood. In this work, we report that deficiency of ubiquitin-specific protease 39 (USP39) in human cell lines, zebrafish larvae, and mice led to impaired spliceosome assembly and a cytotoxic splicing profile characterized by the use of cryptic 5′ splice sites. Disruptive cryptic variants evaded messenger RNA (mRNA) surveillance pathways and were translated into misfolded proteins, which caused proteotoxic aggregates, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and, ultimately, cell death. The detrimental consequence of splicing-induced proteotoxicity could be mitigated by up-regulating the ubiquitin-proteasome system and selective autophagy.

Bradley,Predictions of groundwater PFAS occurrence at drinking water supply depths in the United States,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), known colloquially as “forever chemicals,” have been associated with adverse human health effects and have contaminated drinking water supplies across the United States owing to their long-term and widespread use. People in the United States may unknowingly be drinking water that contains PFAS because of a lack of systematic analysis, particularly in domestic water supplies. We present an extreme gradient–boosting model for predicting the occurrence of PFAS in groundwater at the depths of drinking water supply for the conterminous United States. Our model results indicate that 71 million to 95 million people in the conterminous United States potentially rely on groundwater with detectable concentrations of PFAS for their drinking water supplies before any treatment."

This limitation has been overcome in electromagnetic resonators by coupling them to other strongly nonlinear quantum systems such as atoms and superconducting qubits. We demonstrate the realization of the single-phonon nonlinear regime in a solid-state mechanical system. The single-phonon anharmonicity in our system exceeds the decoherence rate by a factor of 6.8, allowing us to use it as a mechanical qubit and demonstrate initialization, readout, and single-qubit gates. Our approach provides a powerful quantum acoustics platform for quantum simulations, sensing, and information processing."

This technology holds promise for numerous exciting applications. However, previous demonstrations of subambient daytime radiative cooling require surfaces that directly face the sky, and these cannot be applied to vertical surfaces that are ubiquitous in real-world scenarios such as buildings and vehicles. Here, we demonstrate subambient daytime radiative cooling of vertical surfaces under peak sunlight using a hierarchically designed, angularly asymmetric, spectrally selective thermal emitter. Under peak sunlight of about 920 watts per square meter, our emitter reaches a temperature that is about 2.5°C below ambient temperature, corresponding to a temperature reduction of about 4.3° and 8.9°C compared with a silica-polymer hybrid radiative cooler and commercial white paint, respectively."

McGuire,Detection of interstellar 1-cyanopyrene: A four-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are organic molecules containing adjacent aromatic rings. Infrared emission bands show that PAHs are abundant in space, but only a few specific PAHs have been detected in the interstellar medium. We detected 1-cyanopyrene, a cyano-substituted derivative of the related four-ring PAH pyrene, in radio observations of the dense cloud TMC-1, using the Green Bank Telescope. The measured column density of 1-cyanopyrene is∼1.52×1012cm−2, from which we estimate that pyrene contains up to 0.1% of the carbon in TMC-1. This abundance indicates that interstellar PAH chemistry favors the production of pyrene. We suggest that some of the carbon supplied to young planetary systems is carried by PAHs that originate in cold molecular clouds."

However, the precise mechanism(s) of action for many microbiota species and molecules have not been fully elucidated, limiting the development of microbiota-based diagnostics and therapeutics. In this Review, we highlight innovative chemical and genetic approaches that are enabling the dissection of microbiota mechanisms and providing causation in health and disease. Although specific microbiota molecules and mechanisms have begun to emerge, new approaches are still needed to go beyond phenotypic associations and translate microbiota discoveries into actionable targets and therapeutic leads to prevent and treat diseases."
