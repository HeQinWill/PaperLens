Zhang;Hanqing Guo;Zhien Wang,Thermodynamics-guided machine learning model for predicting convective boundary layer height and its multi-site applicability,"We developed a new machine learning approach to estimate the height of the mixing layer in the lower atmosphere, which is important for predicting weather and air quality. By using daily temperature and heat patterns, the model learns how the atmosphere changes throughout the day. It gives accurate results across different locations and seasons, helping improve future climate and weather forecasts through better understanding of surface–atmosphere interactions. 
 Accurate estimation of convective boundary layer height (CBLH) is vital for weather, climate, and air quality modeling. Machine learning (ML) shows promise in CBLH prediction, but input parameter selection often lacks physical grounding, limiting generalizability. This study introduces a novel ML framework for CBLH prediction, integrating thermodynamic constraints and the diurnal CBLH cycle as an implicit physical guide. Boundary layer growth is modeled as driven by surface heat fluxes and atmospheric heat absorption represented with the low tropospheric stability, using the diurnal cycle as input and output. TPOT and AutoKeras are employed to select optimal models, validated against Doppler lidar-derived CBLH data, achieving an R2 of 0.84 across untrained years. Comparisons of eddy covariance (ECOR) and energy balance Bowen ratio (EBBR) flux measurements show the same prediction capability. Models trained on the ARM SGP C1 site with ECOR data and tested at E37 and E39 yield R2 values of 0.79 and 0.81, respectively, demonstrating their adaptability. The ML model trained with all sites' data slightly enhances the performance compared with ML models trained over single-site data. The interquartile range for predicted CBLH is consistently narrower than that for DL-derived CBLH, reflecting lower variability in predicted CBLH compared to DL-derived CBLH, which is influenced by additional factors, which are not well represented with the model inputs. The model's generalizability across multiple sites at the ARM SGP site demonstrates its potential for transfer to greater distances, offering a scalable approach for enhancing boundary layer parameterization in atmospheric models."

Using multiple instruments and models, aerosol particles were linked to wildfires, volcanic eruptions, and anthropogenic pollution. The aerosol consisted of spherical, fine-mode, weakly absorbing particles, which significantly reduced direct solar radiation. This combined approach improves understanding of Arctic aerosol events and climate processes. 
 In the summer of 2019, the Arctic region registered exceptionally high aerosol optical depth (AOD) values over Svalbard, linked to intense biomass burning (BB) and volcanic activity across the Northern Hemisphere. This study presents a comprehensive, multi-instrumental analysis of the aerosol conditions in and around Ny-Ålesund (Spitsbergen, Norway), combining data from ground-based sun-photometry, in-situ observations, active remote sensing (ground-based and on satellite), and atmospheric dispersion modelling (FLEXPART). Despite high AOD was observed during all the period, three different aerosol events are identified in the atmospheric column (6–10 July, 25–28 July, and 6–17 August). In contrast, in-situ surface stations only recorded significant aerosol load during 5–9 July, 30 August, and 12 September, suggesting that most of the aerosol particles remained above the boundary layer. Lidar and photometric observations revealed the presence of spherical, weakly absorbing Accumulation-mode particles (with effective radii between 0.1 and 0.2 µm) in both the troposphere and stratosphere, with persistent layers extending above 10 km. Simulations carried out with FLEXPART correlate well with the measurements, attributing the observed aerosol events to multiple sources, including Siberian and North American wildfires, the Raikoke (Russia) volcanic eruption, and anthropogenic pollution. While the simulations show a contribution from volcanic aerosols, the contribution from biomass-burning aerosols in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere were likely more significant under the atmospheric conditions of summer 2019. Overall, the aerosol radiative impact during this long-lasting event was substantial, with a mean reduction in direct solar radiation of approximately −74 W m−2 during July and August. This work shows how the use of dispersion modelling together with multiple observation sources allows to achieve a more complete description of the atmospheric aerosol events and contributes to a better understanding of the overall picture."

Miller;Robert Spirig;Zhaolong Wu;Yunpei Chu;Xia Li;Ulrike Lohmann;Jan Henneberger,Inferring the controlling factors of ice aggregation from targeted cloud seeding experiments,"Ice crystals in clouds aggregate, shaping snow and rain, yet rates are hard to measure. Using cloud seeding, we sampled crystals downwind after known times. A deep-learning algorithm quantified aggregation by counting crystal components. Initial ice concentration was the main driver, confirmed by causal analysis, physics, and machine learning, though weaker than theory predicts. Temperature, size, and shape also mattered, while turbulence was negligible. 
 Ice aggregation in clouds plays a crucial role in cloud development and precipitation formation. Despite the significance of ice aggregation, direct in situ quantification of aggregation rates in natural clouds has been challenging due to the difficulty of tracking ice crystals. Here, we present in situ measurements of ice aggregation rates in persistent supercooled stratiform clouds. Using novel glaciogenic seeding experiments (CLOUDLAB), ice crystals are nucleated upwind and subsequently measured downwind after a known advection time in cloud, allowing us to estimate their age. A deep-learning-based detection algorithm (IceDetectNet) counts the individual monomers of aggregates to derive the initial ice crystal number concentration (ICNCt0). We considered several factors that may influence ice aggregation, including ICNCt0, temperature, ice crystal size, aspect ratio, and turbulence. Among these, ICNCt0 was found to be the dominant factor controlling aggregation rates by three independent approaches: causal inference, a physical equation, and machine learning models. We report, however, a subquadratic dependence of the aggregation rate on ICNCt0 (mean exponent ∼ 0.92; 95 % CI: 0.88–0.97), in contrast to theoretical expectations (quadratic dependence). One possible explanation is that aggregation may also involve smaller ice crystals, but this remains hypothetical. To predict aggregation rates, we evaluated 11 machine learning models and a physically based formulation. CatBoost achieved the best statistical performance, while the physical model proved more robust in sensitivity tests. These findings provide new insights into the microphysical and environmental controls of ice aggregation and establish a robust methodological foundation for studying aggregation processes in natural clouds."

This study examines interannual and decadal changes in springtime dust emissions and quantifies the role of environmental factors and extratropical cyclones. Using multi-source datasets, a dust emission model, and cyclone tracking algorithms, we find that strong winds, particularly those linked to cyclones, are key drivers of these changes. 
 Dust activities across East Asia and North America have shown decadal variations, mediating radiation budget, air quality, and human health, especially during their peak months of April and May. Using satellite and ground measurements, as along with simulations from a dust emission model, we demonstrate an increase of 12.7 % and 23.4 % in April dust emissions across East Asia and North America, respectively, during the past four decades, in contrast to a 16.5 % and 2.5 % decrease during the last two decades. Meanwhile, both regions show a steady increase in May dust emissions by 5.7 % and 16.3 %, respectively, since the 1980s. Sensitivity experiments attribute both regions' decadal variations in dust emission primarily to surface wind speed changes; whereas vegetation exerts minimum influence on the regional dust emission variations. Furthermore, these decadal variations in dust initiating wind could largely be attributed to regime shifts in extratropical cyclone (EC), including their duration and intensity. Specifically, ECs are responsible for 60 %–70 % of the April–May total dust emissions in East Asia and 30 %–40 % of that in North America; meanwhile, ECs explain a larger portion of the decadal variations in April dust emission from East Asia (up to ∼80 %), compared with May and from North America. These results highlight the changing frequency and duration of strong winds, especially those associated with EC, and their role in shaping the decadal variations of mid-latitude dust emissions."

It can distinguish coarse dust, fine dust, and non-dust aerosols. Tests with real data from regions affected by desert dust show the method works well. This helps improve understanding of how particles are distributed in the atmosphere, which is important for air quality and climate studies. 
 Lidar-based algorithms for aerosol-type separation have the potential to improve air-quality assessments, estimates of aerosol direct and indirect radiative forcing, and the detailed characterization of their vertical distribution. In this study, we present an easy-to-apply algorithm that employs lidar-derived particle linear depolarization ratios measured at two wavelengths to separate up to three aerosol-type-specific particle backscatter fractions. These fractions are estimated under the assumptions that the depolarization ratios of each aerosol type in the mixture differ, and that both the depolarization ratios and the backscatter-related Ångström exponents at two wavelengths for each aerosol type are known. The mathematical relationship between particle linear depolarization ratios at two wavelengths for an aerosol mixture has been derived and expressed as a system of equations. These equations define the region of the observational space that can be meaningfully populated, with boundaries determined by the depolarization ratios and backscatter-related Ångström exponents of the pure aerosol types. Data collected in the Arabian Peninsula confirmed the predicted region of the observational space. The proposed algorithm is applied to synthetic dust mixtures as well as to atmospheric lidar observations of Arabian dust, Asian dust, Saharan dust and their mixtures, with the goal of decomposing coarse-mode dust, fine-mode dust, and low-depolarizing non-dust aerosols. We also discuss the impact of uncertainties in the prior optical properties of the pure aerosol types, along with the effects of observational uncertainties and biases. Overall, the method enhances the potential of dual-wavelength depolarization measurements for improving our understanding of the vertical distribution of coarse and fine dust."

Donovan;Gerd-Jan van Zadelhoff;Angela Benedetti;Holger Baars;Athena Augusta Floutsi;Nikos Benas;Martin Stengel;Christian Retscher;Edward Malina;Vassilis Amiridis,Derivation and validation of a refined dust product from Aeolus (L2A+),"The Aeolus satellite's lidar system had limitations in detecting certain atmospheric layers and distinguishing between aerosol and cloud types. To improve accuracy, a new dust detection product was developed. By combining data from various sources and validating it with ground-based measurements, this enhanced product performs better than the original. It helps improve dust transport models and weather predictions, making it a valuable tool for atmospheric monitoring and forecasting. 
 Originally designed as a wind lidar without depolarization measurement capability, ALADIN (Atmospheric Laser Doppler Instrument) detects only the co-polar component of the backscattered signal, limiting the accuracy of optical products in the presence of depolarizing atmospheric layers. The absence of the cross-polar component also prohibits ALADIN's ability to distinguish between different aerosol and cloud types, in its retrievals. To address these limitations, an enhanced Aeolus aerosol product (L2A+), with a focus on dust, has been developed in the present study to support aerosol data assimilation in dust transport models and improve Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP). The L2A+ product is generated through a series of processing steps that integrate multi-sensor satellite retrievals for cloud screening and aerosol layer characterization, CAMS reanalysis outputs to classify aerosol types, distinguish dust from non-dust fractions, and provide the missing depolarization ratio values required for the Polarization Lidar Photometer Networking (POLIPHON) technique, along with ground-based lidar measurements used for performance assessment. Both the primary (L2A) and enhanced (L2A+) Aeolus pure-dust backscatter coefficient profiles at 355 nm are retrieved using four different algorithms: the Standard Correct Algorithm (SCA), the Standard Correct Algorithm with middle-bin vertical scaling (SCA-MB), the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), and AEL-PRO. These products are validated against ground-based reference observations obtained from the eVe and PollyXT lidar systems, operated as part of the ASKOS/JATAC experimental campaign in Mindelo, Cabo Verde. The approach is detailed on the basis of an indicative Aeolus overpass in the proximity of Mindelo on 3 September 2021, discussing ALADIN's sources of underestimation in terms of L2A backscatter coefficient at 355 nm profiles in the presence of desert dust particles across all four retrieval algorithms and the induced improvements achieved by accounting for the missing cross-polar component. A statistical evaluation of all Aeolus overpasses during the entire ASKOS/JATAC campaign in the Cabo Verde/Mindelo region confirms the enhanced performance of the upgraded L2A+ product compared to the original L2A product. This improvement is evident in both Aeolus-eVe and Aeolus-PollyXT comparisons across all retrieval algorithms and is marked by higher correlation coefficients and regression slopes along with lower biases and RMSE scores. Specifically, among the algorithms, the AEL-PRO and MLE L2A+ products show significant improvements in alignment with eVe lidar observations. The correlation coefficients increased from 0.59 to 0.67 for MLE and from 0.55 to 0.67 for AEL-PRO, while biases decreased from −0.99 to −0.85 Mm-1sr-1 for MLE and from −0.79 to −0.58 Mm-1sr-1 for AEL-PRO. They also achieve lower RMSE values (1.17 Mm-1sr-1 for MLE and 0.94 Mm-1sr-1 for AEL-PRO) and better regression slopes, increasing from 0.28 to 0.34 (MLE) and 0.27 to 0.39 (AEL-PRO). Similarly, L2A+ adjustments reduce biases and improve correlation coefficients, and regression slopes in Aeolus-PollyXT comparisons, among all four retrieval algorithms. Particularly, the AEL-PRO algorithm shows the strongest improvement in correlation, slope, and error metrics. All these advancements establish the enhanced L2A+ dust product as a strong candidate for aerosol data assimilation, supporting improved dust transport modeling and further enhancing Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP)."

However, its accuracy required to be further improved from middle stratosphere above. We developed a quality control scheme and evaluate the Fengyun bending angles’ quality. The new quality control scheme are useful in rejecting outliers and products’ quality have been well understood. The results are promising in improving the performance of Fengyun data in NWP and climate applications. 
 This study systematically evaluated the quality of ionosphere-corrected bending angles from Fengyun3 (FY3) D/E satellites (equipped with GPS and BDS receivers) using ERA5 data as references and MetOp products as comparisons. The quality of subsequent retrieved optimized bending angles, refractivity, and temperature were also analysed.  Ionosphere-corrected bending angle were assessed via two approaches: outlier detection across 10–80 km and bias/noise quantification. Overall quality evaluation showed that FY3 ionosphere-corrected bending angles were consistent with MetOp below 40 km. Above 40 km, FY3 bending angles exhibited larger errors than MetOp. In outlier detection, MetOp had less than 5 % bad profiles, followed by FY3D (<10 %), while FY3E (GPS/BDS) had about 20 % bad profiles. FY3E-GPS bending angles are prone to have large outliers in the height range of 35–50 km. For bias and noise quantification, the daily mean biases and noise levels of FY3 satellites were higher than those of MetOp. Specifically, FY3E-GPS showed notable large daily mean biases of about −0.4 µrad and most of these biases are in setting RO events. FY3D and FY3E-BDS ranked second, with biases of approximately −0.1 µrad. MetOp had the smallest biases, at around −0.05 µrad.  Regarding noises, FY3D, FY3E-GPS exhibited comparable noise levels, at roughly 2.5 µrad; FY3E-BDS had lower noises of 1.5 µrad. MetOp noises are smallest at about 1.0 µrad. Due to the larger biases and noises at high altitudes, FY3's optimized bending angles were strongly corrected by background bending angles. Refractivity and temperature were also influenced by the strong correction of optimized bending angle. In summary, FY3 ionosphere-bending angles show high quality below 40 km.  However, at high altitudes, further efforts are required for improving FY3 data's utility in numerical weather prediction and climate studies, especially for stratospheric applications."

These improvements provide clearer insights into how stream water quality changes over time and how human activities affect aquatic ecosystems. 
 The QUADICA version 2 dataset significantly expands upon the first version of QUADICA (water QUAlity, DIscharge and Catchment Attributes for large-sample studies in Germany), by incorporating more recent data, additional water quality and driver variables, and more stations with concurrent water quantity data. Specifically, QUADICA v2 extends the water quality time series of the first version up to 2020 and introduces new variables, including water temperature, oxygen, and chlorophyll a concentrations, as well as concentrations of ammonium, sulfate, and geogenic solutes like calcium. These additions enable a more comprehensive understanding of ecological impacts, including eutrophication effects, and water quality dynamics across catchments. Furthermore, the number of stations with both water quality and quantity data has effectively doubled – now covering 637 out of the total 1386 stations – by integrating QUADICA with the CAMELS-DE and Caravan-DE datasets. The inclusion of time series on point and diffuse sources of both nitrogen and phosphorus allows for more thorough investigations of driver-response relationships and nutrient export from catchments. To facilitate visualization and exploration of QUADICA, we provide a user-friendly, interactive R application alongside the online data repository, as well as a browser-based web app for inspecting the dataset. This makes QUADICA v2 a comprehensive dataset that spans from driver to impact variables, offering a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners.

Unbiased estimates of both realised warming and anthropogenic warming are possible that approximate a 20-year retrospective mean. Our resulting estimates of 1.40 [1.23–1.58] °C (realised) and 1.34 [1.18–1.50] °C (anthropogenic) as at end of 2024 highlight the urgency of immediate, far-reaching and sustained climate mitigation actions if we are to meet the long term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. 
 Parties to the 2015 Paris Agreement agreed to limit the long-term increase in global average temperature to well below 2 °C and pursue efforts to keep temperatures below 1.5 °C relative to pre-industrial levels. As the world is fast approaching the 1.5 °C warming level on a sustained basis, and with 2024 likely the first year that was over 1.5 °C warmer than 1850-1900, there is ever increasing interest in how we will know whether and when 1.5 °C warming since pre-industrial has been reached or exceeded with respect to a long-term average. This paper represents a comprehensive community methodological overview, building on the IPCC 6th assessment. It explains why there is no straightforward answer and proposes clear and reasoned ways forward. Existing challenges are as follows. Firstly, the Paris Agreement text contains definitional ambiguities around 'pre-industrial', 'global average temperature', whether the assessment should be on realised or long-term human-induced warming, and over what time frame the long-term temperature goal applies. Then, there are intrinsic limitations of observational records which get more uncertain further back in time due to data sparsity and measurement heterogeneity. Finally, in a non-stationary climate, multidecadal mean indicators of global temperature change will either lag behind the change or must rely on expected future temperature changes (based on extrapolation, initialized predictions, or scenario-based and constrained projections). Our analysis shows that knowing 'whether we are there yet' is a multifaceted and inherently probabilistic problem that includes information on the definition of a specific level of global warming, temperature changes over multiple timescales, and also potentially includes unpacking the attribution of human-caused changes from observed variations. Given the policy relevance of understanding where the world stands relative to 1.5 °C, or any other level of global warming since pre-industrial, there are a number of practical steps which could be taken to increase specificity in answering this critical question in a timely manner, and inform future monitoring and assessment activities. This paper reviews a broad range of approaches, identifies the most pragmatic, robust and transparent, and clarifies requirements for use in real time including how to handle and represent remaining uncertainties. We show that it is possible by combining lines of evidence and several methodologies to estimate the present long-term warming level without delay in a manner that is robust both in retrospective validation of crossing past warming levels and, critically, to divergent warming futures including potential wildcard impacts of large volcanoes which can mask underlying warming for several years. Results are benchmarked against historical exceedances of 0.5 °C and 1 °C warming. Long-term warming as assessed using the approaches developed herein and data up to and including 2024 stands at 1.40 [1.23–1.58] °C, and underlying human-caused warming stands at 1.34 [1.18–1.50] °C. In IPCC quantified likelihood language this means that it was unlikely that long-term realised warming had exceeded 1.5 °C by the end of 2024 and very unlikely that human-induced warming had exceeded 1.5 °C."

Observing first-hand snow metamorphism is key to improving the modelling of these transformations. In this work, we monitor snow microstructure evolution during metamorphism by X-ray tomography. We provide a data set at high spatial and temporal resolution of 3D images of snow microstructure evolving through a wide range of experimental conditions, along with videos showing these transformations. 
 Refined observations of the temporal evolution of snow microstructure are crucial for improving the understanding and modeling of snow metamorphism. X-ray tomography has opened new possibilities for observing the microstructure of dry snow by enabling 3D imaging of the ice and air arrangement with micrometric resolution. The development of cells that control the thermal boundary conditions of a snow sample during scanning has made in-situ monitoring of microstructural changes during metamorphism possible. However, such data sets remain scarce and are often limited in terms of the snow evolution conditions explored. In this work, we use highly resolved X-ray tomography to characterize the temporal evolution of dry snow microstructure under a wide range of thermal boundary conditions. We designed a snow-metamorphism cell to continuously control the temperature at the boundaries of a centimeter-sized snow sample directly inside the tomograph. Using this setup, we conducted a total of 20 snow metamorphism experiments, covering mean snow temperatures from -3 to -17 °C, snow temperature gradients from 0 to 100 K m⁻¹, and five initial snow samples with varying snow types, densities, and specific surface areas. Each experiment lasted 7 days, during which tomographic measurements were performed every 4 hours at a spatial resolution of 8.5 µm. We provide a unique set of 4D data in .zarr format, consisting of time series of binary 3D images of snow undergoing the aforementioned experiments. These images are particularly well-suited for investigating local processes, such as the interface growth velocity, as well as for computing various physical properties of snow. In addition, videos showing the temporal evolution of the snow microstructure for the 20 experiments are provided."

The Safe and Sustainable-by-Design (SSbD) framework, developed by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC), offers a comprehensive approach with which to evaluate the safety and sustainability of chemicals and materials across their lifecycle. While SSbD uses various modeling approaches to assess impacts on human health, the environment, and socioeconomic factors, these are often applied independently, hindering a holistic understanding of the complex interactions between these factors and thus the simultaneous optimization of function, cost, safety and sustainability. This review describes existing predictive models and available strategies for their integration to facilitate more comprehensive and holistic chemical and material impact assessments. Specifically, we examine three model integration strategies: consensus integration that combines model predictions for the same impact categories, weighted aggregation that combines different scores in a unified one, and pipeline integration that links models sequentially to create a more unified assessment. Furthermore, we address key concepts related to the uncertainty of model predictions and the applicability domain of models, highlighting how these evolve in integrated frameworks. Insights into the applications of these integration strategies and challenges will allow a more accurate, coherent, and sustainable approach to chemical and material safety and sustainability assessments."

This four-year microcosm study aimed to unravel the mechanisms of relatively long-term OM transformation and stabilization subject to microbial processing in the OM amended Fe-ore tailings. The method of isotopic tracing (13C-glucose and 13C/15N-labeled spring wheat biomass) and a high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) were employed to characterize molecular composition of OM and organo-microbial-mineral interactions in the resultant tailings technosol at the submicron scale. It was revealed that both soluble (i.e., glucose) and solid (plant biomass) OM used to amend tailings for soil formation generated a diverse range of molecules, including protein-, lipid-, and lignin-like compounds. These organics were predominantly stabilized by Fe- and Al-rich minerals heterogeneously. Meanwhile, microbial 14N2 fixation was observed in tailings primed with 13C-glucose, resulting in microbial OM enriched with 13C and 14N. A dynamic OM turnover in the tailings amended with 13C/15N-labeled spring wheat biomass was observed, which was characterized by the decrease of exogenous 13C/15N and the emergence of organic compounds containing atmospheric sources of 12C/14N. These microbial and mineral-mediated OM formation and stabilization processes indicate the emergence of developing soil ecological resilience, indicated by in situ microorganism-driven C/N biogeochemistry in the initially OM-amended tailings."

Flushing (ca. 16 L/min for 5 min) and showering (ca. 7 L/min for 8 min) both temporarily reduced bacterial concentrations by removing accumulated planktonic biomass. However, total bacteria rebounded within 1–4 days after a flush or shower, regardless of the presence of chloramines (1 mg/L Cl2). In the absence of chloramines, Legionella spp. ssrA gene concentrations increased over 3–10 days following flushing or showering, whereas chloramines suppressed Legionella spp. for >10 days despite completely decaying within hours of water use. Without chloramines, hot-water flushing at 49 or 60 °C provided little additional control of Legionella spp. as compared to cold-water flushing. V. vermiformis concentrations decreased temporarily following water use, independent of disinfectant or temperature. Flushing was more effective than showering at removing Legionella spp. from biofilms, while pipe material had limited influence in this pilot-scale system. Overall, the results demonstrate organism-specific recovery dynamics and highlight the role of chloramines in prolonging the suppression of Legionella in premise plumbing."

In this study, paired samples of indoor dust, bulk air, hand wipes, silicone wristbands, and urine were collected from 109 adults residing in urban homes from South China in 2023. First, seven urinary biomarkers, including hydroxylated and carboxylated metabolites of C10–C14  benzylalkyldimethylammonium compounds (BACs), were identified using a combined in silico and in vitro workflow. Then, 23 QACs, including 6 C8–C18 BACs, 6 dialkyldimethylammonium compounds (C8–C18 DADMACs), 6 alkyltrimethylammonium compounds (C8–C18 ATMACs), and 5 emerging QACs, were ubiquitously detected in various environmental matrices, including dust (median ∑QAC concentrations of 39.6 μg/g), bulk air (130 pg/m3), hand wipes (1420 ng for two hands), and silicone wristbands (225 ng/g), respectively. A significantly positive correlation was observed between the logarithmically transformed masses of QACs detected in silicone wristbands and those from dust, bulk air, and hand wipes (r: 0.564, p < 0.01). Moreover, urinary hydroxylated and carboxylated C10- and C12-BACs were significantly correlated with corresponding parent compounds in wristbands (r: 0.481–0.607, p < 0.01). Finally, back calculation from urinary exposure biomarkers revealed that ingestion of surface residues was the dominant exposure route for C10-, C12-, and C14-BACs, accounting for 3.7%, 49.6%, and 18% of total exposure, respectively. The findings from this study propose suitable urinary exposure biomarkers and silicone wristbands as useful indicators for accurate internal and external exposure assessment, respectively, and highlight the importance of ingestion of surface residues as a major exposure route."

Waste management represents the weakest link in the PFAS life cycle, as landfilling sustains long-term secondary releases, suboptimal thermal treatments can re-emit or transform PFAS, and open burning generates additional emissions, with these pressures amplified in low- and middle-income countries. Against this backdrop, this Feature examines how structural weaknesses in waste management perpetuate planetary-boundary transgression and outlines governance and policy solutions to realign PFAS control with a safe operating space. Drawing on lessons from the Basel and Stockholm Conventions, we outline a governance approach centered on class-based regulation, application of the essential-use concept with time-bounded derogations, and strict enforcement of BAT/BEP for remaining uses. Accountability should be strengthened through extended producer responsibility, polluter-pays mechanisms, and product labeling and traceability, supported by equity-focused finance and technology partnerships, with progress assessed through three complementary indicators: declining production and use of nonessential PFAS; decreasing concentrations in sentinel media; and an increasing share of remediation and exposure-reduction costs borne by producers and polluters."

However, the extent to which this association persists in the elderly population, as well as the underlying mechanisms involved, remains insufficiently characterized. This study aimed to comprehensively investigate associations between PFASs exposure and glycometabolic markers in the healthy elderly using integrated multiomics approach, elucidating underlying biological mechanisms. A panel study was conducted among 76 healthy elderly aged 60–69 years living in Jinan City, China, with five consecutive monthly surveys. Blood concentrations of nine PFASs and five glycometabolic markers were measured. Associations between both individual and combined exposures to PFASs and glycometabolic markers were investigated through a linear mixed-effects model (LMM) and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR). Integrated multiomics analysis delineated mechanisms by which PFASs exposure disrupts glycometabolism. We observed that a single exposure to perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) was significantly associated with increases in all five glycometabolic markers. Exposure to perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) was associated with increases in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycated serum protein (GSP), while PFHxS was additionally associated with the triglyceride-glucose index (TyG). Furthermore, the BKMR model further indicated a synergistic and positive association between PFAS mixtures and these markers. Multiomics analyses identified 48 canonical pathways potentially mediating these metabolic disruptions. These findings highlight the need to prioritize reduction of PFASs exposure as a public health strategy for preventing and managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), particularly in aging populations worldwide."

When the OAE is simulated to operate from the year 2030 to 2099 in 12 different coastal areas, the carbon emissions generated from the OAE’s mining, processing, transportation, and dumping can significantly offset their carbon sequestration effects, causing specific OAE technologies unable to reduce atmospheric CO2. Among all four OAE technologies, coastal enhanced weathering exhibits the best overall carbon removal effectiveness, while the North Atlantic has the highest potential to store OAE-captured CO2. All OAE runs have an OAE-induced oceanic carbon leakage into the atmosphere, especially when clean energy is utilized to power the OAE activities, highlighting the necessity to consider the carbon removal additionality, permanency, and leakage performance for robust modeling assessment."

Although the marine environment contains multiple pollutants, OA can alter the environmental behavior of MPs, influencing their toxicity and environmental fate. Therefore, investigating the interactive effects of OA and MPs is essential. Fish can activate physiological compensatory mechanisms to adapt to OA; however, it remains unclear how MPs affect these mechanisms. In this study, marine medaka were exposed to acidified seawater (pH 7.70) containing environmentally relevant concentrations of MPs (0.1 mg/L) for 90 days to investigate the disruptive effects of MPs on responses to OA. The results showed that while OA triggered compensatory energy metabolism reprogramming to enhance ammonia production, MPs disrupted this process, reducing the TCA cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate. This α-ketoglutarate deficiency limited the glutamate supply for ammonia production. Simultaneous inhibition of glutamate dehydrogenase activity further limited glutamate availability. As a result, MPs reduced the level of ammonia production by 25.29%, compromising the ability to neutralize excess H+. Crucially, photoaging exacerbated this toxicity, leading to a 32.04% reduction in ammonia production. This study demonstrates that MPs interfere with fish responses to OA via α-ketoglutarate-mediated metabolic reprogramming, highlighting a vulnerability in marine organisms facing climate change scenarios."

Leveraging existing infrastructure, proven technologies like Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ), and low carbon intensity (CI) feedstocks (e.g., switchgrass and miscanthus) can support this transition and help achieve near-term emissions reduction targets. This study evaluates the implications of lignocellulosic ethanol biorefinery siting and integration with petroleum refineries to produce SAF across 1000 sites randomly sampled from areas suitable for perennial grasses in the U.S. rainfed region. To better understand the logistics of material transport and handoffs, we integrated models of biomass harvest, transport, ethanol, and ATJ production in a stochastic framework based on Monte Carlo simulations to characterize SAF minimum selling price (MSP) and carbon intensity (CI), considering site-specific parameters (e.g., feedstock production, transportation, taxes, incentives). The results indicate trade-offs between MSP and CI across locations, with median MSP ranging from 7.9 to 12.8 USD·gal–1 and CI from −9.7 to 39.4 gCO2e·MJ–1. Despite high estimated decarbonization costs (580 USD·tonCO2e–1), our results indicate that site-specific deployment of ATJ with low-CI feedstocks can improve sustainability outcomes. The framework provides a systematic approach to assess cost and sustainability trade-offs across locations, considering the end-to-end supply chain and supporting an informed investment in SAF production."

Its metabolite, bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCPP), plays a critical role in mediating TDCPP-induced toxicities and may exacerbate aging-related processes. In this study, we quantitatively compared the bioconcentration and toxicity of TDCPP and BDCPP in Caenorhabditis elegans. BDCPP exhibited higher environmental persistence and bioaccumulation potential than TDCPP. Exposure to 0.1–1000 μg/L TDCPP and BDCPP increased Oil red O staining (7.88%–55.44%, 6.42%–33.92%), lipofuscin levels (5.44%–35.98%, 3.54%–28.66%), and reduced the mean lifespan (3.09%–10.31%, 1.84%–8.74%). Overall, TDCPP caused greater triglyceride (TG) accumulation, lipofuscin formation, and lifespan reduction compared to BDCPP. TDCPP reduced brood size by 5.30%–18.95%, while BDCPP exposure increased brood size by up to 13.90%. Mechanism investigations revealed that TDCPP and BDCPP induce aging through distinct pathways. The adverse outcome pathways revealed that BDCPP disrupted germline stem cells (GSCs) apoptosis, transmitting reproductive signals through the kri-1-daf-16-lipl-4 signaling cascade, impairing TG hydrolysis and lifespan, while TDCPP acted through a GSC-independent route. These findings underscore the central role of GSCs in BDCPP-induced aging, enhance our understanding of BDCPP as a secondary pollutant, and provide critical data for assessing the ecological and health risks of chlorinated organophosphate esters."

Here, we reveal that ·OH is a pivotal biogeochemical agent whose function is governed by a “dual-coupling oxidative model”. External coupling is demonstrated by salinity acting as a master variable, driving a significant increase in ·OH production potential. This salinity-driven gradient of oxidative pressure then interacts with the internal coupling─the functional duality of ·OH─to produce divergent GHG dynamics. For CO2, net promotion (contributing an average of 9.38 ± 3.92%) resulted from a trade-off where direct abiotic mineralization overcame the suppression of C-degradation enzymes. In contrast, ·OH acted as a net suppressant of CH4 emission, an effect predominantly driven by biotic responses. For N2O, an apparent promotion (contributing 4.36 ± 4.39%) resulted from a powerful indirect effect via suppression of its sink enzyme, which overwhelmed a direct chemical inhibitory path. Ultimately, the magnitude of the ·OH effect on GHG fluxes was codetermined by initial abiotic (23–41%) and biotic (14–29%) conditions. Our model provides a new framework for understanding abiotic–biotic interactions and predicting blue carbon ecosystem responses to global change like seawater intrusion."

However, the molecular action of HAT in the reaction of nitrate-to-ammonia conversion remains poorly understood, particularly given the complexity of 8-electron transfer process and the kinetics of different hydrogen species (e.g., adsorbed Hads and free •H radical). Herein, we develop a trace ruthenium anchored self-supported heterostructure (Ru-Ni2P/NF), in which Ni2P accelerates water dissociation to generate hydrogen intermediates and Ru optimizes Hads stabilization. Experimental results indicate 97.5% nitrate conversion with 86.4% NH3 selectivity within 4 h. Furthermore, H-species kinetic analysis and H/D isotopic labeling demonstrate a difference in Hads and •H functionalities; Hads dominates nitrite reduction with a 14.6-fold higher rate constant than •H-mediated pathways. DFT calculations identify Ru-induced symmetry breaking in nitrate (N–O bond elongation: 0.039 Å) as the critical activation step, and a complete deoxygenation–hydrogenation mechanism (*NO3– → *N → *NHx intermediates) is validated by in situ FTIR and Gibbs free energy profiles. Notably, the reduction of nitrite by Ru-Hads is thermodynamically favored without additional potential, which is consistent with the high rate of Hads reduction of nitrite to ammonia in the experiment. This study generates valuable insights into HAT-mediated nitrate conversion at a molecular level, providing a blueprint for catalytic systems in environmental remediation and green ammonia synthesis."

This study employed mitochondrial metabolomics integrated with phenotypic assays to investigate the subcellular mechanisms of SCCP-induced energy metabolism inhibition. Exposure to SCCPs (0–100 μg/L) caused profound downregulation of ATP. Seahorse respirometry analyses revealed the dose-dependent inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation and compensatory upregulation of glycolysis. Mitochondrial ultrastructural damage (swelling and cristae loss) and dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential confirmed mitochondria as the primary targets of SCCPs. Mitochondrial metabolomics demonstrated that the suppression of the TCA cycle (depleted citrate, oxaloacetate) and OXPHOS (reduced NAD+, ATP/ADP; inhibited Complex V activity) is responsible for the downregulation of ATP. The conversion from phosphatidylcholines to lysophosphatidylcholines further verified mitochondrial membrane damage. Perturbations in nucleotide metabolism reflected impaired synthesis pathways for DNA/RNA. Critically, medium-chain chlorinated paraffins (MCCPs), proposed as SCCP substitutes, induced qualitatively similar mitochondrial damage (respiration inhibition, cristae disruption, and ΔΨm loss), challenging the presumed safety of MCCPs as alternatives.

ED is uniquely suited for ion separation and recovery from high-salinity waters, especially for ions of low concentrations, as ions, instead of water, are transported in an electrical field. However, the application of ED is limited by the lack of selectivity of the counterions in the existing IEMs. Here, we developed a thin-film composite cation exchange membrane (TFC-CEM) consisting of an ultrathin polyamide coating, a porous polysulfone support, and a dense cation exchange polymer layer, which provides excellent separation between divalent and monovalent cations, high mechanical strength, and effective separation between cations and anions. At a constant current of 0.24 mA cm–2, the TFC-CEM demonstrated monovalent over divalent cation selectivity of 49.32–136.79 in mixed cation solutions with a divalent to monovalent cation molar ratio of 25. The selectivity increased with increasing divalent to monovalent cation concentration ratios and correlated strongly with the difference in the hydrated size of the cations. Furthermore, the asymmetric structure of the TFC-CEM led to unique limiting current density behaviors, revealing that ion transport through the polyamide coating was rate-limiting. Finally, TFC-CEM demonstrated great potential for lithium extraction from hypersaline brines."

Understanding how the resulting volatile and semivolatile organic oxidation products influence indoor air chemistry requires accurate representations not only of their emission into indoor air but also of their transport across the outermost skin barrier, the stratum corneum. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the passive permeation of acetone, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, and water, two representative products of skin-oil oxidation and a reference compound, through a model stratum corneum lipid membrane. We determine position-dependent diffusivities using two complementary analyses based on the same set of simulations and evaluate their accuracy through  propagator analysis. The two approaches provide upper and lower bounds for the true diffusivity, which, when combined with previously reported free-energy profiles, yield permeabilities relevant for modeling macroscopic skin transport. Our results show that permeation is governed primarily by energetic barriers rather than by molecular mobility and that the predicted transport coefficients vary by about 1 order of magnitude depending on the chosen diffusivity estimator. These findings provide molecular-level constraints for parameters used in indoor air chemistry models and establish a transferable framework for linking atomistic transport mechanisms to large-scale simulations of human exposure to indoor air quality."

Notably, only high-fat foods produced UFP concentrations comparable to those of deep frying. No NOx emissions were found during blank (empty appliance) runs, and NOx was only detectable while cooking certain types of foods. However, residues accumulating within inaccessible areas of the air fryer following over 70 uses led to increases of 23% in VOC and 236% in UFP concentrations while not cooking food."

This study used a mouse model with gut dysbiosis induced by cefoperazone to explore As bioaccumulation, transformation, and excretion. By integrating absolute quantification methods, this study monitored the responses of gut microbiota, As biotransformation genes (ABGs), and gut metabolites in mice exposed to 1 and 10 mg/L As. Arsenic accumulation in the liver, spleen, heart, ileum, and blood was markedly decreased in gut dysbiosis mice exposed to 10 mg/L As. These mice also exhibited lower proportions of DMA(V) and As(V) in the liver compared with normal mice. A total of 17 ABGs were detected in the mouse gut, with a significant reduction in their absolute abundance in gut dysbiosis mice (e.g., arsC, arsH, and arsB genes). Consistently, gut dysbiosis mice had lower bacterial loads, particularly for Alloprevotella and Bacteroides, accompanied by the upregulation of “amino acids” and “fatty acid esters.” Association analysis predicted several specific bacteria carrying ABGs, exemplified by Bacteroides carrying the arsC gene. Our findings provided further insights into As metabolism mediated by gut microbiota, for better understanding As-induced toxicity and disease risk."

However, their effects on wild, free-living organisms remain unexplored. Using red blood cells, we investigated how foraging habits, inferred from stable isotopes, and contaminant exposure were associated with mitochondrial bioenergetics in breeding Scopoli’s shearwaters (Calonectris diomedea), a top marine predator in the Mediterranean Sea. We found higher concentrations of Hg, but not of total PFAS, in older individuals and in males compared to females. Our results also indicate dietary pollutant exposure: Hg, but not total PFAS, was higher in birds with a higher trophic position and in those foraging closer to shores. Additionally, higher Hg concentration was linked to higher mitochondrial proton leakage (LEAK), reflecting reduced efficiency to couple oxygen consumption to energy production. In contrast, specific PFAS were negatively associated with LEAK, suggesting a potential impairment in the regulation of mitochondrial membrane potential through proton conductance, a key mechanism protecting cells from oxidative stress. Our study highlights how foraging ecology shapes pollutant exposure and its consequences for mitochondria bioenergetics in an apex predator of conservation interest."

Although nanoplastics are ubiquitous and intractable in the environment and in organisms, their potential health impacts remain unclear. Emerging evidence showed that nanoplastics can cross the blood–brain barrier and accumulate in the brain. However, the effects of nanoplastics on neuronal health and functions in the brain are poorly understood. Here, we examined the effects of nanoplastic exposure on neurotransmitter release by measuring FM 4-64 (a lipophilic styryl dye) release from synaptic vesicles during electrical stimulation after exposing rat hippocampal neurons to 1–10 μg/mL of fluorescent polystyrene nanoplastics with an average diameter of 42 nm. We found that nanoplastics accumulated in the presynaptic terminal of hippocampal neurons and reduced stimulation-induced FM 4-64 release in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, nanoplastics decreased Ca2+ elevation in the presynaptic terminal of hippocampal neurons during electrical stimulation. Our results suggest that accumulated nanoplastics in the brain can impair neuronal functions by disrupting neurotransmitter release and Ca2+ dynamics in the presynaptic terminal of neurons, which could eventually lead to neurodegeneration."

However, the effects of GenX on male reproductive development remain incompletely understood. In this study, pregnant mice were administered GenX (2 mg/kg bw/d) via gavage and/or inulin (1% w/v) in the drinking water until lactation concluded. At the 16th week after birth, male littermates were necropsied. Early-life exposure to GenX in mice led to gut microbiota imbalance, colonic tissue alterations, reduced expression of goblet cells and tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin, and claudin 5), and triggered an inflammatory response. Moreover, increased serum LPS levels, histopathological alterations in testicular tissue, reduced testosterone levels, and decreased expression of blood–testis barrier proteins (ZO-1, occludin, N-cadherin, and β-catenin) were resulted from early-life exposure to GenX. Additionally, there was an upregulation of inflammatory factors TNF-a and IL-1β, along with a higher incidence of sperm abnormalities. Transcriptomic analysis revealed an enrichment of necroptosis in the testes of the GenX group. Consistently, overexpression of RIPK1, RIPK3, TLR4, and p-ERK, and decreased expression of caspase-8 confirmed the participation of necroptosis in GenX-induced testicular injury. As a potent prebiotic, inulin balanced intestinal homeostasis and attenuated GenX-induced testicular injury by modulating LPS-TLR4-mediated necroptosis. This study offers new insights into the impact of early-life GenX exposure on male reproductive risk and evaluates the potential of inulin as a dietary modification strategy."

However, its impact on endometrial function during early pregnancy remains poorly understood. This study investigates the effects and mechanisms of MC-LR exposure during the peri-implantation period on endometrial receptivity. Pregnant mice were administered with MC-LR at a biologically relevant dose (1/2 NOAEL, 20 μg/kg/day) from gestational days 3.5 to 5.5. MC-LR exposure impaired uterine morphology, reduced serum progesterone, and suppressed expression of key receptivity markers, resulting in decreased implantation sites. Transcriptomic analysis revealed dysregulation of the extracellular region, immune response, and hormone activity, with STAT3 signaling identified as a key regulator. MC-LR also disrupted uterine immune homeostasis, causing macrophage dysfunction and reduced IL-6 levels. The IL-6-dependent STAT3/HIF-1α signaling pathway was inhibited by MC-LR but reactivated by Garcinone D. Pharmacological activation of STAT3 prevented MC-LR-induced impairments, including cytokine dysregulation, extracellular matrix degradation, angiogenesis inhibition, reduced gland numbers, and decreased implantation capacity, though serum progesterone levels remained unaffected. These findings suggest that MC-LR disrupts endometrial receptivity via STAT3/HIF-1α signaling, independent of progesterone restoration, providing novel insights into microcystin-induced reproductive toxicity and a potential therapeutic target for implantation failure."

A previous study revealed that 20 μg/mL COE exposure for 120 days could induce malignant transformation of lung epithelial cells. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The epigenetic regulation of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) plays an important role in carcinogenesis. Changes in lncRNA expression during COE-induced malignant transformation were detected, highlighting the importance of gene–environment interactions in cancer. Here, we identified that SFTA1P was downregulated in COE-induced malignant transformation of lung epithelial cells. Interestingly, this reduction was found to have a gradient effect on different stages of cells of COE exposure. Moreover, we found that downregulation of SFTA1P expression in lung cancer was related to patients’ poor prognosis. Phenotypic studies have demonstrated that SFTA1P suppressed lung cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Further mechanistic studies revealed that SFTA1P directly interacts with ACSS2, an important enzyme responsible for synthesizing acetyl-CoA, leading to abnormal acetyl-CoA metabolism and affecting COE-induced lung carcinogenesis. COE-induced malignant transformed cells or cells with the knockdown of SFTA1P showed significantly increased fatty acid and cholesterol levels, while normal lung epithelial cells or cells with overexpression of SFTA1P showed substantially decreased fatty acid and cholesterol levels. Moreover, transfection of ACSS2 into cells with overexpressing SFTA1P could rescue the SFTA1P-induced cell phenotype. Our findings link SFTA1P-regulated acetyl-CoA metabolism with COE-induced malignant transformation and imply that SFTA1P could be an important biomarker for early intervention and diagnosis of lung cancer."

Nevertheless, the neurodevelopmental consequences of prenatal low-level lead exposure remain inadequately characterized, with limited understanding of its mechanistic underpinnings and a lack of robust biomarkers for susceptibility. In this birth cohort study, we quantified the concentrations of 27 metals along with DNA methylation levels at 12 gene regions in cord blood. Neurodevelopment was assessed longitudinally in infancy using the Ages and Stages Questionnaires (ASQ). Associations between metal exposures and neurodevelopmental outcomes were evaluated via three complementary statistical approaches: mixed-effect models, quantile g-computation, and Bayesian kernel machine regression. Among all metals examined, only lead (mean concentration of 15.3 μg/L) exhibited consistent and statistically significant negative associations with neurodevelopmental performance. A linear dose–response relationship was observed between lead levels and deficits in problem-solving, fine motor, and gross motor skills. Furthermore, we identified four CpG sites within FAM50B and PTCHD3 that mediate the effects of lead exposure and demonstrated strong predictive capacity for neurodevelopmental outcomes using a random forest model. Our results provide novel evidence that even low-level prenatal lead exposure adversely affects early neurodevelopment and implicate FAM50B/PTCHD3 methylation as both a promising biomarker of lead-related neurodevelopmental risk and a potential target for therapeutic intervention."

However, its effectiveness may be compromised by the ubiquitous presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) in these media. Here, we combined metagenomic sequencing, quantitative PCR analysis, plate culture, and Sanger sequencing to examine the effects of steam cooking on the profiles of antibiotic resistance in cooked fish, tap water, and indoor air in real cooking environments (i.e., a canteen and a home kitchen) and a laboratory chamber. We found that while steam cooking eliminated over 92.0% of bacteria and ARGs in both tap water and fish, it significantly increased the absolute abundance of bacteria and ARGs in indoor fine particulate matter (PM2.5) across all settings. Tap water was identified as the primary contributor to the increase, transferring 14.6% of bacteria and 33.2% of ARGs into indoor PM2.5 during steam cooking. This process also elevated the relative abundance of certain putative human pathogens in indoor PM2.5, containing ARGs and heat shock proteins and mainly originating from tap water. To test if these transferred ARGs hosts were viable, we conducted  plate culture experiments and identified a viable heat-resistant ARB, Bacillus cereus, transferred from water to indoor PM2.5 via water vapor. Our results highlight the cross-medium transport of ARB and ARGs via steam cooking and underscore the potential microbial safety issues to cooking personnel through inhalational exposure."

No research has reported their exposure burden in pregnant women, nor is there epidemiological evidence of associations with newborn size. In this study, we recruited 947 mother-infant pairs from China. A morning spot urine sample was collected to measure the concentration of five nitro-PAHs exposure biomarkers using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Three of five measured amino-PAHs were detected in over 50% of the population, and the concentration was 0.044, 0.268, and 0.103 ng/mg creatinine for 1-AP, 2-AF, and 9-APhe, respectively. Using generalized linear regression, we found per ln unit increase in the concentration of 1-AP which was significantly associated with reduced newborn weight Z-Score (−0.12 [−0.20, −0.03]), length Z-Score (−0.11 [−0.17, −0.05]), and weight-for-length Z-Score (−0.09 [−0.16, −0.01]), respectively. The mixture effect model showed a negative association between mixed nitro-PAHs exposure and length Z-Score and weight Z-Score, with 1-AP being the dominant contributor to the effect. To explore how maternal nitro-PAHs exert impact on the developing fetus, the potential mediating role of placental 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a classical biomarker of DNA oxidative damage, was measured in a subset of samples (n = 201). We revealed that urinary 1-AP and 2-AF were positively correlated with placental 8-OHdG content. Mediation analysis showed that placental 8-OHdG mediated the associations of gestational 1-AP and 2-AF exposure with neonatal weight Z-Score, with a proportion of mediation of 31.38 and 18.77%, respectively. These results provide preliminary evidence that gestational nitro-PAHs exposure may be a risk factor for reduced newborn size, and placental DNA oxidative damage potentially mediates the effect."

However, the associations between specific chemical constituents of PM2.5 and the dynamic progression of hypertensive CVD remain unclear. Using multistate models and mediation analyses in a cohort of 316,087 individuals, we investigated the associations between PM2.5, PM2.5 chemical components (sulfate [SO42–], nitrate [NO3–], ammonium [NH4+], organic matter [OM], and black carbon [BC]), and the dynamic progression from different blood pressure states to incident CVD and mortality. Our findings revealed that PM2.5 and its constituents were positively associated with the dynamic HTN progression. For example, with each interquartile range (IQR) increase, PM2.5, SO42–, NO3–, NH4+, OM, and BC were significantly associated with the disease transition from prehypertension (pre-HTN) to HTN, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.116 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.104–1.128), 1.186 (95% CI: 1.171–1.202), 1.179 (95% CI: 1.166–1.193), 1.171 (95% CI: 1.159–1.184), 1.155 (95% CI: 1.141–1.169), and 1.147 (95% CI: 1.133–1.161), respectively. Mediation analysis demonstrated that pre-HTN and HTN significantly mediated the relationships between PM2.5, PM2.5 components, and the increased risk of CVD and cardiovascular mortality. This study provides evidence that ambient PM2.5 and its chemical constituents may be important determinants in the dynamic progression of HTN. Controlling exposure to PM2.5 and its components, particularly during the pre-HTN phase, could be an effective strategy to curb the development of hypertensive CVD and alleviate its public health impact."

However, there is limited evidence regarding how prenatal metal exposome influences newborn metabolic programming. This prospective cohort in 2022–2023 analyzed 432 mother–neonate pairs with complete biospecimens and birth records. We measured maternal urinary concentrations of 18 metals across first and third trimesters as well as neonatal metabolic biomarkers including 12 amino acids, 26 carnitines, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 17-hydroxyprogesterone (OHP), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). Multivariable regression, quantile g-computation, and machine learning methods were integrated to evaluate both individual and joint metal effects, with metabolic network and pathway enrichment analyses. Nine neonatal metabolites (tyrosine, glycine, leucine, free carnitine, C3, C5, C5:1, G6PD, and OHP) showed consistent trimester-specific associations with the metal mixtures. Arginine biosynthesis was the primary metal-responsive pathway. First-trimester exposure to zinc, selenium, tin, and chromium inversely correlated with gestational age at birth (β = −0.22 to −0.07; P < 0.05), while zinc and selenium inversely linked to birth weight (β = −83.48 to −51.67; P < 0.05). Mediation analysis revealed G6PD mediated 17.2% (95% CI, 0.11%; 168.00%) of Zn-gestational age association.

This study assessed firefighter’s ambient (nondietary) exposure to PFASs using silicone wristbands. Twenty-three firefighters from North Carolina wore a new wristband during each 9-day work period for approximately 4 months. While wearing the wristbands, each firefighter reported on fire calls using an App installed on their phones. Wristbands, and blood plasma samples collected at study completion, were analyzed for PFASs. PFASs were detected in all blood samples and were dominated by TFA, PFOA, PFOS, PFPrA and PFHxS. Several PFASs levels were positively associated with age and years as a firefighter. Analytes commonly detected in wristbands were MeFBSE, MeFOSE, PFHxA, PFUnA, 6:2 diPAP, 8:2 diPAP, and 6:2/8:2 diPAP. Wristband MeFBSE levels were associated with the number of fires and duration of time spent at a fire. MeFOSE levels on wristbands were also significantly and positively correlated with plasma N-MeFOSAA, similar to a previous study in a nonfirefighter cohort. Overall, these findings suggest that silicone wristbands can detect some occupational PFASs exposures among firefighters and highlights the potential for specific PFASs compounds to be associated with firefighting activities."

Serum concentrations of 19 PFAS were measured, and pubertal development was assessed using several pubertal markers, including ultrasound-assessed breast development, Tanner staging, pubertal hormone levels, and age at menarche. We applied quantile g-computation, elastic net, and Bayesian regression to evaluate both combined and individual effects of PFAS exposure, in addition to single-pollutant analyses. Higher PFAS concentrations were significantly associated with later thelarche, pubarche, lower serum levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, estrone, and estradiol, and later menarche. Among the PFAS analyzed, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) emerged as the key predictors of later pubertal markers.

Given that renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis is a central pathological feature of progressive kidney diseases, we investigated AhR-induced profibrotic events at the molecular and cellular levels in human renal tubular epithelial cells (HKC). We found that the AhR activation by the potent agonist 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) promoted epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and inflammatory responses. This was evidenced by a 56.19% decrease in E-cadherin; 1.87-, 2.39-, and 8.27-fold increases in fibronectin, MMP9, and IL-6, respectively; and a 37.77% enhancement in cell migration. Transcriptome analysis and experimental validations confirmed the consistent dysregulation of these markers. Moreover, we found the profibrotic effects of the known nephrotoxic phytochemical aristolactam I (AL-I) also involving activation of AhR and consistent regulation of the above marker genes, primarily via the AhR. In addition, the transcriptome data further suggested that AhR activation may indirectly induce the profibrotic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway by upregulating AREG, EREG, and TGF-α, indicating crosstalk between AhR and EGFR. Given the wide variety of AhR-active chemicals, these AhR-EMT/inflammation-related markers could be used to screen nephrotoxicity of emerging dioxin-like pollutants and toxic phytochemicals."

Mechanistically, TCAA inhibited the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1)-nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) interaction, which drove placental iron dyshomeostasis marked by an expanded labile iron pool (LIP) and subsequent reactive oxygen species (ROS) overaccumulation. The iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO) significantly alleviated TCAA-induced pregnancy loss by restoring iron metabolism, reducing oxidative stress, and enhancing trophoblast invasion.

However, its increasing utilization has raised concerns about environmental contamination and potential health risks, underscoring the need for comprehensive toxicological assessments. In this study, we evaluated the tissue distribution and toxicological effects of NMC in adult male C57BL/6J mice following 28-day intratracheal instillation at doses of 32.5, 162.5, and 325 μg/kg/day. Our findings demonstrated that lithium primarily accumulated in the heart, while nickel also showed high accumulation ability in the heart, followed by the liver and epididymis. Cobalt accumulated predominantly in the spleen, kidneys, and epididymis, whereas manganese was mainly concentrated in the epididymis. Notably, exposure to high doses of NMC resulted in a reduction in body weight, elevated levels of systemic inflammation biomarkers, and significant histopathological changes. These histopathological alterations included alveolar fusion and structural damage in the lungs, loss of distinction between red and white pulp in the spleen, renal tubular dilation, and a decrease in spermatogenic cells in the testes and epididymis. Furthermore, NMC exposure disrupted the homeostasis of trace metals (copper, vanadium, molybdenum, strontium, selenium, and stannum) in mice, suggesting their potential roles in NMC-induced toxicity. This study provides a detailed characterization of the distribution and toxic effects of low-dose NMC exposure, contributing valuable data for the toxicology evaluation of NMC materials."

While the “One Health” framework emphasizes the need to monitor antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) across diverse environments worldwide, the risks posed by ARGs in lakes affected by human activities, particularly in lake sediments that serve as natural reservoirs of ARGs, remain poorly understood. Metagenomics enables culture-independent analysis of microbial communities and resistance genes, providing essential insights into ARG dynamics. This study investigates microbial communities, ARGs, metal resistance genes (MRGs), and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in sediments from Lake Donghu and Lake Weishan in China, two contrasting lake ecosystems subject to urbanization and agricultural activities for over four decades, using high-throughput metagenomic sequencing and assembly. ARGs and MRGs were more strongly influenced by deterministic environmental factors, particularly heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Cu), whereas microbial community structures were predominantly shaped by stochastic processes. Metagenomic binning yielded 293 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), 125 of which were identified as potential ARG hosts, with Proteobacteria and Desulfobacterota being the most common. These hosts frequently cocarried MGEs, virulence factor genes (VFGs), and MRGs and exhibited metabolic pathways linked to carbon, nitrogen, and greenhouse gas (CO2 and N2O) cycling. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was determined as a key factor influencing microbial metabolism and promoting resistance gene dissemination. Our findings highlight a tight coupling between ARG dissemination, microbial ecological functions, and biogeochemical processes, underscoring ecosystem-level risks associated with resistance proliferation in human-impacted wetlands of China and elsewhere."

However, their effects and mechanisms on causing endocrine system diseases remain unclear. Here, we established a dietary exposure mouse model using micro and nanoplastics (MNPs) and found that MNPs caused a decrease in thyroid function in adolescent mice. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was used to reconstruct the intestinal microbiota of mice to reveal the mechanisms of thyroid dysfunction. The abundance of Bacteroides in the intestinal tract significantly changed after FMT. PP-MPs and NPs affected the levels of lysophosphatidylethanolamine and fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids, respectively, which competitively bound to thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) on the thyroid gland, thus affecting the thyroid function. PET-MNPs affected the level of 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylglycol sulfate, which regulated the activity of sympathetic nervous system by acting on the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor and TSHR in mice, thereby interfering with the regulatory function of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis on the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones. This study emphasizes the key role of intestinal microbiota-mediated HPT axis in thyroid dysfunction caused by MNP exposure and provides theoretical basis for the prevention of endocrine-related diseases during adolescence caused by MNPs."

While temperature is a key driver of these variations, additional factors such as air pollution, infectious disease cycles, and socioeconomic disparities also shape seasonal health risks. This commentary discusses methodological approaches for assessing seasonality, highlighting key metrics for summarizing seasonality such as peak-to-trough ratios and attributable fractions. We further discuss how both environmental and demographic factors interact to drive seasonality in mortality as well as the potential impact of climate change on driving future seasonality patterns. Finally, we extend the discussion beyond mortality to explore seasonal variations in other health outcomes.

This 5-month longitudinal panel study, conducted among 76 healthy participants aged 60–69 in Jinan, China. Urinary concentrations of six PAHs were measured, and biological age was estimated using the Klemera and Doubal method. The associations between individual and combined PAH exposures and cognitive function were examined using linear mixed-effects model, and the mediating effect of biological aging was assessed by mediation model. Additionally, lipidomic profiling including lipidome clustering and individual lipids helped identify key biomolecular mediators. The results showed that exposure to four PAHs was significantly associated with cognitive decline, with combined exposure analysis further indicated the detrimental effects of PAH mixtures. And biological aging partially mediated the association between 2-hydroxynaphthalene (2-NAP) and cognitive function. Key lipid levels, particularly phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs)-dominated clustering pattern, emerged as pivotal molecular mediator shaping this relationship. Additionally, more lipid species, notably phosphatidylcholines (PCs), mediated PAHs-induced cognitive decline in females. These findings elucidate lipid levels as a key mechanism linking biological aging and PAHs-induced cognitive decline, with specific lipid alterations partially explaining the increased vulnerability of females to cognitive decline."

We conducted a nationwide cohort study of 6.1 million singleton births, based on the National Free Prepregnancy Checkups Project across 29 provinces in China, 2014–2020. We observed that interquartile range increases in particulate matter with diameters ≤2.5 and ≤10 μm, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide during 12 weeks before conception through pregnancy were associated with increased risks of PTB, with the hazard ratios of 1.25 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.24, 1.25), 1.13 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.14), 1.10 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.10), and 1.24 (95% CI: 1.24, 1.25), respectively. Participants with high air pollution exposure (>75th percentile) and abnormal thyrotropin levels (<0.37 or ≥4.88 mIU/L) showed higher risks of PTB, compared to those with low air pollution exposure (<25th percentile) and normal thyrotropin levels. Additive interactions were also identified between air pollution and thyrotropin abnormalities (relative excess risk due to interaction >0, attributable proportion due to interaction >0, and synergy index >1). Our study showed that exposure to air pollution during preconception through pregnancy was associated with increased risks of PTB and that air pollution and thyrotropin abnormalities may synergistically contribute to incident PTB.

However, there are no population-based cohort studies on the effects of parental antibiotic exposure on early IVF outcomes. A total of 33 antibiotics and 1 metabolite with detection rates over 10% in both female and male partners were included. Couples’ early IVF reproductive outcomes included the blastocyst numbers, best-quality embryo numbers, embryo numbers, best-quality embryo rates, two pronuclei (2PN) rates, and blastocyst rates. We applied the adaptive elastic net (AENET) with 10-fold cross-validation to identify antibiotics associated with early IVF outcomes in couples. According to the antibiotics identified by AENET, quantile-based g-computation (QGC) models, group-weighted quantile sum (GWQS) regression, and partitioning around medoids (PAM) algorithms were used to evaluate the joint associations of parental antibiotic mixtures with early IVF reproductive outcomes. The independent associations between antibiotics identified by AENET, antibiotic classes, and early IVF reproductive outcomes in couples were evaluated using the multivariate generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with random intercepts. In this couple-based prospective cohort study, 739 couples with 947 fresh cycles were included between December 2020 and August 2023. The mean age (SD) was 34.08 (5.48) years for male partners and 33.09 (5.22) years for female partners. In couple-based analyses, sulfaclozine, roxithromycin, sulfamonomethoxine, erythromycin, and penicillin V were positively related to several early IVF reproductive outcomes, while sulfamethoxazole, penicillin G, chlorotetracycline, norfloxacin, florfenicol amine (FFA), sulfadiazine, cyadox, and sulfachloropyridazine were negatively related to early IVF outcomes. Among antibiotic classes, human antibiotics (HAs), β-lactams, chloramphenicols, and quinoxalines had positive effects on early IVF outcomes, while sulfonamides, preferred as veterinary antibiotics (PVAs), and lincosamides had inverse effects on early IVF outcomes. Similar results were also observed in male partners and female partners. The association between parental antibiotic exposure and IVF outcomes requires further validation in a larger cohort of couples. Additionally, the extrapolation of our results to the general childbearing-aged couples requires caution as infertile couples may be more susceptible to antibiotics."

However, its toxicological effects, particularly regarding gastrointestinal disease progression, remain largely unexplored. In this study, animal experiments first demonstrated that TBC aggravates colonic inflammation in a mouse model of microplastic-induced colitis. Computational toxicology analysis further predicted TBC to possess potential carcinogenic properties, suggesting its role in promoting colitis-associated carcinogenesis. Using integrated bioinformatics approaches, we combined network toxicology, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations to identify the putative toxicological targets and molecular pathways involved in TBC-induced inflammation-to-cancer transition. A total of 299 TBC-related targets were identified from multilevel databases, and 13 core targets were highlighted through STRING and Cytoscape analyses, including AKT2, MAPK1, MAPK3, HSP90AA1, PIK3CD, BCL2, PIK3R1, PIK3CB, ESR1, CASP3, KRAS, and ERBB2. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that TBC may drive carcinogenic progression via pathways associated with oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations validated the stable interactions between TBC and key targets. To further confirm TBC’s role in colitis-associated tumorigenesis, we employed an AOM/DSS-induced colorectal cancer mouse model and found that TBC significantly exacerbated both intestinal inflammation and tumor formation. Transcriptomic analysis further validated the enrichment of ROS-mediated chemical carcinogenesis pathways and revealed that intestinal barrier disruption may also be a critical contributor to TBC-mediated cancer progression. Collectively, this study provides a theoretical basis for understanding the molecular mechanisms by which TBC aggravates inflammation-associated colorectal cancer, and offers a framework for risk assessment and regulatory strategies addressing plasticizer exposure in digestive health."

However, the mechanistic basis for this pathogen’s resistance evolution remains elusive. Our study demonstrates that a minimally dormant or the early stages of viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state of bacteria is critical to chlorine tolerance development, representing an initial stage of resistance acquisition. Prolonged low-dose chlorination (12 h exposure to 2 mg/L chloramine-T) induced VBNC transformation in L. pneumophila, with a resuscitation lag time ∼10-fold longer than that of parallel nonchlorinated but starved bacteria. Upon resuscitation, secondary chlorination (3 or 12 h) of stationary-phase cells maintained growth rates similar to those of untreated cells, but with significantly shortened lag times (to ∼26 and ∼41 h, vs ∼40 and ∼47 h for single-chlorinated groups, with p < 0.01 for the 3 h treatment). Flow cytometry showed that rechlorinated groups had a higher proportion of active cells and a lower proportion of death-analogous cells than single-chlorinated counterparts, indicating the emergence of a chlorine-tolerant subpopulation. These findings directly link the VBNC state to bacterial resistance evolution, underscoring the urgent need to investigate dormant bacteria to control antimicrobial resistance spread in water systems."

Increasing evidence suggests that Mn impairs endogenous neurogenesis and hinders neural repair. This study aims to investigate the effects of both acute and long-term Mn exposure on neurogenesis and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. By establishing acute (7 and 14 days) and long-term (2 and 4 months) Mn exposure mouse models, we assessed neurogenesis under different exposure conditions. The mRNA sequencing, untargeted metabolomics, and metagenomics were employed to uncover the molecular pathways involved in Mn-induced neurogenesis impairment. The results revealed that early stage Mn exposure, including acute and 2 months exposure, transiently promoted neurogenesis. However, prolonged Mn accumulation in the brain led to suppressed neurogenesis, accompanied by neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, which contributed to a vicious cycle of neural damage. Multiomics analyses identified dysregulation of the tryptophan metabolic pathway as a key mechanism, with a marked reduction in melatonin levels following Mn exposure. Notably, exogenous melatonin supplementation effectively rescued Mn-induced impairments in neurogenesis, neuronal integrity, and neuroinflammation. These findings provide new insights into Mn neurotoxicity and highlight melatonin as a potential therapeutic agent for Mn-related neural damage."

Evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies suggests that GLY and its commercial formulations, glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs), disrupt normal endocrine function, adversely affecting reproduction. This review synthesizes the current knowledge on GLY/GBHs-induced female reproductive toxicity, elucidating mechanisms across molecular, cellular, tissue, organ, and individual/population levels. Using the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework, we identify three key molecular initiating events (MIEs): (1) activation of estrogen receptor α (ERα), (2) inhibition of aromatase activity, and (3) disruption of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes. These MIEs trigger key events (KEs) such as oxidative stress, DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and epigenetic modifications, leading to cell death. At the tissue/organ level, these changes cause hormonal homeostasis imbalance, impaired oocyte maturation, ovulatory dysfunction, ovarian reserve depletion, and abnormal endometrial hyperplasia, culminating in clinical conditions such as premature ovarian insufficiency and endometrial cancer. By constructing an AOP network, this review establishes causal relationships across biological levels, providing a theoretical basis for health risk assessment and environmental management of GLY. The AOP framework enhances our understanding of GLY-induced female reproductive toxicity and identifies potential biomarkers and intervention targets, offering critical insights for regulatory decision-making and public health protection."

While growing evidence links changes in blood pressure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and metal(loid) exposure, knowledge gaps persist in understanding the molecular mechanisms and developing operational screening tools. We aim to investigate the effects of VOC and metal(loid) coexposure on the blood pressure of children in EA, uncover metabolic mechanisms via urinary metabolomics, and develop a machine learning algorithm-driven predictive model for identifying children with potential hypertension risks. We measured systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures, urinary VOC metabolites (mVOCs), metal(loid)s, and metabolomic profiles in EA children (n = 426). Results showed that the hypertension prevalence in our study population (12.7%) significantly exceeded the nationally representative estimate of 3.11%. Elevated levels of urinary 4 mVOCs and 5 metal(loid)s were associated with increased SBP or DBP (p < 0.05). Principal component analysis identified the positive association between mVOC-dominated mixture and SBP and DBP, where 2-aminothiazoline-4-carboxylic acid (ATCA) contributed most substantially (p < 0.05). Urinary metabolomics revealed N-phenylacetyl-l-glutamine (PAGln) and pyroglutamic acid as pivotal mediators linking VOC and metal(loid) exposure to childhood blood pressure elevation, suggesting gut microbiota metabolism and γ-glutamyl cycling may play important roles in pollutant-associated hypertension. Notably, our predictive model achieved 83% accuracy in differentiating children with a potential hypertension risk, with androstane glucuronide (steroid metabolism) and PAGln being top-ranked features. These results collectively indicated that VOC and metal(loid) exposure may contribute to elevated blood pressure in EA children via disturbing gut microbiota metabolism, γ-glutamyl cycling, and steroid metabolism. This study significantly advances our understanding of the potential mechanisms between VOC and metal(loid) exposure and childhood blood pressure elevation while providing practical tools for early risk detection and intervention."

Experimental evidence supports the notion that exposure to pesticides could perturb the gut microbiome, and the toxicant-induced dysbiosis may affect host homeostasis. However, the field of human studies, especially in early life, is still in its infancy. We aimed to evaluate the effects of landscape pesticide exposure on the maternal gut microbiome. Here, we assessed the blood levels of a broad array of pesticides in 405 pregnant women. Gut microbial compositions and functional profiles were assessed by using both 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Microbial alpha diversity indices were regressed on host and environmental factors using linear models. Differences in overall microbial compositions were evaluated by using univariable permutational multivariate analyses of variance (PERMANOVA) with Bray–Curtis dissimilarities. All pesticides, as well as other host and environmental factors, were correlated to the gut microbiome at the phylum, genus, species, and pathway levels employing the multivariable regression models adjusted for the potential covariates, respectively. The joint effects of the mixture of pesticide exposure on the gut microbiome were investigated using quantile g-computation. Microbial ecological networks were constructed via Spearman correlations to explore species co-occurrence patterns related to pesticide exposure. Significant associations were observed between exposure to various pesticides individually or as a mixture and maternal gut microbiome features. Specific taxa and pathways were enriched or depleted in response to varying pesticide concentrations, indicating the potential exposure-response relationships. Notably, mirex exposure showed a positive correlation with both the relative abundance of Blautia_wexlerae and the sucrose biosynthesis II pathway. Microbial co-occurrence network analyses revealed marked shifts in species interactions associated with increasing levels of pesticide exposure. Mediation analyses further identified a greater number of microbial taxa, particularly Blautia_wexlerae, as significant mediators linking pesticide exposure to alterations in microbial functional pathways. Our large-scale amplicon and metagenomic analyses unraveled the extensive impacts of landscape-level pesticides on the maternal gut microbiome. Further observational and experimental research is warranted to validate our findings as well as to elucidate whether and how these microbial changes affect maternal and offspring health."

Previous studies have suggested that evolving tremor properties may relate to changes in the stress conditions of the plumbing system. However, a strong causative link has remained elusive. At Etna volcano, we observe subtle changes in the frequency of stable spectral lines recorded during broadband tremor over 8 months in 2020. Comparison with seismic velocity changes computed using passive seismic interferometry reveals a remarkable correlation between relative frequency (df/f) $(df/f)$ and seismic velocity (dv/v) $(dv/v)$ changes. The most significant of these changes are interpreted to result from a shear‐wave velocity decrease in response to local seismicity. We argue that these observations are best explained by resonance within near‐surface structures. These findings demonstrate that monitoring frequency shifts of stable spectral lines produced during tremor can provide meaningful insights into subsurface properties."

However, the chemical maps are often used to analyze pre‐defined regions based on mapped geology and/or mineralogy. Previous mapping works have relied on first‐principles methods like principal component analyses and k‐means clustering. In response, we adapt dimensionality reduction and multivariate clustering methods to analyze the spatial variability of nine key elements in martian geochemical maps. We identify seven individually contiguous chemical provinces, nearly exclusively in the highlands.

Coarse‐grid global numerical weather forecasts are typically downscaled to meet these requirements, introducing challenges of scale inconsistency, process representation error, computation cost, and entanglement of distinct uncertainty sources from chaoticity, model bias, and large‐scale forcing. We address these challenges by learning the climatological prior distribution of a target region with a generative model, using its high‐resolution numerical weather simulations. An optimal combination of this learned high‐resolution climatological prior with coarse‐grid large scale forecasts yields highly accurate, fine‐grained, full‐variable, large ensemble of weather pattern forecasts. Using observed meteorological records and wind turbine power outputs as references, the proposed methodology verifies advantageously compared to existing numerical/statistical forecasting‐downscaling pipelines, regarding either deterministic/probabilistic skills or economic gains. Moreover, a 100‐member, 10‐day forecast with spatial resolution of 1 km and output frequency of 15 min takes < ${< } $1 hr on a moderate‐end GPU, as contrast to O103 $\mathcal{O}\left(1{0}^{3}\right)$ CPU hours for conventional numerical simulation. By drastically reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy, this paradigm paves the way for more efficient and reliable renewable energy planning and operation."

This study investigates interactions between tropical cyclogenesis and KWs using 10 simulations over 2001 to 2010 produced by the deep‐learning model Ai2 Climate Emulator version 2 (ACE2) trained on reanalysis data. The 100 years of simulations show a robust modulation of tropical cyclogenesis by KWs in all basins. Tropical cyclogenesis preferentially occurs after the peak KW precipitation by 1 day in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific, mainly due to the enhanced column relative humidity and horizontal vorticity by the KWs. This study demonstrates that large‐ensemble data generated from deep‐learning climate emulators can help strengthen relationships difficult to detect in observations alone. While we focus on tropical cyclogenesis, this approach may also benefit other types of weather or climate variability."

However, the carbon footprint of its energy (72% coal‐based) requirement is also equally alarming. Under such scenarios, the Farm Power Subsidy (FPS) policy for groundwater irrigation, one of India's costliest public support systems, needs a relook, keeping in view the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Although aimed at bridging social disparities, it is observed that FPS encourages simplification and intensification of the food production system, leading to inter‐state and district scale inequality in income. States implementing FPS, even if experiencing physical water scarcity, are growing water guzzling crops for economic benefits. Conversely, without adequate access to energy, states reeling from economic water scarcity are witnessing low farm incomes. India consumes about a quarter of the world's groundwater for irrigation, and also leads the energy use. Notably, since the mid‐2000s large‐scale implementation of the FPS policy, the CO2 emission (equivalent) has been rising by 5.77 million tons annually, now surpassing 100 million tons. These outcomes bear testimony to the globally accepted view that those least responsible for causing greenhouse gas emissions are the hardest hit. We suggest repurposing of agricultural policies, without compromising farmers' income, for efficient management of energy and water."

Sugarcane is burned in Florida to facilitate the harvesting process, with the majority of these fires occurring in the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA), where there is only one regulatory air quality monitor. During the 2022–2023 sugarcane burning season (October–May), we used public low‐cost PurpleAir sensors, regulatory monitors, and 29 PurpleAir sensors deployed for this study to quantify PM2.5 from agricultural fires. We found satellite imagery is of limited use for detecting smoke from agricultural fires in Florida due to the cloud cover, overnight smoke, and the fires being small and short‐lived. For these reasons, surface measurements are critical for capturing increases in PM2.5 from smoke, and we used multiple smoke‐identification criteria. During the study period, median 24‐hour PM2.5 concentrations increased by 2.3–6.9 μg m−3 on smoke‐impacted days compared to unimpacted days, with smoke observed on 4%–28% of the campaign days (ranges from the different smoke‐identification criteria). Further, short‐term PM2.5 increases were observed over 40 μg m−3 during smoke events. We contrast the region near the EAA with large populations of low‐income and minoritized groups to the more affluent coastal region. The inland region experienced more smoke‐impacted monitor days than the Florida east coast region, and there was a higher study‐average smoke PM2.5 concentration in the inland area. These findings highlight the need to increase air quality monitoring near the EAA."

 The implications of climate change for malaria eradication this century remain poorly resolved1,2. Many studies focus on parasite and vector ecology in isolation, neglecting the interactions between climate, malaria control and the socioeconomic environment, including disruption from extreme weather3,4. Here we integrate 25 years of African data on climate, malaria burden and control, socioeconomic factors, and extreme weather. Using a geotemporal model linked to an ensemble of climate projections under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5 (SSP 2-4.5) scenario5, we estimate the future impact of climate change on malaria burden in Africa, including both ecological and disruptive effects. Our findings indicate that climate change could lead to 123 million (projection range 49.5 million to 203 million) additional malaria cases and 532,000 (195,000–912,000) additional deaths in Africa between 2024 and 2050 under current control levels. Contrary to the prevailing focus on ecological mechanisms, extreme weather events emerge as the primary driver of increased risk, accounting for 79% (50–94%) of additional cases and 93% (70–100%) of additional deaths. Most increases stem from intensification in existing endemic areas rather than range expansion, with significant regional variation in impact. These results highlight the urgent need for climate-resilient malaria control strategies and robust emergency response systems to safeguard progress towards malaria eradication.

 Ultralight axion particles are candidates for dark matter1, conjectured to form stable, macroscopic field configurations in three-dimensional space, resulting in the possible formation of topological defect dark matter2–4 (TDM). Exploring their possible existence through a realistic parameter space requires considering interactions that extend beyond the constraints imposed by astrophysical observations of stellar cooling processes5. Here we report the outcome of an experiment that monitors possible transient rotations of polarized spins, which could be induced by the interaction with topological defects, carried out by correlating five noble-gas laboratory set-ups located in two cities. Amplification and optimal noise filtering in hyperpolarized noble-gas spins greatly enhance the sensitivity to TDM-induced spin rotations, reaching approximately 10−6 rad. Through this, we set constraints on the axion–nucleon coupling across an axion mass range from 10 peV to 0.2 μeV, achieving 4.1 × 1010 GeV at 84 peV. These values exceed known constraints imposed by astrophysical observations, although these are obtained under different model assumptions. Our approach could further stimulate broad beyond-Standard Model physics searches, such as transient axion waves, axion stars, axion strings and Q-balls.

 Time-dependent drives hold promise for realizing non-equilibrium many-body phenomena that are absent in undriven systems1–3. Yet, drive-induced heating normally destabilizes the systems4,5, which can be parametrically suppressed in the high-frequency regime by using periodic (Floquet) drives6,7. It remains largely unknown to what extent highly controllable quantum simulators can suppress heating in non-periodically driven systems. Here, using the 78-qubit superconducting quantum processor, Chuang-tzu 2.0, we report the experimental observation of long-lived prethermal phases in many-body systems with tunable heating rates, driven by structured random protocols, characterized by n-multipolar temporal correlations. By measuring both the particle imbalance and subsystem entanglement entropy, we monitor the entire heating process over 1,000 driving cycles and observe the existence of the prethermal plateau. The prethermal lifetime is ‘doubly tunable’: one way by driving frequency, the other way by multipolar order; it grows algebraically with the frequency with the universal scaling exponent 2n + 1. Using quantum-state tomography on different subsystems, we demonstrate a non-uniform spatial entanglement distribution and observe a crossover from area-law to volume-law entanglement scaling. With 78 qubits and 137 couplers in a two-dimensional configuration, the entire far-from-equilibrium heating dynamics are beyond the reach of simulation using tensor-network numerical techniques. Our work highlights superconducting quantum processors as a powerful platform for exploring universal scaling laws and non-equilibrium phases of matter in driven systems in regimes where classical simulation faces formidable challenges.

 Developing a unified algorithm that can learn from and generate across modalities such as text, images and video has been a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence. Although next-token prediction has driven major advances in large language models1, its extension to multimodal domains has remained limited, and diffusion models for image and video synthesis2,3 and compositional frameworks that integrate vision encoders with language models4 still dominate. Here we introduce Emu3, a family of multimodal models trained solely with next-token prediction. Emu3 equals the performance of well-established task-specific models across both perception and generation, matching flagship systems while removing the need for diffusion or compositional architectures. It further demonstrates coherent, high-fidelity video generation, interleaved vision–language generation and vision–language–action modelling for robotic manipulation. By reducing multimodal learning to unified token prediction, Emu3 establishes a robust foundation for large-scale multimodal modelling and offers a promising route towards unified multimodal intelligence.

 Integrated circuits for communications play an enabling role when it comes to outer-space exploration thanks to their small footprint and low weight1–3. However, owing to the severe irradiation effects of space energetic particles, the implementation of radiation-tolerant electronic circuits remains a challenge4–6. Here we report the observation of the space radiation effect on a satellite-based device and find that atomically thin materials are expected to accumulate minimal radiation-induced damage in principle. Accordingly, on the basis of a 4-inch wafer-scale monolayer 2D MoS2 process, we implement an atomic-layer transistor-based radiation-tolerant radio frequency (RF, 12–18 GHz) system with both transmitters and receivers for spaceborne communication. For on-orbit experiments, the 2D communication system was successfully launched to the approximately 517 km low Earth orbit. Notably, the system maintains a bit error rate (BER) of less than 10−8 in the transmitted data after 9 months of on-orbit operation, indicating substantial radiation tolerance and long stability. The lifespan of the 2D communication system is predicted to be about 271 years even on the geosynchronous orbit with a much harsher radiation environment. This work showcases the unique prospects of 2D electronics for spaceborne applications.

 Amorphous materials—solids lacking long-range order—underpin technologies from thin-film electronics1, solar cells2 and phase-change memory3 to magnetic components4, medical devices5 and quantum technologies6–8. Yet the absence of periodicity fundamentally limits determination of their three-dimensional (3D) structure at atomic resolution. Despite major theoretical, experimental, and computational advances in characterizing short- and medium-range order9–24, quantitative determination of complete 3D atomic arrangements in amorphous materials remains experimentally demanding. Atomic electron tomography (AET) now provides a pathway to direct 3D atomic mapping in these materials25–27. Here we present a quantitative analysis of AET, showing how robust image preprocessing, denoising, projection alignment and normalization, advanced tomographic reconstruction, atom tracing, elemental classification and atomic position refinement collectively enable reliable determination of 3D atomic coordinates and elemental identities in amorphous materials. Using multislice-simulated datasets of amorphous Si, SiGeSn and CoPdPt nanoparticles under varying noise levels, our workflow outperforms an alternative approach28 in both positional precision and classification accuracy. For CoPdPt, we identify 95.1% of Co, 99.0% of Pd and 100% of Pt atoms, with corresponding 3D positional precisions of 29 pm, 12 pm and 6 pm, respectively, under realistic dose conditions.

 Emerging evidence suggests that Parkinson’s disease (PD) may have its origin in the enteric nervous system (ENS), from where α-synuclein (αS) pathology spreads to the brain1–4. Decades before the onset of motor symptoms, patients with PD suffer from constipation and present with circulating T cells responsive to αS, suggesting that peripheral immune responses initiated in the ENS may be involved in the early stages of PD1,5–7. However, cellular mechanisms that trigger αS pathology in the ENS and its spread along the gut–brain axis remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that muscularis macrophages (ME-Macs), housekeepers of ENS integrity and intestinal homeostasis, modulate αS pathology and neurodegeneration in models of PD8,9. ME-Macs contain misfolded αS, adopt a signature reflecting endolysosomal dysfunction and modulate the expansion of T cells that travel from the ENS to the brain through the dura mater as αS pathology progresses. Directed ME-Mac depletion leads to reduced αS pathology in the ENS and central nervous system, prevents T cell expansion and mitigates neurodegeneration and motor dysfunction, suggesting a role for ME-Macs as early cellular initiators of αS pathology along the gut–brain axis. Understanding these mechanisms could pave the way for early-stage biomarkers in PD.

 Effort is costly: given a choice, we tend to avoid it1. However, in many cases, effort adds value to the ensuing rewards2. From ants3 to humans4, individuals prefer rewards that had been harder to achieve. This counterintuitive process may promote reward seeking even in resource-poor environments, thus enhancing evolutionary fitness5. Despite its ubiquity, the neural mechanisms supporting this behavioural effect are poorly understood. Here we show that effort amplifies the dopamine response to an otherwise identical reward, and this amplification depends on local modulation of dopamine axons by acetylcholine. High-effort rewards evoke rapid acetylcholine release from local interneurons in the nucleus accumbens. Acetylcholine then binds to nicotinic receptors on dopamine axon terminals to augment dopamine release when reward is delivered. Blocking the cholinergic modulation blunts dopamine release selectively in high-effort contexts, impairing effortful behaviour while leaving low-effort reward consumption intact. These results reconcile in vitro studies, which have long demonstrated that acetylcholine can trigger dopamine release directly through dopamine axons6–11, with in vivo studies that failed to observe such modulation12–14, but did not examine high-effort contexts.

 Optical control of topology, particularly in the presence of electron correlations, is an interesting topic with broad scientific and technological impact1–4. Twisted MoTe2 bilayer (tMoTe2) is a zero-field fractional Chern insulator (FCI)5–10, exhibiting the fractionally quantized anomalous Hall effect11–14. As the chirality of the edge states and sign of the Chern number are determined by the underlying ferromagnetic polarization15,16, manipulation of ferromagnetism would realize control of the Chern insulator (CI)/FCI states. Here we demonstrate control of ferromagnetic polarization, and thus the CI and FCI states, by circularly polarized optical pumping in tMoTe2. At low excitation power, we achieve on-demand preparation of ferromagnetic polarization by optical training, that is, electrically tuning the system from non-ferromagnetic to desirable ferromagnetic states under helicity-selective optical pumping. With increased excitation power, we further realize direct optical switching of ferromagnetic polarization at a temperature far below the Curie temperature17,18. Both optical training and direct switching are most effective near CI and FCI states, which we attribute to a gap-enhanced valley polarization of optically pumped holes. The magnetization can be dynamically switched by modulating the helicity of optical excitation. Spatially resolved measurements further demonstrate optical writing of ferromagnetic, and thus CI (or FCI) domains. Our work realizes precise optical control of a topological quantum many-body system with potential applications in topological spintronics, quantum memories and creation of exotic edge states by programmable patterning of integer and fractionally quantized anomalous Hall domains4,19. Optical control of integer and fractional Chern insulators is demonstrated by circularly polarized optical pumping in tMoTe2."

Medzhitov,Environmentally driven immune imprinting protects against allergy,"In a mouse model, environmental immunostimulation in early life led to cross-reactive adaptive immune memory and reduced type II immune responses to allergens, indicating a mechanistic relationship between environmental antigen exposure and subsequent allergy. 
 Allergic diseases are caused by overexuberant type II immune responses mounted against environmental antigens1. The allergic state is typified by the presence of allergen-reactive immunoglobulin E (IgE), which triggers mast cell degranulation upon allergen encounter, manifesting in pruritis, oedema and, in severe cases, anaphylaxis. Over the past century, the prevalence of allergic diseases has increased markedly, suggesting that environmental rather than genetic factors are mediating this change2. Although many hypotheses connecting environment to allergy exist3–6, the biological mechanisms that underpin environmentally mediated protection from allergy are unknown. Here we show, using a mouse model of allergic disease, that exposure to immunostimulatory environments generated cross-reactive adaptive immune memory, which tracked with obstructed type II immune responses upon allergen exposure. We found that engagement of cross-reactive adaptive immunity protected against future allergic sensitization and suppressed established allergic responses. Cross-reactivity in a tolerogenic context also prevented allergy, with the effect extending across antigenically complex exposures even at low protein sequence similarity. Our findings demonstrate a mechanistic relationship between environment and allergy, with general implications for adaptive immune function in natural settings.

 Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is an endemic herpesvirus implicated in autoimmunity, cancer and neurological disorders. Although primary infection is often subclinical, persistent EBV infection can drive immune dysregulation and long-term complications. Despite the ubiquity of infection, the determinants of EBV persistence following primary exposure remain poorly understood, although human genetic variation partially contributes to this phenotypic spectrum1–3. Here we demonstrate that existing whole genome sequencing (WGS) data of human populations can be used to quantify persistent EBV DNA. Using WGS and health record data from the UK Biobank (n = 490,560) and All of Us (n = 245,394), we uncover reproducible associations between blood-derived EBV DNA quantifications and respiratory, autoimmune, neurological and cardiovascular diseases. We evaluate genetic determinants of persistent EBV DNA via genome association studies, revealing heritability enrichment in immune-associated regulatory regions and protein-altering variants in 148 genes. Single-cell and pathway level analyses of these loci implicate variable antigen processing as a primary determinant of EBV DNA persistence. Further, relevant gene programs were enriched in B cells and antigen-presenting cells, consistent with their roles in viral reservoir and clearance. Human leukocyte antigen genotyping and predicted viral epitope presentation affinities implicate major histocompatibility complex class II variation as a key modulator of EBV persistence. Together, our analyses demonstrate how re-analysis of human population-scale WGS data can elucidate the genetic architecture of viral DNA persistence, a framework generalizable to the broader human virome4.

 Pesticides are widely distributed in soils1–3, yet their effects on soil biodiversity remain poorly understood4–7. Here we examined the effects of 63 pesticides on soil archaea, bacteria, fungi, protists, nematodes, arthropods and key functional gene groups across 373 sites spanning woodlands, grasslands and croplands in 26 European countries. Pesticide residues were detected in 70% of sites and emerged as the second strongest driver of soil biodiversity patterns after soil properties. Our analysis further revealed organism- and function-specific patterns, emphasizing complex and widespread non-target effects on soil biodiversity. Pesticides altered microbial functions, including phosphorus and nitrogen cycling, and suppressed beneficial taxa, including arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and bacterivore nematodes. Our findings highlight the need to integrate functional and taxonomic characteristics into future risk assessment methodology to safeguard soil biodiversity, a cornerstone of ecosystem functioning.

 The invention of the laser transformed optics by providing intense, coherent light in the visible region, but extending this concept to X-rays has been hindered by a lack of suitable gain media and mirrors. Current hard X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) facilities1–5 overcome this by amplifying shot noise from a high-peak-current electron bunch via self-amplified spontaneous emission6 in a single pass through long undulators, delivering very high brightness but with a noisy, multi-spiked temporal and spectral profile. Cavity-based XFELs (CBXFELs)7–9 were proposed to close this gap by recirculating spectrally filtered X-ray pulses in a Bragg-reflecting cavity synchronized to a high-repetition-rate electron beam. Here we show lasing with multi-pass gain at 6.952 keV in a 132.8-m round-trip diamond-based Bragg cavity10 at the European XFEL, matched to the 2.23-MHz bunch spacing of the superconducting accelerator5. Under stringent length and angular stability requirements, a ring-up in the cavity across successive bunches was observed, producing spectrally pure, microjoule-level pulses. This establishes the feasibility of CBXFELs in an accelerator environment and validates diamond Bragg optics for X-ray resonators. The demonstrated spectral purity opens a path to next-generation X-ray science, which demands highly coherent, stable sources.

 The emergence of high-transition-temperature (Tc) superconductivity in strongly correlated materials remains the main unsolved problem in physics. High-Tc materials, such as cuprates, are generally complex and not easily tunable, making theoretical modelling difficult. Although the Hubbard model—a simple theoretical model of interacting electrons on a lattice—is believed to capture the essential physics of high-Tc materials1–5, obtaining accurate solutions of the model, especially in the relevant regime of moderate correlation, is challenging6. The recent demonstration of robust superconductivity in moiré WSe2 (refs. 7,8), in which low-energy electronic bands can be described by the Hubbard model and are highly tunable9–11, presents a new platform for studying the high-Tc problem. Here we tune moiré WSe2 bilayers to the moderate correlation regime through the twist angle and map the phase diagram around one hole per moiré unit cell (ν = 1) by electrostatic gating and electrical transport and magneto-optical measurements. We observe a range of high-Tc phenomenology, including an antiferromagnetic insulator at ν = 1, superconducting domes on electron and hole doping, and unusual metallic states such as strange metals12–14. Twist-angle dependence studies further show that the highest Tc always occurs adjacent to the Mott transition3,15. Our results indicate strong correlation as the key to superconductivity in moiré WSe2 and establish a new material system for studying high-Tc superconductivity in a controllable manner.

We characterized the oral microbiomes of 12,519 people by re-analysing whole-genome sequencing reads from previously sequenced saliva-derived DNA. Human genetic variation at 11 loci (10 new) associated with variation in oral microbiome composition. Several of these related to carbohydrate availability; the strongest association (P = 3.0 × 10−188) involved the common FUT2 W154X loss-of-function variant, which associated with the abundances of 58 bacterial species.

 Solid-state thorium-229 (229Th) nuclear clocks1–5 are set to provide new opportunities for precision metrology and fundamental physics6–8. Taking advantage of inherent low sensitivity of a nuclear transition to its environment9, orders of magnitude more emitters can be hosted in a solid-state crystal compared with current optical lattice atomic clocks10. Furthermore, solid-state systems needing only simple thermal control11 are key to the development of field-deployable compact clocks. Here we explore and characterize the frequency reproducibility of the 229Th:CaF2 nuclear clock transition, a key performance metric for all clocks. We measure the transition linewidth and centre frequency as a function of the doping concentration, temperature and time. We report the concentration-dependent inhomogeneous linewidth of the nuclear transition, limited by the intrinsic host crystal12 properties. We determine an optimal working temperature for the 229Th:CaF2 nuclear clock at 196(5) K, at which the first-order thermal sensitivity vanishes. This would enable in situ temperature co-sensing using different quadrupole-split lines, reducing the temperature-induced systematic shift below the 10−18 fractional frequency uncertainty level. At 195 K, the reproducibility of the nuclear transition frequency is 220 Hz (fractionally 1.1 × 10−13) for two differently doped 229Th:CaF2 crystals over 7 months. These results form the foundation for understanding, controlling and harnessing the coherent nuclear excitation of 229Th in solid-state hosts and for their applications in constraining temporal variations of fundamental constants.

 Eukaryotic genome replication is surveyed by the S-phase checkpoint, which coordinates sequential origin activation to prevent the exhaustion of poorly defined, rate-limiting replisome components1–3. Here we show that excessive origin firing saturates chromatin-bound proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)—a sliding clamp for DNA polymerase processivity and Okazaki fragment processing4—thereby restricting further PCNA loading and lagging-strand synthesis when checkpoint control is lost. PCNA-associated factor 15 (PAF15) emerges as a dosage-sensitive regulator of this process5–9. During unperturbed S phase, the entire soluble PAF15 pool binds to chromatin, leaving no reserve to stabilize PCNA under conditions of excessive origin activation. PAF15 binds to PCNA specifically on the lagging strand through a high-affinity PIP motif and occupies the DNA-encircling channel, protecting the clamp and associated enzymes from premature unloading by the ATAD5–RFC complex. Conversely, overexpression of PAF15 or forced redistribution to the leading strand disrupts replisome progression and induces cell death. These detrimental effects are mitigated by Timeless–Claspin, which blocks PAF15–PCNA binding on the leading strand. E2F4-mediated repression fine-tunes PAF15 expression to ensure optimal dosage and strand specificity. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized replisome constraint: when PAF15–PCNA assemblies are exhausted, the S-phase checkpoint globally restricts origin activation, linking a strand-specific rate-limiting mechanism to global replication dynamics. PCNA–PAF15 has a key role in determining replisome dynamics during genome replication and protecting against genome instability."

 Cambrian Burgess Shale-type (BST) fossil biotas document nearly complete snapshots of the oldest Phanerozoic marine ecosystems1–4. However, the rarity of deposits bearing high-diversity BST biotas5 has restricted our understanding of the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of the Cambrian explosion. Here we report the Huayuan biota—a lower Cambrian (Stage 4, approximately 512 million years ago) BST Lagerstätte from an outer shelf, deep-water setting of the Yangtze Block in Hunan, South China. The Huayuan biota yields remarkable taxonomic richness, comprising 153 animal species of 16 phylum-level clades dominated by arthropods, poriferans and cnidarians, among which 59% of species are new. The biota is comprised overwhelmingly of soft-bodied forms that include preserved cellular tissues. The complex ecosystem contained diverse radiodonts and pelagic tunicates, filling a gap of high-diversity BST biotas from the Cambrian Stage 4. Critically, multivariate ordination based on a global dataset of Cambrian BST biotas places the Huayuan biota within a main transition of marine animal ecosystems between Cambrian Age 3 and Age 4. Network analysis reveals close faunal connections between the Huayuan and Burgess Shale biotas, indicating transoceanic dispersal.

 Galaxy clusters are the most massive gravitationally bound structures in the universe and serve as tracers of the assembly of large-scale structure1. Studying their progenitors, protoclusters, sheds light on the earliest stages of cluster formation. However, detecting protoclusters is demanding: their member galaxies are loosely bound and the emerging hot intracluster medium (ICM) may only be in the initial stages of virialization2–4. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations located several protocluster candidates by identifying overdensities of z ≳ 5 galaxies5–9. However, none of these candidates was detected by X-ray observations, which offer a powerful way to unveil the hot ICM. Here we report the combined Chandra and JWST detection of a protocluster, JADES-ID1, at z ≈ 5.68, merely one billion years after the Big Bang. We measure a bolometric X-ray luminosity of

              , making this system a progenitor of today’s most massive galaxy clusters. The detection of extended, shock-heated gas indicates that substantial ICM heating can occur in massive halos as early as z ≈ 5.7. Also, given the limited survey volume, the discovery of such a massive cluster is statistically unlikely10, implying that the formation of the large-scale structure must have occurred more rapidly in some regions of the early universe than standard cosmological models predict.

Our second-harmonic-resonant design enhances both pump generation efficiency (95% conversion) and pump power utilization through recirculation, without sacrificing bandwidth. The resonant architecture increases the effective pump power by nearly an order of magnitude compared with conventional single-pass designs, while also multiplexing the signal and pump. We demonstrate flat near-quantum-limited noise performance over 110 nm. Our low-power architecture enables practical on-chip OPAs for next-generation quantum and classical photonics.

 Most bacterial pathogens are polylysogens, harbouring multiple vertically transmitted prophages1–3. These prophages enhance bacterial pathogenicity and survival by encoding virulence factors and anti-phage defence systems while retaining the capacity for horizontal transfer. Thus, prophage-encoded anti-phage defences must block propagation of external phages without inhibiting the spread of the prophages that encode them. Here we identify HepS—an abortive infection system encoded on the Gifsy-1 prophage constituted of a single HEPN domain protein—which restricts phages of the Siphoviridae family. We demonstrate that in its native host context of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, HepS both senses phage infection and enacts abortive infection. Structures of HepS reveal a tetrameric nuclease complex that undergoes allosteric activation upon recognition of Siphoviridae tail tip proteins during production of new phage particles. Once activated, HepS cleaves specific transfer RNA anticodon loops and arrests phage replication. Gifsy-1, a Siphoviridae itself, evades self-targeting by expressing a tail tip variant that does not trigger HepS, as do co-resident Siphoviridae prophages Gifsy-2 and Gifsy-3. This evasion permits Gifsy-1 to spread despite encoding HepS. These findings reveal a mechanism by which a prophage defends the host while maintaining its propagation abilities.

 Early development across vertebrates and insects critically relies on robustly reorganizing the cytoplasm of fertilized eggs into individualized cells1,2. This intricate process is orchestrated by large microtubule structures that traverse the embryo, partitioning the cytoplasm into physically distinct and stable compartments3,4. Here, despite the robustness of embryonic development, we uncover an intrinsic instability in cytoplasmic partitioning driven by the microtubule cytoskeleton. By combining experiments in cytoplasmic extract and in vivo, we reveal that embryos circumvent this instability through two distinct mechanisms: either by matching the cell-cycle duration to the time needed for the instability to unfold or by limiting microtubule nucleation. These regulatory mechanisms give rise to two possible strategies to fill the cytoplasm, which we experimentally demonstrate in zebrafish and Drosophila embryos, respectively. In zebrafish embryos, unstable microtubule waves fill the geometry of the entire embryo from the first division. Conversely, in Drosophila embryos, stable microtubule asters resulting from reduced microtubule nucleation gradually fill the cytoplasm throughout multiple divisions. Our results indicate that the temporal control of microtubule dynamics could have driven the evolutionary emergence of species-specific mechanisms for effective cytoplasmic organization. Furthermore, our study unveils a fundamental synergy between physical instabilities and biological clocks, uncovering universal strategies for rapid, robust and efficient spatial ordering in biological systems. The cytoplasm can be partitioned into distinct compartments by microtubule structures, which can be stabilized by distinct mechanisms in different species."

 Deep learning models that predict functional genomic measurements from DNA sequences are powerful tools for deciphering the genetic regulatory code. Existing methods involve a trade-off between input sequence length and prediction resolution, thereby limiting their modality scope and performance1–5. We present AlphaGenome, a unified DNA sequence model, which takes as input 1 Mb of DNA sequence and predicts thousands of functional genomic tracks up to single-base-pair resolution across diverse modalities. The modalities include gene expression, transcription initiation, chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, transcription factor binding, chromatin contact maps, splice site usage and splice junction coordinates and strength. Trained on human and mouse genomes, AlphaGenome matches or exceeds the strongest available external models in 25 of 26 evaluations of variant effect prediction. The ability of AlphaGenome to simultaneously score variant effects across all modalities accurately recapitulates the mechanisms of clinically relevant variants near the TAL1 oncogene6. To facilitate broader use, we provide tools for making genome track and variant effect predictions from sequence.

 Neutral-atom arrays and optical cavity quantum electrodynamics systems have developed in parallel as central pillars of modern experimental quantum science1–3. Although each platform has shown exceptional capabilities—such as high-fidelity quantum logic4–7 in atom arrays and strong light–matter coupling in cavities8–10—their combination holds promise for realizing fast and non-destructive atom measurement11, building large-scale quantum networks12–17 and engineering hybrid atom–photon Hamiltonians18–20. However, so far, experiments integrating the two platforms have been limited to spatially interfacing the entire atom array with one global cavity mode21–26, a configuration that constrains addressability, parallelism and scalability. Here we introduce the cavity-array microscope, an experimental platform where each individual atom is strongly coupled to its own individual cavity across a two-dimensional array of over 40 modes. Our approach requires no nanophotonic elements26,27, and instead uses a free-space cavity geometry with intra-cavity lenses28,29 to realize above-unity peak cooperativity with micrometre-scale mode waists and spacings, compatible with typical atom-array length scales while keeping atoms far from dielectric surfaces. We achieve homogeneous atom–cavity coupling and show fast, non-destructive, parallel readout on millisecond timescales, including through a fibre array as a proof of principle for networking applications30. As an outlook, we realize a next-generation iteration of the platform with over 500 cavities and a nearly 10-fold improvement in finesse. Our work unlocks the regime of many-cavity quantum electrodynamics and opens an unexplored frontier of large-scale quantum networking with atom arrays.

 Environmental differences in genetic effect sizes, namely, gene–environment interactions, may uncover the genetic encoding of phenotypic plasticity1–3. We provide a cross-population atlas of gene–environment interactions comprising 440,210 individuals from European and Japanese populations, with replication in 539,794 individuals from diverse populations. By decomposing the contributions from age, sex and lifestyles, we delineate the aetiology of these gene–environment interactions, including a reverse-causality from a disease-related dietary change.

 Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV, 100–200 nm) light sources are crucial for advanced spectroscopy, quantum research and semiconductor lithography1–3. Compared with conventional large-scale VUV generation technologies4–7, second-harmonic generation (SHG) through nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals8–10 is the simplest and most efficient method. However, the scarcity of suitable NLO crystals has constrained the production of VUV light through SHG: existing materials fail to meet phase-matching requirements, suffer from low conversion efficiency or have severe growth limitations11–19. In this study, we report the development of the fluorooxoborate crystal NH4B4O6F (abbreviated as ABF) as a promising material for VUV light generation. VUV devices with specific phase-matching angles were constructed, achieving a record 158.9-nm light through phase-matching SHG and a maximum nanosecond pulse energy of 4.8 mJ at 177.3 nm with a conversion efficiency of 5.9%. The enhanced NLO performance is attributed to optimized arrangements of fluorine-based units creating asymmetric sublattices. This work provides further material in the NLO field, with potential for applications in compact, high-power VUV lasers using ABF.

 Psychedelics are undergoing a renaissance as potential therapy for psychiatric disorders, with more than 200 clinical trials being studied across several countries1–3. However, the precise mechanisms by which these drugs bring about benefits and the potential clinical risks are not yet fully understood. The serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) was reported to be a Gq-coupled receptor and the primary interoceptive target of psychedelics4,5. Here we compared psychedelics and their non-hallucinogenic analogues (nHAs) using in vitro and in vivo approaches, finding that 5-HT2AR-mediated non-canonical Gi signalling is essential for hallucinogenic effect. We further presented five cryo-electron microscopy structures of 5-HT2AR–Gi/Gq in complex with psychedelics or nHAs. Structural analysis and pharmacological investigation revealed that a special contact between nHAs with 5-HT2AR mediated the signalling bias. Building on this insight, we identified a 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine derivative, DOI-NBOMe, which exhibits potent and selective Gq-biased activity, and demonstrates promising therapeutic effects in mouse models without hallucinogenic effect. Our finding uncovers the functional mechanisms underlying the Gi signalling mediated by 5-HT2AR and provides valuable insights for designing psychedelic-based drugs with minimized risk from hallucinogenic effects. Psychedelics and their non-hallucinogenic analogues were compared, revealing that serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR)-mediated Gi signalling is essential for hallucinogenic effect, with the functional mechanisms underlying this providing insights for designing therapeutic drugs without hallucinogenic effects."

 Three-dimensional atomic structure is routinely determined for periodic crystals. However, extending such analysis to amorphous materials remains a substantial challenge, despite the scientific and technological importance1,2. In this context, a recent report describing the three-dimensional structure determination of an amorphous solid using atomic-resolution electron tomography (AET) is truly remarkable3. If validated, such an analysis would be groundbreaking. Here we address this issue and investigate whether and when AET can identify all or most atoms in an amorphous nanoparticle. By simulating AET, we reveal limitations on the structural and chemical information AET can determine from noisy electron images. For monoatomic nanoparticles, the structure can be determined with an atomic-position accuracy of tens of picometres under stringent fluence, sampling and projection requirements. For multi-element amorphous nanoparticles, chemical identification resolution is determined by noise and experimental sampling. Heavier atoms are more easily resolved than lighter ones, and large chemical analysis uncertainties emerge when atomic peak and background intensities overlap. Using these insights, we delineate nanoparticle size, composition, electron fluence and image sampling requirements for AET. The results serve as a benchmark for future experiment design and demonstrate a viable approach for amorphous structure determination validation using AET. A simulation approach is used to ascertain the limitations on the structural and chemical information that atomic-resolution electron tomography can determine from noisy electron images."

 Three-dimensional (3D) microfabrication/nanofabrication technologies have revolutionized various fields by enabling the precise construction of complex microstructures/nanostructures1–6. However, existing methods face challenges in fabricating intricate 3D architectures from a diverse range of materials beyond conventional polymers.

A femtosecond-laser-induced heating spot generates a localized thermal gradient, providing precise spatiotemporal control over optofluidic interactions of the nanoparticle-laden dispersions. This enables the rapid and highly localized assembly of nanoparticles with diverse shapes and compositions—including metals, metal oxides, carbon nanomaterials and quantum dots—into complex 3D microstructures. To demonstrate its versatility, we fabricate multifunctional microdevices, such as 3D microfluidic valves with size-selective sieving functionality, achieving fast separation of microparticles/nanoparticles with distinct dimensions, as well as microrobots integrated with four distinct functional materials, achieving multimodal locomotion powered by different external stimuli.

 The Stoner–Wohlfarth antiferromagnet (AFM), an extension of the classical Stoner–Wohlfarth model originally describing the magnetization reversal in ferromagnetic nanoparticles1,2, refers to a single-domain AFM whose Néel vector can be coherently switched by the magnetic field. These AFMs not only retain the inherent advantages of antiferromagnetism but also feature controllable Néel vector and a perfect switching ratio, thus emerging as promising building blocks for ultradense magnetic memories and high-throughput computing systems3,4. However, bulk AFMs are not the Stoner–Wohlfarth AFMs owing to the hard-to-switch Néel vector and inevitable multidomain structure3,5–7. Here we report that CrPS4, a two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) A-type AFM, exhibits ideal characteristics of the Stoner–Wohlfarth AFMs, because of the dominance of antiferromagnetic exchange over the magnetic anisotropy and high quality of vdW interfaces. The antiferromagnetic order undergoes a ferromagnet (FM)-like binary switching with the magnetic field rather than the layer-by-layer flipping observed in other 2D A-type AFMs. Moreover, we deduce the characteristic exchange length of several vdW A-type AFMs and propose a criterion for judging the Stoner–Wohlfarth AFMs. Our work therefore establishes a universal framework for understanding the magnetization reversal in layered AFMs and promotes the effective use of 2D AFMs in advanced spintronic devices. CrPS4, a 2D van der Waals A-type antiferromagnet, is shown to exhibit ideal characteristics of Stoner–Wohlfarth antiferromagnets, such as ferromagnet-like binary switching rather than layer-by-layer flipping as in other 2D A-type antiferromagnets."

Our circuits can perform 1010 fixed and random multiplications without error, withstand over 40,000 bending cycles and maintain stable performance for a period exceeding 6 months.

 Controlling quantum matter with light offers a promising route to dynamically tune its many-body properties, ranging from band topology1,2 to superconductivity3. However, achieving such optical control for strongly correlated electron systems in the steady state has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate optical switching of the spin–valley degree of freedom of itinerant ferromagnets in twisted MoTe2 (t-MoTe2) homobilayers. This system uniquely features flat valley-contrasting Chern bands and exhibits a range of strongly correlated phases at various moiré lattice fillings, including Chern insulators and ferromagnetic metals4–7. We show that the spin–valley orientation of all of these phases can be dynamically reversed by resonantly exciting the exciton–polaron8 transitions with circularly polarized light. These findings not only provide direct evidence for non-thermal optical switching of a ferromagnetic spin state at zero magnetic field but also demonstrate the possibility of dynamical control over a topological order parameter, paving the way for optical generation of chiral edge modes and topological quantum circuits. Optical spin orientation of itinerant ferromagnets in twisted MoTe2 homobilayers is demonstrated, enabling control of topological Chern numbers with circularly polarized light."

 Galaxy clusters, the Universe’s largest halo structures, are filled with an X-ray-emitting gas with a temperature between 10 million and 100 million degrees. Their evolution is shaped by energetic processes such as feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and mergers with other cosmic structures1–3. The imprints of these processes on gas kinematics remain largely unknown, restricting our understanding of energy conversion within clusters4. High-resolution spectral mapping with the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) observatory5 offers a way forward6,7. Here we present XRISM kinematic measurements of the Perseus cluster, radially covering the extent of its cool core. We find direct evidence for at least two dominant drivers of gas motions operating on distinct physical scales: a small-scale driver in the inner approximately 60 kpc, probably associated with the SMBH feedback; and a large-scale driver in the outer core, powered by mergers. This finding suggests that, during the active phase, SMBH feedback drives gas motions, which, if fully dissipated into heat, could have a substantial role in offsetting radiative cooling losses in the Perseus core. Our study underscores the necessity of kinematic mapping observations of extended sources to robustly characterize the velocity fields and their role in the evolution of massive halos. It further offers a kinematic diagnostic for SMBH feedback models. Kinematic measurements of the Perseus galaxy cluster reveal two drivers of gas motions: a small-scale driver in the inner core associated with black-hole feedback and a large-scale driver in the outer core powered by mergers."

 How brain circuits are organized to skillfully produce learned sequences of behaviours is still poorly understood. Here we functionally examined how the cortical song premotor region HVC, which is necessary for zebra finch song1, controls the sequential production of learned song syllables. We found that HVC could generate the complete sequence of learned song syllables independently of its main synaptic input pathways. Thalamic input to HVC was needed for song initiation, but it was not required for transitions between syllables or for song completion. We showed that excitation of HVC neurons during song reliably caused vocalizations to skip back to the beginning of the song, in a manner reminiscent of a skipping record. This restarting of syllable sequences could be induced at any moment of the song and relied on local circuits within HVC. We identified and computationally modelled a synaptic network, including intratelencephalic premotor and corticostriatal neurons within HVC that are essential for completing song syllable sequences. Together, our results show that the learned zebra finch song is controlled by a cortical sequence-generating network in HVC that, once started, can sustain production of all song syllables independent of major extrinsic input pathways. Thus, sequential neuronal activity can be organized to fuse well-learned vocal motor sequences, ultimately achieving holistic control of this naturally learned behaviour. A cortical premotor network in HVC, once initiated, can sustain and regulate the sequential production of zebra finch song syllables without major extrinsic inputs."

 Benchmarks are important tools for tracking the rapid advancements in large language model (LLM) capabilities. However, benchmarks are not keeping pace in difficulty: LLMs now achieve more than 90% accuracy on popular benchmarks such as Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding1, limiting informed measurement of state-of-the-art LLM capabilities. Here, in response, we introduce Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE), a multi-modal benchmark at the frontier of human knowledge, designed to be an expert-level closed-ended academic benchmark with broad subject coverage. HLE consists of 2,500 questions across dozens of subjects, including mathematics, humanities and the natural sciences. HLE is developed globally by subject-matter experts and consists of multiple-choice and short-answer questions suitable for automated grading. Each question has a known solution that is unambiguous and easily verifiable but cannot be quickly answered by internet retrieval. State-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate low accuracy and calibration on HLE, highlighting a marked gap between current LLM capabilities and the expert human frontier on closed-ended academic questions. To inform research and policymaking upon a clear understanding of model capabilities, we publicly release HLE at

Flynn,GlycoRNA complexed with heparan sulfate regulates VEGF-A signalling,"Heparan sulfate proteoglycans facilitate the assembly of clusters of glycoRNAs and cell surface RNA-binding proteins, which negatively modulate VEGF-A signalling and angiogenesis. 
 Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) have been recognized as key plasma membrane-tethered co-receptors for a broad range of growth factors and cytokines containing cationic heparan-binding domains1,2. However, how HSPGs mechanistically mediate signalling at the cell surface—particularly in the context of cell surface RNA—remain poorly understood. During developmental and disease processes, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), a heparan sulfate-binding factor, regulates endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis3. The regulatory paradigm for endothelial cell-mediated selectively of VEGF-A binding and activity has largely been focused on understanding the selective sulfation of the anionic heparan sulfate chains4–8. Here we examine the organizational rules of a new class of anionic cell surface conjugates, glycoRNAs9,10, and cell surface RNA-binding proteins (csRBPs11,12). Leveraging genome-scale knockout screens, we discovered that heparan sulfate biosynthesis and specifically the 6-O-sulfated forms of heparan sulfate chains are critical for the assembly of clusters of glycoRNAs and csRBPs (cell surface ribonucleoproteins (csRNPs)). Mechanistically, we show that these clusters antagonize heparan sulfate-mediated activation of ERK signalling downstream of VEGF-A. We demonstrate that the heparan sulfate-binding domain of VEGF-A165 is responsible for binding RNA, and that disrupting this interaction enhances ERK signalling and impairs vascular development both in vitro and in vivo and is conserved across species. Our study thus uncovers a previously unrecognized regulatory axis by which csRNPs negatively modulate heparan sulfate-mediated signalling in the context of angiogenesis driven by VEGF-A. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans facilitate the assembly of clusters of glycoRNAs and cell surface RNA-binding proteins, which negatively modulate VEGF-A signalling and angiogenesis."

Tanenbaum,Pre-assembly of biomolecular condensate seeds drives RSV replication,"Viral ribonucleoprotein–viral protein networks form pre-replication centres that nucleate viral factories and drive respiratory syncytial virus replication. 
 During infection, many RNA viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), form specialized biomolecular condensates, viral factories (VFs), where viral transcription and replication occur1,2. Paradoxically, high protein concentrations are typically required for condensate nucleation3, yet attaining sufficient protein levels in infection is thought to require VFs for viral transcription and replication. Here, to uncover how viruses solve this paradox to establish VFs, we visualized early infection of RSV in real time with single genomic viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) resolution. Our results reveal that VFs are nucleated from infecting vRNPs rather than de novo in the cytoplasm. VF nucleation further requires in-virion pre-assembly of viral protein–protein interaction networks on vRNPs to form ‘pre-replication centres’ (PRCs). PRCs are potent condensate nucleation seeds due to their efficient recruitment and retention of viral proteins. The high affinity of PRCs also results in increased association of the viral polymerase and its co-factors, allowing efficient viral transcription even in the absence of VFs. Together, these activities create a feed-forward loop that drives rapid VF formation. PRC assembly depends on in-virion viral protein levels and is highly heterogeneous among virions, explaining cell-to-cell heterogeneity in infection progression, and identifying heterogeneous virions as an important origin of infection heterogeneity. Together, our results show that in-virion pre-assembly of PRCs kick-starts viral condensate nucleation upon host-cell entry and explains cell-to-cell heterogeneity in RSV infection. Viral ribonucleoprotein–viral protein networks form pre-replication centres that nucleate viral factories and drive respiratory syncytial virus replication."

 Bile acid and steroid hormone homeostasis are critical for human health, with disruptions linked to metabolic and endocrine disorders1,2. The organic solute transporter Ostα/β, essential for bile acid efflux in enterohepatic circulation3, has long defied mechanistic elucidation. Here we present cryogenic electron microscopy structures of human Ostα/β in apo and substrate-bound states at 2.6–3.1 Å resolution, revealing a distinctive membrane protein architecture that defines a new transporter class. Ostα/β forms a symmetric tetramer of heterodimers, with each Ostα subunit showing a new seven-transmembrane fold, augmented by a single transmembrane helix of Ostβ. This architecture is stabilized by extensive lipid modifications, including a palmitoylated cysteine-rich motif that forms a lateral substrate-binding groove. The structures uncover a unique transport pathway featuring two substrate-binding sites connected by an amphipathic helix-gated conduit. This design, conserved in the evolutionarily related TMEM184 family, suggests an ancient mechanism for substrate translocation. Electrophysiological studies demonstrate voltage-sensitive, bidirectional transport driven by electrochemical gradients, elucidating the efflux role of Ostα/β in vivo. Lipid interactions, notably palmitoylation-dependent trafficking, emerge as critical for stability and function. These findings clarify the molecular mechanism of Ostα/β, provide a structural basis for disease-associated mutations4,5 and establish a paradigm for lipid-modified membrane transport. Cryogenic electron microscopy structures of human Ostα/β uncover a unique transport pathway featuring two substrate-binding sites connected by an amphipathic helix-gated conduit, and electrophysiological studies demonstrate voltage-sensitive, bidirectional transport, showing its efflux role in vivo."

Theoretical works have proposed that interactions could drive the BEC ground state into another exotic phase that simultaneously exhibits properties of both a crystalline solid and a superfluid—termed a supersolid5–8. Identifying a material system, however, that hosts the predicted BEC solid phase, driven purely by interactions and without imposing an external lattice potential, has remained unknown9–11. Here we report observation of a superfluid-to-insulator transition in the layer-imbalanced regime of bilayer magnetoexcitons. Mapping the transport behaviour of the bilayer condensate as a function of density and temperature suggests that the insulating phase is an ordered state of dilute excitons, stabilized by dipole interactions. The insulator melts into a recovered superfluid on increasing the temperature, which could indicate that the low-temperature solid is also a quantum coherent phase. Transition of superfluid to insulator is observed in the layer-imbalanced regime of bilayer magnetoexcitons."

 Optical control offers a non-contact, high-precision and ultrafast route to manipulating quantum material properties1–5. Fractional Chern ferromagnetic states in moiré superlattices are a promising platform by which to pursue topological quantum computing6–10, but an effective optical control protocol has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate robust optical switching of integer and fractional Chern ferromagnets in twisted molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2) bilayers using continuous-wave circularly polarized light. Highly efficient optical manipulation of spin orientations in the topological ferromagnet regime is realized at zero field using a pump light power as low as 28 nW µm−2. Using this optically induced transition, we also demonstrate magnetic bistate cycling and spatially resolved writing of ferromagnetic domain walls. This work establishes a reliable and efficient optical control scheme for moiré Chern ferromagnets, paving the way for dissipationless spintronics and quantized Chern junction devices.

Liberles,Vagal blood volume receptors compensate for haemorrhage and posture change,"A vagal reflex to blood volume changes in the heart involves PIEZO2 and helps to stabilize blood pressure in an upright posture and after blood loss. 
 Cranial nerves densely innervate the heart and vasculature, with sensory neurons reporting on blood pressure, respiratory gases and tissue damage1. The roles of arterial baroreceptors in systemic physiology are well appreciated2, but the functions of vagal cardiac mechanoreceptors have been more difficult to parse, in part due to the closed-loop structure of the cardiovascular system. Here we use genetic tools in mice to identify a small group of neurons that are acutely sensitive to circulating blood volume and initiate a reflex that compensates for decreased filling of the heart in an upright posture and haemorrhage. Vagal PIEZO2 neurons form characteristic end-net endings in the heart, lower blood pressure in response to optogenetic stimulation and display blood-volume-dependent responses with every heartbeat that are time-locked to atrial and ventricular systole. Knockout of Piezo2 and/or ablation of PIEZO2 neurons in vagal ganglia eliminates this heartbeat-coupled nerve activity, causes orthostatic hypotension and compromises cardiovascular stability during trauma-induced blood loss. Together, these findings demonstrate that vagal mechanoreceptors monitor the cardiac cycle and initiate a blood-volume-dependent reflex that defends the constancy of circulation.

 Bile acids (BAs) are crucial amphipathic surfactants that function as multifaceted regulators in various physiological processes, including nutrient absorption and distribution, lipid metabolism and inflammation1,2. The human organic solute transporter αβ (OSTα–OSTβ; hereafter referred to as OSTα/β) is a BA transporter that has a key role in the secretion and distribution of BAs3–6. Pathogenic mutations in OSTα/β have been associated with cholestasis7,8. Despite the functional importance of OSTα/β in BA homeostasis, the stoichiometry and assembly of the complex and the molecular mechanism that underlies BA transport by OSTα/β remain unknown. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of human OSTα/β in complex with cholesterols and an endogenous substrate, elucidating the structural basis for the function of OSTα/β. OSTα/β is assembled in a novel dimer-of-heterodimers manner: two OSTα units form the homodimeric core, with two OSTβ units bound to the periphery. OSTα adopts the G-protein-coupled-receptor (GPCR) fold and contains a unique cysteine-rich loop with seven palmitoylation sites; these cooperate with transmembrane helices 5 and 6, constituting a BA recognition site. A positive cavity in OSTα connects the BA site and facilitates the transmembrane translocation of BAs through OSTα/β. Together, this study reveals the architecture and transport mechanism of OSTα/β and provides insights into the structure–function relationships of this crucial transporter in BA homeostasis.

 Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) with high global warming potential are regulated under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. While China began freezing production and consumption of HFCs in 2024, there are discrepancies among previous activity-based bottom-up emissions estimates and lack of observation-based inverse modelling emissions estimates of China’s HFC emissions since 2017. Here we use atmospheric observations across China and inverse modelling to reveal distinct emissions trends of nine HFCs from 2011 to 2021 in China. Our top-down emissions estimates reveal an overestimation of HFC emissions post-2017 by an average of 117.2 Tg CO2-equivalent per year, by China’s national official bottom-up emissions inventories. Also, we find that while eastern China is the largest emitter of HFCs in China (37.4% CO2-equivalent), non-eastern China contributed to national emissions (62.6%). Lastly, we show that non-Annex I countries (mostly developing countries under the UN climate framework) excluding China accounted for 61.3% of the global HFC emissions growth during 2011–2020, far surpassing contributions from Annex I countries (23.9%) and China (14.8%).

Here, the authors uncover a Crinkler‑derived genomic parasite that ADP‑ribosylates EZH2 and TRAF6 to evade epigenetic silencing and immune detection, revealing an evolutionary role for toxin‑derived proteins. 
 Crinkler effectors are iconic toxins deployed by pathogens to suppress host immunity, a function long thought exclusive to pathogenic species. Here, we uncover a striking evolutionary twist: an ADP-ribosyltransferase-associated Crinkler-like protein that has repurposed its toxin-derived activity to function as an epigenetic parasite in free-living eukaryotes, challenging the paradigm that Crinkler effectors are exclusively pathogen-restricted virulence factors. The ADP-ribosyltransferase-associated Crinkler-like protein retains a functional mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase domain homologous to diphtheria toxin, yet exhibits degeneration of N-terminal host-targeting domain, severing ties to canonical pathogenic functions. This activity enables dual subversion of host mechanisms: the ADP-ribosyltransferase-associated Crinkler-like protein mono-ADP-ribosylates the EZH2, reducing H3K27me3-mediated silencing and reactivating its own locus and adjacent transposons to drive replicative amplification; simultaneously, it modifies the immune adaptor TRAF6, suppressing NF-κB and IRF3 pathways to weaken innate immune surveillance and facilitate sustained propagation within the host genome. Notably, this parasitic strategy is countered by host detoxification: TRAF6 ubiquitinates ADP-ribosyltransferase-associated Crinkler-like protein, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Together, our findings reveal how a toxin-derived effector escaped pathogenic contexts to evolve as a selfish genomic element, leveraging toxin-like activity to subvert epigenetic and immune barriers and redefining the evolutionary potential of Crinkler toxins as drivers of genomic conflict beyond pathogenicity.

 Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains refractory to most immunotherapies, with cancer vaccines failing due to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Here, we show that β-glucan–induced trained immunity overcomes these barriers by reprogramming macrophages through H3K4me3-dependent epigenetic modifications and metabolic rewiring. In female mice vaccinated with peptide-coated adenovirus-based vaccine PeptiCrad, training enhances glycolysis with creatine metabolism sustaining CXCL9/10 production, enabling macrophages to recruit NK cells via CXCR3. In turn, NK cells produce CCL5, driving cDC1 infiltration and antigen presentation, which together amplify effector memory CD8⁺ T cell responses. Moreover, with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CRC patient-derived organoids, trained macrophages boost NK migration, antigen-specific T cell activation, and tumor killing. These findings highlight trained immunity as a powerful adjuvant to reinvigorate colorectal cancer vaccination.

Here, the authors report the application of inorganic selenium molecules as a lithographic mediator and encapsulation layer during the processing of various sensitive materials, such as perovskites and black phosphorus. 
 Lithography is pivotal in fabricating micro/nanoscale patterns and processing materials for electronic microdevices. However, conventional organic polymeric resists inevitably entail the use of various chemical solutions or solvents, which especially compromise fragile electronic materials featuring atomic-level surfaces. Here, we introduce inorganic selenium molecules as a lithographic mediator for sensitive electronic material processing without direct exposure to solutions or solvents. Specifically, the inorganic selenium molecular film functions as both a lithographic mediator for direct patterning due to its weak intermolecular van der Waals interactions and as a protective encapsulation layer for atomic electronic materials without compromising structural and electronic characteristics. Wafer-scale arrays of sensitive materials with high-quality, sharp edges are facilely achieved by a non-destructive mechanical peeling of the selenium layer. This approach provides a solvent-free lithographic route for microfabricating sensitive materials and high-performance electronic devices. Conventional organic polymeric resists and chemical solutions used in microlithographic techniques can damage sensitive materials. Here, the authors report the application of inorganic selenium molecules as a lithographic mediator and encapsulation layer during the processing of various sensitive materials, such as perovskites and black phosphorus."

 Navigational contrail avoidance presents an opportunity for rapid reduction in aviation-attributable warming. Here, we use the Aviation Climate and Air Quality Impacts model to evaluate the global temperature changes associated with contrail avoidance towards 2050. If no avoidance is adopted, aviation is projected to contribute 0.040 K of CO2 warming and 0.054 K of contrail warming by 2050. The combined warming from aviation CO2 and contrails is 19% of the difference between current temperatures and the +2 °C limit above pre-Industrial levels, i.e. 19% of our remaining temperature budget. An avoidance strategy phased in over 2035-2045 may recover 9% of this budget, but a 10-year delay may reduce this to 2%. The warming due to additional CO2 emitted during avoidance is two orders of magnitude lower than the expected contrail warming reduction. For every year of delay, the world will be on average 0.003 K hotter in 2050. The most significant climate risk associated with contrail avoidance is therefore inaction. This study shows that contrail avoidance can recover 9% of the global temperature budget by 2050. For every year of delay, the recoverable warming will diminish by 0.6%.

Here, the authors show that the intervention is cost effective, with greater benefits for more socially vulnerable groups. 
 Despite proven oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) efficacy, adherence barriers among men who have sex with men (MSM) persist. Economic viability of digital adherence tools in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) requires validation. We assessed the 6-month within-trial cost-effectiveness of a digital intervention for real-time enhancement of oral PrEP adherence (DIRECT-PrEP) in China, from health system, multipayer, and societal perspectives. Costs were derived from hospital records, and effectiveness was evaluated using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and PrEP-adherence days (PADs). Among 442 participants (247 intervention, 195 standard care), incremental costs per QALY gained for the smart pillbox intervention were $19,575.93 (health system), $19,656.66 (multipayer), and $19,844.42 (societal)—all below the cost-effectiveness threshold of three times per capita gross domestic product ($31,200). Costs per PAD gained were $30.46–$30.86, achieving >95% probability of cost-effectiveness at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $47.50–$48.50 per PAD. Notably, the intervention demonstrated greater cost-effectiveness per QALY among participants stratified as more socially vulnerable ($16,259.77–$16,490.41) compared with those classified as less socially vulnerable ($23,514.83–$23,834.38). These results establish the smart-pillbox digital intervention as a cost-effective strategy for oral PrEP adherence within primary healthcare settings in LMICs, particularly when prioritizing more socially vulnerable populations, though long-term scalability requires further validation.

 Time-multiplexed networks of degenerate optical parametric oscillators have demonstrated remarkable success in simulating coupled Ising spins, thus providing a promising route to solving complex combinatorial optimization problems. In these systems, referred to as coherent Ising machines, spins are encoded in the oscillator phases, and measured at the system output using phase-sensitive techniques, making intricate phase stabilization necessary. Here, we introduce an optical Ising machine based on spontaneous polarization symmetry breaking in a coherently driven fiber Kerr nonlinear resonator. In our architecture, the spins are encoded in the polarization state, allowing robust, all-intensity readout with off-the-shelf telecom components. By operating in a newly-discovered regime where nonlinearity and topology lock the system’s symmetry, we eliminate drift and bias, enabling uninterrupted Ising trials at optical speeds for over an hour, without manual intervention. This all-fiber platform not only simplifies the hardware but also opens a path to more stable, high-throughput coherent optical optimization devices for applications from finance to drug design and beyond.

Optimizing technology mixes is now shown to limit the supply-constrained energy transition metals to only copper, lithium, and vanadium, though economy-wide resource sobriety remains urgent. 
 A successful energy transition is crucial for mitigating climate change but may be hindered by bottlenecks in the availability of critical metals. The energy transition scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change overlook such risks, proposing energy and transport pathways deemed unrealistic by past studies. Yet by relying on fixed market shares, those studies ignore the market’s ability to shift towards a (sub)technological mix requiring fewer supply-constrained metals. Here, for the most stringent decarbonization scenarios, we show that an optimized technology mix trims the list of metals constrained by mining capacities from 13 to copper, lithium and vanadium only. Key levers include substituting silver and gallium in solar technologies, prioritizing gearbox wind turbines and induction-motor electric vehicles without permanent magnets, and replacing part of the grid’s copper with aluminium. Sixteen other metals remain under pressure, but because over 90% of their demand stems from sectors outside the energy transition, our results underscore the need for economy-wide metallic sobriety. Metals shortage threatens climate goals by affecting adoption of key technologies for the energy transition.

 In contrast to global warming trends, much of Eurasia experienced a winter cooling trend over 1990–2014. Some studies have proposed a causal link between this regional cooling, particularly strong over Siberia, to coincident reductions in Arctic sea-ice extent. However, free-running historical climate models overwhelmingly simulate a forced Eurasian warming signal, leading other studies to suggest that internal variability explains the observed cooling. Here, we use retrospective seasonal climate predictions to highlight a robust dynamical link between Siberian cooling and upstream north-east Atlantic atmospheric circulation changes. Examining the interannual predictability of these circulation patterns, we find spuriously weak but skilful model signals. When these weak dynamical signals are corrected, stronger low-frequency variability in downstream Siberian temperature also emerges, with half of the observed 1990–2014 cooling simulated. Our results suggest that Eurasian decadal climate variability is at least partly driven by a predictable atmospheric circulation response to slowly evolving boundary conditions."

 Global climate models project that the South Pacific will be a hotspot for some of the largest atmospheric river (AR) changes. Thus, there is an urgent need to review both historical trends and updated high-resolution climate projections tailored to this region. Here we show that significant trends in AR frequency from reanalysis are mostly still constrained to the ocean (~45–60°S). For landfalling ARs, trends in synoptic-scale features are not yet considered robust, whereas percentile-based moisture transports show stronger increases over parts of southern New Zealand and Tasmania. Furthermore, high-resolution downscaled climate projections indicate that landfalling AR trends should become much more widespread and robustly detectable (5 of 6 models) in the next 10–20 years, first appearing across regions of southern New Zealand during spring and winter. Even under a moderate emissions scenario, projections indicate that the frequency of extreme landfalling ARs could double before mid-century, carrying significant societal impacts."

 It remains uncertain whether precipitation oxygen isotopes (δ18O) reliably capture East Asian Meiyu monsoon variability. Analyzing daily δ18O across the Yangtze-Huai River Basin from 28-34°N, we reveal a distinct spatial dichotomy. In the middle and northern Meiyu regions, δ18O robustly tracks Meiyu precipitation. Conversely, the southern Meiyu margin is decoupled from Meiyu variability, primarily reflecting upstream convection processes further south. We identify the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) as the central driver, creating a dynamic dipole: its northwestward extension enhances moisture transport and deep convection along its northwestern flank (driving isotopic depletion in the northern Meiyu region), while imposing subsidence and convective inhibition under its body (suppressing isotopic depletion in the southern Meiyu region). Importantly, these mechanisms persist on interannual timescales. Consequently, while northern δ18O records effectively capture Meiyu variability, southern records reflect distinct vertical constraints, necessitating spatially differentiated paleoclimate interpretations."

 Ancient basement faults within plate interiors may be reactivated by external forces, generating intraplate seismicity. However, the driving mechanisms remain unclear. The 2017 Changdao earthquake swarm in the Bohai Bay Basin, eastern China, provides an opportunity to investigate such processes. A high-resolution earthquake catalog, constructed using matched filter detection and waveform-based relocation, reveals that the swarm occurred at 7-13 km depth along an X-shaped fault network, with migration following sqrt(t) diffusion (D = 0.08 – 1.2 m² s-1). High b-values and external forcing rate, and substantial isotropic components (13-38%) in the moment tensors indicate fluid involvement. Combined with low VP/VS ratios and proximity to CO2-rich hydrocarbon fields, we propose a fault-valve model where highly compressible fluids episodically breach fault intersections, triggering transient crack opening and swarm migration. This study reveals how deep fluids reactivate ancient basement faults in intraplate regions, and provides new insights for seismic hazard assessment in hydrocarbon-bearing basins.

 The bioavailability of iron from different sources to phytoplankton, driving substantial carbon dioxide uptake of the large blooms downstream of South Georgia Island, remains unknown. Although geochemical characterization suggests that iron from glacial meltwater and groundwater is bioavailable, phytoplankton iron uptake measurements are lacking. In this study, additional to assessing iron chemical speciation and weathering processes, iron-55 uptake by a natural phytoplankton community was quantified in seawater sampled from low and high chlorophyll waters around South Georgia, to which iron from nearshore sources (glacial meltwater and groundwater) was added. Iron bioavailability depended on the chemistry of the fertilized seawater and the chemical composition of the source itself. Aggregation of dissolved organic matter in high chlorophyll water scavenged dissolved iron, making it unavailable to phytoplankton. In low chlorophyll water, as opposed to iron from groundwater, iron from glacial meltwater was bioavailable to phytoplankton and would increase carbon dioxide fixation by 80-100%.

 The 2025 Myanmar earthquake caused heavy casualties and economic losses in Myanmar and surrounding regions. The mechanism of the unexpectedly long rupture and the effect of sediments on its rupture dynamics remain unclear. Here we integrate seismic and geodetic observations with kinematic inversions and dynamic rupture simulations, revealing that the rupture extended ~450 km with a maximum slip of 6.9 m concentrated within the top 10 km of the upper crust. The rupture propagated ~70 km northward (subshear to supershear) and ~380 km southward (subshear to supershear and back to subshear). The long southward-propagating supershear rupture created a highly energetic front that resulted in an unexpectedly long surface rupture. Moreover, we find the coexistence of shallow subshear and deep supershear around station NPW due to the influence of sediments. Our results highlight the importance of combining data-driven inversions and physics-based modeling to decipher the rupture dynamics of large earthquakes.

 Climate models are increasingly used to inform water availability projections at regional scales. However, the models’ own runoff sensitivities—the change in runoff per unit change of precipitation or temperature—are often biased, which can degrade their projections of runoff change. Specifically, models tend to underestimate the runoff decline in response to a temperature increase. Here, we conduct a comprehensive analysis with multiple observational datasets, two climate model generations, and large ensemble sampling of internal climate variability to assess these biases and to constrain future runoff projections across major river basins globally. For basins that can be robustly constrained by available observations, the constraint indicates stronger runoff declines than raw model projections. The constrained projections thus indicate more severe impacts of climate change on water resources than indicated by direct climate model output.

 Accurate quantification of carbon dioxide emissions is crucial for addressing climate change. However, traditional top-down CO2 estimates are limited by sparse satellite observations and coarse temporal resolution. Although NO2 data from polar-orbiting satellites can help constrain CO2 emissions, temporal mismatch with OCO-3 measurements introduce additional uncertainty. To address this, we estimate hourly CO2 emissions by combining OCO-3 XCO2 observations with high temporal resolution NO2 data from the GEMS instrument onboard the GEO-KOMPSAT-2B satellite. We developed an algorithm based on a Gaussian plume model and wind rotation techniques to estimate CO2 emissions and NOx/CO2 emission ratios from near-synchronous NO2/CO2 observations. Hourly CO2 emissions were further derived using GEMS-based NOx emissions estimated via the flux divergence method. A total of 59 power plant cases across six Asian countries were identified. For these cases, the estimated CO2 emissions exhibit distinct diurnal, seasonal, and interannual emission variability, primarily driven by heating demand, decarbonization measures, and pandemic-related industrial slowdowns. These top-down estimates, constrained by GEMS NO2 data, show strong consistency with bottom-up inventories (R = 0.89), supporting the validity of our optimization approach. Furthermore, comparisons with daytime mean estimates suggest that CO2 emission estimates constrained by polar-orbiting satellite observations can exhibit biases of approximately 60% relative to GEO-based approaches, underscoring the importance for high-temporal-resolution measurements. This study highlights the value of integrating geostationary NO2 and CO2 observations to capture the diurnal dynamics of power plant emissions and improve the accuracy of top-down CO2 emission monitoring."

 Accurate tree volume and structure are crucial for forest biomass estimation and ecosystem investigations. While terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) offers non-destructive pathways for the detailed three-dimensional tree reconstruction, current methods overestimate small branch volumes and often require tree segmentation and leaf–wood separation as a priori. This study introduces and validates RayExtract, a novel method for reconstructing woody volume from TLS data, utilising tools from the RayCloudTools library, to automate the extraction of tree structural metrics from point clouds. Our method incorporates two key morphological rules — Self-Similarity and Leonardo’s Rule — to aid branch radius and taper calculations. Likewise, it enables rapid and automated plot-scale reconstruction by integrating tree segmentation and woody structure modelling without requiring leaf point classification. In this study, RayExtract demonstrated high accuracy across four high-quality destructive harvest reference sets with concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) values ranging from 0.82 to 0.97 (n=124). To explore algorithm behaviours under different leaf conditions and point densities, we implement a framework using TLS simulation of highly realistic synthetic trees. Results from the simulation framework show consistent high accuracy of total woody volume, with CCC ranging from 0.97 to 0.98 (n=18) across four distinct scanning configurations. Fine-scale volumetric analysis revealed that incorporating simple morphological rules can effectively inform branch taper and reduce woody volume overestimation, particularly in smaller components. Furthermore, it identifies a limitation in volumetric accuracy in trees exhibiting significant taper in the lower stem. Analysis of RayExtract’s computational efficiency demonstrates that runtime and memory usage scale predictably with input data size, primarily driven by point count and the associated structural complexity within the point cloud, positioning the algorithm as well suited for large-scale applications. RayExtract represents a significant advancement in forest reconstruction, biomass estimation, and vegetation structural analysis. The method’s efficiency, accuracy, and robustness across varied forest conditions mark a substantial improvement in forest structural assessment techniques using laser scanning and have broad implications for improving regional biomass estimations, and contributing to the calibration and validation of broad-scale remote sensing observations."

 Timely crop mapping is crucial for field management, policy formulation, phenological monitoring, and yield forecasting. However, acquiring sufficient labeled samples in the current year presents a formidable challenge for in-season mapping. Previously proposed solutions mainly include classifier transfer and sample transfer strategies. The classifier transfer strategy trains classifiers with historical samples associated with historical-year features and then transfers the trained historical sample classifiers (HSC) to classify remote sensing data in the current year; the sample transfer strategy generates trusted samples associated with current-year remote sensing features by predicting labels of the current-year sample based on some prior knowledge (e.g., crop rotation pattern) and then trains trusted sample classifiers (TSC) for current-year classification. However, the performance of the classifier-transfer strategy may degrade when there is large interannual feature variation, while the performance of the sample-transfer strategy depends on the reliability of the generated trusted samples. This study proposes a novel approach that integrates the above two strategies for in-season mapping through a sample weighting technique. Firstly, two sample sets, trusted samples and classified samples associated with current-year features, are generated by crop rotation prediction and HSC, respectively. Subsequently, based on an independent assumption between the rotational prediction errors and the current-year remote sensing features, the optimal weights of these two sample sets are derived based on the Bayesian principle. Finally, an optimal weighted sample classifier (OWSC) is trained using the weighted samples for in-season classification. To illustrate the robustness of the proposed OWSC, we compared it with different methods combined with various classification models across four regions with different interannual feature variation and crop rotation stability. Results demonstrated that OWSC maintained its advantages across various regions and different available lengths of historical crop-type sequences. Owing to its independence from specific classifiers, the proposed sample weighting method can be seamlessly applied to any classification model and thus continues to benefit from advances in classification algorithms. Additionally, sensitivity experiments regarding the uncertainty in trusted samples and historical crop-type sequences showed that OWSC performed stably across different scenarios. Therefore, OWSC provides a promising solution for in-season crop mapping without current-year samples."

 Eucalyptus plantations, characterized by uniform stand structure and relatively sparse foliage, are highly susceptible to typhoon damage, which poses substantial economic risks to forestry operations and undermines regional ecosystem stability in southern China. This study focuses on windthrown eucalyptus forests in Shangsi and Bobai Counties, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, following Typhoons Ma-on and TALIM . We developed a specialized UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) based deep learning dataset and proposed a novel segmentation model, GIBN-Net, which incorporates an asymmetric global attention module to enhance feature extraction. Evaluation results, including ablation and comparative experiments, show that GIBN-Net outperforms mainstream models, achieving optimal accuracy (OA: 0.9405, Precision: 0.8879, Recall: 0.9105, IoU: 0.8248, F1-Score: 0.8722). The study also revealed that tailored preprocessing strategies significantly improved boundary detection, while simple stacking of the UAV-derived DSM with RGB imagery led to a decrease in model accuracy. This research is the first to develop a dedicated dataset and an optimized deep learning model for typhoon-damaged eucalyptus detection in southern China. The GIBN-Net model is capable of detecting wind damage in eucalyptus forests more accurately and efficiently in complex forest environments. The dedicated dataset, combined with spatial context information, improves boundary accuracy and facilitates faster damage mapping. This study enables rapid, large-scale, and automated assessment of typhoon-induced damage in eucalyptus plantations, thereby providing actionable insights for insurance claim verification, post-disaster resource allocation, and ecological restoration planning.

 In the era of embodied intelligence, wearable datasets for pedestrian navigation are essential. However, publicly available multisensory datasets tailored to such scenarios remain scarce. Traditional sensors such as RGB cameras and LiDAR often struggle to capture the fast and irregular dynamics of human motion.

The dataset includes event camera, RGB cameras, LiDAR sensors, a tactical-grade IMU, and GNSS, covering a wide range of indoor and outdoor environments with diverse motion types and illumination conditions. High-precision ground truth is obtained using motion capture systems indoors and GNSS/IMU integration with bidirectional smoothing outdoors. The dataset is structured into 23 subsets categorized by motion dynamics and lighting, supporting the development and evaluation of robust localization and SLAM algorithms. Benchmarking with state-of-the-art frameworks reveals notable performance degradation under highly dynamic or low-light conditions, highlighting the dataset’s value for advancing pedestrian navigation and event-based perception.

 Climate conditions such as the dynamics of temperature and precipitation significantly influence agricultural production. Therefore, the climate-induced agricultural economic consequences cannot be neglected. This study employs machine learning models with time series climate data, a panel of state-by-year total factor productivity estimates (1960–2004) for 48 contiguous states of the United States (U.S.), and the yield data for corn and soybean (1960–2020) in the main producing states to quantify the potential climatic effects on U.S. agricultural productivity under different climate scenarios. The results show that the climate change impacts are spatially heterogeneous under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 climate change scenarios from 2020 to 2050. However, the effects on future agricultural productivity are consistently negative regardless of the region. The negative climatic effects on productivity growth will offset the advancements of U.S. agricultural productivity after 5–25 years under various climate change scenarios assuming the same advancement rates as the past. The predictions of the impacts could advance our understanding of future productivity growth in U.S. agriculture under climate change. The analysis results could also shed light on policy planning to mitigate various effects and threats to food security due to the changing climate."

 For routine road maintenance, accurate and efficient crack detection holds significant research value and practical importance. With advances in computer vision, image processing-based crack detection has achieved promising results. However, in complex environments, factors such as illumination and weather introduce noise interference, especially in high-resolution crack images where fine fracture features show heightened complexity and diversity. This often leads to degraded detection accuracy in such challenging scenarios. To address this, we propose FE-SegNeXt, a convolutional neural network segmentation framework tailored for high-resolution crack detection in complex environments. The algorithm leverages distinct characteristics of high- and low-frequency features in crack images: average pooling separates these features, while a dedicated Frequency Collaborative Enhancement Module (FCEM) independently enhances high- and low-frequency components before fusing multi-band information. This design significantly improves the model’s ability to extract subtle cracks from high-resolution images under noisy conditions. Additionally, we introduce a Locally Enhanced Feed-Forward Network (LE-FFN) to amplify perception of weak crack signals in local regions, further refining fine-grained feature extraction. Experimental results on the public datasets Sun520, Rain365, and BJN260 demonstrate that the proposed method achieves F1-scores of 61.55%, 62.57%, and 60.31%, respectively, outperforming existing crack detection algorithms."

 Urban streets form the backbone of cities, and variations in street-junction spatial configuration provide valuable insights into urban form and function, both of which exhibit fractal and scaling characteristics in their structural and statistical properties. However, these patterns emerge from the interaction of multiple spatial processes operating at different scales, making it difficult to capture and compare their form-function relationships using single-scale analyses. To address this challenge, this study proposes a new α–β framework for multi-scale urban form comparison, grounded in fractal theory. Using a progressive clustering method, we construct scaling profiles for multiple cities, deriving the α (form) and β (function) parameters to systematically compare urban structures with differing morphologies and to identify urban clusters at their characteristic scales. This approach transforms the subjective perception of morphology into an actionable analytical tool, enabling integrated form-function assessment and overcoming the challenges of comparative studies from different urban systems. Overall, the proposed α–β framework effectively deconstructs urban complexity, as evidenced by its application to a comparative analysis of nine global metropolises."

However, acquiring comprehensive elevation data at global scale remains challenging, particularly for oceanic regions, with the current open-access global open DEM resolution limited to 15 arc-seconds (approximately 450 m). In order to further improve the global DEM resolution, we propose an innovative Relay Residual Diffusion Probabilistic Model (RRDPM) for DEM super-resolution tasks based on diffusion model principles. Our model achieves distribution transformation between high- and low-resolution DEMs through tens of steps. Moreover, RRDPM introduces two types of inherently indivisible sampling equations, and we prove that each of them has different advantageous positions, and integrate these advantageous positions using a “relay race” approach. In addition, we discard the conventional downsampling-super-resolution paradigm, by utilizing paired datasets of global 15 arc-second and local 3 arc-second DEMs, so that our method can be trained and tested in real-world situations. The experimental results show that the RRDPM reduces the RMSE by 20.73 % and 22.77 % for land and seabed regions, respectively, and improves the PSNR by 2.23 dB and 2.34 dB, respectively, for the same areas, representing significant advancements in the current global DEM detail recovery.

 Droplet evaporation is a fundamental process with broad implications for cloud microphysics and atmospheric chemistry. Solutes introduce non-ideal behaviour that alters the droplet's microphysical properties and reconfigures its evaporation dynamics, yet their influence remains insufficiently quantified. Using an optical tweezers system, we investigated the evaporation of droplets containing non-volatile solutes. The results reveal distinct stagewise variation in evaporation rate, driven by a gradual transition in the dominant microphysical mechanism from vapour diffusion across the gas–liquid interface to bulk-phase diffusion within the droplet. Once bulk-phase diffusion becomes dominant, the evaporation rate decreases significantly and the overall evaporation time increases, indicating that classical evaporation theory underestimates droplet lifetime by neglecting internal mass transport. A new radius–time relationship that better aligns with experimental observations is proposed and highlights the decisive role of solutes in both the initial conditions and the dynamic evolution of droplet evaporation. These findings advance our understanding of the microphysical evolution of droplet evaporation, providing a physical basis for improving the parameterisation of aerosol–cloud interactions and droplet lifetime in atmospheric models."

 Understanding the past climate variability of Greenland is vital for contextualizing its current and future changes, a purpose for which centennial-scale reanalyses provide critical support. However, the performance of centennial-scale reanalyses over Greenland remains an open question, as previous assessments have primarily focused on the post-1979 period. Therefore, we evaluated the performance on different climate variables of the Twentieth Century Reanalysis version 3 (20CR v3; 1806–2015) and the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts fifth generation reanalysis (ERA5; 1940–2015) over Greenland, based on in-situ observations and ice core records. For 2-m temperature (T2m), both reanalyses exhibited small cold biases in summer, though with a failure to capture variation patterns during this season. 20CR v3 showed dry biases in summer and wet biases in winter, while ERA5 consistently overestimated precipitation among all the seasons. Significant dry bias (<−2.5 mm) of 20CR v3 was found at southeastern coastal sites. We concluded that the elevation bias induced by the coarse resolution of 20CR v3 was one of the primary reasons for its cold and dry biases along the margin of the ice sheet. Notably, unlike ERA5, 20CR v3 failed to reproduce the observed increasing precipitation trend from 1940 to 2015 (−1.9 mm/dec vs 4.9 mm/dec, p > 0.05). Although 20CR v3 performed slightly inferior than ERA5, their consistent patterns, coupled with 20CR v3's robust performance, support the reliability of 20CR v3 for centennial-scale climate studies in Greenland."

Here, we use ERA5 reanalysis and Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) ensembles to examine the spatial distribution and long-term trends of Antarctic ARs during 1979–2022, and also investigate the mechanisms behind it by distinguishing between dynamic and thermodynamic effects. Reanalysis shows a strong increase in annual AR frequency over Dronning Maud Land (DML) in Antarctica during 1979–2022, predominantly driven by dynamical processes. Sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) strongly modulate AR intensification over DML by enhancing convection and exciting a Rossby wave train, which deepens the Weddell Sea cyclone anomaly and amplifies downstream high-pressure ridges. Fingerprinting experiments with the 50-member CESM2 ensemble confirm the pivotal role of internal Pacific variability in reproducing observed AR trends. These results highlight the importance of accurately representing SPCZ SST variability for understanding the mechanisms driving Antarctic AR changes."

Current diagnostic methods assess circulating autoantibodies, C-peptide levels, or dysglycemia, yet these approaches fail to identify β cell destruction preceding glucose dysregulation. Here, a subcutaneous microporous scaffold is used as an immunological niche (IN), which provides a nonvital accessible tissue reflecting many immune changes occurring in the pancreas. Sequencing analysis of the IN successfully delineates at-risk from nonrisk groups, as well as disease progressors from nonprogressors at 6 weeks of age in the nonobese diabetic mouse model. Within progressors, we identify disease 5 to 7 weeks before disease onset. Collectively, disease occurring in a poorly accessible site can be identified early by sampling a distant nonvital tissue, indicating the systemic nature of the disease and informing the timing of disease modifying therapies to halt or delay the progression of T1D."

We extended the generalized weighted quantile sum regression model by incorporating two-way fixed effects (gWQS-feglm) to quantify PM2.5component–attributable CVD deaths across the contiguous United States. PM2.5component–attributable CVD deaths declined from 42,200 (28,200,57,600) in 2001 to 23,500 (15,700,32,100) in 2020, driven by ammonium (NH4+) and sulfate (SO42−) reductions. In 2020, high-attributable-mortality regions remained and regional disparities in PM2.5composition pronounced, with NH4+dominant in California and the East North Central, SO42−in the South, and black carbon and SO42−in the Middle Atlantic. Racial/ethnic disparities persisted, with non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics experiencing slower attributable-mortality declines compared with non-Hispanic whites.

Among these,BIN1andRIN3have emerged as susceptibility genes, yet their functional relationship in AD remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated how BIN1 and RIN3 interaction regulates RAB5 activity and endosomal pathology. RIN3 has been shown to bind BIN1, and we previously reported that this interaction modulates amyloid-β (Aβ) precursor protein (APP) trafficking and Aβ generation in vitro. To extend these findings, we usedRin3constitutive knockout (Rin3-CKO) mice and CRISPR-Cas9–edited human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived neurons carrying eitherBIN1knockout or rare familial ADRIN3missense mutations within the BIN1-binding domain. We found that disruption of BIN1-RIN3 binding, through either genetic deletion or pathogenic RIN3 variants, resulted in RIN3-mediated RAB5 hyperactivation and enlargement of neuronal endosomes, a hallmark of early AD pathology. Transcriptomic profiling further revealed dysregulated expression of AD-related genes. Together, these findings establish BIN1 as a critical regulator of RIN3-driven RAB5 activation and neuronal endosomal homeostasis."

To date, the reported effects of αSyn expression on the kinetics of axonal synaptic vesicle exocytosis and membrane cycling have been relatively small. In contrast, we report that αSyn is the major modulator of substantia nigra somatodendritic dopamine release, a little-understood form of neurotransmission that is central to sensorimotor and basal ganglia circuitry. This regulation is due to a previously unknown role for αSyn in controlling the activity of the L-type calcium ion channels (LTCC), which are also implicated in Parkinson’s pathogenesis. αSyn-deficient neurons further display decreased spike frequency adaptation, hippocampal LTCC-dependent long-term potentiation, and immediate early gene induction, functions that are essential for synaptic adaptation and neuronal plasticity."

The origin of these large ultralow-velocity zones (ULVZs), referred to as mega-ULVZs, remains uncertain partly because of lack of constraints on the relative reduction in shear versus compressional wave speeds (RS/P). This ratio can give clues into the compositional makeup of the mega-ULVZs. Through joint seismic analysis of core-diffractedPandSwaves beneath Hawai’i, we constrain theRS/Pof its mega-ULVZ to 1 to 1.3. Mineralogical modeling reveals that iron enrichment via solid iron-rich magnesiowüstite [(Mg,Fe)O] matches this seismic constraint, independent of modeled ULVZ thickness. Enrichment of metallic iron-rich magnesiowüstite likely enhances the thermal conductivity of mega-ULVZs and provides a mechanism to drive localized plume upwelling. Higher reportedRS/Pvalues for smaller ULVZs near subduction zones may therefore indicate different processes at play controlling ULVZ formation across the diverse core-mantle boundary landscape."

The nematic liquid crystal, leveraging its electrically tunable properties, is explored to select specific polarizations of heralded single photons, enabling dynamic remote switching in trimode quantum imaging. To further improve the time efficiency, an ultrafast remote switching is presented on the basis of the appealing ferroelectric liquid crystals.

How long-range inputs drive cell type–specific activity within motor circuits remains unclear. The dorsolateral striatum (DLS) contains direct- and indirect-pathway medium spiny neurons (dMSNs and iMSNs) with distinct roles in movement control. In mice performing skilled locomotion, we recorded from dMSNs, iMSNs, and their cortical and thalamic inputs identified by monosynaptic rabies tracing. A recurrent neural network (RNN) classifier and clustering analysis revealed functionally heterogeneous subpopulations in each population, with dMSNs preferentially activated at movement onset and offset, and iMSNs during execution. Cortical and thalamic inputs were preferentially activated during onset/offset and execution, respectively, though dMSN- and iMSN-projecting neurons in each region showed similar patterns. Locomotion phase-specific rhythmic activity was found in a subset of thalamic dMSN-projecting neurons and dMSNs. Cortex or thalamus inactivation reduced MSN activity.

Using quantitative live-cell imaging, we monitored the activity of major efflux systems inEscherichia coliandPseudomonas aeruginosawith Hoechst 33342 (HCT), a DNA binding inhibitor. We found that inactivation of efflux (ΔtolCinE. coliand Δ6 inP. aeruginosa) increased the apparent HCT-DNA affinity, mediated by a decreased apparent unbinding rate, whereas the intrinsic rate remained unchanged. Statistical physics modeling and experimental testing show that, unlike under dilute in vitro conditions, drug molecules that unbind from their targets in intracellular environments undergo successive rebinding, prolonging the total lifetime of the drug bound to the target. However, efflux pumps counteract this effect by suppressing rebinding, thereby kinetically destabilizing drug-target interactions. This biophysical mechanism acts multiplicatively with the canonical gatekeeping effect to broaden and amplify drug resistance."

The abundant nitrogen/fluorine/zinc-rich lithiophilic sites effectively decrease lithium nucleation energy barriers, ensure uniform lithium deposition, and stabilize solid electrolyte interphase. The interconnected three-dimensional framework further guides uniform lithium deposition by spatially homogenizing lithium ion flux and reducing local current density as well as offers sufficient space to alleviate structural change, thus affording structural integrity against pulverization. As a result, the MX/2D-Zn-MOF host demonstrates uniform lithium deposition, reversible lithium plating and stripping behavior, and stable cycling performance (~1800 hours at 1.0 milliamperes per square centimeter and 5.0 milliampere hours per square centimeter).

It enables wireless, mild-restricted measurement of eyelid deformation during eye movements. Through biomechanical modeling validated by ocular magnetic resonance imaging simulations, we establish a prior correlation between eyelid deformation and eye movements. The Eyelectronics, powered by our physiology knowledge-driven end-to-end AI algorithm, achieves simultaneous measurement of strabismus angle and identification of paretic muscle. It delivers a 96.6% four-direction classification accuracy and a 1.2° measurement accuracy in ocular motility examinations. Clinical benchmarking against the clinical standard (Hess screen test) confirmed diagnostic agreement (intraclass correlation = 0.978).

The molecules of good solvents screen off interchain interactions for hyperelasticity. The long dangling chains disentangle and adsorb to substrate for strong adhesion. We synthesized such gels by controlling the polymerization kinetics. When a monomer solution is partially cured, some monomers form a network and others form the solvent. The resulting gel, termed homogel, consists of a polymer network with enormous dangling chains and solvent of identical chemistries. An interval exists where the dangling chains are long and disentangled substantially, and the homogel exhibits both hyperelasticity and omniadhesion.

H3K36me3 modification is accomplished by Set2/SETD2 during transcription elongation by the RNA polymerase II elongation complex (EC). Here, we found that Set2-mediated H3K36me3 deposition occurs on the nucleosome reassembling behind the EC. The histone chaperone FACT suppresses H3K36me3 deposition on the downstream nucleosome, thereby ensuring that Set2 targets specifically on the reassembling upstream nucleosome. Cryo–electron microscopy structures of the nucleosome-transcribing EC complexed with Set2 revealed that Set2 is anchored by the Spt6 subunit of the EC to capture both of the H3 N-terminal tails in a stepwise manner during the nucleosome reassembly process.

These highly diffusive elements contribute external entropy to the system, stabilizing the structure at 140 GPa and 3800 K. Our free-energy calculations reveal that water tends to freeze under deep lower mantle conditions, so dehydration becomes energetically and kinetically unfavorable even under core-mantle boundary (CMB) conditions.

Users simply define the spatial placement of reservoirs, specify the channel connections between them, and assign desired flow rates through this layout. Leveraging a hybrid algorithmic framework that integrates ML models with mathematical modeling, μFG automatically generates spatially coded maze structures that implement the precise fluidic resistances needed to meet the target flow distribution. These resistive elements are optimized to fit within the available geometry and can reproduce complex flow profiles, such as physiologically relevant flow rates in multi-organ-on-chip platforms. The resulting microfluidic designs are directly exportable for three-dimensional printing. Experimental validation demonstrates that μFG-generated circuits reproduce target flow distributions with 90% accuracy. By streamlining and automating microfluidic circuit creation, μFG not only lowers the barrier to entry for nonexperts but also showcases a principled and efficient application of ML to fluidic system design, enabling rapid and customizable development of complex microfluidic architectures."

The steel exhibits very low hydrogen diffusivity (~7.8 × 10−17square meters per second), mitigating hydrogen embrittlement at ambient temperature, an advantage over conventional steels. In addition, formation of a dense passive film improves corrosion resistance in environments such as dilute hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and caustic soda. The outstanding resistance of the stainless steel against such harsh coupled environmental conditions qualifies it as a promising candidate for sustainable and secure infrastructure in the emerging hydrogen economy."

Schneider,From Plato to Pareto: Defining the shape of infection’s disease space,"If the immune system is an interconnected network, then the evolution of an archetype that is ideal for fighting one pathogen should result in trade-offs decreasing its ability to fight others. How many archetypes are there in an immune system? We infected diverse mice withPlasmodium chabaudiand identified five distinct archetypes of responses on the basis of the host’s position in microbial load, immune activity, and host damage space. To better understand the nature of these archetypes, we developed a mathematical model of a generalized host-pathogen system. This model explains the number and distribution of archetypes across a population of diverse hosts. Mice resilient toP. chabaudiexhibited poor outcomes when challenged with influenza, SARS-CoV-1, orMycobacterium tuberculosis, and vice versa, supporting our trade-off hypothesis."

Placental abnormalities contribute to the pathophysiology, onset, progression, and prognosis of major perinatal disorders, making imaging modalities that enable their detection and monitoring crucial. Ultrasound (US) imaging is the principal modality for placental imaging, providing structural assessment with B-mode and blood flow evaluation with Doppler mode. Furthermore, advanced techniques such as 3D power Doppler, quantitative US, and shear-wave elastography expand the capabilities of placental US imaging. Photoacoustic (PA) imaging enables observation of the optical properties of endogenous chromophores (e.g., hemoglobin) with high spatial resolution and measures blood oxygenation, a key factor in placental dysfunction, offering substantial value for placental imaging. In this review, we cover US/PA imaging techniques for placental imaging, including preclinical and clinical studies. In addition, by considering current limitations and potential solutions, we suggest future trajectories for the advancement of US/PA imaging in this field."
