Estimated fluxes show a strong seasonality with maximums in October, corresponding with the period of harvest and straw incorporation. The estimated annual methane emission was about 262.8 kg CH4 ha‑1. Results were compared with fluxes obtained with static chambers showing strong agreement between both methodologies. 
 The Ebro River Delta, in the northwestern Mediterranean basin, has an extension of 320 km2 and is mainly covered by rice fields. In the framework of the ClimaDat project, the greenhouse gases atmospheric station DEC was designed and installed in this area in 2013. The DEC station was equipped, among other tools, with a Picarro G2301 instrument and an ARMON (Atmospheric Radon Monitor) to measure both CH4 and CO2 and 222Rn concentrations, respectively.The variability of methane fluxes over this area and during the distinct phases of the rice production cycle was evaluated in this study using the Radon Tracer Method (RTM). The RTM was carried out using (i) nocturnal hourly atmospheric measurements of CH4 and 222Rn between 2013 and 2019 and (ii) FLEXPART-WRF back trajectories coupled with radon flux maps for Europe with a resolution of 0.05° × 0.05° available thanks to the project traceRadon. Prior to the calculation of methane fluxes by RTM, the FLEXPART-WRF model and the traceRadon flux maps were evaluated by modelling atmospheric radon concentrations at the DEC station and comparing them with observed data.RTM-based methane fluxes show a strong seasonality with maximums in October (13.9 mg CH4 m−2 h−1), corresponding with the period of harvest and straw incorporation in rice crop fields, and minimums between March and June (0.2 to 0.6 mg CH4 m−2 h−1). The total estimated methane annual emission was about 262.8 kg CH4 ha−1. These fluxes were compared with fluxes directly measured with static accumulation chambers by other researchers in the same area. Results show strong agreement between both methodologies, having both a similar annual cycle and similar monthly mean absolute values."
10.5194/acp-25-6353-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要探讨了2022年汤加火山爆发对平流层气溶胶层光学性质的影响。论文利用卫星数据反演的气溶胶粒径分布，计算了火山爆发前后平流层气溶胶的光学性质，并与历史上的El Chichón和Pinatubo火山爆发进行了对比。研究发现，汤加火山爆发的气溶胶层在单位质量下具有更大的冷却潜力，主要是由于其更有效地散射太阳短波辐射。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它使用了卫星观测数据来分析大气成分（气溶胶）的变化，并评估了这些变化对气候的影响。研究结果可用于改进气候模型，并更好地理解火山爆发对地球气候系统的影响。,"['stratospheric aerosol', 'optical properties', 'satellite observations', 'radiative forcing', 'volcanic eruption', 'particle size distribution', 'aerosol extinction', 'single-scattering albedo', 'climate cooling']",Pasquale Sellitto;Redha Belhadji;Bernard Legras;Aurélien Podglajen;Clair Duchamp,The optical properties of the stratospheric aerosol layer perturbation of the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai volcano eruption of 15 January 2022,"The Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha’apai volcano erupted on 15 January 2022, producing the largest stratospheric aerosol perturbation of the last 30 years. Stratospheric volcanic aerosols usually produce a transient climate cooling; these impacts depend on volcanic aerosol composition/size, due to size-dependent interactions with solar/terrestrial radiation. We demonstrate that the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha’apai stratospheric aerosols have a larger cooling potential per unit mass than the past climate-relevant El Chichón (1984) and Pinatubo (1991) eruptions. 
 The Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai volcano violently erupted on 15 January 2022 and produced the largest stratospheric aerosol layer perturbation of the last 30 years. In comparison to background conditions and other recent moderate stratospheric eruptions, one notable effect of the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai eruption was the significant modification of the size distribution (SD) of the stratospheric aerosol layer, resulting in a larger mean particle size and a smaller SD spread for Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai. Starting from satellite-based SD retrievals and the assumption of pure sulfate aerosol layers, in this work, we calculate the optical properties of both background and Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai-perturbed stratospheric aerosol scenarios using a Mie code. We found that the intensive optical properties of the stratospheric aerosol layer (i.e. the single-scattering albedo (SSA), the asymmetry parameter, the aerosol extinction per unit mass, and the broad-band average ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) to mid-infrared (MIR) Ångström exponent (AE)) were not significantly perturbed by the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai eruption with respect to background conditions. The calculated AE was found to be consistent with multi-instrument satellite observations of the same parameter. Thus, the basic impact of the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai eruption on the optical properties of the stratospheric aerosol layer was an increase in the stratospheric aerosol extinction (or optical depth), without any modification of the shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) relative absorption, angular scattering, and broad-band spectral trend of the extinction, with respect to background. This highlights a marked difference between the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai perturbation of the stratospheric aerosol layer and perturbations from other larger stratospheric eruptions, such as Pinatubo 1991 and El Chichón 1982. With simplified radiative forcing estimations, we show that the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai eruption produced an aerosol layer likely 1.5–10 times more effective in producing a net cooling of the climate system with respect to the Pinatubo and El Chichón eruptions due to more effective SW scattering. As intensive optical properties are seldom directly measured, e.g. from satellite, our calculations can support the estimation of radiative effects for the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai eruption with climate or offline radiative models."

We use the novel technique polar imaging nephelometry that helps to determine the phase functions using a CMOS camera. The capability of measuring with polarized light helps to infer new properties about the mixture of Saharan dust particles with those of anthropogenic origin. 
 This work investigates scattering matrix elements during different Saharan dust outbreaks over Granada (southeast Spain) in 2022 using a polarized imaging nephelometer (PI-Neph) capable of measuring continuously the phase function (F11) and the polarized phase function (-F12/F11) at three different wavelengths (405, 515 and 660 nm) in the range 5–175°. The focus is on two extreme dust events (PM10 > 1000 µg m−3) in March 2022. During the peaks of these events F11 and -F12/F11 show the classical patterns observed for dust samples in laboratory measurements available in the Granada–Amsterdam Light Scattering Database at all wavelengths. However, for the moments prior to and after the peaks the results reveal important sensitivity in -F12/F11 at 405 nm. For the other wavelengths, however, this difference in -F12/F11 is not evident. Moreover, no remarkable changes are found in F11, which is always characterized by strong predominance of forward scattering. The analyses of more frequent and moderate events recorded in summer 2022 (PM10 between 50 and 100 µg m−3) revealed F11 and -F12/F11 patterns like those observed prior to and after the extreme events. The combination of PI-Neph measurements with additional in situ instrumentation allowed a typing classification that revealed the peaks in the extreme dust events as pure dust, while for the rest of cases it remarked a mixture of dust with urban background pollution. In addition, simulations with the Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties (GRASP) code explain the different patterns in -F12/F11, with changes in the refractive indexes and with the different contributions of the fine and coarse mode."
10.5194/acp-25-6365-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文的标题和摘要都明确表明其与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。论文研究了北半球野火增加与卫星观测到的CO和AOD浓度上升之间的关系。论文使用了IASI/Metop卫星观测的CO数据以及MODIS/Terra和Aqua卫星观测的AOD数据，分析了2008年至2023年期间北半球夏季和初秋CO和AOD的平均值和极端值的变化。研究结果表明，野火的增加导致了CO和AOD的显著上升，尤其是在北方地区和美国西部。这与大气环境遥感技术中的空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等领域直接相关。,"['carbon monoxide (CO)', 'aerosol optical depth (AOD)', 'biomass burning', 'wildfires', 'satellite observations', 'IASI/Metop', 'MODIS/Terra and Aqua', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis']",Antoine Ehret;Solène Turquety;Maya George;Juliette Hadji-Lazaro;Cathy Clerbaux,"Increase in carbon monoxide (CO) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) observed by satellites in the Northern Hemisphere over the summers of 2008–2023, linked to an increase in wildfires","Biomass burning has a considerable effect on the chemical composition of the atmosphere and climate, due to the emission of trace gases and aerosols. We examine the relationship between fire variability and the values of carbon monoxide and aerosol optical depth observed by satellites. The observed increase in wildfires has led to a corresponding rise in the mean and extreme values of carbon monoxide and aerosol optical depth during the summer and early autumn across the Northern Hemisphere. 
 Biomass burning has a significant impact on the composition of the atmosphere and climate due to large emissions of trace gases and aerosols. Previous studies have demonstrated the influence of biomass burning emissions on the spatial and temporal variability of carbon monoxide (CO) and aerosol concentration on hemispheric scales. This study aims to examine the variability of fires and their impact on the mean and extreme values of CO and aerosol optical depth (AOD) observed by satellites (IASI/Metop for total column CO and MODIS/Terra and Aqua for AOD), focusing on the extratropical Northern Hemisphere (NH) from 2008 to 2023. While biomass burning due to agricultural practices is decreasing in many regions, boreal regions and the western United States have experienced a notable rise in burned area, up to +37 % in recent years (2017–2023) compared to the 2008–2023 period, and fire intensity. This is consistent with an increase in meteorological fire risk in these regions. The increase in wildfires has led to a rise in the mean and extreme values of CO and AOD during the summer and early autumn across the whole of the NH, up to +9.3 % and +33 % for extreme values of total column CO and AOD in boreal regions and the western United States in recent years compared to 2008–2023. The number of days with extreme total column CO and AOD has increased by more than 50 % in recent years during summer in North America, the Atlantic and Europe, in comparison to the full period. A robust correlation (r = 0.83) between the number of plumes and burned areas in the extratropical Northern Hemisphere is obtained."
10.5194/acp-25-6273-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了通过在CHIMERE模型中包含闪电产生的氮氧化物（LNOx）排放来改进北半球对流层臭氧分布的模拟。论文评估了两种不同的闪电参数化方案（基于云顶高度的CTH方案和基于冰通量的ICEFLUX方案），并将其模型输出与原位测量和卫星数据进行了比较，以评估这些方案的稳健性和适用性。研究发现，包含LNOx可以改善热带自由对流层中的臭氧分布，并减少痕量气体甲烷的寿命。这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及空气质量监测、利用卫星观测数据进行模型验证以及分析大气成分。,"['tropospheric ozone', 'lightning NOx emissions', 'air quality', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric composition', 'CHIMERE model', 'cloud-top height scheme', 'ice-flux-based scheme']",Sanhita Ghosh;Arineh Cholakian;Sylvain Mailler;Laurent Menut,Representing improved tropospheric ozone distribution over the Northern Hemisphere by including lightning NOx emissions in CHIMERE,"In this study, we evaluate the present state of modelling lightning flashes over the Northern Hemisphere, using the classical CTH (cloud-top height) scheme and the ICEFLUX scheme with the CHIMERE model. Our study provides a comprehensive 3D comparison of model outputs to assess the robustness and applicability of these schemes. An improvement in O3 distribution in the tropical free troposphere is observed due to inclusion of LNOx (nitrogen oxide emissions from lightning) in the model. Inclusion of LNOx also reduces the lifetime of trace gas CH4. 
 Estimating nitrogen oxide emissions from lightning (LNOx) in models is highly uncertain, affecting the accuracy of atmospheric composition and air quality assessments. Still, it is essential to include these emissions in models to increase the realism of representing the gases and aerosols. LNOx emissions have recently been incorporated into the updated version of the CHIMERE model (v2023r2). In this study, we evaluate the present state of modelling the lightning flashes over the Northern Hemisphere (NH), using a classical scheme based on cloud-top height (CTH) and an updated ice-flux-based scheme (ICEFLUX). We conduct a comprehensive 3D comparison of model outputs, including in situ measurements and satellite data, to rigorously assess the robustness and applicability of these parameterizations. The comparative analysis reveals that the CTH scheme provides a more accurate spatial variability of lightning flashes over lands and tropical oceans. Both parameterizations accurately capture the magnitude of lightning flashes over the tropics, while the ICEFLUX scheme is more effective in representing mid-latitudinal flashes. However, both schemes perform well in capturing the seasonal variation of lightning flashes. The estimated flash frequencies over the NH from the experiments closely align with satellite observations, and the LNOx emissions fall within the range reported in previous modelling studies. There is an overall increase in ozone (O3) concentration due to inclusion of LNOx, which substantially improves the tropospheric O3 distribution, specifically in the tropical free troposphere. The LNOx emissions hence critically influence the O3 burden as well as the hydroxyl radicals, which further impact the atmospheric lifetime of trace gas methane."

This innovative design reduces the beam incidence angle and narrows the width. Using polystyrene latex spheres, we validated the high transmission efficiency. Additionally, a standard dust test demonstrated consistency with the aerodynamic particle sizer. This study introduces a novel design framework that not only enhances transmission range and efficiency but also supports instrument miniaturization. 
 A new aerodynamic injection system has been designed for a wide particle size range, combining a new pre-focus structure, a smaller buffer chamber, and a five-stage lens. Compared with previous injection systems, the new design adds virtual impactors and pre-focus structures, while reducing the overall volume by 90 %. The newly developed pre-focus structure effectively addresses the challenges associated with the focusing and transmission of large particles, significantly reducing the beam width and dispersion angle of particles exiting the critical hole, thus preventing the buffer chamber from becoming excessively large. Furthermore, the focusing capability and transmission efficiency for large particles have been significantly enhanced, with the transmission range expanded to encompass particles from 100 nm to 10 µm. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the injection system can transmit particles within the 1 to 9 µm range with an efficiency exceeding 90 %. Additionally, the standard micro-sphere experiment verified the good consistency between the performance of the injection system and the simulation results. In the testing of standard dust, the wide-range particle size distribution obtained using the new injection system is highly consistent with the aerodynamic particle sizer (APS). In summary, this new design has ultra-high transmission efficiency while reducing volume, demonstrating the miniaturization potential of the single-particle aerosol mass spectrometer when detecting particles with a wide particle size range."

Kotarba;Izabela Wojciechowska,Satellite-based detection of deep-convective clouds: the sensitivity of infrared methods and implications for cloud climatology,"The research investigates methods for detecting deep convective clouds (DCCs) using satellite infrared data, essential for understanding long-term climate trends. By validating three popular detection methods against lidar–radar data, it found moderate accuracy (below 75 %), emphasizing the importance of fine-tuning thresholds regionally. The study shows how small threshold changes significantly affect the climatology of severe storms. 
 Reliable deep-convective cloud (DCC) climatology relies heavily on accurate detection. Infrared-based algorithms play a critical role, as they are the only ones that can be applied to the 6.7 µm water vapour (WV) absorption band and the 11 µm infrared (IR) window band. For over 40 years, the latter has been the only daytime/nighttime channel used in satellite cloud imaging. This study presents the first global validation of three commonly used DCC detection methods, which use brightness temperature (Tb) in the WV and IR bands. These methods are the infrared-window method (IRW; Tb11), the brightness temperature difference method (BTD; Tb6.7−Tb11), and the temperature difference method with the tropopause method (TROPO; Tb11−Ttropo). All methods were applied to 1 year (2007) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations and validated against collocated CloudSat-CALIPSO lidar–radar cloud classifications. Results indicate that even with optimal parameter configurations, DCC detection accuracy remains moderate and is below 75 % (Cohen's κ < 0.4) for all methods. Global accuracy ranged from 56.6 % (for TROPO) to 72.8 % (for BTD) using an optimal threshold of −2 K. Regionally, the BTD method performs best, with an accuracy of 72.9 % over Europe and 67.9 % over Africa. Misclassifications are common with cloud types such as nimbostratus and altostratus (single-layer cloud regimes) and cirrus and altostratus (multilayer cloud regimes). Overall, the BTD method slightly outperforms the others, while TROPO is the least effective. Our study highlighted the high sensitivity of these methods to threshold selection. Even a ±1 K change in the threshold resulted in a 10 %–40 % variance in DCC frequency. This finding is of particular importance for the construction of homogenous DCC datasets, whether they are global mosaics or time series spanning multiple generations of satellite instruments."

Walvoord,Permafrost–wildfire interactions: active layer  thickness estimates for paired burned and  unburned sites in northern high latitudes,"Wildfires have the potential to accelerate permafrost thaw and the associated feedbacks to climate change. We assembled a dataset of permafrost thaw depth measurements from burned and unburned sites contributed by researchers from across the northern high-latitude region. We estimated maximum thaw depth for each measurement, which addresses a key challenge: the ability to assess impacts of wildfire on maximum thaw depth when measurement timing varies. 
 As the northern high-latitude permafrost zone experiences accelerated warming, permafrost has become vulnerable to widespread thaw. Simultaneously, wildfire activity across northern boreal forest and Arctic/subarctic tundra regions impacts permafrost stability through the combustion of insulating organic matter, vegetation, and post-fire changes in albedo. Efforts to synthesis the impacts of wildfire on permafrost are limited and are typically reliant on antecedent pre-fire conditions. To address this, we created the FireALT dataset by soliciting data contributions that included thaw depth measurements, site conditions, and fire event details with paired measurements at environmentally comparable burned and unburned sites. The solicitation resulted in 52 466 thaw depth measurements from 18 contributors across North America and Russia. Because thaw depths were taken at various times throughout the thawing season, we also estimated end-of-season active layer thickness (ALT) for each measurement using a modified version of the Stefan equation. Here, we describe our methods for collecting and quality-checking the data, estimating ALT, the data structure, strengths and limitations, and future research opportunities. The final dataset includes 48 669 ALT estimates with 32 attributes across 9446 plots and 157 burned–unburned pairs spanning Canada, Russia, and the United States. The data span fire events from 1900 to 2022 with measurements collected from 2001 to 2023. The time since fire ranges from 0 to 114 years. The FireALT dataset addresses a key challenge: the ability to assess impacts of wildfire on ALT when measurements are taken at various times throughout the thaw season depending on the time of field campaigns (typically June through August) by estimating ALT at the end-of-season maximum. This dataset can be used to address understudied research areas, particularly algorithm development, calibration, and validation for evolving process-based models as well as extrapolating across space and time, which could elucidate permafrost–wildfire interactions under accelerated warming across the high-northern-latitude permafrost zone. The FireALT dataset is available through the Arctic Data Center (https://doi.org/10.18739/A2RN3092P, Talucci et al., 2024)."

It includes numerous improvements to the original database from 2015 and includes newer high-quality radar sounding data from 2014–2019. It represents a unique and widespread constraint on the history of the ice sheet that could be helpful to initialize and interpret ice-sheet models. 
 Between 1993 and 2019, NASA and NSF sponsored 26 separate airborne campaigns that surveyed the thickness and radiostratigraphy of the Greenland Ice Sheet using successive generations of coherent VHF radar sounders developed and operated by The University of Kansas. Most of the ice sheet's internal VHF radiostratigraphy is composed of isochronal reflections that record its integrated response to past centennial- to multi-millennial-scale climatic and dynamic events. We previously generated the first comprehensive dated radiostratigraphy of the Greenland Ice Sheet using the first 20 of these campaigns (1993–2013) and investigated its value for constraining the ice sheet's history and modern boundary conditions. Here we describe the second version of this radiostratigraphic dataset using all 26 campaigns, which includes substantial improvements in survey coverage and was mostly acquired with higher-fidelity systems. We improved quality control and accelerated reflection tracing and matching by including an automatic test for stratigraphic conformability, a thickness-normalized reprojection for radargrams, and automatic inter-segment reflection matching. We reviewed and augmented the 1993–2013 radiostratigraphy, and we applied an existing independently developed method for predicting radiostratigraphy to the previously untraced campaigns (2014–2019) to accelerate their semi-automatic tracing. The result is a more robust radiostratigraphy and age structure of the ice sheet that covers up to 65 % of the ice sheet and includes > 58 600 km of newly traced reflections from the 2014–2019 campaigns. This dataset can be used to validate the sensitivity of ice-sheet models to past major climate changes and constrain long-term boundary conditions (e.g., accumulation rate). Based on these results, we make several recommendations for how radiostratigraphy may be traced more efficiently and reliably in the future.

Both human activities and natural events widely impact forest ecosystems, with regional differences across tropical, temperate, and boreal zones. Forest fires concentrated in Siberia and North America; and shifting cultivation dominant in tropical areas. 
 Forests play a pivotal role in global carbon cycling and biodiversity conservation, yet they face increasing disturbances from both anthropogenic and natural drivers. This study presents the first high-resolution (30-m) global forest disturbance dataset (GFD) for 2000–2020, classifying 11 disturbance types by integrating Landsat-based Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) time-series analysis with spatial metrics and machine learning. A total of 57,000 expert-validated samples were used to train and validate a decision tree model, achieving an overall accuracy of 94.88 %. The results reveal that forestry disturbance (43.79±0.31 %), shifting cultivation (24.32±0.28 %), and forest fires (11.45±0.05 %) dominate global forest loss. There are regional differences in global forest disturbance, such as farmland expansion in South America and Africa, forest fires in northern regions, and shifting cultivation in tropical regions. Disturbed forests span 1,247.06±11.18 Mha, accounting for 30.87 % of the global forest area. Notably, 2.76 % of global forests were newly established, primarily in China, India, and Brazil. Spatial consistency analysis with existing datasets (R2=0.93) confirms the reliability of the GFD product. The GFD dataset advances our understanding of forest dynamics and underscores the need for targeted conservation strategies in an era of escalating environmental change.

This study presents the first spatial and temporal measurements of selected VCP tracers in Houston, Texas, using a Vocus 2R Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer on a mobile platform. Ambient measurements of five major VCP tracers, including D5-siloxane, monoterpenes, para-dichlorobenzene, para-chlorobenzotrifluoride (PCBTF), and 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol isobutyrate (Texanol), were collected in winter and summer 2023. Several compounds exhibited significantly higher averaged concentrations, with pronounced spatial and seasonal variability, distinguishing Houston from urban areas in the temperate and cooler climate zone. A customized box model was employed to estimate seasonal emissions for the Greater Houston Area, showing that emissions of most VCPs were significantly higher during the summer. This study provides critical insights into the distribution and emission of VCPs in a subtropical metropolitan area, advancing methods for assessing VCP emissions and concentrations across cities and improving understandings of their impacts on air quality, climate, and public health."

Nevertheless, current remediation approaches face critical limitations, including high energy consumption and interference from dissolved organic carbon (DOC). To address these challenges, we developed an innovative N,O-doped graphene-like coordinated single-atom iron catalyst (FeSA-N,O-GO) using silkworm excrement as a sustainable precursor. The catalyst features robust Fe−π interactions between high-spin Fe atoms and the N,O-GO support, generating a substantial surface electric field (∼146 mV). This unique configuration enables FeSA-N,O-GO to achieve remarkable degradation efficiency for multiple antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin (CIP), tetracycline (TC), oxytetracycline (OTC), and norfloxacin (NFX), without requiring external peroxides or additional energy input. Complete antibiotic removal (100%) was attained within 90 min, accompanied by total organic carbon removal of 65.2–79.7%. Most importantly, the catalytic performance was further enhanced in DOC-containing real water samples, where synergistic coordination of DOC-antibiotics-H2O on FeSA-N,O-GO amplified the surface electric field effect.

The maximum monthly mean O3 concentration within the boundary layer was observed at an altitude of 100–300 m. Concentrations of O3 and its precursors declined from 2018 to 2021, followed by slight increases in 2022 and 2023. The combined temporal percentages of O3 formation under the NOx-limited and transition regimes were accessed at both sites. These percentages for the boundary layer condition have reached 69.2% at the rural site during summer 2023. The trend toward a shift from the VOC-limited to NOx-limited regime was observed. This shift occurred at a much faster rate at the rural site than at the urban site.

Herein, a category of hitherto overlooked dynamic single-atom sites on heteroatom-doped carbons (HDCs) that mitigate the above problems was observed by coupling Fenton and activated carbon. Specifically, the defects on the carbon surface, particularly the heteroatom defects, coordinated with Fe3+ in the bulk solution to form dynamic single-atom sites that simultaneously suppress the Fe3+ hydrolysis and promote the Fe3+/Fe2+ conversion. This synergy sustains the efficient oxidation process of the coupled system through up to 5 cycles due to the optimized Fe3+/Fe2+ cycling. Moreover, dynamic single-atom sites enable the continuous removal of adsorbates from the carbon surface, extending the time before adsorption saturation and maintaining nearly 100% efficiency for 480 h. Mechanistic analysis revealed that dynamic single-atom sites optimize the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox cycle through forming a carbon → ligand atoms → Fe ↔ H2O2 electron flux pathway. Their bidirectional electron flux with H2O2 enhances OH· production, thereby improving the Fenton oxidation process. These findings offer crucial insights for overcoming challenges in environmental engineering technologies and underscore the potential superiority of coupled systems in practical applications."

Conventional AOPs, e.g., the benchmark O3/H2O2 (peroxone), are not efficient in removing them from water/wastewater, because of their relatively low reaction rates with hydroxyl radical (•OH). We report here that Cl-OPFRs (i.e., TCEP, TCPP, and TDCPP) can be efficiently removed by catalytic ozonation with zinc oxide (O3/ZnO) through a novel reaction pathway. Based on in situ characterization with confocal Raman spectrum and fluorescence microscopy imaging, we confirmed that the ozone–ZnO interaction resulted in the formation of surface-bound •OH, with yields 50% higher than those of the peroxone system. Using TCEP as a model Cl-OPFR and ATR-FTIR characterization, we recognized the coordination between the phosphoryl oxygen and the surface Zn(II) of ZnO. The surface coordination improved the reactivity of TCEP toward the surface-bound •OH, which was confirmed with a competitive reaction on ZnO. The O3/ZnO was most effective at neutral pH for TCEP removal and can achieve partial mineralization and detoxification of the compound.

This repeated-measures prospective study, comprising 6160 observations (4098 participants at baseline and 2062 participants at the six-year follow-up) from the Wuhan–Zhuhai cohort, measured serum pyrethroids and glucose metabolic traits to assess the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of pyrethroid exposure with glucose dyshomeostasis. Network toxicological analyses and gene-environment interaction analyses were integrated to identify the underlying targets and mechanisms. Cross-sectionally, multiple pyrethroids, particularly bifenthrin and fenvalerate, were positively associated with fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin resistance, and β-cell dysfunction. Longitudinally, serum bifenthrin and fenvalerate were associated with the annual change rate of glucose metabolic traits and an increased incident risk of type 2 diabetes. Additionally, pregnane X receptor (PXR) was predicted as a key molecular target for pyrethroid exposure-related glucose dyshomeostasis. PXR variants significantly interacted with bifenthrin exposure, with individuals carrying a high-risk PXR genotype and high bifenthrin exposure exhibiting higher FPG or lower β-cell function.

Although many advanced materials exist for photo- and electrocatalytic production, H2O2 output and stability depend on reactor design and water quality. This study explores a scalable photochemical system employing bismuth vanadate-coated polymeric optical fibers (POF-BVO) illuminated by 440 nm LEDs. A single 20 cm, 3 mm diameter fiber generates H2O2 at 4.3 mg H2O2 h–1 (430 mg H2O2 gcat–1 h–1), with enhanced rates achieved using bundled fibers. The bundled configuration increases fiber packing density in the reactor to >120 m2 m–3, tripling that of flat-plate photocatalytic reactors. High H2O2 production is achieved using oxygen-permeable hollow-fiber membranes to deliver pure O2 or air. The system performs consistently across pH 4–9 and in tap water, wastewater, or seawater. Phosphate ions improve H2O2 stability, resulting in higher concentrations. Over 21 days of continuous operation, the system produces >6 g L–1 of H2O2 with minimal  performance degradation. Energy analysis reveals a 2–30x reduction in energy use compared to traditional slurry-based photocatalytic systems, with a three-fiber bundle reaching 27 kWh kg–1─comparable to electrochemical processes.

While recent studies have investigated the photosensitized oxidation of SO2─typically focusing on inorganic sulfate formation─the mechanisms underlying the multiphase formation of organosulfate remain largely unexplored. This study identifies a potential pathway for organosulfate formation via a radical–radical mechanism under highly acidic conditions, involving an interaction between organic radicals and sulfate radicals generated through photosensitization chemistry. Using photosensitizing films composed of vanillin, 4-benzoylbenzoic acid, and humic acid in a vertical wetted-wall flow tube reactor, SO2 uptake was examined under both irradiated and dark conditions. Product analysis was conducted using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Results revealed substantial SO2 consumption under irradiation, with uptake rates significantly enhanced compared to dark conditions, likely due to oxidation by excited triplet states. The second-order rate constants for SO2 reacting on the irradiated films follow the order: 4-benzoylbenzoic acid (6.9 × 107 M–1 s–1) > vanillin (4.56 × 107 M–1 s–1), where the value for 4-BBA is the direct experimentally determined in Wang’s study (refer 21).

This study provides laboratory evidence that dark ozonolysis of limonene, in the presence of biogenic (α-pinene) or anthropogenic (toluene) precursors, generates SOAs more effectively in BrC formation when subsequently dried with (NH4)2SO4/glycine in bulk solutions, and toluene had a stronger effect than α-pinene in promoting oligomeric BrC formation. BrC absorption was significantly enhanced in limonene-SOA and the (NH4)2SO4/glycine mixed droplet upon evaporation at ∼75% RH but was suppressed at lower RH, likely due to reduced aerosol liquid water and precursor evaporation. RH-dependent trends were also observed in SOA generated by limonene and toluene mixtures (lim/tol-SOA), with the strongest oligomeric BrC absorption at ∼85% RH for both (NH4)2SO4 and glycine systems. While bulk-dried experiments showed 1–2 orders of magnitude differences in BrC absorption between limonene-SOA and lim/tol-SOA, evaporated droplets exhibited no significant differences.

Baseline NO2-cLA levels were 2.56 (95% CI: 1.20–5.43)-fold higher among COPD participants than healthy participants, which can be explained by higher fractional exhaled nitric oxide and sputum myeloperoxidase levels. Among COPD but not healthy or IHD participants, the street walk, compared to park, led to a 57.7% (95% CI: 7.6–80.6%) decrease in NO2-cLA levels and sputum biomarker changes indicative of decreased neutrophil inflammation and proresolving responses.

To interpret these records, we derive empirical relationships between moment magnitude (Mw) and maximum tsunami amplitude (MTA) for the five remote tide gauge locations using synthetic Mw 8–9 Chile‐Peru earthquakes and validate them with recent events. We infer Mw 8.8–9.1 for the 1868 earthquake and Mw 8.8–8.9 for the 1877 earthquake, clarifying a long‐standing debate and providing key insights for hazard models for this region. Our results confirm that MTA is predominantly controlled by Mw, but is also influenced by rupture strike, rupture length, and slip size; given Mw, greater slip over a shorter rupture increases MTA.

Meteorological conditions that favored high rates of mass loss included low winter snow accumulation, early‐season heat waves, and prolonged warm, dry conditions. High transient snow lines, and impurity loading due to wildfires (WCAN‐US) or Saharan dust (Switzerland) darkened glaciers and thereby increased mass loss via greater absorbed shortwave radiation available for melt.

The simulation captured the LLCE, including a nearly steady inner eyewall and an expanding outer eyewall indicated by the radius of the maximum tangential wind (RMW). The RMW budget diagnostics reveal that the radial advection of momentum is balanced by the vertical advection of momentum and diffusion at the inner RMW. This dynamic balance maintains a near‐zero radial gradient of tangential wind tendency, thereby supporting a steady inner eyewall with a sharpening tangential wind profile. The inward‐propagating rainbands enhance tangential winds outside the outer eyewall, maintaining a positive radial gradient of tangential wind tendency and facilitating the outer RMW expansion.

We find that the strength of all four of these simulated cloud feedbacks have statistically significant relationships with simulations of present‐day clouds. We use these relationships in an emergent constraint analysis to narrow the spread in the estimated strength of each feedback.

Climate feedbacks remain difficult to constrain directly from temporal variation in observed surface warming and radiation budgets due to the pattern effect and low signal‐to‐noise ratio, with only order 1°C historic rise in surface temperatures and high uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing. This study presents a new method to analyze climate feedbacks from observations by empirically fitting simplified reduced‐physics relations for outgoing radiation at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) to observed spatial variation in climate properties and radiation budgets. Spatial variations in TOA outgoing radiation are dominated by the dependence on surface temperature: around 91% of the spatial variation in clear sky albedo, and 77% of spatial variation in clear sky TOA outgoing longwave radiation, is functionally explained by variation in surface temperatures. These simplified and observationally constrained relations are then differentiated with respect to spatial contrasts in surface temperature to reveal the Planck, fixed‐cloud albedo (λalbedo ${\lambda }_{\text{albedo}}$) and WVLR (λWVLR ${\lambda }_{\text{WVLR}}$) climate feedbacks spatially for both clear sky and all sky conditions. The resulting global all sky climate feedback values are λWVLR ${\lambda }_{\text{WVLR}}$ = 1.28 (1.13–1.45 at 66%) Wm−2K−1, and λalbedo ${\lambda }_{\text{albedo}}$ = 0.64 (0.53–0.74) Wm−2 for the period 2003–2023, reducing to 0.35 (0.29–0.41) Wm−2K−1 under 4°C warming after cryosphere retreat.

The size of TCs is measured by the mean radius of gale‐force winds at their lifetime maximum intensity. Our results reveal an abrupt decadal change in the ENSO‐TC size relationship: the annual mean TC size exhibited a strong correlation with the Niño 3.4 SST index before 1998, but this correlation has significantly weakened since then. This change is primarily attributed to the more uniform distributions of cyclone expansion rate (CER) across ENSO phases during the past two decades. Climatically, environmental conditions favorable for TC size expansion weaken with increasing latitude, resulting in a dominant meridional gradient of CER. Before 1998, TC activity displayed a pronounced north‐south contrast between El Niño and La Niña years, leading to a significantly higher mean CER for TCs during El Niño episodes. In recent decades, however, interannual variations in TC genesis density have shifted to a southeast‐northwest dipole pattern. This shift, along with changes in TC tracks, has substantially increased the latitudinal overlap of TC occurrences between warm and cold phases, thereby narrowing differences in CER distributions. Concurrently, changes in environmental conditions have become more favorable for TC size expansion during La Niña years, further reducing disparities in TC size distributions across ENSO phases."

The magnitude of possible latitudinal change in the position of climate belts is, however, poorly understood. Here, we address this issue based on a case study of the early Toarcian (late Early Jurassic) Oceanic Anoxic Event (T‐OAE, ∼183 Ma), one of the most significant global change events of the Phanerozoic, characterized by elevated humidity and major disturbances to terrestrial ecosystems on land. We present new leaf‐wax n‐alkanes δ13C data from the high‐paleo‐latitude Junggar Basin (northwest China) spanning the T‐OAE and develop a time–space framework of plant‐fractionation change, from low‐ to high‐paleolatitudes across this time interval. We show that significant latitudinal changes in humidity occurred across the T‐OAE (∼10°), likely because of a significant northward expansion of the low‐latitude arid belts to mid‐paleo‐latitudes, and by inference a latitudinal expansion of the Hadley cells. This has important implications for the anthropogenic global warming and its effects on climate belts."

We assess the effectiveness of two SAI experiments, G6Sulfur and Geo SSP5‐8.5 1.5 (here called Geo‐SAI), using the CESM2(WACCM6) model to reduce hydrological changes under high‐emission SSP5‐8.5 (no mitigation) pathway. Geo‐SAI stabilizes near surface global temperatures at 1.5°C above preindustrial levels, whereas G6Sulfur limits temperature rises to those under the SSP2‐4.5 scenario. In our findings, Geo‐SAI reverts many, but not all, hydrological changes induced by SSP5‐8.5 restoring global and regional means, seasonal amplitudes, and peak timings. G6Sulfur delivers smaller restorations, as expected, due to its smaller prescribed forcing. In hyperarid regions such as the Middle East, both SAI scenarios improve water storage compared with both SSP5‐8.5 and present conditions. However, in wetter or cooler climates, such as the Amazon, middle and southern Africa and east Europe, they only partly reverse the reductions in available water (AW) and runoff caused by high GHG emissions. Residual warming and snowmelt dynamics play an important role in runoff at mid‐to‐high latitudes. Additionally, SAI does not completely suppress GHG‐induced vegetation expansion and so over‐reduces global runoff in three latitude bands: 45°–65°N, 45°–65°S, and 30°S to 0 with end‐of‐century decreases of 4.1% under G6Sulfur and 7.3% under Geo‐SAI despite mean AW levels remaining close to present‐day. These findings emphasize that although SAI mitigates many climate‐driven hydrological disruptions, its unintended effects on runoff, vegetation feedback, and regional water availability warrants study—especially in regions heavily dependent on surface water resources."

Understanding the relationship between TP soil moisture (TPSM) and summer precipitation in Northwest China (NWC) is essential for improving climate predictions for East Asia. However, most existing studies have focused on the connection between TPSM and the climate of East Asian monsoon region, whereas the mechanisms by which TPSM influence precipitation in NWC, a nonmonsoonal area, remain underexplored. This study investigates how spring anomalies of TPSM persist into summer and influence summer precipitation in NWC. The results indicate that anomalies in spring TPSM can initiate a positive feedback with precipitation, which affects the intensity of plateau monsoon and contributes to the persistence of SM anomaly from spring to summer. During summer, positive SM anomalies in northern TP facilitate maintaining cyclonic circulation anomalies over western TP and trigger eastward‐propagating Rossby waves that induce anticyclonic circulation anomalies over eastern NWC. The anomalous circulation results in upward motion in the western NWC and subsidence in the eastern NWC enhancing precipitation in the western NWC while reducing the precipitation in the north. Finally, the findings from the circulation analysis are validated through numerical model simulations. This study provides valuable insights into the climatic effects of TPSM and offers important implications for precipitation prediction in NWC."

Kendon,Precipitation Over Complex Mountain Terrain in a Convection‐Permitting Regional Climate Model,"Orographic precipitation is a critical freshwater source and major flooding hazard, but its distribution and behavior over complex terrain are often uncertain due to sparse observations. We examine precipitation and its drivers in one of the wettest regions in the world, the Southern Alps of New Zealand (NZ), using the first multi‐decadal simulation by a convection‐permitting regional climate model across all mainland NZ at 2.2 km grid‐scale. Model skill is primarily assessed against direct measurements by more than 170 rain gauges to avoid uncertainty commonly introduced by gridded observations in remote regions. Peak intensity and duration of sub‐daily rainfall over mountains appear markedly improved in the 2.2 km model relative to the 12 km driving model. The orientation of water vapor flux relative to the mountain barrier strongly affects both climatological and daily extreme precipitation. Transects illustrate the influence of steep local topography on strong landfalling atmospheric rivers to produce high vertical velocities and extremely high accumulations of rainfall over windward upper mountain flanks, which do not appear unreasonable against available gauge observations. These transects also reveal the finer spatial structure of mountain waves in the 2.2 km model, which may contribute to its more realistic windward enhancement of orographic precipitation, but with excessive leeward precipitation and an annual mean dry bias over mountains. Despite the computational burden, these results support further targeted dynamical modeling at kilometer scales to improve physical understanding of precipitation in the current climate and its potential future change in NZ and other mountainous regions of the world."

 Aharonov–Bohm interference of fractional quasiparticles in the quantum Hall effect generally reveals their elementary charge (e*)1–15. Recently, our interferometry experiments with several ‘particle states’ reported flux periods of ΔΦ = (e/e*)Φ0 (with Φ0 the flux quantum) at moderate temperatures16. Here we report interference measurements of ‘particle–hole conjugated’ states at filling factors ν = 2/3, 3/5 and 4/7, which revealed unexpected flux periodicities of ΔΦ = ν−1Φ0. The measured shot-noise Fano factor (F) of the partitioned quasiparticles in each of the quantum point contacts of the interferometer was F = ν (ref. 17) rather than that of the elementary charge F = e*/e (refs. 18,19). These observations indicate that the interference of bunched (clustered) elementary quasiparticles occurred for coherent pairs, triples and quadruplets, respectively. A small metallic gate (top gate), deposited in the centre of the interferometer bulk, formed an antidot (or a dot) when charged, thus introducing local quasiparticles at the perimeter of the (anti)dot. Surprisingly, such charging led to a dissociation of the ‘bunched quasiparticles’ and, thus, recovered the conventional flux periodicity set by the elementary charge of the quasiparticles. However, the shot-noise Fano factor (of each quantum point contact) consistently remained at F = ν, possibly due to the neutral modes accompanying the conjugated states. The two observations—bunching and debunching (or dissociation)—were not expected by current theories. Similar effects may arise in Jain’s ‘particle states’ (at lower temperatures) and at even denominator fractional quantum Hall states20. The coherent bunching of anyons and their dissociation was observed in an interference experiment. "

 A key virtue of spin qubits is their sub-micron footprint, enabling a single silicon chip to host the millions of qubits required to execute useful quantum algorithms with error correction1–3. However, with each physical qubit needing multiple control lines, a fundamental barrier to scale is the extreme density of connections that bridge quantum devices to their external control and readout hardware4–6. A promising solution is to co-locate the control system proximal to the qubit platform at milli-kelvin temperatures, wired up by miniaturized interconnects7–10. Even so, heat and crosstalk from closely integrated control have the potential to degrade qubit performance, particularly for two-qubit entangling gates based on exchange coupling that are sensitive to electrical noise11,12. Here we benchmark silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS)-style electron spin qubits controlled by heterogeneously integrated cryo-complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (cryo-CMOS) circuits with a power density sufficiently low to enable scale-up. Demonstrating that cryo-CMOS can efficiently perform universal logic operations for spin qubits, we go on to show that milli-kelvin control has little impact on the performance of single- and two-qubit gates. Given the complexity of our sub-kelvin CMOS platform, with about 100,000 transistors, these results open the prospect of scalable control based on the tight packaging of spin qubits with a ‘chiplet-style’ control architecture.

 The nervous system has a pivotal role in cancer biology, and pathological investigations have linked intratumoural nerve density to metastasis1. However, the precise impact of cancer-associated neurons and the communication channels at the nerve–cancer interface remain poorly understood. Previous cancer denervation models in rodents and humans have highlighted robust cancer dependency on nerves, but the underlying mechanisms that drive nerve-mediated cancer aggressivity remain unknown2,3. Here we show that cancer-associated neurons enhance cancer metabolic plasticity by transferring mitochondria to cancer cells. Breast cancer denervation and nerve–cancer coculture models confirmed that neurons significantly improve tumour energetics. Neurons cocultured with cancer cells undergo metabolic reprogramming, resulting in increased mitochondrial mass and subsequent transfer of mitochondria to adjacent cancer cells. To precisely track the fate of recipient cells, we developed MitoTRACER, a reporter of cell-to-cell mitochondrial transfer that permanently labels recipient cancer cells and their progeny. Lineage tracing and fate mapping of cancer cells acquiring neuronal mitochondria in primary tumours revealed their selective enrichment at metastatic sites following dissemination. Collectively, our data highlight the enhanced metastatic capabilities of cancer cells that receive mitochondria from neurons in primary tumours, shedding new light on how the nervous system supports cancer metabolism and metastatic dissemination.

 Mantle upwellings drive large-scale surface volcanism and facilitate continental breakup and ocean basin formation. However, the spatial characteristics and internal composition of these upwellings alongside how they are modified by plate tectonics are poorly resolved. Afar, East Africa, is a classic triple junction comprising three rifts at various stages of evolution thought to be underlain by a mantle upwelling or plume, allowing examination of the controls on the mantle upwelling. Here we present geochemical data from >130 samples of ‘young’ volcanoes spanning the rifts defining the triple junction to show that the underlying mantle comprises a single, asymmetric upwelling. Using statistical modelling to integrate our data with existing geochemical and geophysical constraints, we suggest that Afar is fed by a spatially and chemically heterogeneous upwelling, which controls the composition and relative abundance of melt in all three rift arms. We identify repetitive signatures in mantle compositions in rift regions, whose variability is a longer wavelength in faster-extending rift arms. This suggests more rapid channelized mantle flow occurs where rifting rates are higher and the plate is thinner, aiding flow of the upwelling towards the faster-spreading Red Sea Rift. Our findings demonstrate how the evolution of mantle upwellings is influenced by the dynamics of overriding plates.

 Limiting climate warming to 1.5 °C requires reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and CO2 removal. While various CO2 removal strategies have been explored to achieve global net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and account for legacy emissions, additional exploration is warranted to examine more durable, scalable and sustainable approaches to achieve climate targets. Here we show that preserving woody debris in managed forests can remove gigatonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere sustainably based on a carbon cycle analysis using three Earth system models. Woody debris is produced from logging, sawmill wastes and abandoned woody products, and can be preserved in deep soil to lengthen its residence time (a measure of durability) by thousands of years. Preserving annual woody debris production in managed forests has the capacity to remove 769–937 GtCO2 from the atmosphere cumulatively (10.1–12.4 GtCO2 yr−1 on average) from 2025 to 2100, if its residence time is lengthened for 100–2,000 years and after 5% CO2 removal is discounted to account for CO2 emission due to machine operation for wood debris preservation. This translates to a reduction in global temperatures of 0.35–0.42 °C. Given the large potential, relatively low cost and long durability, future efforts should be focused on establishing large-scale demonstration projects for this technology in a variety of contexts, with rigorous monitoring of CO2 removal, its co-benefits and side-effects. Land surface modelling suggests that preserving woody debris in managed forests could remove 769–937 GtCO2 from the atmosphere between 2025 and 2100."

 Frameshifts can be caused by specific combinations of tRNA and mRNA. The wildtype AGC-decoding E. coli tRNASer3GCU has been shown to induce −1 ribosomal frameshifting on GCA alanine codons, and proposed to read a two-base codon instead of a canonical triplet. However, it has remained unclear whether this type of non-cognate decoding can be accommodated by the ribosome. Here, we perform single-particle cryo-EM reconstructions on E. coli 70S ribosomes with the frameshift-inducing tRNASer3 bound to the non-cognate GCA codon or the cognate AGC codon in the ribosomal A site. The structures demonstrate that doublet decoding is made possible when A1493, the conserved monitoring base in 16S rRNA, mimics a first codon base, forming a Hoogsteen base pair with U36 from the anticodon and stacking with the mRNA. This interaction pushes the first two bases of the A-site codon in position for base pairing with C35 and G34 of the anticodon.

Here, the authors analyse the early stages of melanoma development in mouse models of minimal genetic induction, identifying melanoma emergence with little evidence of consistent DNA mutation or common copy number variation. 
 Melanomas are genetically heterogeneous, displaying mitogen-activated protein kinase mutations and homozygous loss of tumor suppressor genes. Mouse models combining such mutations produce fast-growing tumors. In contrast, rare, slow-growing tumors arise in mice combining Braf activation with heterozygous loss of Pten. Here we show that similar tumors can arise in albino mice bearing only a Braf mutation. Incidence kinetics suggest a stochastic event underlies tumorigenesis in tumors that arise with only a Braf mutation, yet de novo mutations or structural variants that could explain the incidence of most tumors could not be found. Single-cell transcriptomics of tumors identify a cell type resembling “neural crest-like” cells in human and mouse melanomas. These exist in normal mouse skin, expand upon Braf activation, and persist through serial transplantation; analyses of gene expression suggest they serve as precursors of malignant cells. This state may serve as an intermediate on a slow path to malignancy that may provide a diagnostically and therapeutically important source of cellular heterogeneity.

Here, the authors show that subdural electric field stimulation delivered across the injury via an ultra-thin implant improves functional recovery in rats. 
 Spinal cord injury (SCI) can cause permanent loss of sensory, motor, and autonomic functions, with limited therapeutic options available. Low-frequency electric fields with changing polarity have shown promise in promoting axon regeneration and improving outcomes. However, the metal electrodes used previously were prone to corrosion, and their epidural placement limited the penetration of the electric field into the spinal cord. Here, we demonstrate that a thin-film implant with supercapacitive electrodes placed under the dura mater can safely and effectively deliver electric field treatment in rats with thoracic SCI. Subdural stimulation enhanced hind limb function and touch sensitivity compared to controls, without inducing a neuroinflammatory response in the spinal cord. While axon density around the lesion site remained unchanged after 12 weeks, in vivo monitoring and electrochemical testing of electrodes indicated that treatment was administered throughout the study. These results highlight the promise of electric field treatment as a viable therapeutic strategy for achieving long-term functional recovery in SCI.

 Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of acute hepatitis and mainly transmitted faecal-orally. HEV particles present in faeces are naked (nHEV), whereas those found in the blood are quasi-enveloped (eHEV) with a cell-derived lipid membrane. Despite its global health impact, the cellular life cycle of HEV remains poorly understood, particularly regarding the mechanisms of viral entry into host cells. To address this knowledge gap, we develop a high content RNA-FISH-based imaging assay that allows for the investigation of the entry pathways of both naked and quasi-enveloped HEV particles. Surprisingly, we find that integrin α3, previously implicated in nHEV cell entry, is not expressed in the cell types that are most permissive for HEV infection. Instead, we identify integrin β1 (ITGB1) pairing with different α-integrins as the key player mediating nHEV cell entry. Our results indicate that the interaction of nHEV with ITGB1 facilitates entry through Rab11-positive recycling endosomes. In contrast, eHEV particles do not interact with ITGB1 and enter cells using a classical endocytic route via Rab5a-positive early endosomes. The entry of both types of HEV particles requires endosomal acidification and proteolytic cleavage by lysosomal cathepsins, which ultimately results in delivery of the HEV genome to the cytoplasm.

 As wildfires grow increasingly complex, institutional adaptation—adjusting institutions to respond effectively to environmental changes—is crucial for enhancing wildfire management capabilities. However, institutional adaptation is a challenge as the connection between environmental changes and human institutions remains poorly understood. Here, by analysing trends in five incident characteristics linked to institutional complexity at national and regional levels from 1999 to 2020 in the USA, we show national trends of increasing institutional complexity of wildfire indicators associated with wildfire governance, logistics, management, resource scarcity and network coordination. Substantial regional variation was observed, with some cases exhibiting trends in opposite directions. For example, while average jurisdictional complexity showed an increase in the west, it decreased in the east. These results offer insight into the linkage between environmental change and demands for institutional adaptation and provide an empirical basis for considering potential trade-offs of different institutional adaptations in light of competing pressures.

This work reports an approach that can effectively produce gold from both primary and secondary resources without the use of toxic substances such as mercury or cyanide. 
 Gold plays an essential role in the global economy and has wide applications in various industrial technologies. Currently, the gold supply relies heavily on mining processes that employ toxic substances such as cyanide salts and mercury metal, leading to substantial environmental pollution. Gold extraction approaches that do not rely on cyanide and mercury are needed to improve the overall sustainability of gold production. Here we develop an approach for gold leaching and recovery from ore and electronic waste. This approach first uses trichloroisocyanuric acid, activated by a halide catalyst, to oxidatively dissolve gold metal from ore and electronic waste, and then applies a polysulfide polymer sorbent to selectively bind gold from the leachate. The gold can be recovered in high purity by pyrolysing or depolymerizing the sorbent. The efficacy of this approach in gold extraction was validated using ore, electronic waste and other gold-containing waste. Overall, this work provides a viable approach to achieve greener gold production from both primary and secondary resources, improving the sustainability of the gold supply.

 The bathymetric data is of great significance to coral reef protection. Traditional measurement methods have low efficiency, high cost, and are easily affected by natural conditions. Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) in the shallow water area has high efficiency. However, the accuracy of conventional single-band, logarithmic ratio, and multi-band model is easily affected by the difference of sediment types, that is, the portability of a single model is poor. It is necessary to take into account the coral reef sediment types and improve the accuracy of SDB. Fine sediment classification relies on field acoustic and spectral measurements, which is costly and subject to many restrictions. In this study, a subregional shallow water satellite-derived bathymetry method in combination with sediment information (SDB_SS) is proposed by integrating various algorithms. Firstly, based on the Sentinel-2 multi-spectral imagery, the study area is roughly divided into six types of sediment samples: Sand, Rubble, Seagrass, Rock, Microalgae mat, and Coral / Algae. Then, the sediment pixel information is counted, and the coral reef area is divided into three sub-regions of high, medium and low reflection by threshold segmentation method. Finally, combined with ICESat-2 and Sentinel-2 data, the improved subregional satellite-derived bathymetry model is constructed to obtain the shallow bathymetry results. Taking the Yongle Islands in the South China Sea as an example, root mean square error (RMSE), mean relative error (MRE), and mean absolute error (MAE) of the retrieval results are 0.97 m, 0.90 m and 21.23 %, respectively, compared with the measured depth. Compared with conventional single-band, logarithmic ratio, multi-band and other models, they are reduced by 0.27 m ∼ 1.65 m, 0.11 m ∼ 1.76 m and 2.5 % ∼ 65.27 %. It is proven that the proposed method can provide a reference for improving the SDB accuracy of coral reefs without measured spectral data."

 Accurate and timely mapping of agricultural products is a crucial component in management and decision-making for promoting food security and sustainable development. The intricacy of differentiating diverse croplands due to the existence of small and winding agricultural fragments contributes to the complexity of crop classification in arid environments. In this study, we employed a novel hybrid approach, integrating time-series analysis, noisy data quality control, and different machine learning and deep learning models to classify croplands of complex multi-crop systems in central Iran. The classification was based on time series spectral bands of Sentinel-2 images and indices of crop growth phenology, providing valuable insights into the growth cycles of different crops in the region. Additionally, a neural network-based method was used to assess and enhance the quality of training data before modeling. For crop classification, we used four machine learning and deep learning methods including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (TCNN), and compared their results before and after quality control measures. The results indicated that after quality control, the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the analyses were considerably improved. RF and TCNN methods demonstrated superior prediction and modeling performance compared to XGBoost and SVM models. The overall accuracy of the four methods increased from 91 %, 87 %, 83 %, and 91 % before quality control to 96 %, 94 %, 89 %, and 95 % after quality control, respectively.

 Satellite-based optical Remote Sensing (RS) presents a unique opportunity for monitoring the water quality of complex riverine systems stretching over large regions. However, due to the weak reflectance and resulting low signal-to-noise ratio of water bodies, interference of clouds and cloud shadows significantly impacts the accuracy of remotely sensed water quality parameters. This study presents a scalable, innovative cloud and cloud-shadow masking using the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) combined with a spatially aggregated reflectance sampling approach that can robustly monitor the Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and turbidity over selected sections of the study site, the Hooghly River in West Bengal, India. The statistical resampling approach based on GMM was applied to Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery to produce input to Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to retrieve the TSS and turbidity for target river sections. The resampled reflectance data was spatially aggregated over the selected regions of interest to further improve the input quality. Out of 80 cloud-contaminated images, we were able to use 70 images with 40%–50% clouds/cloud shadows for TSS and turbidity retrievals after applying the GMM-based masking and spatial aggregation. The resampled spectral data and in-situ TSS and turbidity measurements were used to train four ML models: Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Our approach improved the estimation accuracy of the TSS by 33% and turbidity by 28% compared to the input processed using the built-in Sentinel-2 cloud and cloud shadow masks.

 Monitoring and curbing methane emissions is an important means of slowing global warming. Existing quantitative segmentation methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers are limited in their ability to process large-scale remote sensing images. They are also susceptible to interference from species with similar spectral features, resulting in high false positive rates. To cope with these difficulties, we propose kMetha-Mamba — a k-means clustering mamba-based network for methane plumes segmentation. Specifically, the spatial feature encoder (SFE) is employed to extract clustering patches from the methane enhancement product for follow-up complementary learning with spectral information. Subsequently, similar pixels are clustered based on the ability of spectral derivative to distinguish between subtle spectral variations in a continuous region and species with similar spectral features. However, traditional k-means clustering algorithms are susceptible to the influence of outliers. In this study, we revisit the relationship between pixels and the selective scanning mechanism from the perspective of clustering, and propose k-means mamba to implement cluster center updating by multi-directional local scanning, which mitigates the effect of outliers on cluster centers. Finally, kMetha-Mamba utilizes a mamba-based decoder (MBD) with linear complexity and long-range dependencies to achieve high efficiency and precision segmentation. Extensive experiments on hyperspectral and multispectral datasets from different sensors have shown that kMetha-Mamba has the best performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Among them, it achieve the highest accuracy of 88.69% and the lowest false positive rates of 0.0466% on the AVIRIS-NG dataset."

 The optical response of pure materials (quartz, halite, pyrite, and pyrrhotite) typically composing mineral dust in central Los Andes was studied through their controlled deposition on a reflective surface and the measurement of the solar irradiance and the reflected radiance with a hyperspectral radiometric system. Results show that the refractive index, derived from the crystalline structure of the material, has a primary effect on its optical properties, while the size distribution of the particles has a secondary effect, which in some cases is counteracted by the type of crystallinity. These results are useful for understanding the effect of mineral dust on radiative forcing in sensitive areas, particularly on highly reflective surfaces such as snow or ice. Iron-rich minerals, like pyrite and pyrrhotite, contribute significantly to local warming due to their significant ability to reduce albedo, whereas quartz and halite show much lower radiation absorption. The experimental results were compared to results from a radiative transfer model based on the Mie theory, i.e., assuming spherical size- and composition-homogeneous particles. Although these assumptions are far from realistic, especially for anisotropic materials, modelled results show similar decreasing trends for spectral albedo with increasing concentrations of particles on the surface and were useful to suspect inaccurate refractive index spectral data (particularly the imaginary part) for some materials, such as the type of quartz used here. In the case of halite, whose imaginary part of the refractive index is nearly zero, the albedo was not substantially affected by the particle concentration, neither in experimental nor modelled results. On the contrary, the model was unable to predict the non-linear albedo reduction for pyrrhotite dust, which can be explained by the heterogeneities in the content of sulfur and impurities, therefore contributing to an increase in the light scattering, and thus in the albedo."

Synergy indices and analyses stratified by coexposure level were applied to characterize the synergistic impacts of PM2.5 and O3 on mortality. Modification effects of temperature and relative humidity were evaluated by stratified analyses. Deaths attributable to PM2.5 and O3 were calculated both with and without considering their synergy, as well as the influences of regional temperature and relative humidity. The increases in cardiorespiratory mortality every 10 μ g/m3 rise in PM2.5 and O3 are significantly greater under high O3 (2 %) and PM2.5 (1.10 %) levels than under low O3 (0.53 %) and PM2.5 (0.86 %) levels. The synergistic effects were more pronounced in low-temperature areas for cardiovascular mortality and in low-humidity areas for respiratory mortality.

 Unraveling the variations in δ2Hp and δ18Op within precipitation events of different intensities is essential for understanding the underlying mechanisms of meteorological phenomena and climate change processes. This study systematically analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution of δ2Hp and δ18Op in 539 atmospheric precipitation samples collected from 6 stations of the North China along a longitudinal gradient of East Asia during 2020–2022. This analysis also investagted moisture transport pathways and precipitation source composition. The results show that: (1) Precipitation events of varying intensity exhibit significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity within the study area. The δ2Hp and δ18Op values of all precipitation events are enriched in summer and autumn (δ2Hp: −54.8 ± 32.3 ‰; δ18Op: −8.5 ± 4.5 ‰) and depleted in winter and spring (δ2Hp: −32.8 ± 36.9 ‰; δ18Op: −5.4 ± 4.83 ‰). (2) The fluctuation of δ2Hp and δ18Op were less in the coastal sites between different precipitation intensities, while larger fluctuation appeared in the inland region. (3) Different geomorphological sub-regions exhibited notable heterogeneity in their Local Meteoric Water Line (LMWL). Relatively larger slope (10.16) of LWML appeared in the downpour (DP, 100 mm ≤ Dp (24-h daily precipitation amounts) < 200 mm) events compared to other precipitation intensities. (4) Environmental factors (include air temperature, precipitation amount, relative humidity, potential evaporation amount, wind speed and altitude) did not show a significant correlation with δ2Hp or δ18Op across the study region. (5) The composition of moisture sources for regional precipitation exhibits significant temporal variability, with an alternating dominance of oceanic sources during the rainy season and continental sources during the non-rainy season. (6) Continental moisture is the main source for regional extreme heavy precipitation events, particularly in autumn. The location shift of Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) is a key circulation factor contributing to extreme precipitation during this season.

 The chemical evolution and secondary reaction of inorganic aerosol during East Asian dust long-range transport have been extensively investigated. However, knowledge about the impact of dust on secondary organic aerosols (SOA) formation remains unclear. By combining online chemical observation of submicron aerosols and offline measurements of size-segregated aerosols in Shanghai, this study revealed that SOA dominated organic aerosols (OA) during the campaign and comprised biogenic SOA (BSOA), oxygenated OA (OOA) and aqueous-phase SOA (aqSOA). During the non-dust storm (NDS) periods, aqSOA prevailed, followed by OOA and BSOA, while in the dust storm (DS) periods OOA was dominant, followed by BSOA with a minor aqSOA. BSOA presented a similar size distribution pattern in both NDS and DS periods, with a predominant peak in the fine mode (<2.1 μm) and a minor peak in the coarse mode (>2.1 μm). However, OOA displayed a distinct size distribution pattern with a large peak in the fine mode and a small peak in the coarse mode during the NDS periods and only a large coarse-mode peak during the DS periods, respectively. HR-AMS analysis results further suggested that during the campaign OOA are composed of carboxylic acid-like compounds, which were produced largely by photochemical oxidation, BSOA was formed by photochemical oxidation of isoprene, while aqSOA was produced mainly through aqueous-phase reactions of carbonyls. Compared to those in the NDS periods, during the DS periods OOA formation was enhanced through reactive uptake by alkaline dust particles, particularly in the coarse mode. In contrast, aqSOA and BSOA formation was suppressed mainly due to dry conditions and reduced aerosol acidity in the DS periods."

 The electric field and current intensity within the discharge channel are the key parameters for lightning research and protection. Aiming at the difficulty that the electric field in the channel cannot be directly measured, based on the dependence of spectral line broadening on the electric field, this paper developed a method for indirectly measuring the electric field within the lightning channel according to the experimental spectrum. Based on the lightning spectra and the synchronous ground electric field change waveforms caused by lightning, the basic parameters reflecting the current-carrying capacity of the channel, such as electron density, conductivity, and radius, were calculated, and the inner electric field at the bottom of the lightning discharge channel was further obtained. In the calculation, two methods are adopted for the spectral line broadening: direct measurement of the spectral line profile and inversion from the electron density calculated by the Stark broadening theory of spectral lines. The results show that the radial electric field near the lightning channel and the axial electric field inside the channel are respectively 2.31–22.78 × 104 kV/m and 1.30–13.14 kV/m. The internal electric field values calculated by the two methods are in good agreement. To further confirm the reliability of the calculation results, the axial current in the channel is calculated by using Ohm's law from the calculated internal electric field, and compared with the peak current estimated by the synchronous electric field change waveform. It is found that they have a good positive correlation. Moreover, the peak current and the axial current are positively correlated with the radius of the current-carrying core channel, respectively."

 To elucidate the impact of boundary-layer meteorology on persistent heavy haze pollution, we analyzed 2018–2019 observational data from a 255-m meteorological tower in Tianjin. The boundary-layer evolution demonstrated that during the pollution period, the nocturnal static stability significantly intensified, with a daily maximum averaging approximately 18 K/km, accompanied by a jet stream structure. During the dissipation period, the ventilation coefficient, mechanical turbulence, and turbulent kinetic energy values were 1.5–3 times those recorded during the pollution period. Regarding the turbulent motion states, the continuous accumulation of PM2.5 was accompanied by enhanced turbulent intermittency. Over 80 % of the turbulent motion was in an intermittent state at heavy pollution levels. During the pollution accumulation period, the turbulent intermittency was more intense in the lower atmosphere, implying a stronger turbulence barrier effect restraining the upward diffusion of surface pollutants. The substantial increase in static stability, which hindered downward momentum transmission, was an important cause for weakening mechanical turbulence and enhancing turbulent intermittency. The negative correlation between the boundary-layer height and PM2.5 concentrations did not apply universally. During the pollution accumulation phase, no significant correlation was observed between these two parameters, suggesting a possible more direct impact by other physical processes. Spectral analysis of a case study showed significantly correlated semi-diurnal periodic signals between surface pressure and PM2.5 concentrations during the pollution accumulation period. A 2 hPa pressure oscillation could cause a 40–50 μg/m3 variation in PM2.5, leading to bimodal peaks of PM2.5 concentrations at night and late morning."

 The Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM), a pivotal climate system impacting a substantial portion of the global population, is one of the most influential monsoon systems due to its intensity and its crucial role in supporting agriculture and driving socio-economic development in India through seasonal rainfall. The 21st century has witnessed notable changes in the ISM dynamics attributed to global warming, resulting in spatiotemporal variabilities and heightened extreme weather events across the nation. Recent advancements in climate modeling, particularly the application of CMIP6 models, have facilitated a comprehensive analysis of climate change impacts on the ISM, enabling more accurate predictions of future variations in this monsoon system. This review synthesizes findings from recent research, emphasizing the examination of Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) variability and the principal climate drivers influencing it. CMIP6 models, distinguished by their enhanced resolution and incorporation of intricate physical processes, have demonstrated superior capabilities in simulating ISMR patterns compared to their predecessors. Teleconnections, notably El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and Atlantic Zonal Mode (AZM) play a central role in ISMR modulation, across climate scenarios, with amplified influence under the high emission SSP5–8.5 scenario. Insights from the reviewed literature underscore the improved precision of CMIP6 models in projecting ISMR changes, particularly in association with air-sea interactions and sea surface temperature fluctuations across different oceans. The study encompasses an in-depth examination of extreme conditions such as droughts and floods, emphasizing their increasing frequency in recent years. Against the backdrop of evolving ISMR dynamics due to climate change, the review advocates for further investigations into the influence of additional climate factors on ISM under future warming scenarios."

Single, optically trapped droplets were probed by using Raman bands as markers. We found the surface layer to act like a microscopic flow reactor, with chemical gradients providing access to unconventional reaction pathways. This observation revealed a general mechanistic scheme for distinctive droplet chemistry. Interfacial chemistry is a possible nonenergetic route for urea formation under prebiotic conditions."
10.1126/science.adv4314,False,Science,该研究论文主要关注细胞凋亡过程中BAX蛋白的结构和功能。它详细描述了BAX蛋白如何形成寡聚体，以及这些寡聚体如何导致线粒体外膜的通透性改变，从而促进细胞凋亡。研究通过冷冻电镜技术揭示了BAX蛋白重复单元的结构，并分析了不同寡聚体的组装方式。论文重点在于分子生物学和细胞生物学领域，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关联。,[],Ying Zhang;Lu Tian;Gaoxingyu Huang;Xiaofei Ge;Fang Kong;Pengqi Wang;Yige Xu;Yigong Shi,Structural basis of BAX pore formation,"During apoptosis, cytosolic BAX monomers are translocated to the mitochondria to permeabilize the outer membrane. Here, we identified a dimer of BAX dimers as the basic repeating unit of its various oligomeric forms: arcs, lines, and rings. Cryo–electron microscopy structure of the BAX repeating unit at 3.2-angstrom resolution revealed the interactions within and between dimers. End-to-end stacking of the repeating units through the protruding α9 pairs yielded lines, arcs, polygons, and rings. We structurally characterized the tetragon, pentagon, hexagon, and heptagon, which comprise 16, 20, 24, and 28 BAX protomers, respectively. Missense mutations at the BAX inter-protomer interface damage pore formation and cripple its proapoptotic function. The assembly principle of the various BAX oligomers reported here provides the structural basis of membrane permeabilization by BAX."

Their complex structures and nanoscale crystal sizes present challenges for analysis using conventional x-ray diffraction techniques, leading to inefficiencies in material development. We report NJU120-1 and NJU120-2, two robust and fully connected aluminosilicate nano zeolites featuring interconnected channel systems with extra-large 22-ring pores. NJU120-1 is a nanosheet with only about 8-nanometer thickness, corresponding to 1.5 unit cells, and NJU120-2 is a nanorod with 50 by 250 nanometer dimensions. Their synthesis optimization was greatly accelerated through rapid structure determination with MicroED, revealing their multidimensional pore structures. Their very large largest-free-sphere diameters of approximately 1.2 nanometers coupled with nano morphologies enabled catalytic cracking of large molecules."
10.1126/science.adx2723,False,Science,该研究论文主要关注的是一种新的有机化学方法，即通过连续的双碳-碳键活化实现羰基到硫原子的替换。该方法利用一种新型的N'-烷基-肼酰胺（NAHA）试剂，促使酮底物的两个α-C−C键发生均裂，最终用硫原子替换羰基中的碳原子。该方法具有广泛的底物适用性和优异的化学选择性，可以从容易获得的酮类化合物高效合成含硫骨架。该研究与大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析没有直接关系。,[],Zining Zhang and Guangbin Dong,Carbonyl-to-sulfur swap enabled by sequential double carbon-carbon bond activation,"In drug development, replacement of a skeletal carbon with a sulfur atom can result in analogs of bioactive compounds with improved properties. Currently, the sulfur analogs are almost exclusively prepared by de novo synthesis; the existing approach to swap carbon with sulfur is inefficient and involves stoichiometric mercury reagents. In this study, we report a two-step carbonyl-to-sulfur (CO-to-S) atom swap approach, enabled by a rationally designedN′-alkyl-hydrazonamide (NAHA) reagent that promotes forming pre-aromatic intermediates twice sequentially by different mechanisms, thereby achieving homolytic cleavage of both α-C−C bonds of the ketone substrates. A Ts−S−Ts (Ts,p-toluenesulfonyl) reagent mediates this process through successive intermolecular and intramolecular alkyl radical trapping by the central sulfur. This method shows a broad substrate scope and excellent chemoselectivity, providing a streamlined route to sulfur-containing scaffolds from readily available ketones."

In early Çatalhöyük, burials in the same building were frequently close genetic relatives, suggesting that houses were used by biological family members. In later periods, however, individuals buried in the same building were often genetically unrelated, despite sharing similar diets. We found no indication of sex-biased mobility into Çatalhöyük. Meanwhile, in all periods, within-building genetic connections were predominantly maternal rather than paternal. Burials of female subadults also received a higher frequency of gifts than male subadults. Our results reveal how kinship practices changed while specific practices prioritizing female lines persisted for 1000 years at Neolithic Çatalhöyük."

Recent research highlights a gap in understanding these interactions on human timescales, given rapid climatic change and urban expansion into hazard-prone zones. We review how surface processes such as coseismic landslides and post-fire debris flows form a complex sequence of events that exacerbate hazard susceptibility. Moreover, innovations in modeling, remote sensing, and critical zone science can offer new opportunities for quantifying cascading hazards. Looking forward, societal resilience can increase by transforming our understanding of cascading hazards through advances in integrating data into comprehensive models that link across Earth systems."
