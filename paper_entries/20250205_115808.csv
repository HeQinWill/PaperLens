10.1088/1748-9326/ada16f,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注生物能源与碳捕获和储存技术（BECCS）的开发和应用，以及专家对该技术未来发展潜力和成本效益的预测。研究通过专家调查的方式，评估了BECCS在不同地区和应用领域的潜力、成本、二氧化碳捕获能力以及可扩展性。其重点在于BECCS技术本身的经济性和可行性，以及不同地区专家观点的差异，而非大气环境遥感技术。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等，关系不大。,[],Tobias Heimann;Lara-Sophie Wähling;Tomke Honkomp;Ruth Delzeit;Alessandra Pirrone;Franziska Schier;Holger Weimar,Expert projections on the development and application of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage technologies,"Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is a crucial element in most modelling studies on emission pathways of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to limit global warming. BECCS can substitute fossil fuels in energy production and reduce CO2 emissions, while using biomass for energy production can have feedback effects on land use, agricultural and forest products markets, as well as biodiversity and water resources. To assess the former pros and cons of BECCS deployment, interdisciplinary model approaches require detailed estimates of technological information related to BECCS production technologies. Current estimates of the cost structure and capture potential of BECCS vary widely due to the absence of large-scale production. To obtain more precise estimates, a global online expert survey (N = 32) was conducted including questions on the regional development potential and biomass use of BECCS, as well as the future operating costs, capture potential, and scalability in different application sectors. In general, the experts consider the implementation of BECCS in Europe and North America to be very promising and regard BECCS application in the liquid biofuel industry and thermal power generation as very likely. The results show significant differences depending on whether the experts work in the Global North or the Global South. Thus, the findings underline the importance of including experts from the Global South in discussions on carbon dioxide removal methods. Regarding technical estimates, the operating costs of BECCS in thermal power generation were estimated in the range of 100–200 USD/tCO2, while the CO2 capture potential was estimated to be 50–200 MtCO2yr−1 by 2030, with cost-efficiency gains of 20% by 2050 due to technological progress. Whereas the individuals’ experts provided more precise estimates, the overall distribution of estimates reflected the wide range of estimates found in the literature. For the cost shares within BECCS, it was difficult to obtain consistent estimates. However, due to very few current alternative estimates, the results are an important step for modelling the production sector of BECCS in interdisciplinary models that analyse cross-dimensional trade-offs and long-term sustainability."
10.1088/1748-9326/ada6de,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注电动汽车的普及及其面临的挑战，包括定价、融资、充电基础设施、供应链中断以及公平性问题。它分析了影响电动汽车市场发展的各种因素，并提出了一种系统的公平框架，以促进电动汽车的公平普及。然而，文章并没有涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术的关系不大。,[],Hala Alshahapy;Joe F Bozeman;Sanya Carley;Destenie Nock;Daniel Matisoff,"Modern challenges facing electric vehicle adoption: a review of barriers to adoption, supply chain challenges, and equity","The automotive industry’s shift to electric vehicles (EVs) faces persistent barriers in pricing, financing, and charging infrastructure, particularly affecting low-income and disadvantaged individuals. These hurdles pose challenges to achieving US decarbonization goals and hinder the development of a sustainable and electrified transportation sector. Global disruptions in the supply chain, driven by the pandemic and geopolitical tensions, exacerbate these challenges, keeping EV purchase prices elevated. Key disruptors include critical mineral scarcity, semiconductor shortages, and international trade and COVID-19-related restrictions, complicating efforts to overcome adoption hurdles. Conducting a systematic review using Google Scholar and ScienceDirect, we focused on articles related to EV supply chain disruptions, equity, and adoption barriers published in English post-2009. We analyzed 130 articles for topical focus and key findings. Our exploration reveals insights into the challenges of electrifying the transportation sector while addressing equity concerns. Proposing a systemic equity framework, we advocate for the simultaneous and effective administration of resources, policies, and cultural considerations for systematically marginalized communities. This holistic approach aims to navigate the complexities of the EV supply chain, fostering a future marked by equitable transport electrification. The intersection of equity issues with supply chain challenges emphasizes the timeliness and importance of this academic examination. Our contribution to the ongoing discourse on achieving a sustainable and inclusive transition to EVs delves into the dynamics of these challenges, highlighting the need for comprehensive solutions."
10.1088/1748-9326/ada6e0,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇研究论文探讨了公众参与地理信息系统 (PPGIS) 在支持北卡罗来纳州夏洛特市环境正义 (EJ) 工作中的应用。它关注的是如何通过整合社区知识和参与来增强 EJ 工作。研究采用混合方法，包括研讨会、调查问卷和焦点小组讨论，以收集社区和个人对将 PPGIS 纳入当前 EJ 工作的战略意义的看法。虽然研究中使用了 NASA 遥感数据和环境筛选工具，但这主要用于支持社区参与和环境正义倡议，而不是直接进行大气环境遥感，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术的相关性较弱。,"['NASA remote sensing data', 'environmental screening tools', 'air quality']",Jacelyn Rice-Boayue;Laurie Garo;Elisabeth Ilboudo Nebie,Community stakeholder perspectives for empowering EJ initiatives through Public Participation Geographic Information Systems (PPGIS),"This study explores the use of Public Participation Geographic Information Systems (PPGIS) to support environmental justice (EJ) efforts in Charlotte, North Carolina by incorporating community knowledge and engagement. Through a workshop with representatives from community-based organizations (CBOs), participants learned about PPGIS, NASA remote sensing data, and environmental screening tools. A hands-on web-Geographic Information Science (GIS) demonstration allowed them to identify how PPGIS might address challenges in their EJ efforts. Using a mixed-methods approach, both surveys and focus group discussions were conducted to collect community and individual perspectives on the strategic implications of incorporating PPGIS into current EJ efforts. Thematic analysis of the focus groups revealed key themes of community engagement and representation, challenges with coordination, the power of GIS and data, political and policy advocacy, and holistic and intersectional approaches. Descriptive statistics and comparative insights from survey data revealed nuances in individual CBO representative’s perceived strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, complementing focus group narratives. Assessment of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of current efforts showed that coalition building, community involvement, and local knowledge were key strengths. In contrast, weaknesses included a perceived lack of influence over decision-makers and difficulty securing funding. The study concludes that PPGIS could strategically enhance community mobilization, facilitate collaboration, and advocate for policy change."
10.1088/1748-9326/adaa05,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注的是阿拉斯加地区土壤水含量变化和侧向水流对土壤热力学的影响。研究使用了一个三维生态系统模型，该模型考虑了地表和地下水文过程，模拟土壤水分，然后利用模拟的土壤水分驱动一维垂直土壤热力学模型，模拟土壤水分对土壤热力学的影响。结果表明，该耦合模型提高了土壤温度估算精度，尤其是在干旱季节，土壤水分对土壤温度的影响显著。侧向水流也对土壤水分和土壤温度有显著影响。总的来说，该研究强调了在永久冻土地区考虑土壤水分动态和侧向水流对土壤热力学的影响的重要性。该研究与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等关系不大，因为它主要关注的是地表过程和土壤物理性质。,[],Xiangyu Liu;Qianlai Zhuang;Chang Liao;M Torre Jorgenson,Changes in soil water content and lateral flow exert large effects on soil thermal dynamics across Alaskan landscapes,"Both lateral surface and subsurface water flow affect soil moisture dynamics, yet most land surface models only solve subsurface water movement vertically. Here, we use a 3D ecosystem model that considers both land surface and subsurface hydrologic processes to simulate soil moisture, which is then used to drive a 1-D vertical soil thermal model to simulate the soil moisture effects on soil thermal dynamics in central Alaska. Our coupled model improves soil temperature (ST) estimates by 43.5% in comparison with observational data. Soil moisture has little effect on ST during the wet season (−1.5%) and a substantial influence during the dry season (60%). Spatially, water lateral flow has significant impacts on both soil moisture and ST, causing model estimates for thawed areas in the transition season to increase by ∼10% in the study area. Our results highlight the importance of considering dynamical soil moisture, as well as lateral flow effects, on soil thermal dynamics in permafrost regions."

However, this process alters seawater chemistry, increasing total alkalinity and pH, which can directly influence marine organisms’ metabolic activities or indirectly impact them through changes in prey availability and quality. This study disentangled the OAE-driven factors that might influence zooplankton physiology. We assessed the direct effects of altered chemistry on the copepod, Temora longicornis, and the indirect effects through changes in the phytoplankton prey, Rhodomonas salina. We cultured the prey under OAE conditions and used it to feed copepods to investigate the indirect effects. We found that OAE negatively impacted prey growth but improved its nutritional quality, thereby offsetting the direct negative impact of OAE on the copepod. These findings regarding OAE’s impact on prey-predator dynamics contribute to a deeper understanding of how OAE may influence zooplankton communities."

TCR is highly correlated with near-term climate projections, and thus of relevance for climate policy, but remains poorly constrained in part due to uncertainties in the representation of key physical processes in Earth System Models (ESMs). Within state-of-the-art ESMs participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), the TCR range (1.1 ∘C–2.9 ∘C) is too wide to offer useful guidance to policymakers. Similarly, the sixth report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, while not solely reliant on ESMs for its TCR assessment, produced a very likely range of 1.2 ∘C–2.4 ∘C. To complement earlier, ESM-based, estimates, we here present a new TCR estimate of 2.17 (1.72–2.77) ∘C (95% confidence interval), derived based on a statistical relationship between surface air temperature and observational proxies for its main drivers, i.e. changes in atmospheric greenhouse gases and aerosols. We show that, within uncertainty, this method correctly diagnoses TCR from 20 CMIP6 ESMs if the same input variables are taken from the ESMs that are available from observations. This increases confidence in the new observation-based central estimate and range, which is respectively higher and narrower than the mean and spread of the estimates from the entire ensemble of CMIP6. Many ESM-based estimates tend to produce TCRs lower than the observational range reported here. Our findings suggest that a misrepresentation of the aerosol cooling effect could be the cause of this discrepancy. Further, the revised TCR estimate suggests a downward revision of the remaining carbon budgets aligned with the overarching goal of the Paris agreement."

It has been experiencing increasing nutrient emissions from anthropogenic activities since the 1970s. This paper describes total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) sources and transport in the GBM basin at a 0.5-degree resolution for the past (1970–2019) and future (2020–2050) according to Shared Socioeconomic Pathways scenarios. Our results indicate a three-fold increase in the delivery and export of TN and a two-fold increase of TP in the GBM basin between 1970 and 2019. Elevated nutrient levels are driven by agriculture mainly, with sewage discharge important particularly in the large number of densely populated urban areas. Continuing current nutrient management practices in a business as usual scenario will increase the risk of eutrophication in the GBM basin and the Bay of Bengal. Implementing nutrient reduction strategies in a sustainable scenario will reduce TN and TP loads and concentrations, but nutrient imbalances remain strong with continued risk of harmful algal blooms. These findings call for integrating nutrient stoichiometry with balanced nutrient reduction strategies to mitigate nutrient pollution in the GBM River basin."

This study quantitatively describes two distinct coupled patterns between autumn Arctic sea ice concentration in the Barents–Kara seas and the subsequent winter regional temperature over Eurasia. The leading coupled pattern dominantly depicts interannual variations of the cold Arctic―warm Eurasia or warm Arctic—cold Eurasia configuration, differing from the background warming pattern. While the second coupled pattern describes in-phase interannual variations of winter temperature over the Arctic and across much of Eurasia. This second pattern displayed an interdecadal transition in the early 2010s, from frequent occurrences of the cold Arctic―cold Eurasia pattern to the dominant warm Arctic―warm Eurasia configuration. Through this interdecadal transition, the warm Arctic―warm Eurasia configuration replaced the leading coupled pattern. The previously proposed the tropospheric and stratospheric processes cannot fully explain this Arctic―Eurasia temperature configuration. These findings underscore the pivotal role of Arctic sea ice melting in influencing the interannual and interdecadal variations of winter atmospheric circulation patterns and have significant implications for predicting short-term winter temperature trends over Eurasia."

On the global level, the two risks are widely recognized as trade-offs by the academic and policy literature: rapid decarbonisation increases transition risks while reducing physical risks, and vice versa for a delayed reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, little is known about the interaction between the two risks on smaller geographical scales. This paper investigates the interactions between physical and transition risks on the sub-national level for petroleum-based economies. Their strong dependency on the export of fossil fuels requires a more far-reaching economic restructuring to meet both local and global emission targets than most other economies, exposing them to high transition risks. At the same time, the profound economic changes resulting from a low-carbon transition lead to a spatial redistribution of assets and labour, when brown assets and jobs get stranded and new green assets and jobs are created elsewhere. Building on the literature on spatial economic restructuring and climate disaster risk, we show that, unlike the common conceptualisation as a trade-off, physical and transition risk can increase simultaneously on the sub-national level. We call this dynamic the climate change risk trap. The paper provides an empirical illustration of this trap using the example of flash flood risk in Kuwait, a wealthy petroleum-based economy in the Gulf region. It shows how decisions on urban planning and low-carbon economic restructuring have increased flash flood risk. The analysis highlights the importance of considering climate disaster risk and environmental impact assessments in low-carbon transition planning to avoid falling into the climate change risk trap."

High uncertainties in the bottom–up estimates of wetland CH4 emissions pose significant challenges for accurately understanding their spatiotemporal variations, and for the scientific community to monitor wetland CH4 emissions from space. In fact, there are large disagreements between bottom–up estimates versus top–down estimates inferred from inversion of atmospheric CH4 concentrations. To address these critical gaps, we review recent development, validation, and applications of bottom–up estimates of global wetland CH4 emissions, as well as how they are used in top–down inversions. These bottom–up estimates, using (1) empirical biogeochemical modeling (e.g. WetCHARTs: 125–208 TgCH4 yr−1); (2) process-based biogeochemical modeling (e.g. WETCHIMP: 190 ± 39 TgCH4 yr−1); and (3) data-driven machine learning approach (e.g. UpCH4: 146 ± 43 TgCH4 yr−1). Bottom–up estimates are subject to significant uncertainties (∼80 Tg CH4 yr−1), and the ranges of different estimates do not overlap, further amplifying the overall uncertainty when combining multiple data products. These substantial uncertainties highlight gaps in our understanding of wetland CH4 biogeochemistry and wetland inundation dynamics. Major tropical and arctic wetland complexes are regional hotspots of CH4 emissions. However, the scarcity of satellite data over the tropics and northern high latitudes offer limited information for top–down inversions to improve bottom–up estimates. Recent advances in surface measurements of CH4 fluxes (e.g. FLUXNET-CH4) across a wide range of ecosystems including bogs, fens, marshes, and forest swamps provide an unprecedented opportunity to improve existing bottom–up estimates of wetland CH4 estimates. We suggest that continuous long-term surface measurements at representative wetlands, high fidelity wetland mapping, combined with an appropriate modeling framework, will be needed to significantly improve global estimates of wetland CH4 emissions. There is also a pressing unmet need for fine-resolution and high-precision satellite CH4 observations directed at wetlands."

By using the three-pattern decomposition of global atmospheric circulation (3P-DGAC), this study recognizes the interdecadal changes of three-dimensional atmospheric circulation patterns associated with summer temperature anomalies in the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River (MLRYR), and further demonstrates that these related changes of atmospheric circulation patterns are modulated by the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). During the positive phase of the IPO, the three-dimensional atmospheric circulation patterns are characterized by the anticyclonic high at the middle and upper troposphere, and anomalous downdrafts along local meridional circulation near MLRYR. Then, in the negative phase of the IPO, alongside the aforementioned atmospheric circulation patterns, there are anomalous downdrafts along the local zonal circulation at the Eastern Tibetan Plateau (ETP). Through statistical and dynamical analysis, the emergence of local zonal circulation is attributed to the influences of positive sea surface temperature anomalies in North Atlantic during the negative phase of the IPO, which propagate to East Asia through intensified jet stream waviness. The findings of this study establish a synchronous linkage between ETP climate and downstream regions, offering significant implications for enhancing seasonal climate forecasting in the future."

On August 30, it made landfall along Florida’s Big Bend area as a Category 3 hurricane. Strikingly, despite Idalia’s moderate intensity and favorable vortex structure, neither upper ocean thermal energy nor environmental vertical wind shear conditions were as favorable during its intensification from Category 2 to Category 4 as earlier in its path, raising the question of what external factors contributed to its extreme intensification during this phase. Using satellite data, underwater glider observations, and numerical model outputs, this study reveals that, in addition to the 2023 marine heatwave, an extensive riverine plume in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, extending from the Mississippi-Alabama-Florida shelf to the Straits of Florida, produced a ∼20 m thick low-salinity layer (∼34–34.5 psu) and a corresponding warm upper ocean (>29 °C, ∼25–30 m thick). This defined a 10–20 m thick strongly stratified barrier layer below the surface layer with buoyancy frequencies exceeding 10−3 s−1 that suppresses vertical mixing and became a critical factor contributing to Idalia’s rapid intensification under the relatively less than favorable thermal and wind field environments. Therefore, incorporating the river plume in future forecast models appears to be essential to improve the accuracy of intensity predictions, especially in the areas affected by the plume, where stratification plays an important role in the intensification dynamics."

Quantile mapping (QM) has been widely used in bias correction (BC) due to its effectiveness in aligning the cumulative density function of climate model data with observations. However, QM has a significant limitation: it fails to consider the temporal correspondence between the model data and observations, which restricts its ability to represent intra-annual temporal patterns. To address this issue, this study integrated wavelet analysis (WA) into QM to develop a combined method termed WA-QM, which aimed to preserve QM’s efficacy in overall BC and preservation of climate change signals, while capturing the intra-annual temporal patterns. The effectiveness of WA-QM was investigated using monthly precipitation data from five Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 models in the Pan Third Pole region, which includes Central Asia (CA), Southeast Asia, and the Tibetan Plateau. Quantile delta mapping (QDM) and scaled distribution mapping (SDM) served as the benchmark methods for assessment. The results indicated that integrating WA into QDM or SDM did not compromise the ability of QDM or SDM to correct overall biases and preserve the model’s climate change signal. Furthermore, WA could be an effective tool to overcome QM’s limitation in capturing intra-annual temporal patterns. The WA approach employed discrete wavelet transformation to decompose GCM data into various frequency bands and then adjusted their standard deviations and signs to ensure that their relative relationships were consistent with those in observations. Compared to the standalone QM approach, WA-QM showed greater accuracy in monthly statistical metrics.

However, intercomparisons of extreme events are often hampered by inconsistent definitions and standardizations for different types of events. Here we introduce the Optimal Path Threshold (OPT) method, a dynamic programming-based approach that adaptively determines optimal thresholds for defining extreme events at specific severity levels. Two case studies demonstrate its applicability. The first case study presents a long-term comparison of air heatwaves and lake heatwaves in Lake Mead. The algorithm adaptively selects thresholds to identify a comparable number of events at various severity levels. The second case study examines compound hot, dry, and windy events in California, exploring threshold selection for multivariable extremes and investigating their potential relationship with wildfires.

Hamburg;Ritesh Gautam,Small emission sources in aggregate disproportionately account for a large majority of total methane emissions from the US oil and gas sector,"We utilize peer-reviewed facility-level oil and gas methane emission rate data gathered in prior work to estimate the relative contributions of methane sources emitting at different emission rates in the United States. We find that the majority of total methane emissions in the US oil and gas sector stem from a large number of small sources emitting in aggregate, corroborating findings from several other studies. 
 Reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas (oil–gas) sector has been identified as a critically important global strategy for reducing near-term climate warming. Recent measurements, especially by satellite and aerial remote sensing, underscore the importance of targeting the small number of facilities emitting methane at high rates (i.e., “super-emitters”) for measurement and mitigation. However, the contributions from individual oil–gas facilities emitting at low emission rates that are often undetected are poorly understood, especially in the context of total national- and regional-level estimates. In this work, we compile empirical measurements gathered using methods with low limits of detection to develop facility-level estimates of total methane emissions from the continental United States (CONUS) midstream and upstream oil–gas sector for 2021. We find that of the total 14.6 (12.7–16.8) Tg yr−1 oil–gas methane emissions in the CONUS for the year 2021, 70 % (95 % confidence intervals: 61 %–81 %) originate from facilities emitting <100kgh-1 and 30 % (26 %–34 %) and ∼80 % (68 %–90 %) originate from facilities emitting <10 and <200kgh-1, respectively. While there is variability among the emission distribution curves for different oil–gas production basins, facilities with low emissions are consistently found to account for the majority of total basin emissions (i.e., range of 60 %–86 % of total basin emissions from facilities emitting <100kgh-1). We estimate that production well sites were responsible for 70 % of regional oil–gas methane emissions, from which we find that the well sites that accounted for only 10 % of national oil and gas production in 2021 disproportionately accounted for 67 %–90 % of the total well site emissions. Our results are also in broad agreement with data obtained from several independent aerial remote sensing campaigns (e.g., MethaneAIR, Bridger Gas Mapping LiDAR, AVIRIS-NG (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging System – Next Generation), and Global Airborne Observatory) across five to eight major oil–gas basins. Our findings highlight the importance of accounting for the significant contribution of small emission sources to total oil–gas methane emissions. While reducing emissions from high-emitting facilities is important, it is not sufficient for the overall mitigation of methane emissions from the oil and gas sector which according to this study is dominated by small emission sources across the US. Tracking changes in emissions over time and designing effective mitigation policies should consider the large contribution of small methane sources to total emissions."

In regions where plumes are thick and background aerosol is low, models and satellites compare well. However, the input emission inventory tends to underestimate in many places, and particle property and loss rate assumptions vary enormously among models, causing uncertainties that require systematic in situ measurements to resolve. 
 We assessed the biomass burning (BB) smoke aerosol optical depth (AOD) simulations of 11 global models that participated in the AeroCom phase III BB emission experiment. By comparing multi-model simulations and satellite observations in the vicinity of fires over 13 regions globally, we (1) assess model-simulated BB AOD performance as an indication of smoke source–strength, (2) identify regions where the common emission dataset used by the models might underestimate or overestimate smoke sources, and (3) assess model diversity and identify underlying causes as much as possible. Using satellite-derived AOD snapshots to constrain source strength works best where BB smoke from active sources dominates background non-BB aerosol, such as in boreal forest regions and over South America and southern hemispheric Africa. The comparison is inconclusive where the total AOD is low, as in many agricultural burning areas, and where the background is high, such as parts of India and China. Many inter-model BB AOD differences can be traced to differences in values for the mass ratio of organic aerosol to organic carbon, the BB aerosol mass extinction efficiency, and the aerosol loss rate from each model. The results point to a need for increased numbers of available BB cases for study in some regions and especially to a need for more extensive regional-to-global-scale measurements of aerosol loss rates and of detailed particle microphysical and optical properties; this would both better constrain models and help distinguish BB from other aerosol types in satellite retrievals. More generally, there is the need for additional efforts at constraining aerosol source strength and other model attributes with multi-platform observations."

The long-term stability of the data record is further improved through scaling of the profiles using as a reference the GOME-type Total Ozone Essential Climate Variable (GTO-ECV) data record. 
 We present the GOME-type Ozone Profile Essential Climate Variable (GOP-ECV) data record covering the 26-year period from July 1995 until October 2021. It is derived from a series of five nadir-viewing ultraviolet-visible(-near-infrared) satellite instruments of the GOME-type, including GOME/ERS-2, SCIAMACHY/ENVISAT, OMI/Aura, GOME-2/MetOp-A, and GOME-2/MetOp-B, which are merged into a single coherent long-term time series. It provides monthly mean ozone profiles at a spatial resolution of 5° x 5° latitude by longitude. The profiles are given as partial columns for 19 atmospheric layers ranging from the surface up to 80 km. The underlying profile retrieval algorithm is the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory scheme, which has sensitivity to both tropospheric and stratospheric amounts of ozone. The merged profile record has been developed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in the framework of the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative+ (ESA-CCI+) ozone project (Ozone_CCI+). Profiles from the individual instruments are first harmonized through careful inspection and elimination of inter-sensor deviations and drifts and then merged into a combined record. In a further step, the merged time series is harmonized with the GOME-type Total Ozone Essential Climate Variable (GTO-ECV) data record, which is based on nearly the same satellite sensors. GTO-ECV possesses an excellent long-term stability and with the homogenization an improvement of the robustness and stability of the merged profiles can be achieved. For this purpose, an altitude-dependent scaling is applied that utilizes ozone profile Jacobians obtained from a Machine Learning approach. We found that climatological ozone distributions derived from the final GOP-ECV data record agree with spatial and temporal patterns obtained from other long-term data records."

It examines data quality and potential problems and clarifies misunderstandings between configurations. The findings highlight 2D PPPARs' challenges in making accurate weather measurements when the beam steers off broadside. The CPPAR shows promise in obtaining high-quality polarimetric data due to its azimuthal scan-invariant beam characteristics. 
 The initial weather measurements from two polarimetric phased-array radars (PPARs) with cylindrical and planar configurations, both developed by the Advanced Radar Research Center (ARRC) at the University of Oklahoma (OU), were compared with those from the dish antenna systems, the operational KTLX Weather Surveillance Radar 1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (∼ 23 km northeast of OU). Both the cylindrical PPAR (CPPAR) and the planar PPAR (PPPAR) Horus are S-band two-dimensional (2D) electronic scan PPARs. This comparison investigates the error statistics of the polarimetric measurements in one-dimensional (1D) electronic scans from each radar during two convective rain events. The first event occurred on 30 August 2019, when the CPPAR performed a 3.3° elevation plan-position indicator (PPI) scan at 25 azimuth angles. The second event took place on 4 October 2023, when Horus conducted range–height indicator (RHI) scans at 64 elevations. For both events, KTLX provided volumetric polarimetric radar data and served as the reference. To ensure temporal and spatial alignment between the radars, reconstructed RHI scans and PPI sectors from KTLX were matched to the corresponding Horus rays and CPPAR domain, respectively. The standard deviations and mean biases of the PPAR weather measurements were calculated and analyzed. The standard deviations of the two PPARs were similar and met the Radar Functional Requirements (RFR) set by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Weather Service. However, as noted in previous studies, the standard deviation and biases of polarimetric variables from Horus exhibited varying error characteristics depending on the electronic steering angle from broadside. The present results suggest that PPPARs may have difficulties in producing high-quality polarimetric data at large steering angles, and further investigation on CPPARs is required to find the optimal design for future weather applications."

Turk-Kubo,Global biogeography of N2-fixing microbes: nifH amplicon database and analytics workflow,"Nitrogen is crucial in ocean food webs, but only some microbes can fix N2 gas into a bioavailable form. Most are known only by their nifH gene sequence. We created a software workflow for nifH data and ran it on 944 ocean samples, producing a database (DB) that captures the global diversity of N2-fixing marine microbes and the environmental factors that influence them. The workflow and DB can standardize analyses of past and future nifH datasets to enable insights into marine communities. 
 Marine dinitrogen (N2) fixation is a globally significant biogeochemical process carried out by a specialized group of prokaryotes (diazotrophs), yet our understanding of their ecology is constantly evolving. Although marine N2 fixation is often ascribed to cyanobacterial diazotrophs, indirect evidence suggests that non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs (NCDs) might also be important. One widely used approach for understanding diazotroph diversity and biogeography is polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a portion of the nifH gene, which encodes a structural component of the N2-fixing enzyme complex, nitrogenase. An array of bioinformatic tools exists to process nifH amplicon data; however, the lack of standardized practices has hindered cross-study comparisons. This has led to a missed opportunity to more thoroughly assess diazotroph diversity and biogeography, as well as their potential contributions to the marine N cycle. To address these knowledge gaps, a bioinformatic workflow was designed that standardizes the processing of nifH amplicon datasets originating from high-throughput sequencing (HTS). Multiple datasets are efficiently and consistently processed with a specialized DADA2 pipeline to identify amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). A series of customizable post-pipeline stages then detect and discard spurious nifH sequences and annotate the subsequent quality-filtered nifH ASVs using multiple reference databases and classification approaches. This newly developed workflow was used to reprocess nearly all publicly available nifH amplicon HTS datasets from marine studies and to generate a comprehensive nifH ASV database containing 9383 ASVs aggregated from 21 studies that represent the diazotrophic populations in the global ocean. For each sample, the database includes physical and chemical metadata obtained from the Simons Collaborative Marine Atlas Project (CMAP). Here we demonstrate the utility of this database for revealing global biogeographical patterns of prominent diazotroph groups and highlight the influence of sea surface temperature. The workflow and nifH ASV database provide a robust framework for studying marine N2 fixation and diazotrophic diversity captured by nifH amplicon HTS. Future datasets that target understudied ocean regions can be added easily, and users can tune parameters and studies included for their specific focus.

A data set that might improve our understanding of biosphere-cloud interactions and the dynamics of bioaerosols in the atmosphere. 
 Fluorescent aerosol particles (FAPs) as a fraction of total aerosol particles (TAPs) were measured online with a Wideband Integrated Bioaerosol Sensor 5/NEO (WIBS, Droplet Measurement Technologies) from mid-September to mid-December during the Pallas Cloud Experiment 2022 (PaCE22) at the Sammaltunturi station, located in the sub-Arctic region of Finnish Lapland. The WIBS measures particle size distributions from 0.5 to 30 µm and fluorescence in three channels of single aerosol particles, as well as particle concentrations. Since most biological aerosol particles exhibit intrinsic fluorescence, FAP concentration can be used as a proxy for primary biological aerosol particles (PBAPs) like bacteria, fungal spores and pollen. The concentrations and size distributions of different fluorescent particles, together with meteorological data and air mass trajectories allow valuable insights to the emission of PBAPs from northern boreal forests and their dynamic in the atmosphere. We found a clear seasonal trend for most FAP types and a strong, sudden decrease in concentration after the surrounding ground is covered in snow. Caution should be taken in interpreting the data, as interference may be introduced by non-biological fluorescent particles like secondary organic aerosols or soot, as well as biological secondary organic aerosol.

The generated product exhibits good consistency with existing datasets and provides finer spatial detail compared to global SOC products. This SOCD dataset offers valuable insights into the long-term status of soil health in China and enhances our understanding of the response of soil organic carbon to global warming and human activities. 
 Soil organic carbon (SOC) is an important component of the worldwide carbon cycle as a vital indicator of soil quality and ecosystem health, with significant implications for agricultural production and climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. Although there are some studies on mapping the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon density (SOCD), the long-time series SOCD products in China are still lacking. Therefore, this study proposed a new algorithm with climatic zoning, aiming to improve the accuracy of predicting SOC densities with depths of 0–20 cm and 0–100 cm from 1985 to 2020. The data sources used in this study include Landsat archives, topographic data, meteorological data, and measured SOCD data. The innovation lies in the zoning models by climate regions using a random forest ensemble learning approach for SOCD estimation in China. The predicted results show that our zoning model outperformed the global model without climate zoning in predicting SOCD with R2=0.55 and RMSE=2.19 for 0–20 cm SOCD estimation and R2=0.52 and RMSE=6.50 for 0–100 cm. Comparably, the SOCD estimation using the global model is with R2=0.46 and RMSE=2.36 for 0–20 cm SOCD estimation and R2=0.44 and RMSE=8.09 for 0–100 cm. Moreover, our 0–20 cm SOCD predictions align well with independent samples (R²=0.69, RMSE=2.01) and are further validated with Xu's dataset (R²=0.63, RMSE=1.82). Furthermore, the comparisons with the published SOC content products including HWSD, SoilGrids250m, and GSOCmap have also shown good consistency, too. Comparably, our predicted SOCD is the best fit with SoilGrids250m products with R2=0.72 and RMSE=1.35.

It utilizes data from multiple tide gauges, enhancing predictions even with limited historical data and during sensor outages. With its advanced architecture, HIDRA3 outperforms current state-of-the-art models by achieving a mean absolute error of up to 15 % lower, proving effective for coastal flood forecasting under diverse conditions. 
 Accurate modeling of sea level and storm surge dynamics with several days of temporal horizons is essential for effective coastal flood responses and the protection of coastal communities and economies. The classical approach to this challenge involves computationally intensive ocean models that typically calculate sea levels relative to the geoid, which must then be correlated with local tide gauge observations of sea surface height (SSH). A recently proposed deep-learning model, HIDRA2 (HIgh-performance Deep tidal Residual estimation method using Atmospheric data, version 2), avoids numerical simulations while delivering competitive forecasts. Its forecast accuracy depends on the availability of a sufficiently long history of recorded SSH observations used in training. This makes HIDRA2 less reliable for locations with less abundant SSH training data. Furthermore, since the inference requires immediate past SSH measurements as input, forecasts cannot be made during temporary tide gauge failures. We address the aforementioned issues using a new architecture, HIDRA3, that considers observations from multiple locations, shares the geophysical encoder across the locations, and constructs a joint latent state that is decoded into forecasts at individual locations. The new architecture brings several benefits: (i) it improves training at locations with scarce historical SSH data, (ii) it enables predictions even at locations with sensor failures, and (iii) it reliably estimates prediction uncertainties. HIDRA3 is evaluated by jointly training on 11 tide gauge locations along the Adriatic. Results show that HIDRA3 outperforms HIDRA2 and the Mediterranean basin Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) setup of the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) by ∼ 15 % and ∼ 13 % mean absolute error (MAE) reductions at high SSH values, creating a solid new state of the art. The forecasting skill does not deteriorate even in the case of simultaneous failure of multiple sensors in the basin or when predicting solely from the tide gauges far outside the Rossby radius of a failed sensor. Furthermore, HIDRA3 shows remarkable performance with substantially smaller amounts of training data compared with HIDRA2, making it appropriate for sea level forecasting in basins with high regional variability in the available tide gauge data."

In this study, we investigated the impact of the two-step sulfidation method on the physicochemical properties and reactivity of magnetite with trichloroethene (TCE). We systematically evaluated the effect of different sulfur precursors (dithionite, thiosulfate, and sulfide) and sulfur-to-iron ([S/Fe]dosed) molar ratios on the reactivity. Results were compared to those of sulfidated nZVI (S-nZVI) as a benchmark for assessing the efficacy of sulfidated magnetite (S–Fe3O4). The findings indicated limited reactivity of magnetite when sulfidated with dithionite and thiosulfate. However, sulfidation with sulfide yielded reaction rates comparable to those of S-nZVI, particularly at lower [S/Fe]dosed ratios. At higher [S/Fe]dosed ratios (>0.1), sulfide-sulfidated magnetite (S–Fe3O4_S) exhibited reaction rates surpassing those of S-nZVI, with the major dechlorination product being acetylene. Nonetheless, reusability experiments demonstrated that the performance of S–Fe3O4 diminished with aging.

However, hydrolysis of PFCs, such as CF4, usually suffers from a drastic activity decline during the induction period, which seriously hinders its conversion performances and practical applications. In this work, we found that the carbonaceous (*COO) species account for the activity decline during the induction period, and their detoxification could promote PFC hydrolysis at low temperature. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) shows that the poisoning signals belong to *COO species on the surface of γ-Al2O3 during CF4 catalytic hydrolysis. The adsorption configuration of *CFOH intermediate is the key to the formation of poisoned *COO species. By introducing Ni sites with strong *CFOH adsorption capacity into γ-Al2O3, the *CFOH at the Al active site can transfer to the adjacent Ni site to avoid the formation of poisoned *COO species, which was proved by DRIFTS and density functional theory. As a result, the optimal 0.1Ni/γ-Al2O3 (10% Ni loaded γ-Al2O3) catalyst achieved 100% CF4 conversion without any activity decline at 570 °C for over 300 h, much higher than that of ∼55% CF4 conversion on pure γ-Al2O3 at the same temperature.

Johnson,Interception History Drives Colloid Transport Variance in Porous Media,"Colloid transport in porous media is traditionally predicted using the principle of constant fractional removal for each grain passed, such that concentrations decrease exponentially with transport distance. This approach successfully describes transport when repulsive barriers to attachment are absent. However, repulsive barriers characterize environmental contexts wherein attachment upon grain interception is inhibited, causing colloid concentrations to decay nonexponentially with distance from the source and thwarting prediction. The pervasiveness of these nonexponential trends across wide-ranging experiments suggests that a fundamental process is at play. Here, we propose a paradigm shift by considering constant fractional loss with each interception rather than with each grain passed. We show that by recognizing the history of grain interceptions, a pathway is revealed toward a simple and predictive framework in which nonexponential trends emerge. This shift in perspective offers the possibility of colloid transport prediction in settings that were previously infeasible using classic filtration theory, with potential applications in contexts ranging from environmental (e.g., groundwater aquifer protection) to biomedical (e.g., drug delivery)."

We combine 15 years of daily species-specific PM2.5 concentrations from 700 air pollution monitors with satellite-derived ambient wildfire smoke PM2.5, and use a panel regression to estimate wildfire smoke’s contribution to the concentrations of 27 different chemical species in PM2.5. Wildfire smoke drives detectable increases in the concentration of 25 out of the 27 species with the largest increases observed for organic carbon, elemental carbon, and potassium. We find that smoke originating from wildfires that burned structures had higher concentrations of copper, lead, zinc, and nickel relative to smoke from fires that did not burn structures. Wildfire smoke is responsible for an increasing share of ambient concentrations of multiple species, some of which are particularly harmful to health. Using a risk assessment approach, we find that wildfire-induced enhancement of carcinogenic species concentrations could cause increases in population cancer risk, but these increases are very small relative to other environmental risks.

Hydroxyl radicals (•OH)-mediated electrochemical processes show promise; however, the bond energies associated with carbon-heteroatom bonds exceed 200 kJ/mol, which constrains the effectiveness of oxidative degradation and detoxification. We have developed a paired electrolysis process coupling hydrogen atom (H*) generation at the cathode with •OH production at the anode. The involvement of H* and •OH in this system was first confirmed by using methylene blue (MB) as an electrochemical probe. When applied to the degradation of glyphosate (GP), which contains C–N bonds, the paired electrolysis process achieved removal efficiencies for COD, TOC, and toxicity that were twice those of individual oxidation processes. The degradation kinetics also exhibited performance that was double that of individual oxidation processes. Mass spectrometry and theoretical calculations confirmed that hydrogenolysis of H* effectively attacks high-energy C–N bonds, thereby circumventing the rate-limiting steps associated with standalone •OH oxidation, enhancing pollutant degradation and reducing toxicity. When applied to pollutants containing C–O and C–S bonds, the paired electrolysis process demonstrated improvements in COD, TOC, and toxicity removal of approximately 30%, 10%, and 20%, respectively, showcasing its multifunctionality and scalability.

TOMCAT qualitatively agrees with the ACE‐FTS LS N2O and HCl trends, confirming that transport variability drives such patterns, despite some discrepancies for O3. An additional model simulation is used to quantify the sensitivity of O3 to long‐term changes in chlorine and bromine and thus determine the chemical contribution of the spatially varying halogen trends to both observed and modeled O3 trends. Overall, the recent dynamically induced variation in mid‐latitude LS halogen abundance has, through chemical feedback, accentuated the O3 recovery signal in the SH and delayed it in the NH, reflecting the enhanced dynamical variability of the NH. These results further indicate the complexities that exist in the search for the signal of ozone recovery in the mid‐latitude LS."
10.1029/2024EF004988,False,Earth's Future,这篇研究论文主要关注的是气候变暖对森林土壤碳储存、稳定性和饱和度的影响。研究人员通过在中国5000公里长的森林样带进行采样，并整合全球数据集，发现气候变暖不仅减少了易分解的颗粒有机物，也降低了通常稳定的矿物结合有机物，从而导致土壤碳储存总量显著下降。此外，变暖的气候还会促进铁铝氧化物的结晶，降低铁铝氧化物结合有机复合物的形成效率，导致矿物碳饱和度下降。该研究强调了土壤地球化学性质在塑造森林土壤有机碳组成和饱和度方面的重要作用，以及气候变暖可能导致土壤碳储存减少，削弱其减缓气候变化的能力。总的来说，该研究属于土壤科学和生态学领域，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。,[],Yuntao Wu;Ziyang Peng;Xin Wang;Junsheng Huang;Lu Yang;Lingli Liu,"Warmer Climate Reduces the Carbon Storage, Stability and Saturation Levels in Forest Soils","Forest soils store about one‐fifth of the global terrestrial biosphere carbon stock. However, our understanding of how soil geochemical, plant and microbial factors regulate forest soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, stability, and saturation levels remains limited. Here, we conducted a sampling campaign across a 5000‐km natural forest transect in China, measuring climate, geochemical factors and SOC fractions with varying stability. Additionally, we compiled a global data set of SOC fractions in major forest biomes. Our field survey and global synthesis consistently demonstrate that warmer climates not only reduce the content of labile particle organic matter (POM), but also decrease the typically stable mineral‐associated organic matter (MAOM), leading to a significant decline in total soil carbon storage. Additionally, warmer climates promote the crystallization of Fe/Al oxides, which decreases the formation efficiency of Fe/Al oxide associated organic complexes. Consequently, the mineralogical carbon saturation level declines from boreal forests (37%) to tropical forests (25%). Our findings underscore that, beyond the well‐established climate impacts, soil geochemical properties play a pivotal role in shaping forest SOC composition and saturation levels across latitudes. This highlights that colder regions harbor larger and more stable carbon pools, and that ongoing climate warming and associated soil geochemical properties shift could potentially lead to a decline in soil carbon storage and its capacity to mitigate climate change."

 Asymmetric multicomponent reactions that aim to control multiple chiral centers with high selectivity in a single step remain an on-gonging challenge. The realm of enantioselective radical-polar crossover transformation achieved through C-H Functionalization has yet to be fully explored.

A diverse array of chiral homoallylic alcohols could be obtained in good to excellent yields, accompanied by outstanding enantioselectivity. The asymmetric radical-polar crossover transformation could build two chiral centers simultaneously and demonstrates broad substrate tolerance, accommodating various drug-derived aldehydes, (hetero)aromatics, and 1,3-diene derivatives. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate the involvement of a radical intermediate, with the chiral allylic chromium species reacting with various aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes through Zimmerman–Traxler transition states enabled by dual photoredox and chiral chromium catalysis.

The introduction of hypothetical pathways of gender (in)equality in the scenario space can help analyse interactions with other socioeconomic drivers and subsequent implications for adaptation and mitigation options. The extent of challenges to climate change adaptation and mitigation may substantially change depending on the rate at which societies progress towards equal access to resources and opportunities for self-realization for all genders.

Focusing on Japan, with its extreme ageing demographic, our study assesses the health impacts of PM2.5 across different age segments from a spatial–temporal perspective while considering the uneven distribution of medical resources across different regions. We find that the Baby Boomer generation, born in the 1950s, faces a statistical value of life that is approximately 52% higher than that of other generations, signifying that individuals of this generation are more likely to bear increased costs for health issues caused by long-term exposure to PM2.5. On the basis of 170,000 medical-clinic records across Japan, our research reveals that the disease burden exacerbated by mismatches in medical resources has become increasingly evident, affecting over 86% of the areas we studied, with remote regions in West Japan being particularly vulnerable. These findings highlight the amplified challenges posed by demographic shifts, the need for targeted health and environmental policies, and serve as a critical warning for regions facing similar issues. PM2.5 pollution can have a detrimental effect on human health, especially for elderly populations, due to the ageing process. This study examines the social–economic impact of such pollution on different age segments and healthcare systems across Japan, a country with a super-ageing society."
10.1038/s43247-025-02081-y,True,Communications Earth & Environment,这篇论文研究了联合国教科文组织生物圈保护区网络在维持森林生态系统功能方面的有效性。研究人员利用卫星数据评估了全球119个森林生物圈保护区内外的生态系统功能差异，发现只有18个保护区的生态系统功能指标在所有方面都优于周边地区。研究结果表明，更大的森林覆盖率与更强的生态系统功能正相关，而较小的、位于破碎森林景观中的保护区更容易受到高温的影响。该研究强调了生物圈保护区对生物多样性保护的潜在意义，以及在评估保护区有效性时整合基于卫星的、面向结果的生态系统功能指标的必要性。 这项研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它使用了卫星数据来监测和评估森林生态系统功能，这是一种间接的大气环境遥感应用。,"['Forest ecosystem functions', 'Satellite-derived proxies', 'Remote sensing', 'Ecosystem services', 'Biodiversity conservation', 'Forest cover', 'Biosphere reserves']",Charlotte Gohr;Henrik von Wehrden;Sassan Saatchi;Nathalie Pettorelli;Pierre L.

 UNESCO biosphere reserves serve as learning areas for sustainable development, where preserving ecosystem functionality is an imperative. However, this critical assumption has yet to be thoroughly examined. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated differences in satellite-derived proxies of ecosystem functions in forests between inside and surrounding areas of biosphere reserves, globally. Our findings based on linear mixed effect models show that (i) only 18 of 119 biosphere reserves exhibited higher values for all forest ecosystem function proxies inside the reserves compared to outside, (ii) smaller reserves in fragmented forestscapes were more affected by hot day temperatures, and (iii) greater forest cover correlated with increased ecosystem functioning across all biomes. This study underscores the potential significance of biosphere reserves to biodiversity conservation efforts and the need for the integration of satellite-based, outcome-oriented proxies of ecosystem functions in assessments of protected area effectiveness. Only 18 of 119 forests within the world network of biosphere reserves perform better for all ecosystem functions than those outside, with increased functions correlated to greater forest cover regardless of biome, according to a multi-proxy evaluation."

This conclusion is supported by satellite observations, alongside gas measurements and geochemical analyses. 
 The 2017–2018 eruption of Ambae volcano provided a rare opportunity to investigate gas emissions during a sub-Plinian basaltic eruption. Here we document the gas emissions during this eruption using satellite observation, alongside gas measurements and geochemical analyses. Our results indicate that the volcano released 3.3 teragrams of sulfur dioxide, 7.7 of carbon dioxide, 134 of water vapour, 0.2 of hydrogen sulfide, and 0,001 of dihydrogen, ranking Ambae among the world’s top volcanic gas emitters. Despite these substantial emissions, the relatively modest volume of 0.47 cubic kilometer of magma that fueled the eruption indicates a volatile-rich magma source. This enrichment is likely linked to the geodynamic setting, where subduction of the faulted, carbonate-rich D’Entrecasteaux Ridge, coupled with an influx of fertile mantle, fostered the formation of volatile-rich magma. High concentrations of volatiles, can drive substantial gas exsolution, increasing magma buoyancy, resulting in greater magma supply and faster ascent rates. Rapid ascent prevents volatile separation from the melt, resulting in powerful gas surges that drive the transition from effusive to basaltic sub-Plinian eruption phases. The basaltic sub-Plinian eruptions of Ambae Volcano, Vanuatu, are driven by rapid magma ascent, due to high concentration of dissolved volatile. This conclusion is supported by satellite observations, alongside gas measurements and geochemical analyses."

 Since the 2000s, there has been a marked acceleration in the decline of summer Arctic sea ice, accompanied by an increase in Arctic sea ice variability. However, the impact of Arctic sea ice decline on changes in Arctic atmospheric circulation and its implications for mid-latitude summers remain unclear. Here we propose that the emergence of a dipole-like mode of Arctic atmospheric circulation, driven by the Arctic sea ice decline, is linked to the intensification of temperature rise and increased European heat waves. Idealized model experiments support that the recent intensification of the Arctic sea ice decline is a key driver for the emergence of dipole-like atmospheric circulation in mid-latitude summer. The accelerated Arctic sea ice decline weakens the meridional temperature gradient and the zonal wind in Eastern Europe, develops an anti-cyclonic circulation, and contributes to the intensification of European heat waves.

 Vegetation greening on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) has profoundly changed the connection between terrestrial ecosystems and regional carbon, water, and energy cycling, but existing research on vegetation greenness can only be traced back to the 1980s, because of the scarcity of long-term remote sensing data. Here we present an ice-core record of pollen accumulation rates with a 3-year resolution during 1935–2012 AD for the western TP. Based on backward trajectory and wind data, we identified the pollen source region and transport mechanisms. We found that the 3-year total pollen accumulation rate (TPAR3a) is a good indicator of vegetation coverage of the source region, and our data showed that the greening of the western TP and surroundings began as early as 1935 AD, mostly due to regional warming and moistening. The greening trend became more significant after the 1970s, which is mostly related to the significant increase in temperature.

 Carbonate minerals are considered a metastable carbon reservoir under alkaline conditions. Here we demonstrate calcium carbonate as a sole inorganic carbon source at moderately alkaline pH for a methanogenic microbial community enriched from alkaline, saline wetland soil. In reactors amended with calcium carbonate as the sole source of inorganic carbon, concentrations of methane and aqueous calcium increased concurrent with headspace hydrogen depletion. Cells were observed in association with the carbonate mineral matrix via coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering and two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy. Genome-resolved metagenomics of the enrichment community confirmed the presence of a methanogen (Methanobacterium sp.) with the metabolic potential for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in addition to five bacterial community members. These results demonstrate that carbonate minerals can serve as an inorganic carbon source for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, leading to mineral dissolution under stable alkaline conditions. As such, hydrogenotrophic methanogens may impact carbon biogeochemistry and carbonate mineral stability in environmental systems.

 Agriculture is an important contributor to air pollution and its health impacts, with ramifications for environmental and health inequity. A substantial fraction of these effects can be attributable to dietary changes, but the extent of such impacts remains unclear. Here we show that the PM2.5-related mortality attributable specifically to dietary changes and the associated rising agricultural emissions has a high Gini coefficient of 0.369 in China in 2010, and raises the Gini coefficient of all-cause PM2.5-related mortality from 0.189 to 0.197 with more uneven allocation among income groups, reflecting worsened health inequity and an export of pollution from richer coastal regions to poorer agricultural regions via food trade. Such mortality is associated positively with urbanization but negatively with green space and healthcare quality. Our results also provide empirical evidence for the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis, and offer decision support for equitable clean air, food and health policies in China. Fine particulate matter-related mortality attributable to dietary changes and agricultural emissions has increased health inequality across regions and income groups in China, according to an analysis combining emission concentration, mortality, and economic data in the statistical model."
