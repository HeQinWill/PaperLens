10.5194/acp-24-12963-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了2022年巴黎地区夏季对流层低层臭氧垂直廓线的日变化。研究利用激光雷达、飞机观测、Copernicus大气服务（CAMS）集合模型和红外大气探测干涉仪（IASI）卫星观测数据，分析了巴黎地区臭氧污染的时空变化特征及其与微气象过程和区域污染传输的关系。结果表明，IASI卫星观测能够捕捉到臭氧柱的日变化，但仅限于臭氧羽流最大高度高于2公里时；激光雷达观测到的臭氧垂直结构与PBL的日变化规律一致；区域污染传输对巴黎地区臭氧浓度有显著影响，例如撒哈拉沙尘事件中平流层臭氧贫乏的空气团可以减轻臭氧的光化学生成，而来自欧洲大陆的高浓度污染物平流则会维持地表高浓度臭氧。该研究结合多种地面和遥感观测手段，深入探讨了城市地区臭氧污染的成因和变化机制，与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['Tropospheric ozone', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Lidar', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'IASI', 'CAMS', 'Atmospheric composition analysis', 'Ozone vertical profile', 'Pollution transport', 'Planetary boundary layer (PBL)']",Gérard Ancellet;Camille Viatte;Anne Boynard;François Ravetta;Jacques Pelon;Cristelle Cailteau-Fischbach;Pascal Genau;Julie Capo;Axel Roy;Philippe Nédélec,Analysis of the day-to-day variability of ozone vertical profiles in the lower troposphere during the 2022 Paris  ACROSS campaign,"Characterization of ozone pollution in urban areas benefited from a measurement campaign in summer 2022 in the Paris region. The analysis is based on 21 d of lidar and aircraft observations. The main objective is an analysis of the sensitivity of ozone pollution to the micrometeorological processes in the urban atmospheric boundary layer and the transport of regional pollution. The paper also discusses to what extent satellite observations can track observed ozone plumes. 
 The variability of ozone vertical profiles in the Paris area is analyzed using 21 d of lidar monitoring of the lower-troposphere ozone vertical profiles and planetary boundary layer (PBL) vertical structure evolution in summer 2022. Characterization of the pollution regional transport is based on daily ozone analysis of the Copernicus Atmospheric Service (CAMS) ensemble model and on backward trajectories. The CAMS simulations of the ozone plume between the surface and 3 km are consistent with the ozone measurements. Comparisons with the tropospheric ozone column retrieved by satellite observations of the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) show that IASI observations can capture the day-to-day variability of the 0–3 km ozone column only when the maximum altitude of the ozone plume is higher than 2 km.The lidar ozone vertical structure above the city center is also in good agreement with the PBL growth during the day and with the formation of the residual layer during the night. The analysis of four ozone pollution events shows that the thickness of the PBL during the day and the advection of regional-scale plumes above the PBL can significantly change the ozone concentrations above Paris. Advection of ozone-poor concentrations in the free troposphere during a Saharan dust event is able to mitigate ozone photochemical production. On the other hand, the advection of a pollution plume from continental Europe with high ozone concentrations > 140 µg m−3 maintained high concentrations in the surface layer despite a temperature decrease and cloud cover development."

This allowed accurate high-resolution analyses of size distributions and concentrations of rBC particles with diameters of 70 nm–4 μm for the past 350 years. Our results provide crucial insights into rBC's climatic effects. We also found previous ice core studies substantially underestimated rBC mass concentrations. 
 Ice cores can provide long-term records of refractory black carbon (rBC), an important aerosol species closely linked to the climate and environment. However, previous studies of ice cores only analyzed rBC particles with a diameter of < 500 nm, which could have led to an underestimation of rBC mass concentrations. Information on the size distribution of rBC particles is very limited, and there are no Arctic ice core records of the temporal variation in rBC size distribution. In this study, we applied a recently developed improved technique to analyze the rBC concentration in an ice core drilled at the SIGMA-D site in northwestern Greenland. The improved technique, which uses the modified Single-Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) and a high-efficiency nebulizer, widens the measurable range of rBC particle size. For high-resolution continuous analyses of ice cores, we developed a continuous flow analysis (CFA) system. Coupling of the improved rBC measurement technique with the CFA system allows accurate high-resolution measurements of the size distribution and concentration of rBC particles with a diameter between 70 nm and 4 µm, with minimal particle losses. Using this technique, we reconstructed the size distributions and the number and mass concentrations of rBC particles during the past 350 years. On the basis of the size distributions, we assessed the underestimation of rBC mass concentrations measured using the conventional SP2s. For the period 2003–2013, the underestimation of the average mass concentration would have been 12 %–31 % for the SIGMA-D core."

Burrows,Retrieval of stratospheric aerosol extinction coefficients from sun-normalized Ozone Mapper and Profiler Suite Limb Profiler (OMPS-LP) measurements,"We developed a new algorithm to retrieve vertical distributions of aerosol extinction coefficients in the stratosphere. The algorithm is applied to measurements of scattered solar light from the spaceborne OMPS-LP (Ozone Mapper and Profiler Suite Limb Profiler) instrument. The retrieval results are compared to data from other spaceborne instruments and used to investigate the evolution of the aerosol plume following the eruption of the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai volcano in January 2022. 
 A new retrieval approach for obtaining vertical profiles of the aerosol extinction coefficient from measurements of scattered solar light in the limb-viewing geometry made by the Ozone Mapper and Profiler Suite Limb Profiler (OMPS-LP) instrument is presented.In contrast to many other published limb-scatter retrievals, our new algorithm does not employ normalization by a limb measurement at an upper tangent height. Instead, the measured limb radiances are normalized to solar irradiance. The main advantage of this approach is an almost complete elimination of the dependence of the retrieval results on the prior aerosol extinction profile used in the retrieval. This makes the retrieval better suited for the analysis of observation scenes with highly elevated aerosol plumes, such as those that occurred after the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha′apai volcanic eruption in January 2022. The results from the new approach were compared to the vertical profiles of the aerosol extinction coefficients retrieved from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment III on the International Space Station (SAGE III/ISS) and the Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imaging System (OSIRIS). In general, agreement within 25 % between the different data products was observed in the 18–23 km altitude range, although larger differences were seen after very strong volcanic eruptions and wildfires. In comparison with OSIRIS, larger differences are seen at high southern latitudes (above 60° S). The new data product was used to investigate the evolution of the aerosol plume after the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha′apai volcanic eruption."

The observation-minus-simulation biases were able to monitor the performance of the satellite visible instrument. The biases were corrected based on a first-order approximation method, which promotes the data assimilation of satellite visible reflectance in real-world cases. 
 The Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) on board the Fengyun (FY)-4A geostationary satellite has provided high-spatiotemporal-resolution visible reflectance data since 12 March 2018. Data assimilation experiments under the framework of observing system simulation experiments have shown the great potential of these data to improve the forecasting skills of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. To assimilate the AGRI visible reflectance in real-world cases, it is important to evaluate the quality and to quantify the observation errors in these data. In this study, the FY-4A AGRI channel 2 (0.55–0.75 µm) reflectance data (O) were compared with the equivalents (B) derived from the short-term forecasts of the China Meteorological Administration Mesoscale (CMA-MESO) model using the Radiative Transfer for the Television Infrared Observation Satellite Operational Vertical Sounder (RTTOV, v12.3). It is shown that the O–B biases could be used to reveal the abrupt change related to the measurement calibration processes. In general, the O–B departure was positively biased in most cases. Potential causes include the deficiencies of the NWP model, the forward-operator errors, and the unresolved aerosol processes. The relative biases of O–B computed from cloud-free and cloudy pixels were used to correct the systematic biases for the corresponding scenarios over land and sea surfaces separately. In general, the method effectively reduced the O–B biases. Moreover, the bias-correction method based on an ensemble forecast is more robust than a deterministic forecast due to the advantages of the former in dealing with uncertainties in cloud simulations. The findings demonstrate that analyzing the O–B biases has a potential to monitor the performance of the  FY-4A AGRI visible instrument and to correct the systematic biases in the observations, which will facilitate the assimilation of these data in conventional data assimilation applications."

The results demonstrate excellent performance in distinguishing clear-sky scenes and reducing errors in cloud cover estimation. It shows significant improvements compared to existing methods. 
 Cloud fraction as a vital component of meteorological satellite products plays an essential role in environmental monitoring, disaster detection, climate analysis and other research areas. Random forest (RF) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms were used in this paper to retrieve the cloud fraction of AGRI (Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager) on board the Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) satellite based on its full-disk level-1 radiance observation. Corrections have been made subsequently to the retrieved cloud fraction in areas where solar glint occurs using a correction curve fitted with sunglint angle as weight. The algorithm includes two steps: the cloud detection is conducted firstly for each AGRI field of view to identify whether it is clear sky, partly cloudy or overcast within the observation field. Then, the cloud fraction is retrieved for the scene identified as partly cloudy. The 2B-CLDCLASS-lidar cloud fraction product from the CloudSat and CALIPSO active remote sensing satellite is employed as the truth to assess the accuracy of the retrieval algorithm. Comparison with the operational AGRI level-2 cloud fraction product is also conducted at the same time. The results indicate that both the RF and MLP cloud detection models achieved high accuracy, surpassing that of operational products. However, both algorithms demonstrated weaker discrimination capabilities for partly cloudy conditions compared to clear-sky and overcast situations. Specifically, they tended to misclassify fields of view with low cloud fractions (e.g., cloud fraction = 0.16) as clear sky and those with higher cloud fractions (e.g., cloud fraction = 0.83) as overcast. Between the two models, RF exhibited higher overall accuracy. Both RF and MLP models performed well in cloud fraction retrieval, showing lower mean error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) compared to operational products. The ME for both RF and MLP cloud fraction retrieval models was close to zero, while RF had slightly lower MAE and RMSE than MLP. During daytime, the high reflectance in sunglint areas led to larger retrieval errors for both RF and MLP algorithms. However, after correction, the retrieval accuracy in these regions improved significantly. At night, the absence of visible light observations from the AGRI instrument resulted in lower classification accuracy compared to daytime, leading to higher cloud fraction retrieval errors during nighttime."

Using Earth Observation (EO) datasets for 2020, we developed a global height dataset at the individual building scale. The dataset provides spatially explicit information on 3D building morphology, supporting both macro- and microanalysis of urban areas. 
 Understanding urban vertical structures, particularly building heights, is essential for examining the intricate interaction between humans and their environment. Such datasets are indispensable for a variety of applications, including climate modeling, energy consumption analysis, and socioeconomic activities. Despite the importance of this information, previous studies have primarily focused on estimating building heights regionally at the grid scale, often resulting in datasets with limited coverage or spatial resolution. This limitation hampers comprehensive global analysis and the ability to generate actionable insights at finer scales. In this study, we developed a global building height map at the building footprint scale by leveraging Earth Observation (EO) datasets and advanced machine learning techniques. Our approach integrated multisource remote-sensing features and building morphology features to develop height estimation models using the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) regression method across diverse global regions. This methodology allowed us to estimate the heights of individual buildings worldwide, culminating in the creation of the three-dimensional (3D) Global Building Footprints (3D-GloBFP) dataset for the year 2020. Our evaluation results show that the height estimation models perform exceptionally well at a global scale, with R2 values ranging from 0.66 to 0.96 and root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) ranging from 1.9 to 14.6 m across 33 subregions. Comparisons with other datasets demonstrate that 3D-GloBFP closely matches the distribution and spatial pattern of reference heights. Our derived 3D global building footprint map shows a distinct spatial pattern of building heights across regions, countries, and cities, with building heights gradually decreasing from the city center to the surrounding rural areas. Furthermore, our findings indicate disparities in built-up infrastructure (i.e., building volume) across different countries and cities. China is the country with the most intensive total built-up infrastructure (5.28×1011 m3, accounting for 23.9 % of the global total), followed by the USA (3.90×1011 m3, accounting for 17.6 % of the global total). Shanghai has the largest volume of built-up infrastructure (2.1×1010 m3) of all representative cities. The derived building-footprint-scale height map (3D-GloBFP) reveals the significant heterogeneity in urban built-up environments, providing valuable insights for studies on urban socioeconomic dynamics and climatology.

Kern;Andreas Maier;Nikki Vercauteren,Landscape reconstructions for Europe during the late Last Glacial (60–20 ka BP): A pollen-based REVEALS approach,"We provide vegetation reconstructions during the Last Glacial period (60,000 to 20,000 years before present) using fossil pollen data and the REVEALS model. Understanding vegetation change in response to abrupt climate change is critical to enhance our understanding plant migration patterns and the demographic development and dispersal of anatomically modern humans into Europe. Our application PALVEG (https://oakern.shinyapps.io/PALVEG/), aims to make such data accessible to non-experts. 
 Vegetation change during the Last Glacial period in Europe plays a crucial role in better understanding the ecosystem dynamics response to abrupt climate change. Yet, quantitative reconstructions of land-cover primarily focus on the Holocene period and aim to disentangle the impact of anthropogenic and climatic stress on the vegetation. Here, we present temporally continuous land-cover reconstructions from Europe for the latter half of the Last Glacial period (60–20 ka BP) using the “Regional Estimates of Vegetation Abundance from Large Sites” (REVEALS) model. The pollen-based REVEALS model uniquely factors in plant-specific parameters, such as relative pollen productivity (RPP) and pollen fall speed to model pollen dispersal and thus provides more accurate representation of past vegetation cover than fossil pollen data. We compiled a total of 61 datasets from Europe and its bordering regions to model land-cover estimates across 60 time steps in 1000 year increments. By grouping the 38 analysed taxa into 5 land-cover types (LCTs), we simplify the interpretation of our results and demonstrate this using three crucial periods during the Last Glacial: Greenland Interstadial 14 (GI-14), Greenland Stadial 9 (GS-9), and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). These periods provide insight into stadial-interstadial vegetation variability as well as extreme glacial conditions, which seem to play a fundamental role in the demographic developments of Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers. Additionally, we compare the REVEALS land-cover estimates to raw pollen data and also provide REVEALS standard errors and discuss the reliability of our results as well as potential avenues to further improve the reliability of REVEALS estimates. To facilitate the use and interpretation of our data for a wide scientific audience, we developed the browser-based application PALVEG (https://oakern.shinyapps.io/PALVEG/), which requires no prior programming experience and dynamically generates maps based on user input."

It shows the global CO2 uptake by cement materials increases from 7.74 Mt yr-1 in 1928 to 0.84 Gt yr-1 in 2023, and projected to rise to 0.86 Gt yr-1 in 2024, the accumulated CO2 uptake offsets about 46 % of the cement process emission. The dominance in cement carbon uptake has shifted from the USA, Japan and some European countries to emerging economies such as China and India. 
 The hydration products of cement materials can absorb atmospheric CO2, and this carbonation process provides an important decarbonization pathway for the cement industry. Global carbon sequestration by cement materials has been reported, but carbon uptake in different countries remains unquantified. Here, we quantify the national cement carbon uptake from 1928 to 2023 based on 58517 activity level data from 163 cement-producing countries and regions worldwide and 6186 carbonation parameters from detailed data records of 42 countries, and project their trend to 2024. The global CO2 uptake by cement materials increases from 7.74 Mt yr-1 (95 % confidence interval, CI: 5.84–9.85 Mt CO2 yr-1) in 1928 to 0.84 Gt yr-1 (95 % CI: 0.71–1.00 Gt yr-1) in 2023, and projected to rise to 0.86 Gt yr-1 (95 % CI: 0.73–1.02 CO2 yr-1) in 2024. The accumulated CO2 uptake from 1928 to 2023 is 21.26 Gt CO2 (95 % CI: 17.93–25.17 Gt CO2), which offsets about 46 % of the cement process emission (46.06 Gt CO2) in past 96 years. Simultaneously, the dominance in cement carbon uptake has shifted from the USA, Japan and some European countries to emerging economies such as China and India, which account for 38.0 % and 9.1 % of total CO2 uptake, respectively, in the last decade (2014–2023). By analyzing the long time-series carbon emission and uptake of the 42 countries with detailed data, we find they contributed 82.1 % of global cement CO2 uptake from 1928 to 2023, including 21 peaked countries and 21 non-peaked countries in cement emissions The annual carbon offset level (the ratio of uptake to process emission in a given year) shows a remarkable decrease due to the temporal lag of cement carbon uptake. This is significant for countries with higher cement imports, for example, the cement industry in Australia and Japan have achieved net-zero when considering the cement carbonation sink.

The new maps showed improved accuracy in reflecting local economies, revealing that sectoral GDP distribution differs by country and affects disaster impact estimates. 
 Global risk assessments of economic losses by natural disasters while considering various land uses is essential. However, sector-specific, high-resolution pixel-level economic data are not yet available globally to assess exposure to local disasters such as floods. In this study, we employed new land-use data to construct global, spatially distributed map of sector-specific gross domestic product (GDP). We developed three global GDP maps in 2010, 2015, and 2020 for service, industry, and agriculture sector, with 30 arcsec resolution. Firstly, we found that the spatial relationship between the distribution of industrial GDP and urban areas, where the service GDP is highly concentrated, varies across countries. For example, in the United States, industrial GDP is widely dispersed regardless of urban areas, whereas in India, industrial GDP is concentrated in proximity to urban areas. Secondly, we evaluated the GDP map by subnational regional statistics of Thailand, where validation data are accessible. Traditional GDP maps relying solely on population distribution exhibited 63.0 % relative error of the sectoral GDP in each subnational region to regional statistical data, which the new sector-specific GDP map reduced to 26.2 %. Subsequently, we assessed the map in conjunction with sector-level business interruption (BI) losses resulting from river flooding. Our estimation of sector-level losses revealed that the sectoral ratio to the total loss varied significantly depending on the spatial distribution of flood hazards. The estimated total loss became closer to the reported value when the new GDP map was used, while sectoral ratios of losses still had some differences from the reported ratios suggesting the need for further improving the procedures of loss-estimation models.

Even though repeated airborne laser scanning (ALS) surveys are increasingly available across several European countries, only few studies have so far derived data products of ecosystem structure at a national scale, possibly due to a lack of free and open source tools and the computational challenges involved in handling the large volumes of data. Nevertheless, high-resolution data products of ecosystem structure generated from multi-temporal country-wide ALS datasets are urgently needed if we are to integrate such information into biodiversity and ecosystem science. By employing a recently developed, open-source, high-throughput workflow (named “Laserfarm”), we processed around 70 TB of raw point clouds collected from four national ALS surveys of the Netherlands (AHN1–AHN4, 1996–2022). This resulted in ~ 59 GB raster layers in GeoTIFF format as ready-to-use multi-temporal data products of ecosystem structure at a national extent. For each AHN dataset, we generated 25 LiDAR-derived vegetation metrics at 10 m spatial resolution, representing vegetation height, vegetation cover, and vegetation structural variability. The data enable an in-depth understanding of ecosystem structure at fine resolution across the Netherlands and provide opportunities for exploring ecosystem structural dynamics over time. To illustrate the utility of these data products, we present ecological use cases that monitor forest structural change and analyse vegetation structure differences across various Natura 2000 habitat types, including dunes, marshes, grasslands, shrublands, and woodlands. The provided data products and the employed workflow can facilitate a wide use and uptake of ecosystem structure information in biodiversity and carbon modelling, conservation science, and ecosystem management. The full data products and source code are publicly available on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13940846) (Shi and Kissling 2024)."

 The ATL2MED demonstration experiment involved two autonomous surface vehicles from Saildrone Inc. (SD) which travelled a route from the eastern tropical North Atlantic to the Adriatic Sea between October 2019 and July 2020 (see Table A6). This 9-month experiment in a transition zone between the temperate and tropical belts represents a major challenge for the SD's operations. The sensors on board were exposed to varying degrees of degradation and biofouling depending on the geographical area and season, which led to a deterioration in the measurements. As a result, some maintenance measures were required during the mission.We address the difficulty of correcting the data during a period of COVID-19 restrictions, which significantly reduced the number of discrete samples planned for the SD salinity and dissolved oxygen validation. This article details alternative correction methods for salinity and dissolved oxygen. Due to the lack of in situ data, model products have been used to correct the salinity data acquired by the SD instruments, and then the resulting corrected salinity was validated with data from fixed ocean stations, gliders, and Argo floats. In addition, dissolved oxygen data acquired from the SD instruments after correction using air oxygen measurements were tested and found to be coherent with the variation in oxygen concentrations expected from changes in temperature and phytoplankton abundance (from chlorophyll a). The correction methods are relevant and useful in situations where validation capabilities are lacking, which was the case during the ATL2MED demonstration experiment. For future experiments, a more frequent sample collection would improve the data qualification and validation."

The results highlight the importance of considering fine-scale urban–rural differences when comparing models and observation. 
 Measurements collected from ground monitoring stations have gained popularity as a valuable data source for evaluating numerical models and correcting model errors through data assimilation. The penalty quantified by simulation minus observations drives both model evaluation and assimilation. However, the penal forces are challenged by the existence of a spatial-scale disparity between model simulations and observations. Chemical transport models (CTMs) divide the atmosphere into grid cells, providing a structured way to simulate atmospheric processes. However, their spatial resolution often does not match the limited coverage of in situ measurements, especially for short-lived air pollutants. Within a broad grid cell, air pollutant concentrations can exhibit significant heterogeneity due to their rapid generation and dissipation. Ground observations with traditional methods (including “nearest search” and “grid mean”) are less representative when compared to model simulations. This study develops a new land-use-based representative (LUBR) observational operator to generate spatially representative gridded observations for model evaluation. It incorporates high-resolution urban–rural land use data to address intra-grid variability. The LUBR operator has been validated to consistently provide insights that align with satellite Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) measurements. It is an effective solution to accurately quantify these spatial-scale mismatches and further resolve them via assimilation. Model evaluations with 2015–2017 NO2 measurements in the study area demonstrate that biases and errors differed substantially when the LUBR and other operators were used, respectively. The results highlight the importance of considering fine-scale urban–rural differences when comparing models and observations, especially for short-lived pollutants like NO2."

Maidment,A computationally lightweight model for ensemble forecasting of environmental hazards: General TAMSAT-ALERT v1.2.1,"We present General TAMSAT-ALERT, a computationally lightweight and versatile tool for generating ensemble forecasts from time series data. General TAMSAT-ALERT is capable of combining multiple streams of monitoring and meteorological forecasting data into probabilistic hazard assessments. In this way, it complements existing systems and enhances their utility for actionable hazard assessment. 
 Efficient methods for predicting weather-related hazards are crucial for the effective management of environmental risk. Many environmental hazards depend on the evolution of meteorological conditions over protracted periods, requiring assessments that account for evolving conditions. The TAMSAT-ALERT approach addresses this challenge by combining observational monitoring with a weighted multi-year ensemble. In this way, it enhances the utility of existing systems by enabling users to combine multiple streams of monitoring and meteorological forecasting data into holistic hazard assessments. TAMSAT-ALERT forecasts are now used in a number of regions in the Global South for soil moisture forecasting, drought early warning and agricultural decision support. The model presented here, General TAMSAT-ALERT, represents a significant scientific and functional advance on previous implementations. Notably, General TAMSAT-ALERT is applicable to any variable for which time series data are available. In addition, functionality has been introduced to account for climatological non-stationarity (for example due to climate change), large-scale modes of variability (for example El Niño) and persistence (for example of land-surface conditions).

Yet, projecting future precipitation and temperature data under different emission scenarios relies on complex models that are computationally expensive. In this study, we propose a method that allows us to generate monthly means of local precipitation and temperature at low computational costs. Our modelling framework is particularly useful for all downstream applications of climate model data. 
 Emulators of Earth system models (ESMs) are statistical models that approximate selected outputs of ESMs. Owing to their runtime efficiency, emulators are especially useful when large amounts of data are required, for example, for in-depth exploration of the emission space, for investigating high-impact low-probability events, or for estimating uncertainties and variability. This paper introduces an emulation framework that allows us to emulate gridded monthly mean precipitation fields using gridded monthly mean temperature fields as forcing. The emulator is designed as an extension of the Modular Earth System Model Emulator (MESMER) framework, and its core relies on the concepts of generalised linear models (GLMs). Precipitation at each (land) grid point and for each month is approximated as a multiplicative model with two factors. The first factor entails the temperature-driven precipitation response and is assumed to follow a gamma distribution with a logarithmic link function. The second factor is the residual variability in the precipitation field, which is assumed to be independent of temperature but may still possess spatial precipitation correlations. Therefore, the monthly residual field is decomposed into independent principal components and subsequently approximated and sampled using a kernel density estimation with a Gaussian kernel. The emulation framework is tested and validated using 24 ESMs from the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). For each ESM, we train on a single-ensemble member across scenarios and evaluate the emulator performance using simulations with historical and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP5-8.5) forcing. We show that the framework captures grid-point-specific precipitation characteristics, such as variability, trend, and temporal auto-correlations. In addition, we find that emulated spatial (cross-variable) characteristics are consistent with those of ESMs. The framework is also able to capture compound hot–dry and cold–wet extremes, although it systematically underestimates their occurrence probabilities. The emulation of spatially explicit coherent monthly temperature and precipitation time series is a major step towards a computationally efficient representation of impact-relevant variables of the climate system."

We applied four scenarios: three focused on wastewater treatment technologies, ranging from high to low technology improvement levels, and one combining high technology in wastewater treatment with source-oriented measures. The results show that the combined strategy of high wastewater treatment and source-oriented measures is expected to be the most effective for reducing future microplastics in rivers on a global scale. By 2100, this combined strategy is expected to result in a 68% microplastic reduction in global rivers compared to 2010. African rivers will be the main hotspots, receiving more than five times more microplastics in 2100 than in 2010. In 2100, wear from car tires is expected to be the dominant source of microplastics globally.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which CeO2 NPs enhance drought resistance are unknown. In this work, both foliar application and soil injection of CeO2 NPs were used to rice seedlings under a 30 day moderate drought (40% soil relative moisture). Foliar application of 4 mg of CeO2 NPs per pot reduced excess reactive oxygen species and abscisic acid (ABA) in rice leaves, thereby maintaining chloroplast structural integrity and photosynthetic output, ultimately increasing drought-stressed rice biomass by 31.3%. Genes associated with photosynthesis and ribosome activity provided the foundation by which CeO2 NPs enhanced rice drought resistance. Importantly, these genes were tightly regulated by ABA due to the large number of abscisic acid responsive elements in their promoter regions. CeO2 NPs also upregulated the expression of soluble sugar and fatty acid synthesis associated genes in drought-stressed rice, thereby contributing to osmotic balance and membrane lipid stability. These results highlight the potential of CeO2 NPs to enhance rice photosynthesis and drought-resistant biomolecule accumulation by regulating ABA-dependent responses.

While most studies focus on bacteria, interactions between antibiotics and other crucial microbial groups like protists remain uncertain. This study investigates how protists interact with antibiotics and examines how these interactions impact the fate of resistance genes. It reveals that amoebae exhibit high resistance to eight high-risk environmental antibiotics, accumulating significant quantities within their cells. Wild amoeboid strains from distant locations carry substantial antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and metal resistance genes (MRGs), with significant heterogeneity within a single species. Amoeboid symbionts and pathogens predominantly carry these genes. Paraburkholderia symbionts have reduced genomes and fewer resistance genes compared to free-living strains, while amoeba-endogenous Stenotrophomonas maltophilia does not exhibit a significantly reduced genome size. This suggests that the amoeboid hosts serve as a temporary medium facilitating its transmission. In summary, the study unveils that soil amoebae represent unexpected hotspots for antibiotics and resistance genes. Future research should assess the effects of antibiotics on often-overlooked protists and explore their role in spreading ARGs and MRGs in ecosystems. Incorporating protists into broader antibiotic resistance research is recommended, highlighting their significance within a One Health perspective."

Limited structural information has hindered a comprehensive understanding of their composition. By characteristic fragmentation-based nontarget analysis, the occurrence and composition of organothiophosphate esters (OTPEs), which are antiwear additives in lubricant oils that have received little attention previously, were investigated in dust from automotive repair shops and surrounding buildings. Fourteen OTPEs were tentatively identified, including four triarylphosphorothionates, six O,O-dialkyl phosphorothioates, and four O-alkyl O-alkyl sulfone phosphorothioates, among which four OTPEs were further confirmed by authentic standards or an industrial product. Triphenyl phosphorothioate (TPhPt) and tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphorothioate (AO168=S) were prevalently detected in automotive repair shops with median concentrations of 230  and 246 ng/g, respectively, closely comparable to triphenyl phosphate (TPhP, median concentration: 302 ng/g).

Hierarchical cluster analysis showed that OTPEs exhibited similar distribution patterns across automotive repair shops, indicating that these chemicals had similar sources. Moreover, the concentrations of OTPEs were usually higher in automotive repair shops than that in surrounding buildings, suggesting a motor vehicle related emission source. To our knowledge, 12 out of the 14 detected OPTEs were reported in the environment for the first time.

When excluding road wear and resuspension, mean emissions of 1.1 mg/km/vehicle (median 0.2 mg/km/vehicle) were found for tire wear PM10 and mean emissions of 2.7 mg/km/vehicle (median 1.1 mg/km/vehicle) when including studies with resuspended tire wear.

As revealed by our analysis, secondary literature reports emission factors systematically higher than those of the primary sources on which they are based.

Gridded concentrations of PM2.5 and ozone are typically derived from first principle models called Chemical Transport Models (CTMs). Widespread application of CTMs, particularly for regulatory purposes, requires an understanding of model performance in comparison with observation data. A landscape approach that systematically reviews CTM model predictions and proposes benchmarks for assessing model performance can offer a way forward to build confidence in CTM-backed forecasting tools. Following similar efforts in the United States and China, we systematically shortlisted and examined model performance outcomes for 46 CTM studies reporting PM2.5 and ozone predictions in India between 2008 and 2023. The reported statistical metrics for each pollutant (normalized mean bias (NMB), normalized mean error (NME), coefficient of correlation (r), and index of agreement (IOA) were rank ordered to identify two types of benchmarks: “goals” (highest achievable model accuracy based on top one-third performing studies) and “criteria” (typical model accuracy based on the top two-third performing studies). The identified goal performance for PM2.5 was 17% (NMB), 34% (NME), and 0.67 (r), and ozone was 14% (NMB), 43% (NME), and 0.89 (r). These benchmarks are less restrictive than those reported for the United States and China. This highlights the need for the CTM community to coalesce around a common set of practices in evaluating CTMs. Additionally, complementary efforts in developing representative emissions inventories and including air pollution data from the expanding observational networks are required to update such benchmarks periodically. This study seeks to advance the capabilities of CTMs as a cornerstone of air quality forecasting tools and augment air quality management frameworks in India."

This review comprehensively reviews the impact of microplastic properties on biofilm formation and composition, including the microbial community structure. We then explore the dynamic interactions between microplastics and biofilms, examining how biofilms alter the physicochemical properties, migration, and deposition of microplastics. Furthermore, we emphasize the potential of biofilm-colonized microplastics to influence the environmental fate of other pollutants.

Dedoussi,Sensitivities of Ozone and Radiative Forcing to Supersonic Aircraft Emissions Across Two Flight Corridors,"Civil supersonic aviation may return in the near future. Their emissions have been found to lead to changes in the composition of the stratosphere, affecting the ozone layer and climate. To keep up with the rapid developments in supersonic aircraft technology and alternative fuels there is an increasing need for the development of surrogate modeling methods, which requires knowledge of the sensitivities to these emissions. We present a parametric study which evaluates the first‐ and second‐order sensitivities of the ozone column and radiative forcing (RF) to supersonic emissions across two flight corridors and three altitudes. For a given increase in global fuel burn, we find that the increase in emission of NOx ${\text{NO}}_{x}$ is the main driver of both the changes in the global ozone column and RF, the latter of which is linked through changes in the ozone distribution. Followed by the increase in the emission of SOx ${\text{SO}}_{x}$, which leads to O3 ${\mathrm{O}}_{3}$ loss and has a cooling effect. The ozone column and climate are least sensitive to increases in H2O ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ emissions. We also show that interactions between NOx ${\text{NO}}_{x}$, SOx ${\text{SO}}_{x}$, and H2O ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ emissions lead to non‐linear behavior in the atmospheric response. The effect of these interactions can lead to < ${< } $5% differences in the ozone column impacts and up to 7.3% increases in RF. Our results demonstrate that the majority of second‐order sensitivities may be neglected in surrogate models for small errors, which could greatly simplify their development. Our results also indicate that reductions in flight altitude and fleetwide NOx ${\text{NO}}_{x}$ emissions may effectively reduce the environmental footprint of supersonic aviation emissions."

Less than half of them can intensify into tropical cyclones, with the majority remaining nondeveloping. This study reveals that nondeveloping low‐level tropical disturbances within the easterly wind belt can also cause heavy rainfall over the northern South China Sea (NSCS, 110°E–120°E, 15°N–20°N) in autumn. Based on a heavy rainfall event in September 2021, physical mechanisms of intensified tropical disturbance‐induced rainfall over the NSCS are investigated. The tropical disturbance at 850 hPa initially originated within easterly winds south of the western Pacific subtropical high and was guided into the NSCS by these easterlies. Meanwhile, the South Asian high disrupted the long‐lasting cyclone‐anticyclone pairs on its southeast side, inducing divergence at 200 hPa, which enhanced the tropical disturbance. Specifically, the upper‐level divergence superimposed on the tropical disturbance intensified ascending motion and low‐level convergence. Above the tropical disturbance, convergence below 400 hPa, combined with vertical and horizontal advection above 500 hPa, together reinforced the vortex structure of the disturbance, facilitating water vapor accumulation. Further results show that cold rain processes above the freezing level were active and significantly contributed to the precipitation. This study provides new insights into heavy rainfall over the NSCS, showing that in the absence of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and cold air, upper‐level divergence promotes the vertical development of the tropical disturbance. The enhanced ascending motion and the increased midupper level moisture intensify cold rain processes and precipitation."

Previous studies have shown that biases in the dynamical prediction of EISOs reduce the accuracy of subseasonal forecasts for extreme events, particularly in extratropical regions. However, the current dynamical prediction skills of EISO and associated dependence remain unclarified. Based on the recently proposed EISO metrics, which represent three dominant zonally propagating EISO modes traveling along the westerly jets, this study conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the EISOs' prediction skill in 13 state‐of‐the‐art subseasonal‐to‐seasonal (S2S) prediction project models. Firstly, the S2S models display skill to predict the EISOs out to a range of 9–20 days, which demonstrates higher predictability compared to other conventional circulation modes in the extratropics. In the subseasonal prediction, EISOs' amplitudes are underestimated, and their propagating speeds feature large random errors in all S2S models. Secondly, the EISOs' prediction skill depends on their initial/target amplitude, particularly for strong target amplitudes, which showcase higher skill than weak‐amplitude EISOs. Thirdly, although the EISOs' prediction skill is sensitive to the EISOs' phase, it is not locked to any fixed phase, indicating that EISOs do not have an inherent prediction barrier like the tropical ISO. This study also discusses how the humidity initialization and ensemble sizes influence the EISOs' prediction skill, suggesting that increasing the ensemble members in the saturation range is an effective way of improving the prediction for extratropical subseasonal variation and related extreme events."

Historically, the high‐latitude North Atlantic and Southern Ocean have been critical regions for anthropogenic heat and carbon uptake, but our understanding of how this uptake will be altered by future freshwater discharge is incomplete. We assess each ice sheet's impact on global ocean anthropogenic heat and carbon storage for a high‐emission scenario over the 21st ${21}^{\text{st}}$‐century using a coupled Earth system model. We explore the impact of contemporaneous mass loss from both ice sheets on anthropogenic heat and carbon storage and quantify their linear and nonlinear contributions. Notably, added freshwater reduces ocean heat and carbon storage by 2,100, and the sum of individual freshwater effects differ from those induced by simultaneous freshwater discharge from both ice sheets. Combined AIS and GrIS freshwater engenders distinct anthropogenic storage anomalies—particularly in the high‐latitude Southern Ocean and North Atlantic. From 2080 to 2100, GrIS freshwater exerts primary control on the temporal evolution of global ocean heat storage, while global ocean carbon storage is modulated by the linear AIS and GrIS freshwater impacts. Nonlinear impacts of simultaneous ice sheet discharge have a non‐negligible contribution to the evolution of global ocean heat storage. Further, anthropogenic heat changes are realized more quickly in response to ice sheet discharge than anthropogenic carbon. Our results highlight the need to incorporate both ice sheets actively in climate models to accurately project future global climate."

To achieve this, a dialog between practitioners and scientists is imperative. Current research documents impacts of SLR, evaluates local SLR adaptation activities, identifies barriers to action, and works to assess local adaptive capacity. Despite this work, there has been little qualitative assessment of practitioners' needs when it comes to translating SLR science into local changes. To fill this gap, we used a combination of semi‐structured interviews and surveys. The interviews revealed practitioners’ needs, the tools they use, the challenges they face, and the contexts in which they make decisions. The survey allowed practitioners to rank potential interventions according to the level of impact they believed it would have on coastal adaptation planning. In total our study includes the perspectives of 142 practitioners from 24 states, Puerto Rico, the Mariana Islands, and Barbados. Corroborating earlier work, we find that resources broadly and funding specifically is the largest barrier faced by practitioners. We find that practitioners need more localized information and models supported by on the ground monitoring, decision support resources that allow for comparison of different scenarios, and communication tools that will enable them to engage with key audiences. These needs suggest a critical shift toward building trusted relationship between scientists and local practitioners and the need to bolster organizations that can support a bridge between these two contexts."

However, limited knowledge exists concerning the impacts of different SPP error type on hydrological modeling skill and their sensitivity across different climate zones. In this study, forcing data sets from 10 SPPs were collected to drive hydrological models during the period 2001–2018 for 366 catchments across China. Here, we analyze the impact of the SPP errors associated with different precipitation intensities (light, moderate, and heavy) and different precipitation signatures (magnitude, variance, and occurrence) on the performance of hydrological simulations, and rank the sensitivities of SPPs errors for four major Köppen‐Geiger climate zones. The results show that heavy precipitation in SPPs is generally associated with higher errors than light and moderate precipitation when compared to gauge‐based precipitation observations, but hydrological model skill is more sensitive to errors from moderate precipitation than from heavy precipitation. The probability of moderate precipitation detection was identified as the most sensitive metric in determining hydrological model performance, with sensitivities of 0.58, 0.39, 0.59, and 0.47 in the temperate, boreal, arid, and highland climate zones, respectively. The variance error and magnitude error for heavy precipitation from SPPs were also identified as sensitive factors for hydrological modeling in the temperate and arid climate zones, respectively. These findings are crucial for enhancing the understanding of interactions between SPPs uncertainty and hydrological simulations, leading to improved data accuracy of precipitation forcing and the identification of appropriate SPPs for hydrological simulation in China."

 The neuromodulators dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5HT) powerfully regulate associative learning1–8. Similarities in the activity and connectivity of these neuromodulatory systems have inspired competing models of how DA and 5HT interact to drive the formation of new associations9–14. However, these hypotheses have not been tested directly because it has not been possible to interrogate and manipulate multiple neuromodulatory systems in a single subject. Here, we establish a mouse model enabling simultaneous genetic access to the brain’s DA and 5HT neurons. Anterograde tracing revealed the nucleus accumbens (NAc) to be a putative hotspot for the integration of convergent DA and 5HT signals. Simultaneous recording of DA and 5HT axon activity, together with genetically encoded DA and 5HT sensor recordings, revealed that rewards increase DA signaling and decrease 5HT signaling in the NAc. Optogenetically dampening DA or 5HT reward responses individually produced modest behavioral deficits in an appetitive conditioning task, while blunting both signals together profoundly disrupted learning and reinforcement. Optogenetically reproducing DA and 5HT reward responses together was sufficient to drive acquisition of new associations and supported reinforcement more potently than either manipulation alone. Together, these results demonstrate that striatal DA and 5HT signals shape learning by exerting opponent control of reinforcement."

 Urea’s transmembrane transport through urea transporters (UT) is a fundamental physiological behavior for life activities. Here, we present 11 cryo-EM structures of four UT members in resting states, urea transport states, or inactive states bound with synthetic competitive, uncompetitive or noncompetitive inhibitor. Our results indicate that the binding of urea via a conserved urea recognition motif (URM) and the urea transport via H-bond transfer along the QPb-T5b-T5a-QPa motif among different UT members. Moreover, distinct binding modes of the competitive inhibitors 25a and ATB3, the uncompetitive inhibitor CF11 and the noncompetitive inhibitor HQA2 provide different mechanisms for blocking urea transport and achieved selectivity through L-P pocket, UCBP region and SCG pocket, respectively. In summary, our study not only allows structural understanding of urea transport via UTs but also afforded a structural landscape of hUT-A2 inhibition by competitive, uncompetitive and noncompetitive inhibitors, which may facilitate developing selective human UT-A inhibitors as a new class of salt-sparing diuretics.

 Enantioenriched unsymmetrical vicinal diamines are important basic structural motifs. While catalytic asymmetric intermolecular 1,2-diamination of carbon–carbon double bonds represents the most straightforward approach for preparing enantioenriched vicinal-diamine-containing heterocycles, these reactions are often limited to the installation of undifferentiated amino functionalities through metal catalysis and/or the use of stoichiometric amounts of oxidants. Here, we report organocatalytic enantioselective unsymmetrical 1,2-diaminations based on the rational design of a bifunctional 1,2-diamination reagent, namely, azocarboxamides (ACAs). Under the catalysis of chiral phosphoric acid, unsymmetrical 1,2-diaminations of ACAs with various electron-rich double bonds readily occur in a regiodivergent manner. Indoles prefer dual hydrogen-bonding mode to give dearomative (4 + 2) products, and 3-vinylindoles and azlactones are inclined to undergo unsymmetrical 1,2-diamination via the (3 + 2) process. DFT calculations are performed to reveal the reaction mechanism and the origin of the regio- and enantioselectivity. Guided by computational design, we are able to reverse the regioselectivity of the dearomative unsymmetrical 1,2-diamination of indoles using Lewis acid catalysis. 1,2-diaminations of double bonds represent a fundamental transformation in organic synthesis, the progress of which has largely been limited to symmetrical delivery of equivalent amine species.

 Altered mechanotransduction has been proposed as a putative mechanism for disease pathophysiology, yet evidence remains scarce. Here we introduce a concept we call single cell immuno-mechanical modulation, which links immunology, integrin biology, cellular mechanics, and disease pathophysiology and symptomology. Using a micropatterned hydrogel-laden coverslip compatible with standard fluorescence microscopy, we conduct a clinical mechanobiology study, specifically focusing on immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), an autoantibody-mediated platelet disorder that currently lacks a reliable biomarker for bleeding risk. We discover that in pediatric ITP patients (n = 53), low single platelet contraction force alone is a “physics-based” biomarker of bleeding (92.3% sensitivity, 90% specificity). Mechanistically, autoantibodies and monoclonal antibodies drive increases and decreases of cell force by stabilizing integrins in different conformations depending on the targeted epitope. Hence, immuno-mechanical modulation demonstrates how antibodies may pathologically alter mechanotransduction to cause clinical symptoms and this phenomenon can be leveraged to control cellular mechanics for research, diagnostic, and therapeutic purposes.

Here, the authors report poly(terphenyl alkylene)-scaffold bipolar membranes that enhance water dissociation efficiency and enable durable pure water electrolysis. 
 Bipolar membrane electrolyzers present an attractive scenario for concurrently optimizing the pH environment required for paired electrode reactions. However, the practicalization of bipolar membranes for water electrolysis has been hindered by their sluggish water dissociation kinetics, poor mass transport, and insufficient interface durability. This study starts with numerical simulations and discloses the limiting factors of monopolar membrane layer engineering. On this foundation, we tailor flexible bipolar membranes (10 ∼ 40 µm) comprising anion and cation exchange layers with an identical poly(terphenyl alkylene) polymeric skeleton. Rapid mass transfer properties and high compatibility of the monopolar membrane layers endow the bipolar membrane with appreciable water dissociation efficiency and long-term stability. Incorporating the bipolar membrane into a flow-cell electrolyzer enables an ampere-level pure water electrolysis with a total voltage of 2.68 V at 1000 mA cm–2, increasing the energy efficiency to twice that of the state-of-the-art commercial BPM. Furthermore, the bipolar membrane realizes a durability of 1000 h at high current densities of 300 ∼ 500 mA cm–2 with negligible performance decay.

 Recent observations of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates offer insights into high-temperature superconductivity mechanisms. However, defects and dislocations in doped films complicate the realization of superconductivity, limiting current research to superconducting nickelate heterostructures. The lack of research on superconductivity in superlattices composed of ultrathin nickelates severely impedes not only the exploration of the interface effect on superconductivity, but also the utilization of heterostructure engineering for exploring higher superconducting temperature Tc.

 Like the crystallization of water to ice, magnetic transition occurs at a critical temperature after the slowing down of dynamically fluctuating short-range correlated spins. Here, we report a unique type of magnetic transition characterized by a linear increase in the volume fraction of unconventional static short-range-ordered spin clusters, which triggered a transition into a long-range order at a threshold fraction perfectly matching the bond percolation theory in a new quantum antiferromagnet of pseudo-trigonal Cu4(OH)6Cl2. Static short-range order appeared in its Kagome lattice plane below ca. 20 K from a pool of coexisting spin liquid, linearly increasing its fraction to 0.492(8), then all Kagome spins transitioned into a stable two-dimensional spin order at TN = 5.5 K. Inspection on the magnetic interactions and quantum magnetism revealed an intrinsic link to the spin liquid material Herbertsmithite, ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2. The unconventional static nature of the short-range order was inferred to be due to a pinning effect by the strongly correlated coexisting spin liquids. This work presents a unique magnetic system to demonstrate a complete bond percolation process toward the critical transition. Meanwhile, the unconventionally developed magnetic order in this chemically clean system should shed new light on spin-liquid physics.

 Over 60% of women with endometriosis experience abdominopelvic pain and broader pain manifestations, including chronic back pain, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, vulvodynia, and migraine. Although the imbalance of proinflammatory mediators, including the complement component C5a, is associated with endometriosis-related pain, the mechanisms causing widespread pain and the C5a role remain unclear. Female mice and women with endometriosis exhibit increased plasma C5a levels and pain. We hypothesize the Schwann cells involvement in endometriotic pain. Here, we show that silencing the C5a receptor (C5aR1) in Schwann cells blocks the C5a-induced activation of the NLRP1 inflammasome and subsequent release of interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Macrophages, recruited to sciatic/trigeminal nerves by IL-1β from Schwann cells, increase oxidative stress, which activates the proalgesic TRPA1 pathway, resulting in widespread pain.

 The ice-covered period of large Arctic rivers is shortening. To what extent will this affect biogeochemical processing of nutrients? Here we reveal, with silicon isotopes (δ30Si), a key winter pathway for nutrients under river ice. During colder winter phases in the Lena River catchment, conditions are met for frazil ice accumulation, which creates microzones. These are conducive to a lengthened reaction time for biogeochemical processes under ice. The heavier δ30Si values (3.5 ± 0.5 ‰) in river water reflect that 39 ± 11% of the Lena River discharge went through these microzones. Freezing-driven amorphous silica precipitation concomitant to increased ammonium concentration and changes in dissolved organic carbon aromaticity in Lena River water support microbially mediated processing of nutrients in the microzones. Upon warming, suppressing loci for winter intra-river nitrogen processing is likely to modify the balance between N2O production and consumption, a greenhouse gas with a large global warming potential.

 Accurate national terrestrial net ecosystem exchange estimates are crucial for the global stocktake. Net ecosystem exchange estimates from different inversion models vary greatly at national scale, and the relative impacts of prior fluxes and observations on these inversions remain unclear. Here we estimate the net ecosystem exchange of 51 land regions for the 2017-2019 period, focusing on the 10 largest countries, using prior fluxes from 12 terrestrial biosphere models and XCO2 retrievals from GOSAT and OCO-2 satellites as constraints. The average uncertainty reduction for the 10 countries increases from 37% with GOSAT and 45% with OCO-2 to 50% with combined observations, indicating a trend towards robust estimates. At finer spatial scales, even with combined observations, the uncertainty reduction is only 33%, i.e., the prior flux dominates the estimates. This finding underscores the critical importance of integrating multi-source observations and refining prior fluxes to improve the accuracy of carbon flux estimates.

 This study proposed an innovative joint inversion algorithm that synchronized Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) near-infrared (NIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) radiance data for accurate estimates of clear-sky precipitable water vapor (PWV). The algorithm consists of three parts: (1) simplifying the NIR radiative transfer equation by assuming linear reflectance change with wavelength in the 0.85–1.25 μm range, facilitating NIR water vapor absorption channel top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance simulation without explicit reflectance; (2) partial derivatives of NIR-TIR TOA radiance with respect to the background fields were derived by applying the one-term variational theorem to the radiative transfer equation; (3) optimization approach was employed to adjust the background fields, minimizing the discrepancy between simulated and observed NIR-TIR TOA radiances. The refined water vapor profile was integrated to derive PWV. Three years in situ measurements from the 473 GPS sites and 122 sun photometers in North America were utilized for PWV validation. Additionally, the MODIS MYD05 and MYD07 PWV products were validated using the same in situ measurements. Validation results indicated that the root mean square error (RMSE) of PWV retrieval using the NIR-TIR joint inversion algorithm ranged from 2.40 mm in summer to 1.67 mm in winter, and the mean bias and RMSE were − 0.55 mm and 2.08 mm, respectively, outperforming MODIS PWV products. The bias and RMSE were 3.84 mm and 4.86 mm for MYD05, and 0.41 mm and 4.60 mm for MYD07. Overall, the NIR-TIR joint inversion algorithm provides an effective way to generate comprehensive, long-term, high-resolution PWV data records."

 Open biomass burning in Southeast Asia has significant adverse impacts on air quality in the region and in downwind areas. These biomass burning events emit large amounts of light absorbing brown carbon (BrC). Once in the atmosphere, the light absorbing capacity of BrC is reduced by various oxidation processes. However, few modeling studies have been conducted to explicitly examine light absorption and bleaching on the prediction of ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). In this study, a modified Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model that explicitly tracks the concentrations of light absorbing and non-light absorbing organic aerosol components from different emission sources and the bleaching of BrC due to photooxidation and OH oxidation is applied to widespread open biomass burning events in March 2018 in Southeast Asia. Open biomass burning accounts for as much as 20–40 ppb (30–50%) of the maximum daily average 8-h ozone (MDA8 O3) and 40–120 μg m−3 (60–90%) of the daily average PM2.5 in the emission source regions. Compared to a simulation without BrC light absorption, the predicted MDA8 O3 and PM2.5 are as much as 16 ppb and 16 μg m−3 lower, respectively, than a simulation with light absorption. This confirms that neglecting the UV light absorption of BrC can lead to significant overpredictions of O3 and PM2.5 during the open biomass burning periods, which may lead to an overestimation of the adverse impacts of biomass burning on public health in Southeast Asia. The addition of BrC bleaching results in a 0.5–1% increase in MDA8 O3 and 1–5% increase in PM2.5 compared to the case without BrC bleaching. The results of this study indicate that light absorption by BrC needs to be considered in chemical transport modeling of large open biomass burning events. The BrC bleaching process is relatively slow and neglecting this process does not significantly change the predictions of MDA8 O3 and PM2.5 during open biomass burning."

 Numerous studies have linked air pollution to asthma. However, limited information exists on the effect of ambient ozone (O3), or its interactions with fine particulate matter (PM2.5) or temperature on peak expiratory flow (PEF) of in asthmatic adults. We conducted a longitudinal study including 99 adult asthma patients and documenting 7153 person-days PEF records. Utilizing linear mixed-effect and distributed non-linear models, we investigated the associations between ambient O3 exposures over lag0-14 days with morning and evening PEF, as well as diurnal PEF variability. Findings revealed significant associations between ambient O3 exposure with reduced morning and evening PEF, with varied associations for exposures across different lag days. Specifically, the most pronounced association with morning PEF was found for exposure at lag4, with a change of −0.211 (95%CI: −0.360, −0.062) L/min per 10 μg/m3 increase; for evening PEF, the strongest association was observed for exposure at lag0, with a change of −0.379 (95%CI: −0.721, −0.037) L/min per 10 μg/m3 increase. However, no significant association between O3 and diurnal PEF variability was found. Furthermore, we observed significant interactions between O3 and PM2.5 exposures from lag6 to lag9 on morning and evening PEF, and significant interactions between O3 and temperature from lag1 to lag11 on morning PEF and from lag0 to lag11 on evening PEF. Stronger associations between O3 and PEF were observed in males, those aged over 40 years, overweight individuals, smokers and those with non-allergic asthma.

 Multiple regulations have been promulgated to improve air quality, and previous studies have used an accountability chain to evaluate the effects of these regulations on emission levels, air quality, and human health. However, quantifying these impacts through the accountability chain is complex due to interactions between multiple factors that can influence the efficacy of control policies and introduce uncertainties at each step. We evaluated and quantified the impact of emission controls on electricity generating units (EGU) and motor vehicle sources on emissions and air quality via Generalized Additive Models. These GAMs have minimal bias (around 10−5 to 10−2 μg/m3 or ppbV) and r2 values for daily concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 Counterfactual air pollutant concentrations, in the absence of EGU and mobile source regulations, were calculated using estimated counterfactual emissions for the period 2005 to 2019 in Atlanta, New York City, and California's South Coast Air Basin. Counterfactual air pollutant concentrations indicated that the effects of regulations on air pollutants varied depending on the season and location. Predicted counterfactual air pollutant concentrations were generally 2–12 times higher than the measured concentrations at these sites, except for ozone. The impact of regulations on ozone concentrations typically resulted in reduced peak ozone values in the summer, but increased concentrations in the winter. Monte Carlo modeling found small to modest uncertainties, depending on the pollutant, location and regulations assessed. Counterfactual concentrations predicted in this project will be used in the assessment of the trends of toxicity in PM2.5."

 We collected simultaneous indoor and outdoor PM2.5 measurements from 17 homes in Dhaka, Bangladesh, to characterize spatio-temporal variations and identify factors influencing indoor and outdoor PM2.5 levels. A pair of PurpleAir PM2.5 sensors were deployed at each home, one indoors and the other outdoors, during the wet and dry seasons, and the locally calibrated data were used for analysis. Indoor and outdoor PM2.5 levels were three times higher during the dry season (indoor 146 ± 22 μg/m³, outdoor 153 ± 23 μg/m³) than during the wet season (indoor 52 ± 12 μg/m³, outdoor 50 ± 11 μg/m³). Indoor to outdoor (I/O) ratios were close to 1 in both seasons (dry: 0.97 ± 0.14, wet: 1.05 ± 0.19). This suggests that regional background pollution levels significantly influence indoor levels observed in different households. Infiltration factors closer to 1 (dry: 0.83 ± 0.12; wet: 0.87 ± 0.14), determined through mixed-effects regression of indoor and outdoor time series data, further highlight the substantial impact of outdoor pollution on indoor levels. Data from individual households exhibited strong temporal correlation between indoor and outdoor levels in both seasons (Pearson R: 0.82 ± 0.12 during the dry season and 0.83 ± 0.14 during the wet season), whereas indoor-outdoor spatial correlations across measured households were moderate (R: 0.49 and 0.62 during dry and wet seasons, respectively). These spatial correlations and empirical regression modeling suggest that while the spatial variation of outdoor PM2.5 levels significantly influences indoor levels' spatial variation, other factors such as indoor source activities and ventilation-related features play crucial roles in explaining variabilities in indoor PM2.5 across homes. Overall, our study suggests that indoor environments in Dhaka city are nearly as polluted as outdoor settings, and this locally derived scientific evidence can be valuable for enhancing public awareness and developing mitigation measures to reduce PM2.5 exposures in Bangladesh."

 The instantaneous radiative effects of cores of deep convective clouds (CDCCs) linked to well-organised long-lived convective system over the tropics is estimated for the first time using Megha-Tropiques (MT) during 2012‐–2018. Sondeur Atmosphérique du Profil d'Humidité Intertropicale par Radiométrie (SAPHIR) and Scanner for Radiation Budget (ScaRaB) onboard MT provides collocated and concurrent observations of CDCCs and associated fluxes on top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA), respectively. The vertical extent of CDCCs is estimated using collocated and concurrent CloudSat and SAPHIR observations. The CDCCs have a vertical extent above 10 km and their frequency of occurrence peaks between 13 and 16 km. CDCCs exert significant longwave radiative effect over the tropical Africa, northwest Pacific Ocean and northern Bay of Bengal during June–August with values ranging between 160 Wm−2 and 180 Wm−2. Over the convective core regions, the magnitude of day time (08–17 Local time) shortwave radiative effect of CDCCs (SWREC) ranges from −250 Wm−2 to −650 Wm−2 with peak values over northern Bay of Bengal and west Pacific Ocean during June to August. The SWREC aligns with both the incoming solar radiation and the occurrence frequency of CDCCs (OFCs), while the diurnal cycle of LWREC follows the OFCs, with a more pronounced variation over land. A diurnal amplitude of 30–40 Wm−2 is observed in LWREC over the ocean, ∼60 Wm−2 over land. The CDCCs exert a net radiative cooling ranging from −200 Wm−2 to −550 Wm−2 during daytime and a net warming during night time that reaches as high as 160 Wm−2."

 This study investigates the formation and dynamics of the Summer Shamal Wind (SSW) and its associated dust storms over the Middle East. A regional climate model, RegCM4, coupled with a dust module, is employed to simulate a severe dust storm event on June 12, 2006. To gain deeper insights, a novel dynamical mechanism is proposed. This mechanism highlights the crucial role of both mechanical and thermal forcing in shaping the regional atmospheric circulation. The vertical heat advection from the Zagros Mountains (ZAG), combined with the mechanical forcing from a shallow incident flow originating from the Turkmenistan anticyclone, triggers upward motion over the ZAG. This synergistic effect leads to the development of a mid-tropospheric anticyclone over the ZAG, which, in turn, induces a westward-propagating Rossby wave. The downward motion and descending air associated with this wave over Mesopotamia establish a terrain-induced local circulation. Consequently, the SSW emerges within a shallow layer at the null-vorticity zone of a coupling-pressure pattern formed by the Arabian anticyclone and the Zagros trough, which is itself a product of the terrain-induced circulation. The study concludes that the intensification and southward movement of the Turkmenistan anticyclone play a pivotal role in the formation of severe SSWs and subsequent dust storms over the Middle East."
