Based on microphysical properties, we show that within these clouds a distinction must be made between classic mixed-phase clouds and a mixed-phase haze regime. Instead of supercooled droplets, the haze regime contains large wet sea salt aerosols. These findings improve our understanding of Arctic low-level cloud processes. 
 A comprehensive in-situ dataset of low-level Arctic clouds was collected in the Fram Strait during the HALO-(AC)3 campaign in spring 2022 using the research aircraft Polar 6. The clouds observed at altitudes below 1000 m were frequently in a mixed-phase state. We demonstrate that despite comparable optical properties, classic mixed-phase clouds (MPC) and mixed-phase haze (MPH) can be distinguished on the basis of their microphysical properties, with MPH observed about 8 times more frequently than MPC. While the thermodynamic phases of the particles within the MPH are similar to those in the MPC, the supercooled droplets observed in MPC are replaced by large (> 3 µm) wet aerosol particles in MPH. Furthermore, the particle number concentration measured in MPH is reduced by approximately 3 orders of magnitude compared to MPC. MPH is observed in subsaturated air with respect to water, suggesting that the small liquid particles are haze droplets and are in equilibrium below the activation threshold to form cloud droplets. Chemical analysis suggested that the haze particles contained significant amounts of sea salt. Additional in-situ measurements with an optical particle counter indicated that their number concentration was 2 times larger over the sea ice compared to the open ocean. Furthermore, measurements of the vertical distribution of the thermodynamic phases in low-level Arctic clouds revealed a characteristic structure, with a liquid regime frequently occurring at the top of the atmospheric boundary layer, followed by MPCs, and an MPH layer below. The findings from this study enhance our understanding of the microphysical composition of clouds in mixed-phase conditions."

It found that pollution in the Arctic is decreasing, likely due to European emission regulations, while wildfires are becoming a more important source of particles. In Antarctica, particle levels are higher near the coast than inland, and vary by season. These results help us better understand how air pollution and climate are changing at the Earth’s poles. 
 A multi-year analysis of aerosol optical depth (AOD, τ) and Ångström exponent (α) was conducted using ground-based photometer data from 15 Arctic and 11 Antarctic sites. Extending the dataset of (Tomasi et al., 2015) through December 2024, the study incorporates stellar and lunar photometric observations to fill data gaps during the polar night. Daily mean values of τ at 0.500 µm and α (0.440–0.870 µm) were used to derive monthly means and seasonal histograms.In the Arctic, persistent haze events in winter and early spring lead to peak τ values. A decreasing trend in Arctic τ suggests the impact of European emission regulations, while biomass-burning aerosols are becoming more significant. In Antarctica, τ increases from the plateau to the coast. Fine-mode aerosols dominate in summer-autumn, while coarse-mode particles are more prevalent in winter-spring. Shipborne photometer data align well with ground-based measurements, confirming the reliability of mobile observations.Trend analyses using the Mann-Kendall test and Theil-Sen regression indicate a significant negative trend in τ at Andenes (−2.43 % per year), likely driven by reduced anthropogenic emissions. Antarctic stations such as Syowa and South Pole show positive trends (+3.84 % and +3.54 % per year), though these are subject to uncertainties from data limitations and instrument changes.This work contributes to the Polar-AOD network (https://polaraod.net/, last access: 15 May 2025), enhancing the understanding of aerosol variability and long-term trends in polar regions while promoting open data access for the scientific community."
10.5194/acp-26-1847-2026,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究涉及极地边界层混合相云的模拟，这是大气环境遥感技术中的一个重要领域，因为混合相云对空气质量监测和大气成分分析有重要影响。研究中使用的气候模型和参数化方法也与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['mixed-phase clouds', 'atmospheric general circulation model', 'radiative fluxes']",Étienne Vignon;Lea Raillard;Audran Borella;Gwendal Rivière;Jean-Baptiste Madeleine,Modeling the coupled and decoupled states of polar boundary-layer mixed-phase clouds,"Polar low-level clouds are most often of mixed-phase composition as they contain both liquid droplets and ice crystals. Such clouds are challenging to simulate in climate models, leading to uncertainties in the projection of polar climates. This study presents major advances in the representation of polar mixed-phase clouds in a climate model thanks to the adaptation of an original subgrid parameterization which considers interactions between turbulent eddies and clouds. 
 Representing mixed-phase clouds (MPCs) is a long-standing challenge for climate models, with major consequences regarding the simulation of radiative fluxes at high-latitudes and uncertainties in future cryosphere melting estimates. Low-level boundary-layer MPCs that prevail at high-latitudes can be either coupled or decoupled to the surface, which modulates their dynamical and microphysical properties. This study leverages a recent physically-based parameterization of phase partitioning considering an explicit coupling between microphysics and subgrid-scale dynamics and involving direct interactions between the cloud and turbulent diffusion schemes. This parameterization makes it possible to capture the structure of the decoupled state of polar boundary-layer MPCs – with a supercooled liquid dominated cloud-top sitting on top of precipitating ice crystals – in single column simulations with the LMDZ Atmospheric General Circulation Model. The positive feedback loop involving cloud-top radiative cooling induced by supercooled liquid droplets, subsequent buoyancy production of turbulence as well as the supercooled liquid water production associated with turbulence, is captured by the model. However, the liquid and cloud ice water path remain underestimated and most of the turbulence is confined near cloud top which is probably due to a missing parameterization for convective downdrafts in the model. The study further shows that accounting for the detrainment of shallow convective plume's air when diagnosing the in-cloud supersaturation makes it possible to capture the overall vertical structure of surface-coupled clouds, with realistic liquid and ice water contents. Nonetheless, a parameteric sensitivity analysis emphasizes the importance of properly calibrating the parameter controling the supercooled liquid water production term by subgrid turbulence."

Using standard gas cell measurements, it identifies key sources of modulation loss and spectral artifacts. A simple atmospheric example is included to demonstrate how these instrumental effects can influence scientific measurements. The results improve understanding of instrumental stability and support more accurate long-term use of the spectrometer. 
 This study investigates the impact of non-ideal instrumental effects on the performance of high-resolution Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometers, with a focus on the Bruker FTS 120M. Key non-idealities, including retroreflector misalignments, baseline drift, and spectral channeling, were systematically analyzed using advanced diagnostic tools such as ALIGN60 and LINEFIT. The nominal configuration exhibited significant anomalies, notably modulation efficiency (ME) deviations of up to +10.9 %, phase error (PE) variability of 2.11 × 10−2 radians, and spectral channeling frequencies such as a persistent 2.9044 cm−1, along with emerging frequencies around 0.24 cm−1 attributed to retroreflector wear and CaF2 beamsplitter degradation. A pronounced anomaly at 40.672 cm−1, likely induced by environmental factors such as external vibrations or mechanical instability, was also identified. Implementation of a modified configuration effectively addressed these issues, reducing PE variability to 0.042 × 10−2 radians, aligning ME within the NDACC-acceptable threshold of 1.1, and achieving substantial improvements in the instrument line shape (ILS), including sharper peaks, narrower full-width at half maximum (FWHM), and reduced sidelobe asymmetry. Analysis of HBr transmission spectra revealed improved fitting of the P(2) line, characterized by lower residuals and enhanced spectral quality. Simulated Haidinger fringes near zero path difference (ZPD) highlighted alignment degradation patterns, underscoring the necessity for precise optical adjustments. Temporal trends showed an increase in ILS peak height of >14 % associated with the instrument upgrade, together with significant mean absolute error (MAE) reductions achieved by the modified configuration. In addition, a targeted retrieval case study demonstrates that explicit propagation of the empirically characterized instrumental response into the forward model reduces spectral residuals and retrieval uncertainties while increasing the retrieved total column by approximately 6 %–7 % relative to the nominal configuration. Overall, this study provides a robust framework for diagnosing and correcting instrumental artifacts, ensuring the accuracy, reproducibility, and long-term stability of FTIR measurements essential for atmospheric trace gas retrievals."

Ward;Luke M. Western;Rachel L. Tunnicliffe;Elena Fillola;Aki Tsuruta;Tuula Aalto;Anita L. Ganesan,Uncertainty and retrieval sensitivity in TROPOMI-based methane inversions over the North Slope of Alaska,"We studied methane emissions in Arctic Alaska using satellite observations to assess how well they can monitor this important greenhouse gas. We found that emission estimates varied depending on the satellite data product and were strongly affected by assumptions in the model. Our results highlight the need for careful interpretation of emissions from Arctic satellite data and thorough testing of models, with implications for reliable climate monitoring. 
 The Arctic is experiencing unprecedented environmental changes with rapidly rising temperatures. Emissions of methane (CH4) – a potent greenhouse gas – may be increasing from the region, making accurate monitoring essential. The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) instrument offers high spatial and temporal coverage of CH4 column mole fractions. However, its data in the Arctic has historically exhibited seasonal and latitudinal biases and low-quality retrievals. A major challenge is the lack of ground-based validation data in high-latitude regions, which are used to improve satellite retrievals. This study evaluates inverse modelling to estimate CH4 emissions using TROPOMI measurements over the North Slope of Alaska. Using two retrieval products – the operational SRON product and the scientific WFMD product from the University of Bremen – we assess the alignment of derived emissions with surface measurement-derived inversions over 2018–2020 and test their robustness through sensitivity analyses. Our results show that tundra emissions from SRON inversions align more closely with surface measurement-derived emissions than WFMD inversions. Both TROPOMI-product derived emissions have anomalously low emissions in August 2018 compared to surface measurement-derived emissions, likely due to low data density resulting from high cloud cover. TROPOMI inversions provided stronger constraints on fugitive anthropogenic emissions compared to surface inversions. However, each retrieval produced different emission estimates, highlighting retrieval-dependent differences. Sensitivity tests revealed a strong prior dependence in both retrievals, raising concerns about robustness in northern high latitudes. This study highlights the importance of using multiple retrievals and rigorous sensitivity testing in high-latitude satellite inversions."

Testing both traditional and more recent convolutional neural networks (deep learning), we find that relatively small deep networks performed best, particularly for uncommon classes, because they extract richer features. Our results indicate that such compact models are sufficient for classifying small grayscale plankton images. 
 Plankton imaging devices produce vast datasets, the processing of which can be largely accelerated through machine learning. This is a challenging task due to the diversity of plankton, the prevalence of non-biological classes, and the rarity of many classes. Most existing studies rely on small, unpublished datasets that often lack realism in size, class diversity and proportions. We therefore also lack a systematic, realistic benchmark of plankton image classification approaches. To address this gap, we leverage both existing and newly published, large, and realistic plankton imaging datasets from widely used instruments (see Data Availability section for the complete list of dataset DOIs). We evaluate different classification approaches: a classical Random Forest classifier applied to handcrafted features, various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and a combination of both. This work aims to provide reference datasets, baseline results, and insights to guide future endeavors in plankton image classification. Overall, CNN outperformed the classical approach but only significantly for uncommon classes. Larger CNN, which should provide richer features, did not perform better than small ones; and features of small ones could even be further compressed without affecting classification performance. Finally, we highlight that the nature of the classifier is of little importance compared to the content of the features. Our findings suggest that compact CNN (i.e. modest number of convolutional layers and consequently relatively few total parameters) are sufficient to extract relevant information to classify small grayscale plankton images. This has consequences for operational classification models, which can afford to be small and quick. On the other hand, this opens the possibility for further development of the imaging systems to provide larger and richer images."

Ford;Jamie D. Shutler;Katy L. Sheen;Gavin H. Tilstone;Vassilis Kitidis,UEx-L-Eddies: decadal and global long-lived  mesoscale eddy trajectories with coincident  air–sea CO2 fluxes and environmental conditions,"Mesoscale eddies are abundant in the global oceans affect the physical, chemical and biological properties of the ocean. These changes can modify the air–sea CO2 fluxes. Here, we present a dataset of air–sea CO2 fluxes for 5996 long lived mesoscale eddies trajectories in the global ocean between 1993 to 2022. These trajectories can be used to understand the processes modifying and controlling the air–sea CO2 fluxes in mesoscale eddies which are supported by a comprehensive uncertainty budget. 
 Mesoscale eddies are prevalent features within the global ocean that modify the physical, chemical and biological properties as they move and evolve. These modifications can alter the air–sea exchange of CO2, and therefore these features may be hotspots for enhanced or reduced CO2 uptake compared to the surrounding environment. The understanding of the global and regional effect of mesoscale eddies on ocean CO2 uptake is limited and largely based on single eddies or small regional subsets. Here, we provide a global dataset of 5996 long lived eddies trajectories (lifetimes greater than a year) with corresponding air–sea CO2 fluxes between 1993 to 2022 all tracked using a Lagrangian approach. The trajectories comprise 3244 anticyclonic (“warm core”) and 2752 cyclonic (“cold core”) eddies and the dataset provides the environmental conditions, including the CO2 fluxes, within and outside each eddy. The dataset refines a previous regional methodology with a focus on climate quality environmental parameters and uses a global neural network for estimating the fugacity of CO2 in seawater (fCO2(sw)) along with a comprehensive air–sea CO2 flux uncertainty budget. These refinements provide a robust foundation for studying the modulation of air–sea CO2 fluxes by mesoscale eddies. As an example use of the dataset, we investigate the role of mesoscale eddies in modifying the global and regional air–sea CO2 fluxes, by comparing the eddy driven air–sea CO2 flux to that of the surrounding environment. We find that globally, long-lived anticyclonic eddies enhanced the CO2 sink by 4.5±2.8 % (95 % confidence), while long-lived cyclonic eddies reduce the CO2 sink by 0.7±2.6 %. Collectively, the long-lived mesoscale eddies indicate an enhancement of the ocean CO2 sink by 2.7±1.1 Tg C yr−1. Propagating the air–sea CO2 flux uncertainties was found to be a key component needed to fully understand apparent differences between previous regional and global studies.

Using anonymous GPS signals from vehicles, we tracked traffic CO2 emission patterns throughout the year 2023. The results show that emissions vary significantly between cities and across different days and seasons. This method could help cities monitor on-road emissions in real time and design better strategies to reduce them. 
 On-road transportation is a major contributor to CO2 emissions in cities, and high-resolution CO2 traffic emission maps are essential for analyzing emission patterns and characteristics. In this study, we developed new hourly on-road CO2 emission maps with a 100 × 100 m resolution for 20 major cities in France, Germany, and the Netherlands in 2023. We used commercial Floating Car Data (FCD) based on anonymized GPS signals periodically reported by individual vehicles, providing hourly information on mean speed and the number of GPS sample counts per street. Machine learning models were developed to fill FCD data gaps and convert sample counts into actual traffic volumes, and the COPERT model was used to estimate speed- and vehicle-type-dependent emission factors. These models were calibrated using independent traffic observations available for Paris and Berlin, and subsequently applied to the remaining 18 cities in an extrapolated manner due to data availability constraints. Hourly emissions, initially estimated at the street level, were aggregated to 100 × 100 m grid cells. Annual on-road CO2 emissions across the 20 European cities in 2023 ranged from 0.4 to 7.9 Mt CO2, with emissions strongly correlated with urban area (R2= 0.98) and, to a lesser extent, population size (R2= 0.74). Spatially, emissions are either highly concentrated along major highways in cities such as Paris and Amsterdam or more evenly distributed in cities such as Berlin and Bordeaux, highlighting the need for context-specific mitigation strategies. Temporally, this study shows the CO2 emission fluctuations due to holiday periods, weekly activity cycles, and distinct usage profiles of different vehicle types. Due to the low latency of FCD, this approach could support near-real-time traffic emission mapping in the future. Our approach enhances the spatial and temporal characterization of CO2 emissions in on-road transportation compared to the conventional method used in gridded inventories, indicating the potential of FCD data for near-real-time urban emission monitoring and timely policy-making. The datasets generated by this study are available on Zenodo https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16600210 (Shi et al., 2025)."

The water–energy–food–ecosystem (WEFE) Nexus offers a holistic lens, yet most applications remain conceptual, short-term, or treat ecosystems as external constraints. This study operationalizes the WEFE Nexus by embedding ecosystems as a coequal, quantified pillar through a hydrologic-regime-based method, since streamflow is a master variable shaping riverine ecosystem health. Long-term foresight is incorporated via dynamically downscaled climate projections and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways within a coupled water and energy systems (WEAP–LEAP) model. Applied to the semiarid Sakarya Basin in Türkiye, the framework evaluates three future periods (2020–2030, 2055–2065, and 2090–2100) across seven subbasins. Results show systemic trade-offs: municipal water security remains high (>90%), but ecosystem integrity and renewable energy goals are consistently compromised. Overall, WEFE Nexus Index values (0.53–0.86) show significant spatial disparities, with arid upstream regions consistently underperforming. Strikingly, SSP2 (business-as-usual) and SSP5 (fossil-fueled growth) yield nearly identical outcomes, underscoring the systemic unsustainability of current trajectories. This framework advances nexus assessment from theory to practice by integrating reproducible metrics, scenario planning, and spatial modeling, creating a practical tool for developing adaptive and resilient sustainability strategies."

Using mobile ultrafine particle (UFP) data in Toronto, we compared LUR models trained under random, spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal cross-validation (CV), with and without forward feature selection (FFS). Model hyperparameters and feature subsets were optimized within each CV scheme. Spatial CV folds were designed at fine scales to reflect UFP autocorrelation. Each approach was evaluated on a hold-out test set, across CV schemes, and against independent stationary backyard measurements. Models based on spatiotemporal CV coupled with FFS were able to reduce overfitting, improve generalization, and produce stable exposure surfaces. These surfaces avoided the spatial artifacts and exaggerated variable effects typically seen in models trained with random CV. Models tuned with random CV overfit, performed poorly on independent samples, and were sensitive to outliers. The average percentage error (APE) decreased from ∼217% for a model with random-CV to ∼79% with spatiotemporal CV and FFS. Our findings demonstrate that proper alignment of model design with the data’s spatiotemporal structure and modeling objective ensures reliability, minimizes data reproduction, and enables true prediction."

However, climate feedback from forestation, such as changes in wind speed and downwelling shortwave radiation following forestation driven by modified land-atmosphere heat, momentum, and moisture exchanges, could potentially compromise the availability of weather-dependent renewable energy. Here, based on coupled land-atmosphere simulations with contrasting forest distributions, our results showed that, in idealized forestation scenarios, pixels of forestation remaining suitable for renewable energy deployment are projected to experience a 27.8 ± 1.1% decline in wind energy potential and a 1.9 ± 0.1% reduction in solar energy potential. For the future emission scenario of SSP1-2.6, which is compatible with the goal of the Paris Agreement that limits global warming below 2 °C, forestation-driven reduction (−9.5 ± 1.9%) in wind energy potential for current onshore wind installations can even surpass that caused by climate change (−2.1 ± 1.5%). In contrast, solar energy change for current onshore solar installations in the SSP1-2.6 scenario is projected to be dominated by climate-driven increases (+3.9 ± 0.7%) rather than forestation-induced change (+0.3 ± 0.2%). Our study highlights the need to account for the trade-off between forestation-based carbon removal and renewable-based emission reduction when formulating climate mitigation pathways."

Assessing the toxicity of such mixtures is essential, yet experimental data are often unavailable. This study evaluates the feasibility of applying publicly available in silico tools, including TTC, QSAR models, and read-across, to estimate oral points of departure (PODs) for acute, subchronic, and chronic exposures to JP-5. Applicability domain assessments indicated broad QSAR model coverage, with OPERA and ToxTree fully inclusive and VEGA models showing mostly moderate-to-high confidence, aside from a few additives. Dosimetric adjustments and uncertainty factors were applied to extrapolate rat PODs to in silico-derived health guidance values (HGV). Mixture toxicity was estimated by using the concentration addition model and compared with existing HGV-based values to derive screening levels. In silico-derived HGVs generally aligned with available guidance values, and the TTC estimates were consistently conservative. Potential health effects were also curated based on available animal and mechanistic studies. Overall, this case study demonstrates that in silico models can help fill toxicological data gaps and provide screening-level insights into evaluating chemical mixture exposure when empirical data are limited."

These MPs enter the soil environment through land application, posing a threat to ecosystems. This study proposes an effective control strategy using alkali pretreatment (pH 10, 5 days) followed by hydrothermal treatment at 180 °C (AHT), achieving a degradation rate of 81.83% for polyethylene terephthalate MPs (PET-MPs) in sludge. AHT promotes the formation and solubilization of key active components in sludge, such as alkalinity, which drives nucleophilic attack, metal ions, which catalyze reactions, and organic matter, which acts as radical donors. These components synergistically disintegrate PET-MPs through hydrolysis and radical oxidation pathways during hydrothermal treatment. Meanwhile, hydrothermal treatment induces polymer chain motion and physical structural disruption, accelerating the penetration and reaction of active components, thereby achieving efficient degradation of PET-MPs. Spectral and high-resolution mass spectrometry analyses reveal that sludge AHT facilitates the transformation of MP-derived dissolved organic matter (MP-DOM) into molecules characterized by low-aromaticity, low-molecular-weight, high-saturation, and high-bioavailability. Concurrently, MP-DOM exhibits low acute toxicity toward aquatic organisms and the immortalized human liver cell line (THLE-2 cells). Therefore, sludge AHT effectively degrades and converts polyester MPs into MP-DOM with low-toxicity, thereby mitigating the risks of sludge-based MPs to ecosystems."

Our estimates reveal substantial discrepancies in magnitude, timing, and speciation of non-CO2 pollutants (CO, NMHC, PM2.5) compared to leading global inventories (EDGAR, CEDS, CAMS), highlighting critical inaccuracies in widely used data sets. More critically, future projections under Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) uncover a novel positive feedback mechanism: rising temperatures significantly enhance vehicular evaporative nonmethane hydrocarbon (NMHC) emissions. This temperature-dependent increase and subsequent NMHC oxidation to CO2 suggest an overlooked pathway that could amplify climate warming and air pollution globally, particularly after a breakpoint around 2050 (p < 0.05). While historical emissions peaked in the 1990s–2000s, nonexhaust PM becomes increasingly important. Air quality simulations using our inventory in the MUSICA model show good regional PM2.5 agreement but highlight challenges in resolving local primary pollutant peaks. This comprehensive inventory provides crucial data for Brazil and uncovers globally relevant climate–chemistry interactions, urging a re-evaluation of regional specificities in global emission assessments."

However, its climatic and hydrological impacts remain poorly quantified because high-quality data sets are scarce. This study introduces a novel Dual Random Forest (DRF) framework that synergistically constrains BCS concentration estimates through both physical mechanisms and observational fidelity. By pretraining with six spatiotemporally complete Earth System Model (ESM) simulations, driven by multisource reanalysis data, and fine-tuning against global field observations, the DRF generates a 44-year (1981–2024) global monthly BCS data set at 0.5° × 0.625° resolution. This data set achieves higher accuracy in BCS patterns and concentrations compared with observations (spatial correlation R = 0.92; normalized mean error NME = 31%), outperforming both single-constrained machine learning approaches (ESM- or observation-only) and traditional methods (CMIP5, CMIP6, and MODIS; R = 0.07–0.82, NME = 51%–1951%). It also excels in capturing seasonal variations and long-term annual trends, better reproducing increasing trends driven by anthropogenic forcing and decadal variability modulated by natural climate variability. This data set is hence valuable for robust quantification of BCS-induced radiative forcing and attribution of snowmelt acceleration to snow darkening versus climate warming on a global scale."

However, how contaminants adsorbed on sediment surfaces are degraded at oxic-anoxic interfaces remains unclear. Here we investigated the degradation of tetracycline (TC), a model adsorbed contaminant, during the oxygenation of three Fe(II)-bearing sediments. Quenching experiment results, in situ Raman spectra, and fluorescence microscope images revealed the formation of surface-bound •OH (•OHsurface). •OHsurface, rather than •OHfree, was primarily responsible for the rapid degradation of adsorbed TC. Sediments with moderate Fe(II) oxidation rates and electron release exhibited the highest •OHsurface production and TC degradation, due to competition between the pathways of •OHsurface generation and Fe(IV) formation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate a facet-dependent mechanism for the activation of adsorbed O2 on Fe(II)-bearing clay minerals in sediments and the subsequent production of •OHsurface via surface electron transfer processes. The degradation of adsorbed TC via •OHsurface oxidation followed a distinct pathway compared to homogeneous reactions, generating intermediates with larger molecular weights. Overall, our findings expand the understanding of •OH formation from aqueous phases to sediment surfaces, offering a novel but overlooked pathway for the natural attenuation of adsorbed organic contaminants at oxic-anoxic interfaces."

We investigated their interactions with synthetic lipid membranes, as well as cytotoxicity triggered by membrane disruption. Zwitterionic 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and negatively charged 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DOPG) liposomes were utilized as lipid membrane models for assessing fluorescence leakage caused by two positively charged, two negatively charged, and one neutral WSPs. Positively charged WSPs induced substantial leakage in DOPG liposomes with increasing polymer concentrations, whereas the negatively charged WSP caused only minor leakage in DOPC liposomes at high concentrations, and nonionic WSPs did not cause significant disruption. Quantification of in vitro cytotoxicity on one human (MCF7) and one fish (RTgill-W1 from Oncorhynchus mykiss) cell line confirmed the WSP’s ability to disrupt membrane integrity. Cationic WSPs also caused cytotoxicity in both cell lines at similar concentrations, distinguishing them from negatively charged and neutral WSPs. These findings highlight the pivotal role of electrostatic interactions between charge characteristics of WSPs and phospholipid headgroups of biological membranes. Although WSPs are often exempted for toxicity tests in chemicals regulations such as the European Union’s REACH, further evaluation is necessary to understand their toxic potential and modes of toxic action."

However, its practical implementation has been hindered by inherent challenges, such as sluggish reaction kinetics and limited mass transfer, especially under low-salinity conditions. To address these issues, this study proposes an induced-charge Faradaic CDI (IC-Faradaic CDI) system. The key innovation lies in the strategic integration of Faradaic CDI with an electric double-layer mechanism through a wireless induced-charge IC unit. This design modulates the electric field and ion transport, optimizes the concentration distribution, and establishes a universal pathway to reconcile the trade-off between kinetics and capacity. As a result, the IC-Faradaic CDI system delivers a desalination capacity of 0.269 mg cm–2 and an outstanding average desalination rate of 0.027 mg cm–2 min–1, surpassing most existing Faradaic CDI systems. Furthermore, to validate its real-world applicability, a larger-scale system (324 cm2) was constructed, achieving 77% salt removal from simulated brackish water and the effective desalination of real brackish water from the Yangtze River estuary. This work provides a novel and universal strategy to alleviate the kinetic limitations of Faradaic CDI and offers a low-cost, membrane-free, and energy-efficient solution for high-performance water treatment."

In this study, we investigate the technoeconomic and environmental viability of electrochemically upcycling low-value industrial-grade crude glycerol (50 wt % glycerol) and methanol-depleted crude glycerol (80 wt % glycerol) into formic acid, a valuable chemical commodity. Through process modeling, we assess purification processes and electrochemical oxidation pathways for these waste glycerol streams. Our findings indicate that utilizing low-value crude glycerol can produce formic acid at competitive costs, contingent upon advancements in catalyst efficiency and reactor design. Life cycle assessments reveal that this approach could reduce environmental impacts compared to traditional formic acid production, especially as the U.S. electricity grid decarbonizes through additional renewable energy deployment. State-level analyses highlight the influence of regional electricity prices, water costs, policies, and incentives on economic feasibility.

Using monthly observations over a decade in Xiamen Bay and integrating flow cytometry, high-throughput sequencing, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), and NanoSIMS carbon tracing, we explored how microbially driven carbon cycling responds to these dual forces. Our findings reveal that under present-day conditions, a +4 °C warming would increase the abundances of Synechococcus (∼19%) and microeukaryotic algae (∼5%), suggesting an enhanced potential for labile dissolved organic matter (LDOM) production. NanoSIMS experiments showed a 5-fold increase in heterotrophic bacterial assimilation of phytoplankton-derived carbon at elevated temperatures (30 °C versus 22 °C). Concurrently, intensified riverine discharge delivered terrestrial recalcitrant DOM (RDOM), altering DOM molecular composition and decreasing overall bioavailability. These combined stressors restructured microbial communities, accelerating heterotrophic carbon processing and reducing the ratio of ecologically persistent DOM to recalcitrant dissolved black carbon. We propose a Dual-DOM Forcing framework that formalizes how thermal (autochthonous LDOM) and hydrological (allochthonous RDOM) drivers jointly regulate microbial carbon processing, DOM persistence, and coastal carbon sequestration potential. This framework provides a transferable basis for assessing the vulnerability of coastal blue carbon sinks to concurrent warming and altered river discharge."

However, precise coordination of Zn SACs is highly required to selectively trigger the ETP pathway. Herein, under the guidance of density functional theory (DFT) predictions, we constructed asymmetric Zn–N3Cl sites on N-doped carbon (NC) to unlock the electron-transfer reactivity of redox-inert Zn while maintaining structural robustness. Compared with the symmetric Zn–N4 system, the Zn–N3Cl system achieved a higher sulfamethoxazole (SMX) removal rate and PMS utilization efficiency by 4.4 and 2.3 times, respectively. Mechanism studies revealed that Cl doping significantly altered the electronic structure of Zn sites, thereby promoting their electron transfer capacity. The strongly polarized Zn–N3Cl sites exhibited a notably enhanced interaction with PMS, facilitating the formation of Zn–N3Cl/PMS* with high redox potential and lowering the energy barrier of the rate-determining step (RDS) for ETP. The Zn–N3Cl system demonstrated outstanding catalytic reactivity toward various environmental interferences over a wide pH range. Notably, this system remained effective for the continuous flow-through treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater, coupling high catalytic reactivity and structural robustness.

Studies have explored 2-MTS sinks within aerosols, but observations of 2-MTS in atmospheric waters indicate a need to understand the fate of 2-MTS in clouds and fogs. In batch reactor experiments, we oxidized 2-MTS in 30, 300, and 3000 μM solutions to understand 2-MTS fate in cloud, fog, and aerosol water. Ion chromatography (IC) revealed production of acetate, oxalate, and Sulfinorg with 2-MTS oxidation. Our 30, 300, and 3000 μM experiments revealed a 5%, 20%, and 32% gap in the sulfur mass balance, respectively, suggesting organosulfates (OSs) formed from 2-MTS oxidation.

This study systematically investigated the cellular and virological effects of polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) using three medically relevant viruses─human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71)─across multiple human cell lines under identical experimental conditions. PS-MP exposure induced dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity, G2/M cell-cycle arrest, and early apoptosis, including effects observed at subcytotoxic concentrations. Coexposure assays revealed increased detectable infection levels and enhanced cold-temperature persistence of enveloped viruses (HCoV-OC43 and RSV), whereas no comparable effect was observed for the nonenveloped EV-A71, suggesting preferential effects on viral stability rather than intrinsic infectivity. Under coexposure conditions, PS-MPs reduced type I interferon (IFN-α/β) expression, indicating impaired innate antiviral signaling, while modulation of IFITM3 expression varied depending on viral species and host cell context. Gene-expression analyses demonstrated virus-specific antiviral modulation with attenuated interferon-mediated antiviral priming during HCoV-OC43 infection and reduced IFITM3 expression in RSV-infected cells. Collectively, these findings indicate that PS-MPs act as environmental and biological cofactors that induce cellular stress, suppress antiviral immune responses, and promote viral stability under low-temperature conditions, with implications for viral persistence in contaminated ecosystems."

Based on reanalysis data and surface‐station observations, we demonstrate that the amplitude of SAM variability has substantially increased over the past eight decades, which is associated with more frequent and severe weather extremes. A simple model and idealized climate experiments reveal that this amplification is primarily driven by enhanced stochastic eddy momentum flux, which is linked to a strengthened meridional temperature gradient. State‐of‐the‐art climate model projections indicate that SAM variability will likely continue to intensify throughout the 21st century, driven by a further increase in the meridional temperature gradient.

Upstream spatiotemporal propagation characteristics of EPEs can provide useful precursors for forecasting North China EPEs but remains poorly understood. Using climate network analysis, two dominant EPEs propagation pathways, that is, a northwestern pathway from West Siberian Plain (6‐day lead) and a southwestern pathway from Tibetan Plateau (TP) (3‐day lead), are identified during the warm season. The northwestern pathway is driven by an eastward‐propagating mid‐latitude wave train coupled with Arctic cyclone. The cyclone in the wave train drives the southeastward‐propagating EPEs, and when it merges with the Arctic cyclone, its downstream anticyclone is enhanced, ultimately inducing North China EPEs. The southwestern pathway stems from quasi‐stationary waves coupled with Arctic anticyclone. Interactions between anticyclone in the wave train and Arctic anticyclone generate a TP cyclone, whose intensification and eastward expansion propel EPEs northeastward and strengthen the Northeast Asian anticyclone, ultimately causing North China EPEs."

However, observed trends are “La Niña‐like,” displaying a strengthened zonal equatorial gradient, raising concerns about the accuracy of these projections. Here we explore multi‐model ensemble variability in the projected Pacific warming pattern. This pattern variability is largely explained by two dominant patterns: one linked to hemispheric warming asymmetries, and the other to zonal equatorial gradients. Crucially, model differences in projected zonal equatorial gradients are strongly tied to the model representation of the mean state in the off‐equatorial east and west Pacific. This implies that mean state biases partly control the projected warming pattern. Moreover, models with more realistic mean states tend to produce: (a) historical trends with stronger gradients, aligning better with observations, and (b) more “El Niño‐like” future projections."

Compared to average ETCs, extreme ETCs exhibit an amplified tilt magnitude during the intensification phase and a change in the sign of the lateral tilt prior to maximum intensity. Accounting for the tilted vertical structure, this study shows that average ETCs are associated with an upper‐level positive PV $PV$ anomaly, which is constant through the ETC lifecycle, while the PV $PV$ intensifies from the bottom up. In contrast, extreme ETCs are characterized by a growing magnitude of upper‐level PV $PV$ anomaly, and a simultaneous intensification throughout the lower levels."

To evaluate observed changes in UK winter precipitation from 1901 to 2023, we separate the signal into dynamical and non‐dynamical components by applying a dynamical adjustment using European weather patterns. We find long‐term changes in the non‐dynamical component are tied to temperature, with a 7% increase in UK winter precipitation per degree of local warming, in line with expected increases in atmospheric moisture content. We find this significant increase in non‐dynamical winter precipitation is attributable to anthropogenic forcing according to the CMIP6 global climate model simulations. Notably, most CMIP6 models produce a much weaker intensification of the non‐dynamic (thermodynamic) component relative to observations, with a model ensemble mean scaling of 4% °C−1. The results show that projections based on CMIP6 models could underestimate the scaling of precipitation with temperature and increase in flood risk."

Coupled climate models are conventionally used to more robustly sample these teleconnections and their differences, yet they have persistent tropical sea surface temperature (SST) biases. To better understand teleconnection differences between EP and CP El Niño, we use atmosphere‐only ensemble simulations with both observed and realistic synthetic SSTs generated from a Linear Inverse Model. With a sufficient number of El Niño events, the perceived teleconnection differences weaken due to broader sampling of event patterns, event strengths, and intrinsic atmospheric variability.

High‐resolution WRF‐LES simulations demonstrate that while moderate winds conform to MOST, the constant‐flux‐layer assumption fails under low winds: momentum flux varies by 378% within 25 m. Applying MOST under these conditions yields height‐increasing CD, explaining the excessively large CD in observations. Additionally, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) is significantly lower under low winds, and the mean momentum flux reverses to upward. Further analysis identifies hundred‐meter‐scale eddies causing counter‐local‐gradient transport, with spectral analysis confirming their dominance in momentum flux. The near‐surface momentum flux is primarily generated by pressure perturbations and transported upward via vertical gradient terms."

Global warming has driven substantial snow cover retreat, yet projections from climate models vary widely, hindering reliable climate change adaptation and policy planning. For the Tibetan Plateau (TP), observationally constrained projections offer an opportunity to improve the credibility of snow cover projections, yet such applications are still limited. Based on climate models, we find that the historical inter‐model snow cover reductions are strongly correlated with the projected remaining snow cover by the end of the 21st century. By this emergent relationship and satellite‐derived products, we calibrate the best estimate of the remaining frequency of spring snow cover (relative to 1981–2020) to 37%, which is lower than the multi‐models' prediction (55%) and substantially reduces inter‐model spread (17% after constraint compared to 23% in standard deviation) in a high emission scenario. Cross‐validation tests reinforce the robustness of the constrained projection. The underestimation of snow cover loss is likely attributed to an underestimation of observed warming magnitude. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the choice of period for historical snow cover extent reduction trends and climate model ensemble are the main sources of uncertainty, whereas differences between the two satellite‐derived data sets have only a limited impact on the constraint."

Using new seismic data from the 2nd‐phase array of the China‐Myanmar Geophysical Survey in the Myanmar Orogen, we construct a high‐resolution catalog of 1,819 local‐shallow earthquakes in central and southern Myanmar by combining deep‐learning algorithms and manual phase‐pick refinement, with 93 robust focal mechanisms. Integrated with a previous catalog further north, our analysis reveals that the Sagaing Fault dips eastward at ∼73° in the north, transitions to a nearly‐vertical geometry at ∼20.5°N, and continues further south. This newly identified fault segmentation and associated geometric variations provide essential constraints for improving fine‐scale rupture modelling of the 2025 earthquake. For the whole of Myanmar, our results suggest an abrupt along‐strike north‐south change of shallow seismicity across ∼20°N, with contrasting earthquake distributions and focal mechanisms."

Security constraints prevented timely field investigations on its surface rupture, hindering analysis of seismotectonics and rupture dynamics. Using high‐resolution satellite imagery, we mapped a ∼420 km surface rupture and measured 540 dextral offsets, revealing an average slip of 2.7 m and a maximum of 5.6 m. The rupture consists of two sections separated by a low‐slip‐zone that aligns with the refined epicenter and a previously unmapped stepover, suggesting the earthquake most likely nucleated at this structure and then propagate bilaterally. The rupture extends beyond the known seismic gap and overlaps with some recent historical rupture, highlighting contrasting earthquake recurrence cycles along different fault sections. Our mapping provides essential documentation of an ultra‐long, multi‐segment rupture on a major continental strike‐slip fault under restricted field access, offering critical insights into the rupture behavior of similar faults worldwide."

Observations show that these transitions often occur abruptly within days. We develop a new framework to diagnose zonally asymmetric abrupt seasonal changes (ASC) in tropical circulation, using a pseudo‐streamfunction (Ψpseudo) and a dual‐component vector index (ASCI). Ψpseudo recovers the traditional overturning streamfunction when zonally averaged and is decomposed into rotational and divergent parts via Helmholtz decomposition. Strong ASC is found over land regions containing low‐heat‐inertia land area and intense deep convection, notably the Maritime Continent and South America. Unlike the zonally symmetric Hadley cell, rotational flow dominates ASC in these regions, with divergent flow contributing in regions with strong convection. These results highlight the essential role of tropical and extratropical eddies in shaping abrupt seasonal transitions in regional tropical circulation."

Recent studies using ice core records report large increases (up to tenfold) in Arctic TFA deposition since the 1970s, and trends suggest long‐lived chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) replacements may be a major source. Here, we use a chemical transport model to examine the global TFA budget arising from CFC replacements–hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)–and inhalation anesthetics. Global TFA deposition from these sources increased ∼3.5‐fold from 6.8 (5.9–7.6) Gg/yr in 2000 to 21.8 (18.6–25.0) Gg/yr in 2022, with cumulative deposition reaching 335.5 Gg. We find HCFC‐123, HCFC‐124, and HFC‐134a account for most modeled TFA production and that long‐lived CFC replacements account for virtually all of the observed Arctic deposition trend. At lower latitudes, our analysis supports the recent emergence of hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) as a TFA source. We conclude that increased TFA monitoring is required."

May,Biases in Southern Ocean Precipitation From Shallow Convection: The Role of Cloud Morphology,"Precipitation from marine boundary layer clouds is a critical yet highly uncertain feature of post‐frontal conditions over the Southern Ocean (SO), where shallow convection dominates. This study evaluates whether satellite retrievals (GPM‐IMERG and CloudSat) and reanalysis (ERA5) represent the contrasting precipitation between open and closed mesoscale cellular convection (MCC) observed over the SO, from limited in situ records. Substantial discrepancies are found across data sets. While ERA5 captures the expected contrast, GPM‐IMERG underestimates precipitation, especially from open MCCs, and fails to reflect morphological distinction. Both CloudSat products detect higher mean precipitation for open MCCs, though with differences in intensity distribution. Using observed precipitation rates and occurrence frequencies, open MCCs are estimated to contribute 9%–13% and closed MCCs 1%–11% of the annual precipitation between 40°S and 50°S. These results highlight the importance of improving the representation of marine atmospheric boundary layer cloud morphologies in models and observational data sets to better constrain the SO water cycle."

We introduce the Multi‐Physics Generative Pre‐trained PINN (MP‐GPT‐PINN), a meta‐learning framework to resolve this bottleneck. Its innovation is a two‐stage strategy: an offline pre‐training stage uses a greedy algorithm to build a compact library of PINN solutions for key parameters. A rapid online stage then generates new solutions by combining these pre‐trained bases in an optimal linear manner. For multi‐physics problems, we designed a parallel dual‐network architecture to couple the seepage and chemical fields robustly. Validated across complex groundwater systems, MP‐GPT‐PINN accelerates online predictions by four orders of magnitude while maintaining high fidelity, with dimensionless L2 ${L}_{2}$ relative errors for physical fields approaching 10−3.

We report observations from two campaigns in May and October 2024, each featuring 10‐ton TNT‐equivalent controlled surface chemical explosions recorded by a dense network of 31 single‐sensor stations within 23 km. Despite identical sources, the observed wavefields were very different. October signals followed a near‐unimodal period–distance trend, whereas May signals exhibited a pronounced azimuthal bifurcation in both period and celerity. Downwind paths largely preserved the short‐period baseline observed in October, while upwind paths showed systematically longer periods caused by wind‐driven low‐pass filtering. This study provides the first direct observational evidence that tropospheric winds can impose azimuth‐dependent low‐pass filtering at local ranges, without the influence of measured temperature inversions. Thus, the structure of the atmosphere can modify the spectral characteristics of low‐frequency acoustic waves even at a distance of only a few kilometers."

In this study a numerical model with comprehensive Secondary Ice Production (SIP) descriptions is used to investigate the impact of SIP on the evolution of medicane Qendresa. SIP refers to processes that can generate small cloud‐ice crystals in concentrations exceeding those produced by primary ice nucleation, promoting cloud glaciation and precipitation. However, its effects on medicane thermodynamics have not been considered before. Our results indicate that improving SIP representation in the model leads to a more accurate prediction of the cyclone track, resulting in improved precipitation patterns, particularly in the regions where extreme precipitation is observed."

Box model simulations revealed that dialkene chemistry enhanced ROx cycle rates by over 10% under BD‐dominant and 40% under isoprene‐dominant conditions contributing nearly half of reactive aldehyde formation. Further simulations on O3 indicate that the reactive aldehydes formed from dialkenes exert an influence nearly equivalent to the direct impact of dialkenes. Varying dialkenes composition and abundance modulate ROx activity and secondary aldehydes formation.

Motivated by persistent LLJs detected through Doppler LiDAR observations during March to April 2021, this study systematically characterizes these LLJs over Juehua Island (western Bohai Sea coast) by integrating high‐resolution Weather Research and Forecasting Model simulations. Based on a 61‐day simulation spanning March to April 2021, this study reveals a notable LLJ occurrence frequency of 25.3%, dominated by two distinct directional modes: southwesterly and northeasterly. The high frequency and pronounced directional dominance of LLJs in this region motivated a systematic investigation combining Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis and sensitivity experiments. The LLJ‐favorable synoptic patterns were extracted through EOF analysis of the sea‐level pressure (SLP) field. The northwest‐southeast SLP dipole pattern plays a dominant role, contributing 68% to LLJ formation. Southwesterly and northeasterly LLJs are favored by “high‐southeast, low‐northwest” and its opposite synoptic dipoles, respectively. Sensitivity experiments quantify the contribution of local geography at 21%, collectively accounted for by the Bohai Sea (16%) and the northwestern highlands (5%). Additionally, the Bohai Sea preferentially enhances southwest LLJs, which exhibit lower LLJ heights. In contrast, the northwestern highlands elevate LLJ heights and align LLJ directions with the terrain orientation, resulting in a more clustered wind direction distribution. This study quantified LLJ‐favorable synoptic patterns, Bohai Sea and northwestern high terrain influences. These findings could provide valuable insights for regional LLJ forecasting."

This study presents a framework for assessing the future compound flood hazard profiles in a coastal megacity in the Delta region of southern China. A coupled hydrology‐hydrodynamic model is applied to simulate the flooding processes of 7 typhoon events. Scenarios are constructed using all possible pairwise combinations of three rainfall and three CWL conditions. These inputs are derived from statistical and dynamical downscaling of climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) ensemble under the SSP5‐8.5 pathway. The results show that future CWL rise contributes more to future inundation than increasing rainfall, whereas rainfall contributions exhibit considerable uncertainties due to regional rainfall downscaling. Under extreme warming scenarios, future typhoons may produce increases of up to 230 mm in total rainfall and 28 mm per hour in rainfall intensity, which in turn increase the average urban inundation depth and area by 1.2 cm and 24.7 km2 $\mathrm{k}{\mathrm{m}}^{\mathrm{2}}$, respectively. Given an average CWL of 170 cm and a maximum CWL of 440 cm in the future, the inundation depth and area could increase by up to 8.4 cm and 29 km2 $\mathrm{k}{\mathrm{m}}^{\mathrm{2}}$, respectively. Within the 7 typhoons in this study, Hagupit (2014) exhibits the most notable compound effect, potentially expanding the medium‐to‐high risk area (inundation depth above 27 cm) by over 5%. This study demonstrates that climate change may intensify TCF, requiring flood‐mitigating measures to consider rainfall‐CWL interactions."

 Capsular polysaccharides (CPS) are key virulence determinants, constituting the protective capsule that surrounds bacterial pathogens. Here, we present the complete cryo-EM structure of Gram-negative bacterial CPS secretion machinery formed by the E. coli K12 Wza-Wzc complex. The structure reveals an elongated, continuous channel spanning the entire envelope that facilitates CPS secretion. Multiple structural snapshots of the ADP-bound Wza-Wzc complex capture intermediate conformations of the double membrane assembly, highlighting its remarkable intrinsic dynamics. In-depth analysis of the isolated Wza translocon and Wzc co-polymerase, reveals mechanistic details of both complex formation and CPS transport. We further uncover the jellyroll domain of Wzc as a CPS-binding module, likely guiding CPS repeat units into a proposed Wzc-Wzy polymerization platform. Collectively, this work provides structural and functional insights into CPS synthesis and transport, advancing our understanding of bacterial capsule formation and virulence mechanisms.

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a relatively low incidence but a high mortality rate, primarily due to difficulties in early detection. Current state-of-the-art methods for diagnosing early-stage PDAC tend to be invasive, time-consuming, and unreliable, primarily due to the difficulties associated with the early detection of pancreatic cancers. Here we show a quick and sensitive method for the early diagnosis of PDAC using a signal-enhanced lateral flow immunoassay called SELFI. We develop SELFI, which generates a strong colorimetric signal through multiple hotspots formed by plasmonic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) assembled on a silica nanoparticle. Our SELFI assay achieves a 10,123-fold increase in the limit of detection compared to conventional lateral flow immunoassays using 20 nm AuNPs, providing results within 15 min. We demonstrate that SELFI enables early diagnosis of PDAC, as indicated by a receiver operating characteristic curve and a larger area under the curve compared to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. SELFI’s effective diagnostic features can enhance the timely identification of PDAC and may also serve in the early diagnosis of a range of other diseases.

 Policy acceptance is one of the biggest hurdles to climate action and is heavily driven by people’s perceptions of fairness. Here we investigate which distributive justice principles people prefer and whether these distributive preferences are linked to policy preferences along three policy characteristics: stringency, redistribution, and instrument type. Using an online survey experiment (N = 2, 230), we assess agreement with four justice principles relevant to the decarbonisation context - equal outcomes, sufficientarianism, limitarianism, and utilitarianism - and identify groups with distinct justice orientations. Using data from two choice experiments, we show that climate justice orientation is associated with distinct policy preferences, with most individuals supporting a combination of principles and being sensitive to redistribution in policy design. This study provides further evidence on the widely noted observation that justice is a key aspect in the public’s policy assessment. We suggest this justice orientation should be considered in both policymaking and policy-driven research.

 Normal faulting in the southern Tibetan rift system reflects ongoing orogenic collapse. Here we use multisensor InSAR (Lutan-1, Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2) to map deformation from the 2025 MW 7.0 Dingri earthquake and to invert fault geometry and slip for the main rupture and a geodetically inferred west-side slip episode. The mainshock exhibits bimodal slip on steeply dipping conjugate faults (dip ≥55°). The west-side episode is equivalent to MW ~6.0 and involves two oppositely dipping segments, including deeper reactivation of the fault that ruptured in the 2020 MW 5.6 Dingri earthquake. Numerical dynamic-rupture simulations indicate that, under the adopted friction and stress conditions, static and dynamic stress perturbations alone are unlikely to generate MW ~6 slip on the west-side structure, implying additional weakening or near-critical prestress. Larger fault-bounded volumes host larger slip, highlighting the role of connectivity and mechanical heterogeneity in seismic hazard assessment.

 Asian countries face the dual challenge of fulfilling ambitious climate commitments under the Paris Agreement while simultaneously advancing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study develops an integrated analytical framework that links decarbonization pathways with SDG indicators across energy, air quality, health, and the food-water-land nexus, as well as policy cost-effectiveness, explicitly incorporating national circumstances. Our findings indicate that current climate pledges primarily deliver gains in SDG indicators related to energy and air quality. Achieving broader progress across other SDG dimensions requires combining more ambitious climate targets with diverse, sustainability-oriented mitigation measures tailored to domestic contexts. Middle- and low-income countries face greater pressure in balancing transition costs and target feasibility; therefore, strengthened international support and robust domestic policies are needed to advance climate ambition alongside sustainable development, including climate finance, technology transfer, and measures that can ensure a just transition for vulnerable industries. In Asia, climate pledges and their implementation fall short of meeting the 1.5 degree centigrade and SDG targets, and countries need tailored mitigation strategies to balance ambition, sustainability, and economic impacts, according to an integrated assessment framework analysis."

 Sustainable agri-food system transformation in Africa is critical for addressing the persistent challenges of hunger and malnutrition while promoting sustainability. Here, we investigate how green growth initiatives intersect with the agri-food system transformation in the African Continental Free Trade Area context. We combine World Development Indicators, International Financial Statistics, and OECD data, and we use the Prais-Winsten regression model to analyze the relationship between green growth initiatives and Sustainable Development Goal 2- Zero Hunger indicators across 46 African countries. We show that green growth initiatives positively impact agricultural productivity and cereal yield but negatively affect total fisheries production. Low-income countries, including Malawi, Uganda, Mozambique, and Sierra Leone experience mixed effects, while upper-middle-income countries such as South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, and Mauritius face more challenges. Economic growth, renewable energy, and financial development significantly influence agri-food system sustainability, but challenges like carbon dioxide emissions and deforestation hinder progress. Policymakers should prioritize pro-poor green technology investments, enhance finance accessibility, and implement environmental mitigation measures while fostering trade openness and regional cooperation.

 Accurately quantifying canopy height and above-ground carbon across diverse land-cover types is crucial for understanding carbon storage dynamics and guiding climate-mitigation strategies. Yet existing maps often overlook non-forest ecosystems. Here we present a deep learning framework based on a U-Net architecture that combines radar, optical, elevation and slope data to produce a 10 m canopy height map across China. The model is trained with laser measurements from NASA’s GEDI mission validated using unmanned aerial vehicle lidar data (MAE = 2.39 m). We then estimate the above-ground biomass and carbon from these heights using a Random Forest model (MAE = 37.71 Mg ha-1). By deriving carbon from canopy height, we take advantage of U-Net’s ability to capture trees in non-forest ecosystems such as croplands, grasslands and urban areas. Our nationwide 30 m carbon map reveals that trees outside forests contribute 20.8-32.9% of China’s above-ground carbon in 2019 (3.62-5.72 Pg C), underscoring their importance.

 Monitoring stress recovery and accumulation associated with megaquakes helps to assess their recurrence. Previous studies proposed a high likelihood of imminent recurrence for the 2011 Tohoku and the 17th-century Hokkaido megaquakes belonging to the magnitude-9 class, although their current stress state remains uncertain. Here we compare the occurrence of small earthquakes relative to larger ones, using b-values, showing high b-values in the source area of the Tohoku earthquake, indicating low stresses. In contrast, low b-values occurred in the source area of the 17th-century earthquake, indicating high stresses as seen before the Tohoku event. Around the low-b-value zone, phenomena that provide insight into subsequent large earthquakes are observed, and which were reported for worldwide earthquakes: seismic quiescence, a seismic gap, strong plate coupling, and slow earthquake activity avoiding megaquakes’ rupture zones. Results imply that the Hokkaido and Tohoku megaquakes occur nonrandomly in time, rather their recurrence intervals are more characteristic.

 Accurate large-scale crop yield mapping is crucial for understanding how weather and climate variability affect food security. While temporal deep learning models have achieved notable success in extracting time-series features for yield mapping, they often struggle to model spatial dependencies, such as yield spatial autocorrelations and the influence of time-invariant variables (e.g., soil properties and topography). To address this limitation, we propose KGML-Graph, a knowledge-guided graph machine learning framework that integrates spatial learning with temporal structures to explicitly capture these underutilized spatial dependencies. We incorporate knowledge-guided edge weights, derived from historical yield correlations, into the graph structure to identify patterns among counties with similar yield dynamics and enhance model training. The framework was evaluated using data from 627 counties across the U.S. Corn Belt from 2000 to 2020, benchmarking against Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (TempCNN). Results show that KGML-Graph outperformed benchmarks in cross-year testing, reducing RMSE by at least 10.8%, and improved R2 by at least 9.3% in temporal extrapolation during 2017–2020. Furthermore, it demonstrated superior spatial transferability by maintaining accuracy in unseen regions and significantly reducing spatial autocorrelation in estimation residuals. Under extreme climatic conditions, the model achieved at least a 14.4% improvement in R2 on out-of-distribution test data and reduced the mean estimation residual from -0.413 to -0.074 metric tons per hectare, effectively mitigating the systematic yield overestimation observed in baseline models. Our attribution analyses highlighted the contributions of both graph structure and knowledge-guided edge weights to the improved performance by better capturing spatial patterns and representing key static variables, such as soil organic carbon content. These findings underscore the potential of KGML-Graph as a robust framework for unifying spatial and temporal learning to support accurate, large-scale crop yield mapping across diverse climatic and geographic conditions."

 In SAR imagery, the backscattered power from scenes covering agricultural areas contains information from both soil and vegetation. External factors such as precipitation and irrigation modify soil and vegetation moisture and consequently change the backscattered power, making it difficult to isolate changes related to crop growth from them. To address this issue, the co-polar complex coherence was recently proposed as an effective tool for crop growth monitoring. In this study, a new method for extracting scattering features from the co-polar complex coherence is proposed, which is based on the distances on the complex plane with respect to the coherences associated with elementary targets. In addition, to further enhance the sensitivity to the changes in scattering features between acquisition dates, associated with phenological development, here we define a new change matrix based on these scattering features. This matrix is constructed to characterize the magnitude, direction, and type of change between any two given dates. Airborne quad-pol SAR data gathered during the AGRISAR 2006 and CROPEX 2014 campaigns were used to assess the proposed monitoring approach for three representative crop types: corn, barley, and canola. Besides a physical and a visual interpretation of the change matrix, a phenological clustering was carried out based on it. A comparison with other advanced methods used for decomposition and for generating the change matrix indicates that the proposed approach provides results less affected by fluctuations due to environmental conditions and more consistent across data sets, improving phenological clustering as a final application."

 Distributed scatterer interferometry (DSI) is an effective technique for improving InSAR-derived deformation quality in low-coherence permafrost regions. Reliable identification of statistically homogeneous pixels (SHPs) and deformation inversion through a two-tier network are key steps of DSI. However, existing SHP selection methods based on parametric hypothesis testing generally assume temporal stationarity of surface backscattering, which is often violated in permafrost regions due to freeze‒thaw processes in the active layer. In addition, the conventional two-tier network strategy tends to produce unstable inversion networks in decorrelated permafrost areas, thereby degrading deformation reliability. To address these limitations, this study proposes a robust coherent scatterer InSAR (RCSI) method. First, considering temporal variations in surface backscattering, a U test is developed to identify SHPs with similar temporal backscattering behavior. Second, a multitier network strategy is proposed, in which persistent scatterers (PS) and distributed scatterers (DS) candidates are evenly partitioned into multiple groups according to posterior coherence, and deformation is progressively estimated using robust M−estimators. The effectiveness of RCSI is quantitatively validated using both simulated data and Sentinel-1 observations over the Beiluhe region on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. The results show that the U test can effectively identify SHPs under non-stationary backscattering conditions. Compared with the two-tier network strategy, the multitier network strategy achieves a 19.9% improvement in deformation accuracy, as validated against in situ leveling measurements, and yields a 42.6% increase in the number of measurement points (MPs). Our study demonstrates that RCSI can significantly enhance the quality of InSAR-derived deformation in permafrost regions."

 Change detection in remote sensing leverages temporally distinct imagery to identify alterations in the surface of regions of interest, and holds significant application value in areas such as environmental protection and land use. Existing change detection networks consider pixel-level and mask-level perspectives separately, and have achieved promising results. However, methods based on pixel-level change detection are susceptible to challenges, including the merging of change regions and the omission of small change masks. Mask classification based change detection methods, which rely on query predictions, are more susceptible to false changes. To mitigate these limitations, we propose TextMCD, a mask classification based change detection framework that integrates multimodal vision–language learning. Specifically, our network adaptively obtains potential change masks through queries and further constrains the semantic categories of predicted masks using the text label information of a single mask. Meanwhile, we propose a multimodal decoder based on ground truth mask attention mechanism. During the decoding phase, the ground truth is incorporated into the training process without affecting the validation. By combining the mask attention mechanism, the model simultaneously captures the location, category, and temporal embedding information of the masks, which enhances the semantic consistency of individual masks in the change detection process. To validate our method, we performed before-and-after category labeling of change masks on multiple binary change detection datasets. The quantitative analysis reveals a notable increase in F1 score across various datasets. Qualitative analysis further demonstrates the advantages of our network in addressing issues such as mask adhesion, small mask miss detection, and false changes.

 Crop yield prediction is crucial for food security and agricultural decision-making. Conventional approaches struggle to reconcile the heavy parameter reliance of process-based models with the extensive label dependencies of data-driven models. To address this, we propose a process-aware crop yield prediction framework that integrates the mechanistic interpretability of crop growth models with the flexibility of deep learning. A Knowledge-Informed Fusion Network (KIFN) is introduced to transcend conventional shallow fusion by transferring mechanistic knowledge of biomass accumulation dynamics from process-based models into data-driven architectures. KIFN incorporates a three-stage design. (1) In the knowledge-informed pre-training stage, an expert network is trained on synthetic daily growth trajectories generated through crop growth model simulation. (2) In the process-aware fine-tuning stage, the expert network is aligned with historical yield data. (3) In the dual-stream fusion stage, the expert network output is calibrated using remote sensing observations via a cross-attention mechanism, thereby dynamically refining in-season predictions. Experimental results from the USDA’s multi-year corn yield dataset show that our model achieves high accuracy (R2 = 0.793, RMSE = 1.039 t/ha). The model’s predictions improve progressively throughout the growing season as satellite observations are used for calibration, demonstrating its effectiveness for dynamic in-season yield prediction. Additionally, interpretability analysis indicates that the cross-attention mechanism in KIFN assists the network in identifying more informative temporal windows throughout the crop growth process. This work provides a principled and interpretable pathway for crop yield prediction, offering new insights into integrating domain knowledge with deep learning in agricultural applications."

 This study examines global heavy snowfall (snow rate > 2.5 mm h−1) using 10 years (2014–2023) of observations from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR). Heavy snowfall cases are categorized into three distinct types using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) approach based on liquid-equivalent mass-weighted diameter (Dm) and normalized intercept parameter (logNw).The first type represents the majority of heavy snowfall over highland regions and is characterized by smaller snow particles and higher particle number concentrations, along with lower hydrometeor content and colder environments, indicating limited growth of snow particles. The second type exhibits slightly larger Dm and lower logNw than the first type and predominantly occurs over continental regions. The third type dominates over oceans and explains the largest contribution to global volumetric heavy snowfall, characterized by relatively larger snow particles and lower particle number concentrations, along with higher hydrometeor content. Based on the characteristic occurrence frequency distributions of each type, the three types are referred to as topographic heavy snowfall (THS), continental-like heavy snowfall (CHS), and oceanic heavy snowfall (OHS), respectively. All three types exhibit pronounced seasonality, whereas their diurnal variation is relatively weak.This study enhances understanding of the characteristics and environmental differences among the three heavy snowfall types, which is expected to support improvements in satellite heavy snowfall retrievals and microphysical parameterizations in numerical models."

 Halogenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (HPAHs) are halogenated aromatic compounds formed when chlorine or bromine atoms substitute onto the ring structure of PAHs containing three to five aromatic rings. They have been identified as ubiquitous environmental contaminants. This study investigated the concentrations of HPAHs and coexisting source tracers in ambient particles from different inhabited areas in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. The mean concentrations of the total HPAHs and PAHs in winter and summer were 70 pg/m3 and 230 ng/m3, and 1.0 pg/m3 and 6.3 ng/m3, respectively. The seasonal concentration ratio (winter/summer) was higher for the total HPAHs (69) than for the total PAHs (36), suggested that HPAH productions are efficiently enhanced by coal combustion-related heating activities during winter. Correlation analysis and principal component analysis showed that 6-chlorinated benzo [a]pyrene has the potential to be a specific tracer of coal combustion.

 The mid-latitude cut-off low substantially influences air quality through stratospheric O3 intrusions, however, its spatially extensive impacts on ambient O3 and the associated diverse pathways remain insufficiently understood. Therefore, this study addresses this knowledge gap by integrating observational and simulation data for the Northeast Cold Vortex (NECV), a typical cut-off low over East Asia during April 15–18, 2020, to explore the mechanism underlying NECV-associated near-surface O3 increases over Eastern China (EC). During the southeastward NECV progression, near-surface O3 levels increased across the broad EC region spanning mid- to low-latitudes. When the NECV was centered near the EC coastline along the Pacific, near-surface O3 rose by 40–60 μg·m−3 over northern, central and southern EC, corresponding to relative increases of 29.76%, 17.29%, and 47.49%, respectively. The deep subsidence at the NECV periphery drove the downward transport of stratospheric O3 into the troposphere over northern EC. Concurrently, the NECV interacted with the westward-expanded Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH), generating a convergence zone over central EC between northwesterly and southwesterly flows that accumulated transported O3 and enhanced near-surface O3 levels in central EC. In southern EC, anticyclonic anomalies developed due to the westward WPSH extension led to clear-sky conditions with stronger incoming solar radiation and consequently intensified photochemical O3 production. Collectively, the results demonstrate a synergistic meteorological mechanism of the NECV-associated near-surface O3 enhancements, comprising three coupled pathways: stratospheric intrusion (SI), horizontal transport, and photochemical production. These findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the environmental implications of the cut-off low and support efforts to refine O3 pollution control strategies."

Toxicity is thought to result from the accumulation of either repeat RNAs and/or dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) translated from repeat-containing transcripts through repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. To disentangle RNA from DPR toxicity, we mutated a CUG codon predominantly used to initiate DPR translation from all three reading frames. This mutation disrupted DPR synthesis while preserving the expression of repeat-containing RNAs. Despite the accumulation of RNA foci, behavioral deficits and pathological abnormalities, including p-TDP-43 inclusions, STING activation, motor neuron loss, neuroinflammation, and increased plasma neurofilament concentration, were alleviated inC9ORF72mice.

Using multiple atmospheric inversions constrained by observation- and model-based prescribed hydroxyl radical (OH) fields and CH4atmospheric data, we show that a drop of OH radicals in 2020–2021, followed by recovery in 2022–2023, accounted for 83% of year-on-year variations in the CH4growth rate, the rest being explained by wetland and inland water emissions, which increased between 2019 and 2020–2022 [+8.6 ± 2.6 teragrams of CH4per year (TgCH4year−1)] and then decreased between 2022 and 2023 (−9.9 ± 3.3 TgCH4year−1). Most emission changes from 2019 to 2023 occurred in northern tropical wetlands in Africa and Asia, whereas South American wetlands emissions declined and Arctic emissions increased after 2019."

Here, we resequenced the genomes of 1720Braccessions and de novo assembled 11 representative telomere-to-telomere gapless genomes for seven elite subspecies that underwent intensive morphotypification and developed distinct agronomic traits valued to agriculture. We identified 6992 unknown genes, 110 complete (peri)centromeres, and five new satellites associated withBrmorphotypes and subspecies andBrassicaspecies evolution. The pangenome, built on 11 gapless and 20 published genomes, reveals structural variations and gene diversities amongBrsubspecies. Pangenome-wide association studies uncovered that the geneBrLH1controls leaf-head formation. We show that structural changes have occurred in satellites, (peri)centromeres, and genes, contributing to fast subspeciation and morphotypification during the short history ofBrcultivation, providing invaluable resources forBrassicabreeding."

We present experimental evidence that a nonhuman primate can represent pretend objects. Kanzi, a lexigram-trained bonobo, correctly identified the location of pretend objects (e.g., “juice” poured between empty containers), in response to verbal prompts in scaffolded pretense interactions. Across three experiments, we conceptually replicated this finding and excluded key alternative explanations. Our findings suggest that the capacity to form secondary representations of pretend objects is within the cognitive potential of, at least, an enculturated ape and likely dates back 6 to 9 million years, to our common evolutionary ancestors."

By screening a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved drug library, we identified finerenone, a kidney disease medication, as a promising drug for restoring fertility in POI. Finerenone stimulated follicle development in aged mice and restored antral follicle development in patients with POI following oral administration, resulting in mature oocytes and embryos. Mechanistically, finerenone reduced fibrotic deposition in the ovarian stroma, alleviating collagen-mediated suppression of follicular development. Building on this insight, we identified additional FDA-approved oral antifibrotic drugs as potential treatments for POI-related infertility. Our findings highlight the ovarian stroma—rather than the follicles themselves—as the key therapeutic target and offer potential therapeutic leads for POI-related infertility."

Comparing theSnandLgseismic wave amplitude ratio (Sn/Lg) of an earthquake with that of nearby earthquakes distinguishes CMEs and, unlike previous methods, can be applied globally. We present a global distribution of CMEs that extends well beyond previous individual detections and areas of speculation. CME occurrence is widespread globally yet patterned regionally, reflecting local lithospheric structure and tectonic history. Our results highlight the value of CMEs for understanding continents and global tectonics."

We designed coiled-coil bundlemer peptide nanoparticles that form ordered, hierarchical materials across an unusually broad pH range (1, 7, and 14) dependent on patchy surface charge display. Nematic liquid crystal formation was observed at low concentration (~0.5 to 4 weight %) at pH 1 and pH 14, whereas higher concentration at pH 1 yielded hexagonal columnar phases. At neutral pH, the same patchy nanoparticles assembled into ordered lattices through electrostatic complexation. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed end-to-end particle stacking underlying all phases. Coiled coils with identical amino acid composition but lacking designed charge patches displayed no ordered assembly, demonstrating the importance of programmable electrostatic interactions with protein-like specificity of spatial display."

We report in situ atomic-scale observations of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nucleation and growth through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using environmental transmission electron microscopy. Coupled with molecular dynamics simulations, our observations reveal the formation of a 2D amorphous structure at the initial nucleation stage, which undergoes an in-plane structural ordering transition into a crystalline nucleus once a critical size is reached. We further captured nuclei merging and oriented attachment processes in the early growth stage, which likely contributed to 2D single-crystal fabrication. These findings unveil the atomistic structural evolution in MoS2nucleation and growth under CVD condition, providing mechanistic insight for the controlled synthesis of high-quality 2D crystals and informing broader strategies for covalently bonded material systems."

Potassium acyltrifluoroboronates (KATs) offer a promising alternative through fast and chemoselective amide bond formation, but their application to protein synthesis has been precluded by the lack of a masking strategy. We report chiral, zwitterionic organoboron complexes that mask amino acid–derived KATs. These molecules exhibit unexpected nitrogen-carbon-boron connectivity and are fully compatible with solid-phase peptide synthesis and stereoretentive deprotection. We synthesized C-terminal KAT peptides and demonstrated KAT ligation at micromolar concentrations for the convergent synthesis of the aggregation-prone programmed death ligand 2 (PD-L2) immunoglobulin V domain. This work establishes organoboron chemistry as an enabling strategy for chemical protein synthesis at low concentrations far more suitable for handling large, aggregation-prone biomolecules."

To improve the entangling rate, single-photon interference is leveraged for entanglement heralding, and quantum frequency conversion is used to reduce fiber loss. A tailored Rydberg-based emission scheme suppresses the photon recoil effect on the atom without introducing noise. We achieved high-fidelity atom-atom entanglement and positive asymptotic key rates for fiber lengths up to 100 km. At 11 km, 1.2 million heralded Bell pairs were prepared over 624 hours, yielding an estimated extractable finite-size secure key rate of 0.112 bits per event against general attacks.

In particular, silicon compounds in which π-electrons are delocalized over five or more silicon atoms have been elusive. We report the synthesis of pentasilicon analogs of cyclopentadienides (pentasilacyclopentadienides). These compounds contain nonplanar five-membered silicon rings with some pyramidalized silicon atoms and uneven silicon-silicon distances. The highly shielded7Li nuclear magnetic resonance signal of a lithium pentasilacyclopentadienide corroborates the presence of a diamagnetic ring current in the five-membered ring, which is indicative of at least some degree of aromaticity. Furthermore, a computational study revealed that bulky substituents and the delocalization of π-electrons stabilize the pentasilacyclopentadienide structure."

Since the advent of stable Si–Si π-bonds in 1981, all-silicon aromatics have been targeted, yet only a three-membered cyclopropenium analog (Si3R3+; R, silyl) has been experimentally realized. We report a stable persilacyclopentadienide (Si5R5−; R, aryl), which is essentially planar and decidedly aromatic, although experimental and computational data suggest an ultrarapid equilibrium between nonplanar isomers. With trimethylchlorostannane, Si5R5−rearranges the Si5core to a tricyclic isomer confirming the pivotal role of the lithium cation for stability. The persilacyclopentadienide promises a rich chemistry akin to carbon-based cyclopentadienides.

We found that the TAT of most species groups has increased; that only 20 ± 14 pesticides per group define >90% of the TAT nationally; that fruits, vegetables, maize, soybean, rice, and other cereals contribute 76 to 83% of the global TAT; and that China, Brazil, the United States, and India contribute 53 to 68% of the global TAT.

In this study, we engineered pluripotent stem cells in which cohesin loop extrusion can be inducibly disrupted without confounding cell cycle defects. Transcriptional dysregulation is cell type specific, and not all loci with distal enhancers depend equally on cohesin extrusion. Using comparative genome editing, we demonstrated that enhancer-promoter communication over just 20 kb can require cohesin. However, promoter-proximal elements can support long-range, cohesin-independent enhancer action—even across strong CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) insulators. Lastly, transcriptional dynamics and the emergence of embryonic cell types remain largely robust despite disrupted extrusion. Beyond establishing strategies to study cohesin in enhancer biology, our work provides mechanistic insight into cell type specificity and genomic context specificity."
