This study examines the response of TC precipitation due to increasing sea surface temperatures (SSTs) using convection-permitting model simulations. The sensitivity of key TC rainfall metrics, including the azimuthally averaged maximum precipitation rate were examined. The amount of scaling of precipitation with SST depends on the chosen TC precipitation metric and mostly surpasses the Clausius–Clapeyron (CC) relationship. The azimuthally averaged maximum precipitation rate (Pm) exceeds twice the rate expected under the CC relationship (2CC). By decomposing the scaling rates into thermodynamic and dynamic contributions using a physical diagnostic method, we demonstrate that dynamic changes primarily (about 73%) drive the scaling of Pm. The available moisture plays a much smaller role than expected and scales surprisingly at less than CC. The dynamic contribution is always large for all precipitation metrics. The combination of increased moisture and updrafts enhances moisture convergence, thereby intensifying precipitation and ultimately leading to a super-CC relationship. The ‘exceeding 2CC’ behavior is attributed to the dominance of dynamic effects, particularly enhanced upward motion near the TC inner core. Accurate projections of future changes in TC precipitation therefore depend critically on accurate projections of changes in TC dynamics."

However, understanding of land use associated with rapid wind energy deployment in China remains limited. This study quantified the direct LUR of wind farms in China, using 120 sample wind farms constructed between 2008 and 2023, and with regard to turbine foundations, permanent land use and temporary land use. We employed a categorical regression model to identify influencing factors. Additionally, we calculated the spacing LUR of wind farms by the end of 2023 using an improved Voronoi polygon algorithm based on data from 158 992 turbines across 3718 wind farms. Results indicate an average direct LUR of 7539.64 ± 3306.73 m2 MW−1, with the LURs for turbine foundation, permanent land use and temporary land use measured at 127.95 ± 33.00 m2 MW−1, 2376.23 ± 991.94 m2 MW−1, and 5163.40 ± 2527.11 m2 MW−1, respectively. Various factors, including turbine size, land cover type and topography, influence each type of LUR. By 2023, the direct LUR of wind farms in China totaled 3294.06 km2, accounting for 0.03% of the national land area (9.6 million km2), with 55.90 km2 designated for turbine foundations, 1038.17 km2 for permanent LUR, and 2255.89 km2 for temporary LUR. The spacing LUR of wind farms in China by 2023 was 108 164 km2, representing 1.13% of the national land area. These findings provide critical insights into the LURs and potential ecological impacts of wind energy development in China."

We use the Max Planck Institute Grand Ensemble to examine the occurrence of hot–dry extremes in key crop-producing regions known as ‘breadbasket regions’, either in single or multiple breadbasket regions simultaneously, focusing on the differences between 1.5 ∘C and 2 ∘C global warming scenarios. Our findings reveal strong increases in hot–dry events across all individual breadbasket regions between 1.5 ∘C and 2 ∘C of global warming, with ensemble mean probabilities indicating that occurrences more than double in South Asia and triple in East Asia. Moreover, the likelihood of multiple breadbasket regions experiencing extreme events simultaneously increases significantly between 1.5 ∘C and 2 ∘C of warming. Scenarios that were historically considered virtually impossible and very unlikely under 1.5 ∘C, such as at least four regions being affected by hot–dry events in the same growing season, could occur with a 1-in-14 year likelihood under 2 ∘C of warming. We find that, among the breadbasket regions, Central Europe, East Asia, and Central North America most often experience these events simultaneously within the same growing season. Between 1.5 ∘C and 2 ∘C warmer worlds, the probability of simultaneous occurrence increases the most for the connection between these regions. In contrast, South Asia is least likely to be affected simultaneously with other regions, possibly providing insights for risk management."

We also run individual areas-level Granger causality tests to determine the geographical distribution of the local causal links between the CO2 concentration and temperature. We find evidence of both causality directions at the global level, suggesting potential feedback between CO2 concentration and temperature. We also find that the global phenomenon results from a very fragmented geographical distribution of mostly unidirectional causality links at the local level. Considering the two results jointly, this work potentially provides insights into the connection between average trends of human-induced global warming and particular local conditions experiencing extreme meteorological conditions."

Traditional satellite observations, including high-frequency sensors like Geostationary Ocean Color Imager II (GOCI-II), are often hindered by cloud cover and low-light conditions, limiting their temporal resolution and coverage. We propose a real-time approach using diel variations in dissolved oxygen (DO) measured by buoys to detect HAB initiation and dynamics. By isolating biologically driven oxygen variation ( ) from physical processes, we identify increases in , elevated temperature, and maximum DO as key HAB indicators. This method captures bloom activity under cloudy or low-light conditions when satellites fail. To enhance spatial coverage, we integrate buoy-based DO data with high-frequency GOCI-II satellite observations, providing hourly, all-weather bloom detection. While satellite or buoy observations alone face limitations, their integration overcomes traditional barriers. Our results demonstrate a robust tool for real-time HAB monitoring and early warning, supporting sustainable water resource management."

Disentangling its effects from that of anthropogenic forcing in future regional projections is crucial for effective adaptation planning. Here, we show that internal variability is the main source of uncertainty in near-term changes in Europe compared to model and scenario uncertainty, or as important as model uncertainty for the Mediterranean. The contribution of internal variability is even larger for runoff than for precipitation or evapotranspiration over northern, western and central Europe. The inter-member differences in runoff changes are mainly explained by precipitation changes and indirectly by changes in sea level pressure. In potential disagreement with observational studies, no apparent teleconnection between runoff multi-decadal variability and the Atlantic multi-decadal variability is generally found in climate models. This misrepresentation of teleconnections might affect the multi-decadal variability of annual precipitation and therefore runoff over the Mediterranean. Indeed, the multi-decadal variability in precipitation and sea level pressure over this area is shown to be generally underestimated."

While deforestation has received much attention, the equally vital grasslands are under significant threat. Monitoring efforts have often prioritized the extent of land conversion, with limited focus on the intensity of conversion, particularly in non-forest biomes. This study addresses this gap by assessing the expansion of row crop and irrigated agriculture in the grasslands of central Kenya from 2018 to 2022. The region, particularly around Laikipia County, has seen a rapid increase in irrigated agriculture, encroaching on natural grasslands and threatening local wildlife through excessive water extraction. We mapped the expansion of both smallholder and large-scale croplands and developed a model based on vegetation indices and proximity to key water sources to estimate irrigation likelihood. Our results show a 27% increase in likely irrigated croplands from 2018 to 2022, with projections indicating that, if current trends persist, irrigation areas will double by 2030, probably increasing water consumption substantially. This study underscores the urgent need to protect Kenya’s native grasslands, which are facing active threats with far-reaching environmental consequences."

The EUDR requires national-scale information on deforestation prevalence as one component of deforestation risk assessments, with additional traceability and risk assessment requirements at the parcel scale for exports to the EU to comply with the regulation. To better understand potential implications of this policy and evaluate relevant monitoring data, we estimate area converted from forest to agricultural land use in the United States (US) using three authoritative data sources from US Department of Agriculture statistical programs: the Nationwide Forest Inventory, National Resources Inventory, and Crop Sequence Boundaries Data. Results from all three datasets consistently indicate that agriculture-driven gross deforestation has been minimal over the past decade in the US, averaging 0.01%–0.04% of forested area annually. Most of this land-use change is occurring in the Southeastern US with conversion to pasture being the most common agricultural conversion subcategory. The rarity of agriculture-driven deforestation results in high levels of uncertainty in county-scale estimates due to the low sample size and potential misclassification errors in modeled data. Nevertheless, comparing results from these three complementary datasets can provide greater confidence in fine-scale spatial patterns of past deforestation. This analysis highlights several challenges associated with implementing and enforcing trade policy based on land use categories. Given the low rate of agriculture-driven deforestation and potential difficulties with identifying land-use change at small spatial scales, trade policies focused solely on land use categories may have a limited benefit in countries such as the US where agriculture is not a major driver of deforestation."

Organic carbon from smoke decreases hygroscopicity to levels more like those in continental than in polluted marine regions. Hygroscopicity changes at cloud level demonstrate how surface particles impact clouds in the region, affecting model representation of aerosol and cloud interactions in similar polluted marine regions with high organic carbon emissions. 
 This study characterizes the spatial and vertical nature of aerosol hygroscopicity in Southeast Asia and relates it to aerosol composition and sources. Aerosol hygroscopicity via the light scattering hygroscopic growth factor, f(RH), is calculated from the amplification of PM5 (particulate matter with a particle diameter, Dp, <5 µm) scattering measurements from <40 % to 82 % relative humidity during the Cloud, Aerosol, and Monsoon Processes Philippines Experiment (CAMP2Ex) between August and October 2019 over the northwest tropical Pacific. Median f(RH) is low (1.26 with lower to upper quartiles of 1.05 to 1.43) like polluted environments, due to the dominance of the mixture of organic carbon and elemental carbon. The f(RH) is lowest due to smoke from the Maritime Continent (MC) during its peak biomass burning season, coincident with high carbon monoxide concentrations (>0.25 ppm) and pronounced levels of accumulation-mode particles and organic mass fractions. The highest f(RH) values are linked to coarser particles from the West Pacific and aged biomass burning particles in the region farthest away from the MC, where f(RH) values are lower than typical polluted marine environments. Convective transport and associated cloud processing in these regions decrease and increase hygroscopicity aloft in cases with transported air masses exhibiting increased organic and sulfate mass fractions, respectively. An evaluation of the Community Atmosphere Model with Chemistry (CAM-chem) for cases of vertical transport showed the underrepresentation of organics, resulting in overestimated modeled aerosol hygroscopicity. These findings on aerosol hygroscopicity can help to improve aerosol representation in models and the understanding of cloud formation."

To better understand the effects of carbonyl compounds in the atmosphere, a kinetic and mechanistic study was conducted on the degradation of 33DMbutanal and 33DMbutanone with atmospheric oxidants (Cl atoms, OH and NO3 radicals). The kinetic experiments were performed at 710 ± 30 Torr and at room temperature (298 ± 5 K) using a relative method and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to monitor the reactions. The rate coefficients (k in units of cm3molec.-1s-1) obtained were kCl+33DMbutanal = (1.27 ± 0.08) × 10−10, kCl+33DMbutanone = (4.22 ± 0.27) × 10−11, and kOH+33DMbutanone = (1.26 ± 0.05) × 10−12.

Applied on a recent field campaign, these tools produce morphology-specific size distributions that can be compared across four instruments covering different size ranges. The analysis show that the tools are performing well and are consistent across the different instruments. 
 This study addresses the challenges of ice particle morphology classification from images of optical array probes (OAPs) and proposes a more refined processing to enable better interpretation of observational data. The convolutional neural network methodology is applied to train classification tools for hydrometeor images from optical array probes. Two models were developed in a previous work for the Precipitation Imaging Probe (PIP) and 2D Stereo (2D-S). In addition, three new models are introduced in this study: one for the Cloud Imaging Probe (CIP), one for the High Volume Particle Spectrometer (HVPS), and a global model trained on a data set that merges all available data from the above four instruments. The methodology of retrieving morphology-specific size distributions from OAP data is provided. Size distributions for each morphological class, obtained using both the specific and global classification models, are compared for the data set of the ICE-GENESIS (Creating the next generation of 3D simulation means for icing) project, where all four probes were operated simultaneously. The reliability and coherence of these newly obtained machine learning classification tools are clearly demonstrated. The analysis shows significant advantages of using the global model compared to the specific ones. The presented methodology retrieves morphology-specific crystal size distributions that effectively allow systematic identification of microphysical growth processes from OAP data sets mainly collected on research aircraft during measurement campaigns. By combining the quantitative reliability of OAP-derived total number and mass size distributions with advanced machine learning morphological individual crystal classification, this approach establishes a foundation for investigations on past OAP data sets to be reinterpreted."

Over the three winters at UConn, a total of 40 instruments were deployed across two observing sites that captured 117 precipitation events, including 19 phase transition events as indicated by the PARSIVEL2. These instruments included scanning and vertically pointing radars, along with suites of in-situ sensors. In addition, an unmanned aircraft system has been deployed in 2023–2024. Here, an overview of the different field deployments, instrumentation, and the datasets collected are presented. To showcase the observations, this article features a wide-ranging set of measurements collected from the instrument suite for the 28 February 2023 storm, during which six to eight inches of snow accumulated at the two different observing sites. Also included is a discussion on how these observations can be combined with other datasets to validate ground-based and remote sensing measurements and highlight important atmospheric processes that impact winter precipitation phase and amount."

 The amount of detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology data and Lu-Hf isotopic data has doubled with the continuous improvement of testing methods, and has developed into the most closely integrated research field in earth science with big data methods. However, how to effectively construct giant databases in geoscience has become a challenge. Here, we present OneDZ, a global comprehensive detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology and Lu-Hf isotope database, which includes diverse samples with data source, location, stratigraphy, depositional age, and various elemental and isotopic information. OneDZ collected corresponding regions, stratigraphic and lithological information to facilitate quick access for users. Comparing with current zircon database, OneDZ complies 1,925,687 gains of detrital zircon U-Pb and 275,971 gains of detrital zircon Lu-Hf records from 275,971 publications. Furthermore, the construction of OneDZ leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and programming scripts and offers insights into managing large-scale unstructured data in geosciences.

The experiments are designed with the goal of answering science policy questions related to fires. The options for the multi-model approach, including inputs, outputs, and model setup, are discussed, and the official recommendations for the project are presented. 
 Open biomass burning has major impacts globally and regionally on atmospheric composition. Fire emissions include particulate matter, tropospheric ozone precursors, and greenhouse gases, as well as persistent organic pollutants, mercury, and other metals. Fire frequency, intensity, duration, and location are changing as the climate warms, and modelling these fires and their impacts is becoming more and more critical to inform climate adaptation and mitigation, as well as land management. Indeed, the air pollution from fires can reverse the progress made by emission controls on industry and transportation. At the same time, nearly all aspects of fire modelling – such as emissions, plume injection height, long-range transport, and plume chemistry – are highly uncertain. This paper outlines a multi-model, multi-pollutant, multi-regional study to improve the understanding of the uncertainties and variability in fire atmospheric science, models, and fires' impacts, in addition to providing quantitative estimates of the air pollution and radiative impacts of biomass burning. Coordinated under the auspices of the Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution, the international atmospheric modelling and fire science communities are working towards the common goal of improving global fire modelling and using this multi-model experiment to provide estimates of fire pollution for impact studies. This paper outlines the research needs, opportunities, and options for the fire-focused multi-model experiments and provides guidance for these modelling experiments, outputs, and analyses that are to be pursued over the next 3 to 5 years. The paper proposes a plan for delivering specific products at key points over this period to meet important milestones relevant to science and policy audiences."

Gilbertson,A Liposomal Carrier to Reduce Leaching of Ionic Nutrient Loads in Agricultural Soils,"The use of inorganic nutrient fertilizers in crop agriculture is often inefficient due to rapid leaching of nutrients with percolating water in soil. To address this, a liposomal carrier was developed to slow transport and reduce leaching of inorganic nutrient loads within agricultural soils. Liposomes, spherical lipid bilayers, have been widely used in medicine but remain under-characterized for agricultural applications. Their biocompatibility, high loading capacity, and stability under certain compositions and environmental conditions suggest they could effectively deliver agrochemicals to crops. We present soil column experiments to evaluate the ability of a liposomal carrier to reduce the transport of an ionic tracer load, sodium bromide, under varying soil and water saturation conditions. Results from saturated column experiments demonstrate that encapsulation in liposomes slowed tracer transport and reduced leachate concentrations in sand and silty clay loam soils. Reduction in tracer leachate was also observed for unsaturated column experiments in silty clay loam soil. Subsequent experiments suggested a combination of processes (i.e., attachment, aggregation, physical exclusion, and biogenic immobilization) were responsible for the observed behavior of liposome encapsulated tracer in the soil column experiments. These findings support the use of liposomes as an effective carrier of inorganic nutrients to reduce leaching."

Microorganisms drive Mn(II) oxidation, but traditional cultivation-dependent identification methods are inefficient and error-prone. To overcome these limitations, we developed MnOxGeneTool, a bioinformatics tool for identifying and quantifying Mn(II)-oxidizing genes from genomic and metagenomic data. MnOxGeneTool consists of three main components: (1) a curated database of known Mn(II)-oxidizing proteins and their homologues, (2) a hidden Markov models (HMMs) database derived from this protein data set, and (3) a computational pipeline that integrates bioinformatics tools (e.g., HMMER and BLASTX) to identify and quantify Mn(II)-oxidizing genes. We assessed the accuracy and sensitivity of these HMMs through cross-validation, demonstrating their effectiveness in identifying Mn(II)-oxidizing genes in bacterial genomes. Using MnOxGeneTool, we explored the phylogenetic diversity of Mn(II)-oxidizers and identified 824 bacterial genera containing Mn(II)-oxidizing genes, significantly expanding previous knowledge in this field. Additionally, we analyzed metagenomic data from various environments to explore environmental drivers of Mn(II)-oxidizing genes, identifying two potential drivers: oligotrophic conditions and alkaline environments. These findings enable targeted discovery of novel Mn(II)-oxidizers and genetic determinants through identification of their ecological niches and expression optima, thereby expanding MnOxGeneTool’s predictive coverage of uncatalogued Mn(II)-oxidizing proteins. By providing an innovative bioinformatics tool that enables efficient identification and quantification of Mn(II)-oxidizing genes from both genomic and metagenomic data, this study offers significant advancements in the research of biogenic Mn(II) oxidation.

Mean annual PEC, based on the summed concentrations of eight PFAS detected in WWTP effluents (ΣPFASPEC), for all stream reaches in the watershed was 3.8 ng L–1, and stream reaches impacted by WWTP had perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) PEC of 0.39 and 0.14 ng L–1.

Among environmental factors, the widespread use of chiral pesticides has raised ecological concerns, yet their enantioselective impacts on ARG propagation remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate how chiral pesticides influence microbial ARG dissemination at the enantiomeric level. Using flurtamone as a model, we successfully separated and quantitatively analyzed its enantiomers (R-flurtamone and S-flurtamone) and evaluated their effects at environmentally relevant concentrations (0–80 μg/L). Remarkably, R-flurtamone significantly enhanced the horizontal transfer of ARGs, surpassing the effects of Rac-flurtamone, whereas S-flurtamone exerted a negligible influence. Mechanistic insights revealed that R-flurtamone is more easily recognized by bacterial cells and induces more cellular stress responses. Additionally, R-flurtamone induced an increase in cell membrane permeability, excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, SOS responses, and boosted ATP levels, further accelerating ARG propagation. By integrating experimental findings with molecular simulations, we elucidated the enantioselective mechanisms underpinning ARG transfer.

However, the role of primary degraders initiating decomposition of complex biopolymers in As methylation and the underlying driving mechanisms remain largely unexplored. This study uncovers a direct metabolic connection between chitin, a major component of particulate organic matter in the soil, and As methylation facilitated by specialized aerobic chitin-degrading bacteria. Chitin markedly enhanced As methylation and its volatilization in paddy soils under aerobic conditions, resulting in 2.9- and 25-fold higher increases compared with the treatments with lignocellulosic residue and components, respectively. Chitinophagaceae members were enriched in the presence of chitin, with bacteria related to Chitinophaga likely serving as the key contributors. The direct coupling between As methylation and chitin hydrolysis was further confirmed using a representative Chitinophaga strain isolated from a paddy soil, which produced dimethylarsenate and trimethylarsenate as the major MeAs products. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that a considerable proportion of Chitinophaga found diverse soil environments possess complete functional genes for As methylation and chitin utilization, highlighting their potential for regulating As cycling broadly. These findings emphasize the chitin degradation-associated As methylation as a previously overlooked contributor to MeAs fluxes, enhancing our understanding of the interconnected biogeochemistry of As and carbon in soils."

Adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order model, indicating that the adsorption process is governed mostly by chemisorption. Adsorption isotherms were well fitted by the Langmuir model, indicating that uptake proceeds until roughly monolayer adsorption. Detailed characterization revealed Pb(II) was adsorbed as single atoms with complex inner-sphere binding modes that varied across different facets, indicating that adsorption is both structurally and energetically facet-dependent. Coadsorption experiments further demonstrated Cu2+, Zn2+, and humic acid significantly promoted Pb(II) adsorption.

Variations in the b‐value (slope of the frequency‐magnitude distribution) of induced and natural seismic events are thought to reflect the stress state, although recent laboratory results suggest that fault roughness also contributes. In nature, stress, fault roughness, and pore‐pressure effects can rarely be disentangled. Here, we investigate these effects and their relative contributions to b‐value variation in the laboratory and compare them with hydro‐shearing in Enhanced Geothermal System reservoirs. Spatial‐temporal variations in b‐values stem from three distinct factors: (a) Increasing differential stress shows an inverse linear relationship with b‐value, with a steeper slope at high pore pressure. (b) Higher pore‐pressures, on average, lead to lower b‐values. (c) Spatial variations during injection are potentially structurally controlled so that high‐damage zones promote higher b‐values.

We introduce a methodology to extract this information from amplitude data and view results in ensemble with Very Low Frequency‐derived, D‐Region absorption estimates.

To address this issue, we have developed a method for calculating geostrophic wind speed, which has been used as the reference to perform homogeneity detection and adjustment for the SWS at stations in China. Here, the method is applied to homogenize annual mean SWS from more than 3,600 stations over global land from 1973 to 2022. Although further confirmation from the metadata is required, the homogenization significantly reduces statistical inhomogeneity (p = 0.01) in the raw SWS. The results show that about 35% of the global stations exhibit inhomogeneities in SWS, and this phenomenon is more pronounced over North America and Europe. The homogenization has a minimal impact on the global average trend of SWS, but has major impacts on regional trends, especially in Europe, Asia, and Oceania. Compared with the raw SWS, the trend of homogenized SWS from 1973 to 2022 changed from −0.052 to −0.027 m s−1 per decade in Europe, and from −0.066 to −0.033 m s−1 per decade in Asia.

Results show that the choice of ensemble averaging methods has a large impact on the projection of long‐term mean yield and year‐to‐year yield variability, with a range of −19.79%–16.62% and −47.92%–55.39% for the globe, respectively. Regionally, the largest uncertainties from the choice of ensemble averaging methods are observed in Indonesia and Canada. Further uncertainty decomposition analysis shows that ensemble averaging methods contributes to 39%–87% of total uncertainties for global yield projections, which is even higher than climate models. These results imply that although using an ensemble of crop models is valuable for informing risk‐based policy‐makings, how we choose to combine and derive the best estimates of crop model ensembles has large influence on the assessment outcomes.

Hot and dry conditions harm crops and vegetation, while hot and humid conditions are particularly dangerous for human health. Whether a place tends to experience heat waves that are hot and dry, hot and wet, or both, depends on the local correlation between temperature and humidity. This paper uses reanalysis, observational data, and climate models to show that the global temperature‐humidity correlation has steadily declined since 1981 at a somewhat faster rate than climate models simulate. This decline in the temperature‐humidity correlation has occurred because humidity is increasing less quickly (or decreasing) on days with high dry‐bulb temperatures as compared to days with high wet‐bulb temperatures. The relative drying of hot and dry days is associated with those days warming faster than hot and humid days. Overall, the decline in the temperature‐humidity correlation has exacerbated the risk from hot and dry conditions while slightly slowing increases in hot and humid conditions."

The results showed that the carrying capacity of China's drylands is 7.1 Pg C, with ∼4.1 Pg C (∼58%) already stored and an additional 3 Pg C potentially sequesterable. Regions with the highest carbon sequestration potential are concentrated in the eastern part of Inner Mongolia, the Northeast China, the northern part of Xinjiang, and the Huang‐huai‐hai region.

Carbon sequestration thresholds varied across land use change types and aridity gradients. The identified hotspots in our study where vegetation has not yet reached its full potential should be the main target of future restoration projects.

Over the past two decades, the lake's water levels have steadily dropped. Water conditions in the Sea, characterized by low oxygen and high nutrient levels, favor the production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S). This study investigates the connection between the Sea's changing conditions, particularly the worsening water quality, and H2S emissions using air quality and water quality data collected since 2013 and 2004, respectively. H2S concentrations often exceed California's air quality standards, particularly in areas near the Sea during summer months. Wind patterns substantially impact detection of H2S. When wind is blowing from the Sea toward communities with sensors, located to the northwest of the Sea, H2S is detected significantly more often. Current monitoring efforts underestimate the frequency and distribution of H2S that exceeds air quality standards. An air sensor deployed in shallow water over the Salton Sea by a community science program detected substantially higher concentrations of H2S, particularly when wind was blowing over exposed sediment and shallow water, suggesting that these are a significant and overlooked H2S source at the Salton Sea.

 Structural designs inspired by physical and biological systems have been previously utilized to develop mechanical metamaterials with enhanced properties based on clever geometric arrangement of constituent building blocks. Here, we use the DNA origami method to realize a nanoscale metastructure exhibiting mechanical frustration, a counterpart of the well-known phenomenon of magnetic frustration. By selectively actuating reconfigurable struts, it adopts either frustrated or non-frustrated states, each characterized by distinct free energy profiles. While the non-frustrated state distributes the strain homogeneously, the frustrated mode concentrates it at a specific location. Molecular dynamics simulations reconcile the contrasting behaviors and provide insights into underlying mechanics. We explore the design space further by tailoring responses through structural modifications. Our work combines programmable DNA self-assembly with mechanical design principles to overcome engineering limitations encountered at the macroscale to design dynamic, deformable nanostructures with potential applications in elastic energy storage, nanomechanical computation, and allosteric mechanisms in DNA-based nanomachinery.

 Pluripotent stem cells have long been used to produce knockout mice via germline chimera technology. However, aside from the rat, this approach has not been successfully applied to other mammals. Here, we demonstrate that rabbit induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be reprogrammed using KLF2, ERAS and PRMT6, enabling them to efficiently colonize embryos. These chimeric embryos can develop into fetuses and newborn rabbits, with iPSCs contributing up to 100 % to certain organs. Notably, female rabbits generated through this method are healthy and transmit the iPSC genome to their offspring with a high efficiency, demonstrating germline chimerism. This advancement establishes a foundation for developing rabbit models of human disease with complex genetic traits.

The excellent performance of the catalyst is attributed to an intermediate dinuclear structure formed via spin crossover. 
 Electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide and water oxidation are promising technologies to mitigate environmental problems. A critical bottleneck, however, is the significant energy loss that arises from the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with its sluggish kinetics and reliance on scarce noble metals. It is therefore essential to develop earth-abundant and efficient OER catalysts. Here we report the reactive diiron electrocatalyst [Fe2(µ-O)(µ-OH)(L1)2], where L1 is a nitrogen-based ligand, which exhibits an outstanding performance—achieving a turnover frequency of 20.2 s−1 at 1.580 V and a low overpotential of 184 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2—and exceptional stability over 1,000 h. This diiron electrocatalyst is formed via a spin crossover-driven dimerization mechanism, where the resulting diiron atomic configuration promotes strong metal–ligand covalency and facilitates the formation of key intermediates that are essential for efficient OER catalysis. Our findings offer a promising strategy for the design of high-performance catalysts for water oxidation and sustainable electrocatalysis.

 Damming-induced fragmentation is arguably the most pronounced anthropogenic disturbance of global river systems, yet its spatio-temporal evolution remains poorly understood due to constraints in dam information, particularly in rapidly developing regions like China. Here we establish a spatially and temporally explicit inventory of Chinese riverine reservoirs and assess the long-term trajectory of damming impacts on river fragmentation during 1970–2020. We find that the number of dams rocketed from 1019 to 17,414, promoting a nearly-fourfold rise in total capacity. Consequently, ~62% of the main rivers, accounting for 90% of the total river discharge in China, have become fragmented. In particular, intensified dam construction in the 1980s and early-21st century substantially altered the free-flowing conditions of main rivers in China, including the Yangtze and Yellow rivers. Over five decades, free-flowing main rivers in China decreased by 38.9%, weakening fluvial ecosystems and threatening long-distance migratory fish species. Notably, our fine-resolution results show that small rivers are fragmented at lengths 3-16 times greater than previously reported, revealing the ongoing river fragmentation spreading to fragile high-altitude headwaters. This underscores the urgent need to consider the societal and eco-environmental effects of such a severely fragmented river system, and aligns with the UN SDGs in promoting sustainable practices.

 Coastal flooding is occurring more frequently due to global sea-level rise, among other factors. However, current understanding of coastal flood frequency and sea-level rise impacts is predominantly based on tide gauges, which do not measure water levels on land. Here, we present data from a novel network of land-based flood sensors in the state of North Carolina, USA. We demonstrate that tide-gauge data are poor indicators of flooding: floods occur 26–128 days annually, an order of magnitude greater than what regional tide gauges suggest in some places. Improving the accuracy of coastal flood measures is critical for identifying the impacts of sea-level rise and developing effective adaptation strategies.

 Snow algae, microscopic organisms thriving in snow-covered environments, significantly affect snow albedo and broader climatic processes. This study introduces the Algae Presence Index (API), a novel spectral tool using Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery to detect and classify red and green algae on King George Island, Antarctica. From 2019 to 2023, we analyzed temporal and spatial variations in algae presence during austral summers and observed corresponding reductions in surface albedo, demonstrating how algal blooms influence snowmelt. Green algae showed a stronger albedo reduction (up to 8.46 %) compared to red algae (5.33 %), emphasizing their greater role in accelerating snowmelt. The API outperformed traditional indices, such as the red/green band ratio and Red-Green Normalized Difference. It eliminated spectral overlap and accurately distinguished algae types from algae-free snow. These findings underscore the critical role of snow algae in climate feedback mechanisms and highlight the importance of monitoring their growth during Antarctic warming.

 Canopy chlorophyll content per ground area (CCC, g·m−2) is tightly related to vegetation photosynthesis and is a promising indicator of photosynthetic capacity. However, a global operational CCC product is not yet available. To fill this gap, we developed a two-step upscaling method to estimate global CCC from Sentinel-3 OLCI top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. In the first step, a physically-based PROSAIL-D inversion model produced accurate CCC maps from over 20,000 high-spatial resolution (1 m) airborne hyperspectral images collected across 50 sites within the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) between 2019 and 2021. The validation against ground CCC measurements showed an R2 of 0.89 and an RMSE of 0.30 g·m−2. In the second step, these high-resolution CCC maps were resampled or upscaled to a spatial resolution of 300 m, and combined with Sentinel-3 OLCI TOA reflectance images to train random forest (RF) models. The RF model demonstrated robust performance with leave-one-site-out cross-validation, yielding an R2 of 0.92 and RMSE of 0.14 g·m−2. The two-step method also showed minimal sensitivity to angular effects and land cover variations, underscoring its robustness. In comparison, the traditional direct inversion method (the one-step method) led to underestimation of CCC by 0.16 g·m−2 and a moderate estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.65, RMSE = 0.30 g·m−2). We generated a long-term global OLCI CCC product using Sentinel-3 OLCI TOA reflectance data from 2016 to 2024, which can also be continuously updated using current data. This global CCC product can provide important plant physiological information, for parameterizing terrestrial biosphere models and capturing spatiotemporal photosynthetic patterns, thereby advancing research on vegetation carbon dynamics cycles at the global scale."

 Machine learning models have steadily improved in estimating inherent optical properties (IOPs) from remote sensing observations. Yet, their generalization ability when applied to new water bodies, beyond those they were trained on, is not well understood. We present a novel approach for assessing model generalization across various scenarios, including interpolation within in situ observation datasets, extrapolation beyond the training scope, and application to hyperspectral observations from the PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA) satellite involving atmospheric correction. We evaluate five probabilistic neural networks (PNNs), including novel architectures like recurrent neural networks, for their ability to estimate absorption at 443 and 675 nm from hyperspectral reflectance. The median symmetric accuracy (MdSA) worsens from ≥25% in interpolation scenarios to ≥50% in extrapolation scenarios, and reaches ≥80% when applied to PRISMA satellite imagery. Across all scenarios, models produce uncertainty estimates exceeding 40%, often reflecting systematic underconfidence. PNNs show better calibration during extrapolation, suggesting an intrinsic awareness of retrieval constraints. To address this miscalibration, we introduce an uncertainty recalibration method that only withholds 10% of the training dataset, but improves model calibration in 86% of PRISMA evaluations with minimal accuracy trade-offs. Resulting well-calibrated uncertainty estimates enable reliable uncertainty propagation for downstream applications. IOP retrieval uncertainty is predominantly aleatoric (inherent to the observations). Therefore, increasing the number of measurements from the same distribution or selecting a different neural network architecture trained on the same dataset does not enhance model accuracy.

 The increasing availability of remotely sensed data has enhanced our ability to monitor coastal evolution, yet extracting reliable time series for long-term analysis remains a challenge. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the Isoradiometric shoreline extraction Method in producing consistent time series data across different spatial and temporal scales. We applied the method to about 150 multispectral satellite images spanning 40 years, covering two sandy beaches along Sicily’s coast in the central Mediterranean Sea. Our validation approach focused on assessing method consistency across datasets with different spatial resolutions and revisit times. By comparing Landsat and PlanetScope data, we demonstrated that while high-resolution products capture greater variability in shoreline position, lower-resolution but longer time-span observations effectively identify underlying evolutionary trends. The analysis revealed that manual digitization captures instantaneous swash positions, while the Isoradiometric Method consistently identifies stable morphological features between the low tide terrace and berm, providing more reliable indicators of actual coastal change. This multi-resolution approach proved effective in distinguishing between method-related outliers and paroxysmal events, with the latter typically detected across multiple datasets at corresponding timeframes. The systematic application of the Isoradiometric Method successfully characterized both natural variability patterns and anthropic impacts, providing quantitative baselines for interpreting Quaternary coastal processes while offering practical insights for shoreline monitoring and coastal management strategies. Moreover, we calculated the shifts’ gradient to quantify the rate of change in shoreline position. These results demonstrate: i) the necessity of creating shoreline time series as a tool for geological interpretation through the principle of actualism and as a framework for rationalizing contemporary shoreline monitoring approaches; ii) the Isoradiometric Method enables accurate Earth Observation image processing for this purpose."

 As China’s rural population continues to decline and urbanisation accelerates, the number of vacant courtyards (VCs) has steadily increased. Existing methods for detecting VCs in China face significant challenges regarding data availability, spatial scale, resolution, and reliability, which hinder accurate assessment. This study establishes an innovative approach that evaluates courtyard utilisation status by integrating visual features from horizontal and overhead imagery, distinguishing it from traditional methods that rely solely on remote sensing textures or geometric information. We constructed a systematic set of visual features and employed an interpretable machine learning (XGBoost model) to detect courtyard utilisation status. We identified an optimal model comprising four primary features: from an overhead perspective, plants condition, enclosing wall edge cleanliness, and presence of solar water heaters; and from a horizontal perspective, door and window condition. The research further reveals the asymmetric relationship between these features and courtyard utilisation status, and the spatial heterogeneity underlying this relationship. The model significantly outperforms existing research, achieving an F1 score of 0.834 on the test set while maintaining high accuracy on the external validation dataset. This demonstrates the considerable advantages and potential of this relatively low-cost approach for rapidly detecting VC, providing theoretical support and reliable technical backing for implementing courtyard utilisation monitoring based on image data and sustainable development goals across a broad range of rural areas in the future."

 The difficulty of accurately detecting lichens in Antarctic landscapes, due to their fine-scale spatial patterns and low spectral contrast, drives the need for high-resolution drone-based remote sensing imagery to develop and validate robust mapping methods. Few studies have explored the use of remote sensing and deep learning (DL) techniques for mapping and monitoring lichen density in Antarctic regions. This study aims to fill this gap by using multispectral (MS) cameras onboard uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and DL to detect and map Antarctic lichen through a workflow that enhances detection using a semi-automatic labelling technique based on vegetation indices (VIs). This methodology was validated through a data collection campaign at Robinson Ridge, Windmill Islands, Antarctica in January 2023. Two DL methods were evaluated to classify and map Usnea spp., Umbilicaria and Pseudephebe species (black lichen), moss and non-vegetation: method (1) standalone DL model fitting, namely fully convolutional network (FCN), U-Net, and Deeplabv3+, with semi-automatic labelling thresholding using VIs; and method (2) ensemble stacking by using eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) as the input model, whose predictions are used as features for training a U-Net model. In Method 1, U-Net exhibited the best performance over the other models. Specifically, for Usnea spp., the results demonstrate an intersection over union (IoU) of 84%. Also, the black lichen class obtained an IoU of 86%. In contrast, Method 2, which employed the ensemble stacking technique, demonstrates an IoU of 71% for Usnea spp. and IoU of 75% for black lichen. This study provides promising evidence that using MS cameras on UAVs combined with DL models is an effective approach for detecting and mapping lichen density in Antarctica, though further exploration across diverse regions is recommended to validate its scalability and adaptability."

 In order to enhance the forecasting of tropical cyclone (TC) precipitation, it is essential to gain a comprehensive understanding of the precipitation microphysics and kinematics occurring within the TC. This study elucidates a novel pathway of dynamic-thermodynamic-microphysics interaction between the eye and eyewall of TC by examining the distinctive raindrop distribution pattern in the eyewall of Super Typhoon Yagi (2024), as well as several other TCs. The variability of precipitation microphysics across different regions of Yagi is demonstrated by utilizing FY-3G satellite observations. While the statistical results are consistent with previous findings, for the first time, we have observed a distinctive circular morphology of numerous small raindrops, designated the “Nw ring”, on the inner side of the eyewall. In contrast to the previously documented azimuthal size sorting signature driven by cyclonic wind shear, the “Nw ring” feature is formed by the enhanced warm rain autoconversion and accretion processes occurring below the 0 °C isotherm in the eyewall. This primary pathway results in the efficient production of heavy/extreme precipitation within the eyewall. This study contributes to our understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for heavy/extreme precipitation in these powerful TC storms. It is recommended that numerical weather prediction model parameterization be improved to accurately simulate these unique microphysical features, with the aim of improving TC predictions and reducing the risk of TC-related disasters."

 A novel drone-based aerosol sampling system, integrated with a rotating cascade impactor, was developed to enable size-selective sampling of atmospheric particles at upper altitudes. The system features rotating impaction stages that enable particle deposition suitable for single-particle analysis. For the first time, this platform was combined with Raman microspectroscopy (RMS) and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to perform detailed physicochemical characterization of airborne particles, including submicron aerosols, across ground level and aloft. Applied during a high-pollution event, the methodology enabled the characterization of particle mixing states, chemical functional groups, and size-dependent features that may be associated with aerosol transformation mechanisms. Single-particle analysis showed that internally mixed particles in the coarse-mode size range (1.35–5.5 μm) accounted for 53 % of the total in the upper-level sample, exceeding single-component particles by 20 %, which suggests multiphase processing and aging. Among sulfate-containing coarse particles, CaSO4 was the dominant species (38 %), indicating secondary formation through heterogeneous reactions during long-range transport In the submicron range (<1 μm), nitrate particles dominated (77 %), attributed to freshly formed aerosols resulting from coastal air masses with limited aging. These results highlight the significance of integrating high-resolution vertical aerosol profiling into atmospheric observations, revealing differences not captured by ground-based measurements. Beyond the field findings, this study also demonstrates the utility of a lightweight, drone-mounted rotating cascade impactor system, which enables scalable, size-selective, and altitude-resolved single-particle sampling under atmospheric conditions. This integrated approach offers a novel and practical framework for advancing both aerosol instrumentation and our understanding of atmospheric particle dynamics."

 The pre-monsoon season (March–May) in Bangladesh is the most hazardous period for lightning-related human casualties, particularly during morning and afternoon hours. This heightened risk is primarily associated with labor-intensive manual agriculture on smallholder farms. This study investigates the atmospheric conditions corresponding to the 50 most active and 50 least active pre-monsoon lightning days between 2015 and 2020. Analysis of sounding and reanalysis data reveals distinct differences across nearly all dynamic, thermodynamic, surface, and upper-air composite parameters. On the most active lightning days, the environment typically features a SWEAT index exceeding 230, a mixed-layer mixing ratio above 15 g kg−1, and high values of the most unstable convective available potential energy (≥1580 J kg−1), along with elevated instability—all conducive to thunderstorms with heavy rainfall. Notably, on 20 % of these active days, storm-relative environmental helicity reaches between 300 and 485 m2 s−2, indicating a high potential for supercell thunderstorms and intense lightning activity. In contrast, the least-active lightning days are characterized by weaker storm systems. These variations are primarily driven by strong, warm, moist southwesterly winds from the Bay of Bengal, which enhance horizontal temperature gradients and atmospheric instability. Regression models identified potential instability, cloud ice water content, and cloud liquid water content as strong synoptic-scale predictors of lightning activity. Principal component analysis (PCA) further highlighted the critical role of cloud-scale thermodynamic and kinematic variables in distinguishing lightning intensity. These findings provide a foundation for developing daily lightning forecast systems, with potential benefits for public safety and protection of lightning-sensitive infrastructure."
