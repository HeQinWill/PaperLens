It provides reliable, high-quality data essential for accurately analysing short-term sea level variations and extreme events, which are often overlooked due to limited resolution or insufficient quality control in existing datasets. 
 Availability of high-quality sub-hourly sea level data is essential for understanding of a wide range of oceanic processes, including tidal oscillations, seiches, storm surges, tsunamis (including meteotsunamis), and their impact on sea level extremes and coastal flooding. Freely accessible sea level databases often contain time series measured with hourly or even longer sampling step, or they contain high-frequency data that have not undergone quality control procedures. To address this gap, the SHELDA (Sub-Hourly European Quality Controlled Sea Level DAtaset) has been created. This dataset comprises 257 individual tide gauge records in NetCDF format (https://doi.org/10.14284/764, Balić and Šepić, 2025), each representing quality-controlled sea level time series sampled at intervals between 1 and 15 minutes, along with residual time series derived by removing tidal components. This paper outlines the rigorous quality control procedures implemented and describes the spatial and temporal coverage of the dataset, along with technical specifications. SHELDA enables precise identification and analysis of sea level variability at timescales from minutes to multi-yearly along the European coasts, including Greenland, Canary Islands, Israel, Lebanon and Türkiye."

To reduce carbon emissions, we need accurate predictions of energy demand, which depend on knowing the outdoor temperature at which buildings start heating or cooling. We used artificial intelligence to create the first global dataset of these temperature thresholds for regions worldwide. Our dataset improves energy demand prediction accuracy by 10%, supporting better energy planning and climate policy decisions. 
 Accurate building energy demand modeling is critical to decarbonizing regional energy systems. The cooling and heating degree-day models are widely used due to their simplicity and low data requirements; however, the lack of accurate base temperature data limits their performance. In particular, the scarcity of high temporal resolution building energy demand data constrains regional-scale base temperature estimation through conventional methods such as the energy signature method and the performance line method. To address this limitation, this study develops a global regional-scale base temperature dataset based on the BiLSTM neural network framework with an attention mechanism. The dataset includes both cooling base temperature (Tcool) and heating base temperature (Theat) for each region, defined at a spatial scale equivalent to a U.S. state or a Chinese province. The BiLSTM framework demonstrates strong performance, with RMSE values of 1.39°C for training and 1.33°C for testing, and Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.84 for Tcool and 0.70 for Theat. Predicted results show that global Tcool ranges from 19–25°C and Theat from 14–18°C, consistent with physical principles. External validations using 16 independent datasets demonstrate that the predicted base temperatures significantly improve the accuracy of building energy demand modeling, reducing RMSE by 10.01% for cooling and 10.02% for heating, compared to official or empirical base temperatures. This dataset supplements sparse observational base temperature data and enhances the accuracy of building energy demand modeling, contributing to low-carbon energy system planning, broader climate impact assessment and weather-related financial applications. The proposed global Tbase dataset can be acquired from https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.30646376.v2 (He et al., 2025)."

Ma;Rongliang Qiu,Homologous Gene Analysis Reveals ACR3 Expansion as a Key Driver of Arsenic Hyperaccumulation in Plants,"Pteris vittata is a well-known arsenic (As) hyperaccumulator, yet the genetic basis of its exceptional ability remains unclear. In this study, we constructed a comparative transcriptome database from seven Pteris species, including four As hyperaccumulators and three nonhyperaccumulators, to identify key genes driving As hyperaccumulation. We found that P. vittata uniquely possesses both plasma membrane-localized (Type-I) and tonoplast-localized (Type-II) ACR3s, facilitating AsIII translocation and sequestration. Additionally, P. vittata shows an expansion of HAC and ACR3 gene families, supporting enhanced AsV reduction and AsIII transport. Evolutionary analyses revealed strong positive selection on Type-II PvACR3s, with specific adaptive amino acid sites identified. Functional assays showed that coexpression of Type-I (PvACR3) and Type-II (PvACR3;1) ACR3s in an Arabidopsis thaliana hac1 mutant increased shoot As contents by 5.5–6.3-fold compared to wild-type plants, further supporting the important role of synergistic interaction between two ACR3 types in As hyperaccumulation. This study reveals unique genetic components that constitute the As hyperaccumulation pathway, providing valuable insights for enhancing phytoremediation of As-contaminated soils."

With increasing population growth and food demand, the spatial decoupling of production and consumption has intensified, driving a surge in transnational agricultural products transportation. However, existing research lacks a systematic assessment and future projection of GHG emissions from agricultural product transportation across multiple transport modes worldwide. To address this gap, we developed a global trade-linked transport GHG emission database by integrating multisource data and modeling frameworks. Compared with the research method in this paper, the previous great circle distance as the GHG emission of agricultural product transportation mileage was underestimated by 34%. This study systematically evaluates the spatiotemporal evolution of agricultural transport GHG emissions from 2000 to 2021 and explores their mitigation potential under future scenarios. Our findings reveal that global GHG emissions from agricultural transport increased by 1.6-fold over the 21-year period, with rising GHG emission intensity and trade density collectively shaping a high-carbon flow pattern dominated by exports from the Americas to Asia. Future scenario analyses indicate that the localization strategies proposed in this study are not particularly effective in reducing transport-related GHG emissions as inefficiencies inherent in localized agricultural production can increase production-stage emissions and, in turn, result in a net rise in total GHG outputs. These results suggest that future strategies should prioritize optimizing trade structures while simultaneously enhancing domestic agricultural productivity and promoting low-carbon farming technologies to achieve net emission reductions at the source."

This study developed a novel strategy of hydroxyapatite-modified biochar (PBC) application derived from Se-enriched straw for enhanced rice Se and economic benefits through cross-scale investigations encompassing soil incubation, pot experiments, and field trials. Results indicated that rice straw exhibited both a higher Se enrichment factor (59.3%) from soil and concentration (0.211 mg kg–1) than grains. Application of 1% (w/w) PBC (modified at 2% concentration (w/w)) maximally increased soil-available Se and grain Se content by 47.2% and 55.6%, respectively, compared to the control. The soil Se mobilization mechanism involved three synergistic pathways: intrinsic Se release, adsorption suppression, and soil Se activation. Subsequently, PBC augmented Se sequestration in root iron plaques through enhanced iron deposition, then upregulated expression of transmembrane transporter genes (OsSULTR1;2, OsPT2, OsNIP2;1, and OsSULTR2;1), facilitating Se uptake and translocation. Economically, PBC application generated net benefits of US$18,301 per hectare, representing US$1,137 and US$16,476 increases over BC and control, respectively. This study establishes a novel technological framework for closed-loop Se resource recovery in agroecosystems while delivering actionable insights for sustainable development."

However, the mechanism through which extracellular SeNPs (Ex-SeNPs) are exported remains unclear. In this study, we characterized Ex-SeNPs biosynthesized by Escherichia coli during the aerobic reduction of selenite. The SeNPs appeared within 2 h of exposure, remained extracellular, and displayed a consistent spherical morphology (∼100 nm). Purified Ex-SeNPs consisted of an Se0 core enveloped by a membrane-like layer containing lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, peptidoglycan, and lipopolysaccharides. Fluorescence microscopy and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry indicated that the encapsulated membrane originates from the E. coli cell membrane. Notably, mutants deficient in the outer membrane proteins OmpC or TolA failed to excrete SeNPs, resulting in intracellular accumulation despite efficient Se0 synthesis. Our findings suggest that E. coli forms SeNPs intracellularly and exports them via an envelope-dependent process, during which the particles may become encapsulated in membrane-like structures. These findings help clarify the mechanism underlying a membrane-dependent pathway for SeNP detoxification and export that had been suggested but not directly demonstrated."

This study investigates how behavioral preferences (i.e., individual tendencies in how people value future outcomes, perceive and respond to risk, and interact with others) and prior knowledge influence decision-making in a simulated water crisis. A total of 130 participants completed a behavioral preference survey and engaged in a five-party serious game simulating an acute drinking water contamination incident. Analyses at individual, group, and role levels revealed that decisions related to communication, action-taking, and satisfaction were largely driven by role responsibilities, with limited behavioral preference effects. However, aggregated behavioral preferences, e.g., group-averaged probability weighting and loss aversion, explained collective decision-making patterns. The role-specific analysis further revealed the interactions between certain behavioral preferences and role performance: for instance, altruism reduced residents’ likelihood of demanding compensation but increased the contamination exposure rate. Taken together, these findings suggest that behavioral preferences are a modifiable component of emergency preparedness. These findings underscore the importance of institutional clarity, leveraging behavioral diversity, and training that integrates behavioral assessment and cross-role learning to enhance the water emergency response."

However, the electron transfer from S-nZVI to TCE or water also results in leaching of Fe2+, and the mitigation of this reaction has not been addressed. Anaerobic corrosion of 1.2 g/L S-nZVI during TCE degradation led to high dissolved Fe, up to 353 ± 26 mg/L under electron-excess conditions and 427 ± 30.2 mg/L under electron-limited conditions, thus compromising treated water quality during (ground)water treatment. In this study, a dittmarite-S-nZVI (DS-nZVI) composite yielded efficient TCE degradation with the continuous sequestration of released Fe. S-nZVI was well-dispersed on the dittmarite (NH4MgPO4·H2O) nanosheets. DS-nZVI yielded faster and complete dechlorination and a ∼1000-fold decrease in Fe leaching (<0.3 mg/L) compared to S-nZVI (353 ± 26 mg/L) under electron excess conditions, and >90% iron removal under electron-limited conditions with TCE degradation capacity of 1.46 × 1023 molecules per mol of Fe0. Continuous exchange of Fe2+ with Mg2+ ions and complexation with phosphate ions was followed by structural transformation to crystalline baricite, (Fe, Mg)3(PO4)2·8H2O, leading to a more sustainable TCE degradation approach for groundwater remediation."

Agricultural practices, particularly the application of manure, wastewater, and sludge, constitute major anthropogenic sources driving the occurrence and dissemination of ARGs in soils. Understanding ARG transmission within soil-plant systems is crucial for developing control strategies to mitigate associated human health risks in agroecosystems. This review synthesized the primary sources of ARGs in the soil-plant system, elucidates their transmission pathways and key influencing factors, and systematically analyzed their potential health effects alongside attenuation strategies. Finally, current research gaps and future priorities were discussed. By providing a comprehensive overview of ARG environmental behavior, fate, and risks within the soil-plant system, this work aims to inform the development of control strategies and risk mitigation measures for researchers and environmental policymakers."

This study quantified 10 UVA congeners in urinary samples from 254 Beijing residents aged 19–44 years, revealing pervasive exposure to UVAs. The specific gravity-adjusted concentrations of 10 UVAs (∑10UVAs) ranged from 1.90 ng/mL to 2.03 × 103 ng/mL (geometric mean: 43.7 ng/mL), with UV-P (20.3 ng/mL), UV-360 (11.2 ng/mL), and UV-329 (6.34 ng/mL) as dominant compounds, indicating substantial environmental bioavailability. Women showed 2.7-fold higher ∑10UVAs in the summer (80.0 vs 29.3 ng/mL) and 1.7-fold higher ∑10UVAs in the winter (48.6 vs 28.0 ng/mL) than men, revealing sex-dependent and season-dependent exposure. Congener-specific detection patterns indicated multiple exposure sources and differential bioaccumulation behaviors. Critically, UVA exposure showed congener-specific and nonlinear associations with oxidative stress biomarkers (OSBs). UV-329, in particular, exhibited dual pro-oxidative and antioxidant effects across all four measured urinary OSBs. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) analyses further revealed significant effect modifications by sex, season, and alcohol consumption, underscoring interactions between chemical coexposure and individual susceptibility. These results illuminate the pathways of UVA exposure, its associated health impacts, and the underlying susceptibilities in reproductive-age populations, thereby providing critical evidence to support enhanced risk management strategies for this vulnerable population."

In a cohort of pregnant women in Atlanta, an expansive panel of contemporary and emerging chemicals comprised of 113 analytes in 12 chemical groups were measured in midpregnancy urine samples (N = 168, 2016–2019). We assessed temporal trends in concentrations and performed latent profile analysis jointly with log-binomial regression to uncover patterns of chemical exposures in our population and their associations with sociodemographic, temporal, and behavioral predictors. Parabens, bactericides, and di (2-ethylhexyl phthalate) metabolite concentrations (ng/mL) decreased during our study period. Fungicide and herbicides and phthalate, organophosphorus flame retardant, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolite concentrations (ng/mL) spiked in warmer months. Latent profile analysis identified two distinct profiles: women with moderate levels of most analytes and women with low levels of most analytes. We observed no association between predictors and profile membership. However, chemical groups were significantly associated with season, indicators of low socioeconomic status, and home characteristics and behaviors in linear regression models. We highlight the need for national surveillance systems to incorporate biomonitoring that capture emerging exposures across diverse populations."

However, the impact of cold spells, a common ETE, on adolescent mental health remains unclear. The study aims to explore the impacts of cold spells, defined with different intensities and durations, on adolescent mental health across China while also establishing risk-driven thresholds for cold spells and identifying vulnerable subpopulations. The data was derived from the 2019 survey cycle of the Chinese National Surveillance on Students’ Constitution and Health, conducted between September and December and encompassing 149,697 adolescents aged 10–18 from 30 provinces. Cold spells were defined by using a series of cutoff temperature thresholds and durations. We assessed cold spell frequency and average cold intensity during the 12 months prior to the survey based on 0.1° × 0.1° gridded apparent temperature data. Troubled symptoms were measured using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale and the Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale. We applied generalized linear mixed models to estimate the associations, and risk-driven thresholds for cold spells were determined based on the distribution of risk estimates. Among participants, 10.9% reported troubled symptoms. Higher cold spell frequency and average cold intensity were associated with increased odds of troubled symptoms. Risk-related thresholds were set using daily apparent temperatures at or below the fifth percentile for ≥3 days (P5_3d) or the 2.5 percentile for ≥2 days (P2.5_2d). Early warning and avoidance of cold spell exposure could potentially prevent 2.8–3.5% of troubled symptoms. Younger adolescents, female adolescents, rural residents, and those in lower GDP regions were more vulnerable. Our findings suggest that cold spells exceeding certain thresholds may adversely impact adolescent mental health, emphasizing the need for targeted cold-health early warning systems."

Here, we sought to clarify the potential promoting effects of PS-NPs on ovarian cancer. Our results first showed that ovarian cancer cells could internalize 50 nm PS-NPs, with significant internalization observed at concentrations starting from 20 μg/mL, which aligns with environmental exposure levels. RNA-seq and subsequent experiments indicated that treatment with 20 μg/mL PS-NPs significantly promoted ovarian cancer cell proliferation, and this phenotype was closely associated with CDK4/6-dependent cell cycle regulation. The CDK4/6 inhibitor Palbociclib effectively reverses the cell proliferation induced by PS-NPs. An oral exposure model in mice found tissue deposition of PS-NPs in the ovaries, kidneys, heart, and lungs. In vivo models further confirmed that mice exposed to PS-NPs had larger subcutaneous tumor weights and volumes compared to the control group, while Palbociclib could successfully block these effects. In conclusion, our research revealed that low-dose PS-NPs could stimulate ovarian tumor progression both in vivo and in vitro in a CDK4/6-dependent manner. Taken together, our study provides potential evidence for risk management of exposure to nanoplastics related to cancer development."

They can cause hepatic lipid interventions, but the underlying mechanisms require investigation. This study assessed the retention of polypropylene microplastics in mouse liver and determined the intercorrelations between hepatic lipid fluctuations and transcriptomic changes. Microplastic-induced liver dysfunction was confirmed by the variations of transamination, cholesterol metabolism, biotransformation, and redox state. Chronic high-dose treatment induced distinct pathological changes, including regional fibrotic remodeling and ultrastructural mitochondrial abnormalities. Raman biospectra of liver slice proposed vital peaks of 1060, 1132, 1168, 1340, 1446, 1618, and 1670 cm–1, representing the liver biomolecule landscapes. Transcriptomic changes were mainly involved in mRNA transcription, multicellular organism development, various stimuli response, cell differentiation, and lipid metabolic process. Microplastic exposure dosage exerted more profound effects than exposure duration on gene expressions of oxidation–reduction process, signal transduction, and lipid metabolism. WGCNA analysis proposed 47 hub genes involved gene expression orchestration, cell fate monitor, and mitochondria translation modulation. Nine differentially expressed genes associated with lipid biomarkers were related to mitochondria transcription (Mrps12 and Mrpl53), cell differentiation (Bbc3, Lrrc15 and Gdf15), lipid catabolism (Etnppl and lipg) and tRNA methyltransferase (Trmt112), and Raman peak at 1670 cm–1 intimately connected with aggregated forms of protein.

While regulatory bodies deem these chemicals unlikely to pose significant risks, emerging evidence highlights their potential neurotoxic effects. In this study, we evaluated the neurodevelopmental toxicity of TBBPA and TBBPA-BHEE in zebrafish embryos exposed to nonlethal (94–470 μg/L for TBBPA, 610–2030 μg/L for TBBPA-BHEE) and environmentally relevant concentrations (0.094–0.47 μg/L for TBBPA, 0.061–0.203 μg/L for TBBPA-BHEE) for up to 120 h postfertilization (hpf). Our findings show that at nonlethal concentrations, both TBBPA and TBBPA-BHEE impaired craniofacial development, induced apoptosis, reduced γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels, and disrupted motor behavior, with significant alterations in the expression of genes involved in GABAergic signaling and synaptic plasticity. Transcriptomic and miRNA profiling revealed that downregulation of GABA receptor genes and miRNAs (e.g., let-7i, miR-192,) contributed to neurodevelopmental defects through disruption of CREB signaling and synaptogenesis. In contrast, exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations induced similar phenotypes (craniofacial malformations and apoptosis) without major changes in neurotransmitter levels, suggesting that low-dose neurotoxicity might be mediated by alternative, less understood mechanisms, possibly involving epigenetic modifications or compensatory neuronal adaptations. These findings underscore the complexity of low-dose toxicity and the need for further research into the molecular pathways underlying the neurotoxic effects of TBBPA and its derivatives, particularly at environmentally relevant concentrations."

The contributions of ferroptosis and pyroptosis were recently reported in the progression of hepatic diseases. This study aimed to investigate the possible role of ferroptosis and pyroptosis in PM2.5-induced hepatocyte toxicity in LO2 cells (25, 50, or 100 μg/mL, 24 h) and liver injury in mice (10 mg/kg, intranasal administration, twice a week for 15 times). Our results revealed that PM2.5 induced a dose-related cytotoxic effect on LO2 cells and mouse liver injuries as well as increased activities of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. These findings were accompanied by Fe2+ accumulation, resulting from iron transport system disruption and ferritinophagy activation. The excess free Fe2+ induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, glutathione (GSH) depletion, glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity loss, differential regulation of Nrf2 pathway elements, decreasing expression of the GPX4 protein, increasing expression of PTGS2 and ACSL4 genes and lipid peroxides, and finally initiation of ferroptosis. Along with tissue inflammation, overexpression of HMGB1 and proinflammatory cytokines, hepatocyte pyroptosis as indicated by cellular pyroptotic characteristics, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and Gasdermin D cleavage were also induced by PM2.5. The mitigating effects of deferoxamine on the above effects suggested ferroptosis and pyroptosis and the subsequent inflammation responses as potential mechanisms underlying PM2.5-induced liver toxicity.

However, precise mechanisms underlying the impact of pathogenic bacteria on respiratory health remain poorly understood, and their primary target cells in respiratory tract have not been identified. We systematically explored cytotoxicity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) on the whole epithelial cell lines representing different segments of the respiratory tract, including HNEpC (nasal mucosa), NP69 (nasopharynx), 16HBE (bronchus), and Beas-2B (lung) cells. By tracing the entire process of exposure to P. aeruginosa, NP69 cells emerged as the primary target, with HNEpC cells showing the lowest susceptibility among the four respiratory cell types. P. aeruginosa was transmitted from extracellular space to intracellular region of NP69 cells, accompanied by significant up-regulation (1.5–26.5 fold) of NOD2 expression, an RNA molecule that specifically binds to bacterial cell walls. Furthermore, cell proliferation activity decreased by 6.8%–46.1%, while levels of inflammatory cytokine interleukin IL-6 and IL-1β increased by 14.5%–181.0% and 50.2%–238.2%, respectively, following intracellular transition of bacteria in NP69 cells. The changes in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker expression at genetic and protein levels and enhancement of functional phenotypes (migratory capacity) confirmed the potential of P. aeruginosa to induce malignant transformation of epithelial cells by activating the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway. This comprehensive examination of comparative cytotoxicity of bacteria on cells throughout the human respiratory tract elucidates specific target cells and damage mechanisms, offering valuable insights into health risk assessment, risk prevention, and bacteria control."

However, the impact of OPEs on oxidative stress, a precursor of geriatric diseases, remains unclear in older adults. Based on the China BAPE study, a panel study with multiple repeated measurements, we collected urine samples from 76 healthy older adults to measure OPEs and oxidative stress markers, aiming to investigate both individual and combined OPE exposures in relation to oxidative stress. Our results indicated that Dibutyl phosphate (DBP), Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (BEHP), Bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCIPP), Diphenyl phosphate (DPHP), and Bis(2-methylphenyl) phosphate (BMPP) exposure were significantly associated with increased levels of 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHG), and malondialdehyde (MDA). Household heating status had a modifying effect on these associations. Generalized additive mixed models revealed potential linear and nonlinear associations between OPEs and oxidative stress markers. The quantile g-computation and Bayesian kernel machine regression further found positive effects of OPEs mixtures on 8-OHdG, 8-OHG, and MDA. Weighted distribution analyses identified BEHP as a potentially contributing component affecting oxidative stress.

Exposome-based analyses utilizing biological samples have been conducted in various countries to assess the impacts of environmental endocrine disruptors and other pollutants on maternal and fetal health during pregnancy, particularly in developed countries. However, large-scale cohort studies that comprehensively cover major maternal and fetal diseases during pregnancy to explore the environmental and genetic interactions affecting maternal and fetal health are still lacking in China. Currently, environmental exposure assessment and biomarker measurement are particularly complex, given the challenges posed by handling mixed exposure effects and the hidden threats posed by emerging contaminants.

It is critical to prioritize potential obesogenic factors and systematically profile their modes of action. Here, based on adverse outcome pathway networks (AONs), we established a machine learning screening system that integrated three adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) to describe the mechanisms of chemical-induced obesity for thousands of chemicals. Notably, optimal AON-informed machine learning models achieved an accuracy above 0.95 and identified amide, aromatic/polycyclic, and nitrogen-containing structures as obesity-related. In addition, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were identified as prime candidate obesogens, inducing metabolic syndrome by interfering with all three signaling pathways across the AONs. Representative obesogens predicted in this study, such as antibiotics, insecticide metabolites, and exogenous chemical glucagon, were found to predominantly target membrane, mitochondrial, and nuclear receptor signaling pathways, respectively. Furthermore, top-prioritized chemicals (such as phenanthrene, azithromycin, 1,8,9-trihydroxyanthracene, etc.) according to ranking scores were randomly selected for experimental verification, and all selected candidates exhibited pathway interference in activating specific molecular initiating events (MIEs), demonstrating the predictive model’s accuracy.

While they are generally not classified as persistent organic pollutants due to their relatively rapid metabolism and urinary excretion, a fraction can accumulate in tissues, including the adipose. This bioaccumulation raises concerns about the potential for prolonged endocrine disruption and chronic toxicity. This study investigated the distribution and accumulation of nine BPs in human blood, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). By comparing the detection rates and concentrations of BPs in paired blood and adipose samples, we found that certain BPs (particularly BPF, BPE, and BPA-G) exhibit preferential accumulation in adipose tissues. The accumulation propensity was slightly higher in SAT than in VAT. Correlation analysis revealed that the sources of the same BP in VAT and SAT were highly consistent, whereas most BPs in adipose tissues had significantly different sources compared with those in blood. Further analysis suggested that age and obesity might be key factors influencing the differential accumulation of BPs in adipose tissues. Since accumulated BPs can be slowly or substantially released during lipolysis, our findings highlight that the adipose tissue reservoir of BPs may play an important role in their long-term toxic effects."

Plasma samples were tested with an untargeted metabolomic analysis. Meteorological data was collected from China Meteorological Data Sharing Service System. The three consecutive months with the highest monthly average temperatures of the whole year were defined as summer. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the multiple linear regression model were used to assess the effects of summer mean temperature exposure on blood metabolomics, followed by stratified analysis by sex.

Metabolomic analysis identified 54 altered metabolites related to summer mean temperature, of which 7 altered metabolites were enriched in 4 significant metabolic pathways (p < 0.05), which were mainly involved in amino acid and peptide compound metabolism. Stratified analysis results showed that in addition to amino acid metabolism, summer mean temperature exposure also disrupted vitamin metabolism in females. Summer mean temperature could possibly be associated with altered metabolic pathways such as amino acid metabolism, causing inflammation and oxidative stress damage. Females could be more susceptible to summer temperature in terms of disrupted vitamin metabolism."

In vitro experiments revealed that CTPs exposure impaired mitochondrial function in BEAS-2B cells in a time-dependent manner. Proteomic analysis demonstrated significant alterations in oxidative phosphorylation-related proteins, disrupting the electron transport chain (ETC). Untargeted metabolomics further revealed disruptions in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, glutathione metabolism, and purine metabolism, with notably decreased levels of key metabolites. Multiomics integration suggested potential associations between high-dose CTPs exposure and diseases including lipoyltransferase 1 deficiency, Alzheimer’s disease, and schizophrenia. In vivo studies confirmed pathological lung damage in mice, including alveolar destruction and pulmonary fibrosis. Additionally, downregulation of N-lauroylsphingosine (NLDP) was identified as a potential metabolic biomarker for CTPs-induced lung injury, offering novel insights for mitigating CTPs’ adverse effects.

This study demonstrates that developmental exposure to mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP: 0, 10, and 50 mg/kg), the bioactive metabolite of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), induced neurobehavioral deficits in adolescent offspring rats. Behavioral assessments revealed that the MEHP exposure provoked anxiety-like behaviors at postnatal days (PND) 14 and 21, concurrently manifested as spatial memory impairments at PND35. Histopathological analysis demonstrated significant neurodegenerative alterations in the hippocampus of MEHP-exposed offspring, including reduced Nissl body density in the 50 mg/kg group. Transcriptomic profiling identified a robust dose-dependent dysregulation pattern, with high-dose exposure (50 mg/kg) eliciting substantially more differentially expressed genes (542 DEGs) than low-dose exposure (393 DEGs). Analysis revealed suppression of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) pathways, characterized by the downregulation of Cyp2a1, Cyp2f4, Cyp2g1, and Cyp1a2. Strikingly, these effects occurred independently of canonical xenobiotic-sensing receptors, indicating direct CYP450 transcriptional inhibition as a potential novel mechanism. Taken together, our findings determine MEHP as a potent developmental neurotoxicant, with CYP450 dysregulation identified as a critical mediator of phthalate-induced neurotoxicity, with significant implications for environmental risk assessment."

These potentially tsunamigenic seafloor offsets result from coseismic fault slip and deformation beneath or within the accretionary wedge. The mechanics of these shallow rupture phenomena and their dependence on subduction zone properties remain unresolved, partly due to the sparsity of offshore observations of shallow megathrust earthquake deformation. Here, we analyze how offshore structure influences shallow rupture mechanics and slip partitioning using 3D dynamic earthquake simulations of the Cascadia subduction zone (CSZ) megathrust with and without variably dipping seaward‐ or landward‐vergent splay faults in the wedge that sole into the megathrust. Resulting tradeoffs between splay and megathrust slip reveal structural controls on rupture partitioning, with greater splay slip leading to less shallow megathrust slip updip. Gently dipping and seaward‐vergent splays host more slip than those with steeper, landward‐vergent splays. To isolate the underlying mechanisms, we compare models with Andersonian and plunging principal stresses. Results suggest distinct static and dynamic processes control the dip‐ and vergence‐dependence of splay rupture: static (mis)alignment relative to far‐field tectonic loading favors slip on more optimally oriented, shallowly dipping splay faults. In contrast, dynamic stress interactions of an updip‐propagating megathrust rupture front with the free surface and potential branch faults favor forward branching onto seaward‐vergent splays and inhibit backward branching onto landward‐vergent splays. Resulting seafloor displacements suggest splay fault structure may influence coseismic tsunami source processes, highlighting the importance of dynamically viable rupture scenarios in subduction hazard assessments."

However, these processes do not always produce surface manifestations and may sometimes elude detection by current geological and geodetic monitoring. Here we monitor subsurface seismic velocity changes across Kīlauea's system from 2013 to 2018 and integrate these observations with concurrent measurements of ground deformation and lava lake elevation. We corroborate years‐long seismic velocity decreases around the summit caldera, which are particularly pronounced at southern stations, consistent with sustained pressurization of the South Caldera reservoir (SCR) from a deep magma supply. Following the 2015 summit intrusion, accelerated rates of velocity decrease, summit inflation, and lava lake rise suggest an increased magma supply to the SCR. Notably, we identify an anomalous 7‐month period (late 2016–mid 2017) of disrupted magma/pressure transfer between the SCR and Halema'uma'u magma reservoir (HMR), as evidenced by dropping lava lake levels despite continued summit inflation and SCR pressurization. This period coincided with pressurization observed beneath Pu'u'ō'ō, indicating pressure/magma diversion from the summit toward the ERZ and the episode terminated with a M5.3 flank earthquake in June 2017 that restored the connectivity between the SCR and HMR and triggered shallow crustal pressurization beneath the summit caldera for the subsequent 2–3 months. Our findings reveal significant perturbations in Kīlauea's magmatic plumbing system approximately one year before the catastrophic 2018 eruption, highlighting seismic velocity monitoring's value for detecting subtle changes of the volcano."

As the northern terminus of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC), it thus both affects, and is affected by, the Atlantic MOC. Here we quantify the magnitudes of the two overturning cells in density space, and then decompose the water mass transformation rates into net pan‐Arctic contributions from surface forcing and diapycnal mixing. We use a high‐resolution, quasi‐synoptic ice and ocean hydrographic data set spanning the four main Arctic Ocean gateways—Fram, Davis and Bering Straits, and the Barents Sea Opening. Two surface flux reanalyses and a hydrographic climatology are used to generate estimates of surface water mass transformation rates by density class. A box model then determines the profiles of turbulent mixing transformation rates, and associated turbulent diffusivities. We show that turbulent mixing and surface forcing drive transformations of similar magnitudes, while mixing dominates in the upper cell and surface fluxes in the lower cell. Consideration of uncertainties and timescales leads to the tentative suggestion that our results might be representative of recent decades. We discuss the possible significance of tides and sea ice brine rejection as energy sources driving turbulent mixing. Finally, we speculate as to whether water mass transformation rates may change in future as ocean heat transport into the Arctic increases. As sea ice declines and the efficiency of atmosphere‐to‐ocean momentum transfer increases, the Arctic Ocean is expected to “spin up,” causing more intense turbulent mixing, with uncertain consequences."

 Hunner-type interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (HIC) is a debilitating condition defined by bladder pain and urinary urgency, yet its upstream drivers remain poorly understood. To identify upstream mechanisms that exacerbate urothelial injury, here we apply an integrative multi-omics framework combining metagenomic sequencing, targeted metabolomics of urine and serum, and single-cell RNA sequencing. This approach reveals a microbial signature enriched in Enterococcus avium and a marked alteration in bile acid metabolism, including increased taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA). Single-cell analysis indicates that these changes converge on Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) activation in urothelial cells. Further validations show that a microbiota–bile acid–TLR3 axis disrupts epithelial barrier integrity and triggers inflammatory responses in experimental models. Transplantation and metabolite administration confirm the causal role of E. avium and TCDCA, while TLR3 inhibition ameliorates injury. These findings uncover an upstream pathway linking gut-derived metabolites to bladder pathology and suggest opportunities for biomarker development and targeted therapies for HIC. Through integrated multi-omics and experimental validation, this study reveals that altered gut microbiota and bile acid metabolism activate TLR3 to induce urothelial injury in interstitial cystitis, identifying a pathway with therapeutic potential."

 Cell fate transitions emerge from dynamic gene expression programs, yet existing RNA velocity models primarily rely on RNA abundance and globally inferred latent time, limiting their ability to capture local regulatory dynamics. To address these limitations, we introduce MoFlow, a deep neural network that integrates multi-omic data within a relay velocity framework. Unlike previous approaches, MoFlow flexibly infers velocity parameters at single-cell resolution without pre-assigned latent time, enabling a comprehensive and locally adaptive estimation of gene expression kinetics. Applied to single cell multi-omic datasets from brain, skin, and blood cells, MoFlow distinguished chromatin-dependent and independent transcriptional regulation, validated transcription repression models, and identified asynchronous gene repression in neural progenitors. It also uncovered transcriptional activation of DNA damage response genes in radial glia with distinct subnuclear localization. By resolving fine-grained regulatory programs, MoFlow advances the interpretability and precision of RNA velocity analysis beyond the limits of existing models. Cell fate transitions rely on dynamic regulatory programs that RNA velocity often blurs.

 Cancer detection is challenging, especially in patients with diffuse symptoms that overlap with non-malignant conditions. Here we show that plasma protein profiling can identify cancer among patients with non-specific symptoms. Using proximity extension assay-based proteomics of 1463 plasma proteins from 456 patients presenting with non-specific symptoms sampled prior to cancer diagnostic work-up and diagnosis, we identify 29 proteins associated with new cancer diagnoses. We develop a model able to stratify 160 cancer cases and 296 non-cancer cases with an area under the curve of 0.80, maintaining performance (0.82) in an independent replication cohort of 238 patients. The model also distinguishes cancer from autoimmune, inflammatory and infectious diseases.

 The monomorphic antigen-presenting molecule CD1d presents lipid antigens to both αβ and γδ T cells. While type I natural killer T cells (NKT) display exquisite specificity for CD1d presenting α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer), the extent of lipid specificity exhibited by CD1d-restricted γδ T cells remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that human γδ T cell receptors (TCRs) can recognise CD1d in either a lipid-dependent or lipid-independent manner with weak to moderate affinity. Using small-angle X-Ray scattering, we find that γδ TCR-CD1d binding modality is conserved across distinct CD1d-restricted TCRs. In functional assays, CD1d γδ TCR affinity was a poor predictor of γδ T cell line activation. Moreover, CD1d presenting endogenous lipids was sufficient to stimulate T cell activation and induce γδ TCR-CD3 clustering and phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner. Elongation of the γδ TCR-CD3 complex by the inclusion of the Cγ2 and Cγ3 -encoded constant domains perturbed cellular activation whilst maintaining the ability to form functional γδ TCR clusters. The crystal structure of a Vδ1 γδ+ TCR-CD1d complex showed that the γδ TCR sat atop of the CD1d antigen-binding cleft but made no contacts with the presented lipid antigen.

These atomically thin crystals exhibit remarkable dielectric properties, including a wide bandgap (~5.54 eV), high dielectric constant (~18), robust breakdown voltage (>12 MV cm-1) and good thermal reliability. By integrating ultrathin Sm2O2SO4 nanoplates with 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) via vdW forces, we fabricate field-effect transistors (FETs) showing a subthreshold swing down to 65.2 mV dec-1, hysteresis down to 5.4 mV, on/off current ratios of ~109, and gate leakage currents down to around 7 × 10-7 A cm-2. Furthermore, a high gate coupling ratio (GCR ~ 0.83) non-volatile memory device was developed based on the MoS2/h-BN/MLG/Sm2O2SO4/MLG heterostructure. The flash memory achieves ultrafast (~50 ns) programming/erasing operations, robust endurance (>2000 cycles) and long-term retention (>10 years). This work shows promising results for the integration of Sm2O2SO4 as a high-κ dielectric in future 2D devices, with implications for low-power, high-performance electronics. van der Waals (vdW) dielectric materials with a wide bandgap and high dielectric constant are necessary for the development of 2D electronics. Here, the authors report the synthesis of quasi-vdW layered Sm2O2SO4 thin crystals, showing a bandgap of ~5.54 eV and a dielectric constant ~18, leading to high performance 2D MoS2 transistors."

 Adiabatic topological pumping offers a robust mechanism for light transport in integrated photonics, enabling the development of efficient on-chip photonic devices. However, its practical implementations face significant challenges in maintaining both high transport efficiency and scalability due to slow adiabatic modulation requirements, and existing acceleration strategies fall short in achieving substantial device miniaturization. Here, we develop a gap-mode strategy for constructing shortcut to topological pumping, and experimentally demonstrate a superadiabatic paradigm through iterative adiabatic transformations in an on-chip photonic platform. Our approach achieves a 20-fold footprint reduction compared to conventional adiabatic pumping and a 50% size reduction relative to optimized Landau-Zener (as well as recently reported quantum metric and adiabatic infimum) implementations. The device operates over a remarkable bandwidth of 650–920 nm while facilitating scalable waveguide integration. This methodology establishes a framework for realizing high-efficiency topological photonic transport with tailored coupling configurations, paving the way for ultra-compact photonic integrated circuits.

It revealed antibiotic contamination, resistance genes, and mobile genetic elements from multidrug-resistant pathogens, highlighting sewage as a critical antimicrobial resistance reservoir. 
 The emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in clinically important bacterial pathogens has severely compromised the effectiveness of commonly used antibiotics in healthcare. Acquisition and transmission of AMR genes (ARGs) are often facilitated by sublethal concentrations of antibiotics in microbially dense environments. In this study, we use sewage samples (n = 381) collected from six Indian states between June and December 2023 to assess the concentration of eleven antibiotics, microbial diversity, and ARG richness. We find antibiotics from seven drug classes and detect over 2000 bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Metagenomic (n = 220) and isolated genome sequences (n = 305) of aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species identify 82 ARGs associated with 80 mobile genetic elements (MGEs). These MGEs are predominantly present in multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens. Comparative core genome analysis of MDR bacterial isolates (n = 7166) shows strong genetic similarity between sewage-derived strains and clinical pathogens. Our results highlight sewage as a significant reservoir for ARGs, where genetic exchanges occur and facilitate the evolution and spread of AMR pathogens in both community and healthcare settings. Additionally, the dipstick-based assay developed for ARGs detection can be used for sewage surveillance in low-resource settings for better understanding of resistance prevalence.

 Streamflow in the Upper Colorado River Basin, USA has decreased proportionally more than precipitation in the recent multi-decadal drought. The causes are debated. Understanding how precipitation, and seasonal temperature, vegetation, and evapotranspiration dynamics affect streamflow is essential. Here we use causal inference with historical data to identify surface runoff efficiency drivers. Runoff efficiency increases in years with higher precipitation and snow accumulation accompanied by cooler spring temperatures and delayed vegetation phenology, which generally attenuates biomass accumulation. Conversely, runoff efficiency decreases in years with lower precipitation and snow accumulation, or warmer springs, when vegetation activity and productivity are accelerated or amplified. Summer temperature, often identified as a driver of higher evaporation and aridity, does not emerge as statistically significant. Years with extreme phases of winter-spring precipitation have distinct atmospheric circulation patterns and associated sea surface temperatures, indicating the influence of larger-scale climate drivers on the Basin’s precipitation and runoff efficiency dynamics. Statistical causal inference shows that runoff efficiency in the Upper Colorado River Basin rises with higher precipitation and snow, accompanied by cooler springs and suppressed vegetation, and falls when precipitation and snow are lower and accompanied by warmer springs and enhanced vegetation."

 The rapid expansion of rice-crayfish farming in China has triggered significant land-use transformations, yet long-term mapping of these patterns remains challenging due to sample limitations and spectral complexities. This study developed a robust classification framework integrating synergistic sample generation and hierarchical classification to address this gap. We first proposed a sample generation method integrating temporal migration with feature-based enlargement strategy, then designed a two-layer stratified classification approach combining machine learning (Random Forest) with phenology-based techniques. Applied to the Jianghan Plain (2013−2022), our framework achieved high accuracy, with overall accuracy higher than 87 % annually and correlation around 0.90 with statistical data. Critical land use dynamics were noticed as follows: (1) Land-use transitions accelerated during 2016–2022, with rice-crayfish expanding predominantly at the expense of traditional rice cultivation (77 % ± 4.76 %) of rice-crayfish fields originated from rice-based cropping). (2) Single-rice areas declined by 24 % ± 3.02 %, while rapeseed-rice and wheat-rice systems decreased by 21 % ± 5.41 % and 26 % ± 5.32 %, respectively. (3) Conversions from dryland and water bodies to rice-crayfish emerged during 2019–2022, a later phase of expansion when the conversion to rice-crayfish became widespread. Overall, this study proposed a robust land use type classification framework for complex regions with limited samples in long-term, providing a transferable solution for monitoring land-system changes under rapid transitions. By revealing the transformative impact of rice-crayfish system expansion on traditional land use patterns, this study highlights its substantial effects on conventional rice cultivation and offers valuable insights for formulating adaptive land management strategies that support ecological sustainability and regional food security."

 The increasing frequency and severity of hydrological extremes demand the development of early warning systems and effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. Such systems and strategies require spatially detailed hydrological predictions, mostly provided by hydrological models. However, current state-of-the-art hydrological predictions remain limited in their spatial resolution. A proposed solution is the integration of high-resolution (<1 km) Earth observation (EO) products in hydrological modelling in order to reach hyper-resolution (approximately 1 km2). Nonetheless, proper use of these data in hydrological modelling requires a comprehensive characterization of their uncertainties. Here, we evaluate the performance of high-resolution EO products of four hydrological variables (7 precipitation products, 5 snow cover area products, 6 surface soil moisture products, and 6 actual evapotranspiration products) against observational references. Two merged EO precipitation products at 1 km resolution (merged IMERG-SM2A and merged ERA5-IMERG-SM2A) reached correlation coefficients >0.5 with the benchmark reference over most areas and are recommended for hyper-resolution hydrological modelling over Europe. The MODIS (resolution of 250 m) and Sentinel-2/Landsat-8 (resolution of 20/30 m) snow cover products showed the highest classification accuracy and were selected as the best choice for the use of snow cover area products in hyper-resolution hydrological modelling. For surface soil moisture, the NSIDC SMAP product at 1 km resolution yielded correlation coefficients >0.6 at most stations and is recommended for hyper-resolution hydrological modelling. Finally, evapotranspiration products showed similar performances at the selected flux sites (correlations coefficients > 0.8). While the MODIS-Terra/Aqua evapotranspiration products (MOD16A2/MYD16A2) offer higher spatial resolution (500 m), making them potentially advantageous for hyper-resolution hydrological modelling, their temporal resolution is coarser (8-day intervals). In contrast, products like ETMonitor (1 km), ALEXI, and HOLAPS (5 km) provide daily estimates, albeit at lower spatial resolution. The assimilation of the proposed high-resolution products in models individually or in combination could lead us to hyper-resolution hydrological modelling. Still, developing integration workflows is required to overcome difficulties related to scale mismatches and data-gaps."

 High-resolution monitoring of root-zone soil moisture is essential for optimizing irrigation in precision agriculture. This study demonstrates the potential of drone-borne Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) to map spatial and temporal soil moisture dynamics across an agricultural field over an entire growing season. Using the innovative gprSense® system, which combines a frequency-domain radar with full-wave inversion, we achieved precise and automated data acquisition and processing. To our knowledge, this is the first study to implement time-lapse, root-zone soil moisture mapping using drone-borne GPR combined with real-time full-wave inversion. Time-lapse mapping was conducted in a spinach field, yielding eight high-resolution soil moisture maps that captured dynamic variations driven by precipitation and irrigation. Operating in the frequency range 110–120 MHz, the system measured soil moisture down to a depth of approximately 35–40 cm, with comparisons performed using Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensors and mass balance analyses. Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) provided complementary data into soil electrical conductivity patterns. Results revealed strong agreement between GPR-derived soil moisture estimates and conventional methods, with spatial patterns aligning closely with predictions from Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) models. These findings demonstrate the capacity of drone-borne GPR to deliver actionable, root-zone scale insights for real-time irrigation optimization and agricultural water management."

 Seagrass meadows directly and indirectly provide a wide range of ecosystem services, but their close proximity to anthropogenic activities renders them highly vulnerable. Regardless of their vulnerability and importance as ecosystem health indicators, intertidal seagrasses, unlike their subtidal relatives, have yet to be assessed at continental scales, and current global estimates of seagrass extent either do not mention intertidal seagrasses or combine them with subtidal seagrasses. Here, we present a first of its kind map of intertidal seagrasses in Europe using a harmonised methodology. Over a total intertidal area of 15,100 km2, we found that seagrasses cover an area comparable to the combined areas of Paris and Lisbon: 212 ± 18.8 km2. The proportion of available intertidal area covered by seagrass decreased towards higher latitudes (from ∼5.4 % at 35°N to ∼0 % at 58°N). Regardless of this pattern, the top three hotspots of seagrass covered the full latitudinal range of Europe, notably in the North Frisian Wadden Sea (Germany), Arcachon Bay (France) and Ria Formosa (Portugal). Furthermore, we showed latitudinal gradients in seagrass cover, with higher cover in low latitudes and lower cover in high latitudes. Finally, an almost linear change in intertidal seagrass peak timing (day of the year of maximum seagrass cover) with latitude was found, with peak timing later the further south. This is a ‘Call-to-Action’ for data that are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). We present critical data for prioritising and developing policies, management and protection mechanisms across local, regional or international scales to safeguard these important ecosystems and the societies that depend upon them."

 Flood victims are often trapped inside buildings or stranded on rooftops, making their detection a critical aspect of effective rescue operations. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as an essential tool for disaster response, particularly in locating stranded individuals during flooding events. However, existing datasets do not specifically cater to this application, limiting the effectiveness of state-of-the-art (SOTA) object detection models in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, a novel public dataset called the NITC person rescue dataset is introduced. It consists of UAV-captured images of individuals stranded within buildings and on rooftops with two types of labels: bounding boxes and image captions. This dataset presents challenging environmental conditions that significantly impact the performance of pre-trained models. In particular, these models struggle with detecting individuals behind windows, highlighting the limitations of applying general-purpose object detection models to domain-specific tasks. This performance deterioration emphasizes the need for fine-tuning to adapt these models to specialized rescue scenarios. This work systematically evaluates various fine-tuning strategies and their effectiveness in improving model performance. The advantages of model-structure-based fine-tuning are illustrated using YOLOv9 and YOLOv11 as case studies. The best-performing model achieves an AP@50 of 87% for detecting person instances on unseen data. State-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), BLIP2 and Qwen2-VL are fine-tuned using ground-truth image captions to obtain meaningful descriptions of the seen."

 The vegetation greening trend resulting from afforestation in the Southwest China’s karst (SCK) area has attracted significant research attention. Identifying the interannual variation in net primary productivity (NPP), its sustained reaction to climate change, and differences between new and old forests before and after afforestation is vital in assessing the effect of the climate on the carbon sink potential of ecosystems. Using monthly NPP and climate data for 1981–2019, ensemble empirical mode decomposition was employed for the extraction of the interannual signal, and new and old forests were compared based on changepoint detection and forest-age data. According to the results, (1) NPP change significantly increased in 1981–2019; after 2001, the NPP growth rate in new forests was 1.47 times that in the old forests, indicating greater carbon sink potential. (2) NPP was sensitive to climate change on an interannual scale, and the sensitivity increased further after 2001. (3) Additionally, the main determinant of NPP in old and new forests shifted from precipitation to soil surface water content after 2001,which closely aligns with the implementation of large-scale ecological restoration projects. The findings reveal that afforestation reinforces water constraints and shifts the dominant climatic control, providing a basis for evaluation of ecological restoration effectiveness in the SCK area and supporting incorporation of water and carbon trade-offs into afforestation planning and routine forest management. This study also provides methodological and case-based support for conducting climate sensitivity assessments of afforestation initiatives across different countries and regions."

 Crop yield prediction at a fine spatial scale is crucial for improving agricultural management and resource allocations. Many countries and regions lack fine-scale yield data for fine-scale modeling and thus have to use a “cross-scale pathway”, where coarse-scale (e.g., state-level) data are used to train a model for fine-scale (e.g., county-level or field-level) yield predictions. However, the cross-scale pathway has limited effectiveness in predicting yield due to issues with data availability and model scalability. In this study, we quantify the benefits of transfer learning in the cross-scale pathway. We applied transfer learning by fine-tuning a previously trained and validated AI-based machine learning model, originally developed for field-level soybean yield predictions in the United States, using Brazilian state-level data to predict Brazilian municipal-level soybean yield. Despite differences in environmental conditions, crop phenology, and yield responses between the U.S. and Brazil, we show that transfer learning improves the municipal-level predictions from the cross-scale pathway by increasing the R2 from 0.29 (without transfer learning) to 0.44. Notably, this is achieved without using any municipal-level data and relying only on scarce state-level observations. When the municipal-level data were used, the transfer learning achieved an R2 of 0.57, the most stable high performance compared with previous studies. The effectiveness of the cross-scale pathway, thus, increases from 50% to 78% with transfer learning. These findings demonstrate the benefits of transfer learning in the cross-scale pathway under data-limited conditions, and underscore the potential for global crop yield predictions across scales."

 Slums are densely populated urban areas characterized by substandard housing and squalor. These areas often lack basic infrastructure and services, making them challenging to manage and improve. Mapping slums on a large scale is particularly difficult due to their complex, dynamic, and non-uniform nature and the scarcity of available data. This study employs deep learning and uncertainty estimation to map slum areas in 55 diverse cities. We tackle the issues of scarce labels, noisy labels, and class imbalance to produce reliable slum probability maps. Applied to a large dataset from the Global South, our method approximates probability values to each image, yielding a more granular view of slum morphology within each city. We achieve this by combining Monte Carlo sampling through test-time augmentation, test-time dropout on overlapping image tiles, and an ensemble of four CNNs. The resulting probability maps not only quantify prediction uncertainty but also reveal morphological patterns of slum settlements. Our findings underscore the diversity and complexity of slums, contributing to a more complete understanding of these environments. A key result is our large-scale workflow, which, despite limited data, groups predictions by probability into multiple slum categories defined by their morphological traits. This approach offers a substantial improvement over traditional binary slum classification methods that focus solely on typical slum morphologies."

 Deep learning (DL) methods have emerged as potential tools for automated landform mapping. However, current approaches frequently overlook critical topographic features and prior topographic knowledge, which are essential for accurate landform differentiation. Consequently, these approaches struggle to resolve indistinct class boundaries and misclassification in transitional landform zones. The application of transformer-based approaches to landform mapping remains rare, although these methods are well-suited for capturing global geomorphic patterns. In this study, we develop TKGFormer, a topographic knowledge-guided and transformer-based DL model specifically designed for landform classification. This model explicitly integrates terrain residuals and multi-scale terrain feature-guided attention mechanisms to emphasise key topographic features and improve classification accuracy. We introduce a topographic feature prior loss function, which constrains the learning process by enforcing consistency between predicted landform classes and fundamental terrain characteristics. Moreover, we design an efficient decoder to enhance multiscale feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that TKGFormer outperforms five CNN-based models and two transformer-based model in landform mapping by using bare Earth 30 m resolution Copernicus digital elevation data. In terms of mIoU, TKGFormer exhibits an improvement that ranges from 4.4 % to 20.7 % over the other models. The integration of topographic knowledge into DL provides a promising direction for improving the interpretability and reliability of automated landform classification."

 Existing police resource allocation relies on the prediction of historical crime hotspots, which is difficult to balance the overall effectiveness and regional fairness, resulting in an imbalance in the allocation of resources and difficulty in adapting to dynamic security needs. Taking Los Angeles as the study area, this study first constructs an XGBoost regression prediction model to quantify the future crime risk of each area based on the crime location and time information in the historical crime data, and then introduces the minimum regional disparity (MRD) constraint on the basis of which the fairness indicator is integrated into the optimization framework of patrol region allocation. Meanwhile, this study innovatively introduces a deep reinforcement learning method to improve the model’s solution efficiency and adaptability under complex constraints by interacting with the environment through a policy network. The experimental results show that the MRD fairness model significantly improves resource allocation fairness. Compared with the maximum coverage model, the Gini coefficient and coefficient of variation decrease by 42.56 % and 57.59 %, respectively, and the Jain’s fairness index simultaneously increases by 94.33 %. Regarding patrol region configuration, the proposed method decreases resource redundancy by 66.62 % and increases the spatial balance of facility distribution by 7.5 %, thereby effectively improving resource utilization and spatial layout rationality. Additionally, the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) strategy substantially reduces computational time compared to the classical mixed-integer programming solver, efficiently meeting dual constraints of fairness and coverage effectiveness. In summary, this study integrates MRD constraints and DRL to achieve equitable, efficient policing resource allocation, providing a practical and effective technical pathway for addressing fairness and efficiency demands."

 Recently developed documentation technologies in the science of aquatic ecosystems can provide a large volume of new data. Some sets of documentary data, although developed for a different purpose, can be used to increase the effectiveness of water management and possibly help to better protect riverscapes. Such a source of data is riverscape photos can be used to assess the state of the river environment. In our article, we attempted to assess the hydromorphological condition of rivers based on available riverscape photos in Google Street View (GSV). In accordance with the River Habitat Survey protocol, one of the classic methods of assessing the hydromorphological condition implemented worldwide, we assessed the parameters of the hydromorphological condition of 60 stretches of selected Polish rivers located in different regions of the country, having specific and different physiographic features (slope, flow velocity, discharge, degree of modification). Then, based on available multimedia materials (GSV photos), we independently assessed the same parameters affecting the class of the hydromorphological condition of rivers and performed a comparative statistical analysis. No statistically significant difference between the assessment of the hydromorphological river status using the standard RHS field protocol and the assessment using GSV (p values of the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test 0.19 – 0.98). Although the results require further verification on larger data sets, we see significant potential for using GSV in supplementing field methods of river hydromorphology assessment with this data. We postulate that in the absence of field analyses and with the availability of GSV materials or other photographic materials from rivers (e.g., citizen science), a reliable assessment of the hydromorphological state of rivers can still be made."

 Multirobot Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) has become a hot spot all over the world while there still exist some key issues to be addressed for collaborative mapping, especially for heterogenous platforms. This paper presents a self-designed LiDAR-inertial-mapping system on lightweight manned helmet and unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) platforms. A stable-triangular-descriptor-based place recognition method is proposed to detect overlap between varied field of view (FoV), followed by a Delaunay verification to restrain the global similarity. Based on the conjugated plane primitives across the platforms, bundle adjustment is derived to enhance the map consistency. All frames within the sliding window will be mutually constrained and optimized through the collective pose graph. Experiments on place recognition, pose estimation and point cloud mapping are conducted in different kinds of environments. Compared to other famous works (e.g. FastLIO2, LIOSAM, PointLIO), our system can attain the best results in almost all cases. The final improvements against them of mapping precision reach 15.71% with same LiDAR and 14.49% for heterogenous LiDARs on UGV. As for the helmet, this disparity varies from 0.6% for dataset with small intersection to 22.33% at most."

We focus on understanding these national-scale mining impacts in Côte d’Ivoire, which is a global biodiversity hotspot within the Upper Guinean Forests that has lost >80% of its forest cover since 1960. We combine high-resolution land-use maps with a staggered difference-in-differences approach to assess deforestation and degradation dynamics after mine openings in the Côte d’Ivoire tropical moist forest (TMF) zone between 2001 and 2020. We identify 446 mining clusters, which together directly caused the loss of 5631 ha of forest. We estimate that the total effects extended far beyond mine sites, causing an additional 4.8 percentage-point increase in deforestation within 5 km over 10 years compared to unmined areas. Crucially, for every hectare of deforested land directly cleared for mining, 163 ha were deforested for other, indirect end uses—primarily agricultural and urban expansion linked to mining activity. There was little evidence of significant increases in forest degradation triggered by mining. Our results demonstrate that the true environmental impact of mining vastly exceeds the mine footprint itself and underscores the grave threat that mining poses to moist tropical forests. We recommend the urgent development of national policies and revisions to the mining code to acknowledge the wide area of effect that mining creates, and embedding mitigation efforts to minimise spillover impacts into adjacent forests."

The awareness of the unsteady state of the deep ocean is a fairly recent achievement, but despite its pivotal role in the assessment of climate variability, the understanding of abyssal ocean dynamics remains largely unknown, primarily due to the scarcity of observations.

This study presents novel hierarchically porous TiO2-embedded polymeric optical fibers (TiO2–POFs) with a lotus-leaf-like bionic and micro/mesoporous structure for the removal of emerging contaminants (ECs). When coupled with UV-A LEDs and trace chlorine (5.0 mg/L), the system achieved a carbamazepine degradation rate constant of 0.0302 min–1 (1.167 cm2/μeinstein or 0.0143 cm2/mJ), which was 8.4 times that without chlorine, and a order of magnitude lower electrical energy per order (EE/O) of CBZ degradation (0.001 kWh/m3/order) compared to the median EE/O of the existing UVC-based AOPs. The enhancement was attributed to chlorine activation by photoinduced holes, electrons, and superoxide radicals, ultimately generating hydroxyl radicals (HO•), which were responsible for 99.4% of the degradation. The unique hydrophobic interface of TiO2–POFs confers a high affinity for hydrophobic pollutants and superior resistance to matrix quenching by hydrophilic natural organic matter. This enables the rapid degradation (within 2–5 min) of ECs at environmentally relevant (ng/L) levels in complex matrices like real tap water. The system maintained high activity after treating ∼454 L of tap water and exhibited excellent structural stability under an accumulated HO• exposure of ∼1.04 × 10–8 M·s. A 40% decrease was observed after high Cu2+ exposure, i.e., equivalent to treating 19,800 L of water due to copper oxide/hydroxide deposition. Simple acid washing using household vinegar or dilute nitric acid readily restores their activity. Furthermore, the process yielded less disinfection byproduct (DBP) compared to UV–C/chlorine due to the in situ adsorption and degradation of DBPs and their precursors. With its high selectivity, efficiency, safety, and stability, the UV-A-irradiated TiO2–POF chlorine process represents a highly promising strategy for safe and effective decentralized water purification."

MNPs can also adsorb other contaminants present in aquatic environments, and there is limited information on exposure scenarios involving MNP and pesticide mixtures. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation and chemical oxidation of MNPs can affect the sorption properties of MNPs and chemicals, thus altering the exposure and effects on fish. Our study investigated the toxicity and bioaccumulation of a lindane and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) mixture adsorbed onto pristine and weathered polyethylene (PE) MNPs. Three different PE MNP types were used: microplastics (2–10 μm), oxidized microplastics (10–15 μm), and a MNP mixture (0.2–9.9 μm), and additionally each type was UV-aged for comparisons. RTgutGC cells, derived from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) intestine, were used to evaluate the role of the particle type on pesticides bioaccumulation and toxicity. Results showed that UV aging did not affect the agglomeration in solution but decreased the MNP’s capacity to adsorb the pesticides (i.e., non-aged adsorbed 35% and 69% and UV-aged adsorbed 9.7% and 63% of lindane and DDE, respectively) likely due to a shift in MNPs hydrophobicity and consequently reduced the cytotoxicity of the pesticide MNPs mixture. Nanoplastics induced  approximately 20% more lysosomal damage than microplastics, suggesting a distinct toxicity mechanism. Fluorescently labeled MNPs accumulated in intestinal cells which confirmed the internalization. Finally, bioaccumulation of DDE decreased approximately 2 to 8-fold in cells coexposed with all particle types, although lindane was not detected in the cells. Overall, our study indicated that MP and NPs reduce bioavailability of pesticides, but UV aging and particle fragmentation to nano size increased their bioaccumulation and toxicity in fish intestinal cells."

This study enriched gut IRB from soil earthworms (Pheretima guillelmi) over three generations (189 days) with glucose and lactate as electron donors to investigate their impacts on arsenic reduction, methylation, and demethylation. Intestinal IRB was dominated by Clostridium (42%) and Bacillaceae spp. (25%) in glucose treatments and by Veillonellales-Selenomonadales spp. (34%) and Thermincola (19%) in lactate treatments. As(V) reduction and DMAs(V) demethylation mediated by IRB were detected during incubation, which was more efficient in glucose treatments than in lactate setups. However, no arsenic methylation was identified in all treatments. The dominant IRB in the earthworm gut, including Clostridium, Bacillus, and Paenibacillus, harbored genes involved in As(V) respiration (arrA), As(V) reduction (arsC, arsR, GstB, mgsR, and spxA), and arsenic efflux (ACR3, arsA, arsB, arsD, etc.).

Among 811 GMGs, we observed that PRKCE rs4953292 G > A was significantly associated with increased bladder cancer risk [odds ratio (OR) = 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03–1.37, Padj = 1.87 × 10–2] and exhibited an interaction effect with cigarette smoking (Pinteraction < 0.05).

We performed functional experiments using 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP)-treated bladder cancer cells and found that the rs4953292 A allele combined with 4-ABP decreased PRKCE expression levels in bladder cancer cells, which could upregulate PKG and phosphorylate VASP within the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, enhance glucose uptake, lactate generation, and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) to reprogram glycolysis, thus promoting bladder cancer susceptibility. This study elucidates that cigarette smoking-regulated PRKCE facilitates bladder cancer susceptibility by mediating glycolytic reprogramming through activating the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. The findings provide valuable predictors for bladder cancer susceptibility, aiding in prevention strategies."

Our preferred model suggests that the rupture involves asymmetric supershear ruptures, with stable rupture speeds following initial bilateral subshear propagation, as supported by the low frequency of aftershocks and high seismic radiation efficiency. The Burridge‐Andrews mechanism and free‐surface effects likely dominate the supershear transition. Moreover, the derived slip distribution exhibits segmentation in both extent and magnitude, with few shallow slip deficits, which correlate with the interseismic locking depth and slip rate. Our results demonstrate that data‐constrained dynamic rupture simulations offer valuable insights into the physical mechanisms governing complex earthquake rupture processes."

However, no significant changes in the orbital forcing were found at the two transitions, and the forcing was too small to drive these cycles. Here, a stochastic resonance model is proposed to resolve these two issues. Earth's radiative imbalance varies with temperature but is modulated by non‐stationary greenhouse gas concentrations leading to a persisting warm state (the inter‐glacials) and a colder state (the glacials) only in the Pleistocene. A noise that encodes volcanic eruptions and short‐term climate variations acts to trigger glacial‐interglacial jumps modulated by periodic orbital variations. The mid‐Pleistocene transition to the 100 kyr world is shown to be favored by a weakened noise amplitude. This formulation offers a unified view of Pliocene‐Pleistocene evolution that can be extended to hothouse and snowball climates."

 Optical heterostructures, which feature spatially heterogeneous optical properties at the subwavelength scale, represent a key frontier for next-generation integrated photonics and optoelectronics. While typically realized by joining dissimilar materials, achieving such heterogeneity in single-component systems has remained a fundamental challenge. Here, we report an intrinsic optical heterostructure in a uniform organic nanosheet, manifesting as strongly enhanced fluorescence in the inner zone compared to the outer zone. We demonstrate that this emission heterogeneity stems from a spatially localized solid-state transition in the central top layer, which transforms the initial single crystal into an out-of-plane twin structure and significantly enhances the radiative recombination efficiency. This transition is driven by the competitive interplay between molecule-substrate and intermolecular interactions, as corroborated by multiscale structural, optical, and theoretical analyses. Our findings not only establish a platform for realizing optical heterostructures in organic materials but also open avenues for exploring structural-dynamics-governed photonic phenomena, offering broad implications for future materials design and micro-optical applications.

 Synergistic-tuning the permselectivity and chemical stability of polymer membranes with a scalable method is an imminent demand for sustainable and energy-efficient organic solvent nanofiltration, but remains an intricate challenge. Here, we report a bifunctional molecular engineering strategy to fabricate sub-20 nm fluorinated polyamide nanofilms via scalable interfacial polymerization. Experiments and molecular simulations reveal that in situ incorporation of noncoplanar contorted segments with hydrophobic fluorine-rich pendants into a flexible hydrophilic polyamide backbone constructs a highly crosslinked 3D interconnected Janus microporous framework with rigid–flexible and hydrophilic–hydrophobic duality. This Janus structure instigates simultaneous control over the dissolution and migration of polar and nonpolar organic solvents. The resulting membranes exhibit enduring chemical stability, unprecedentedly high solvent permeance, and concomitantly low molecular weight cutoff, rivaling state-of-the-art membranes. This work provides a promising paradigm for the development of high-performance membranes to promote the sustainability of energy-intensive filtration of organic solvents over a wide range of solvent polarity.

 Bacteria have a variety of mechanisms for limiting predation by phages. SpbK is a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing antiphage defence protein from Bacillus subtilis that provides protection against the temperate phage SPβ via abortive infection. Here we structurally characterise SpbK and its interaction with the SPβ protein YonE. We demonstrate that SpbK is an NADase that produces both ADP-ribose (ADPR) and canonical cyclic ADPR with a N1-glycosidic bond (cADPR, also referred to as N1-cADPR). Combining cryo-EM, in silico predictions, site-directed mutagenesis, and phage infection assays, we show that formation of two-stranded head-to-tail assemblies of SpbK TIR domains is required for both NADase activity and antiphage defence. We also demonstrate that YonE is a dodecameric portal protein that activates the NADase function of SpbK by facilitating TIR domain clustering. Collectively, our results provide insight into how bacterial TIR NADases recognise phage infection. SpbK protects Bacillus subtilis from phage infection by depleting NAD⁺.

Here the authors show that variations in the number of incoming viral particles across cell types is a key factor of this decision, identifying entry efficiency as a key regulator of latency. 
 Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection results in either productive or latent infection, the latter enabling life-long viral persistence. Monocytes support latent infection but become permissive to productive infection upon differentiation into macrophages. These differentiation-driven differences have been largely attributed to chromatin-mediated repression of the viral genome. Using metabolic labeling of newly synthesized RNA, we observe markedly lower viral transcription at early stages of infection in monocytes compared to macrophages. Unbiased comparison reveals that this difference is partly explained by inefficient viral entry in monocytes: fewer viruses enter, and correspondingly, fewer genomes reach the nucleus. Indeed, ectopic expression of known HCMV entry receptors in monocytes enhances viral entry and enables productive infection, demonstrating that these cells can support full lytic replication if entry is efficient. We further identify integrin β3 as a differentiation-induced surface protein playing an important role in HCMV entry into macrophages, partially accounting for the observed differences in entry efficiency. Finally, we show that cells receiving fewer viral genomes are the ones that establish latent infection and have the capacity to reactivate. Overall, our findings reveal that entry is a previously unrecognized factor contributing to latent infection in monocytes, adding a critical layer to the paradigm of HCMV latency. HCMV infection can become productive or latent. Here the authors show that variations in the number of incoming viral particles across cell types is a key factor of this decision, identifying entry efficiency as a key regulator of latency."

Here the authors develop a multi-arm topological universal dynamic crosslinker platform to enable mechanical upcycling of incompatible mixed plastics. 
 Mechanical recycling of postconsumer plastics, especially incompatible mixed plastics, is often a downcycling process, resulting in brittle materials. Here we introduce a multi-arm universal dynamic crosslinker (UDC) platform to enable mechanical upcycling of incompatible mixed plastics. The topological UDC platform is based on readily accessible diazomalonate carbene precursors joined by dynamic siloxane linkages. It creates in situ star-like multiblock copolymer compatibilizing architectures from mixed plastics, irrespective of polymer types, and is compatible with reactive extrusion re/processing. Such architectures are credited for not only drastically enhancing creep resistance by two to four orders of magnitude but also improving the extensibility of polymer blends by up to 100-fold. By adjusting the topological UDC architecture and loading, broad property tunability between thermoset- and thermoplastic-like materials is achieved from mechanical upcycling of mixed apolar/polar plastics. This work provides a viable approach to improve the circularity of plastics. Mechanical recycling of incompatible mixed plastics is challenging, as it often downcycles plastics into brittle materials.

We examined how water temperature, salinity, and primary production change during the ice-free season along the Sept-Îles coast (Qc, Canada). We found seasonal variation of the parameters and peaks of primary production at specific depths and months. These results provide a baseline to track future environmental changes. 
 Coastal ecosystems are highly dynamic and vulnerable to both climate changes and anthropogenic pressures. The Sept-Îles region, located in the northwestern Gulf of St. Lawrence, is a high-use subarctic coastal system with diverse urban, industrial and maritime activities. This study presents analyses of monthly water column profiles at 35 sites focusing on temperature, salinity and chlorophyll fluorescence, used as a proxy of phytoplankton biomass, during the ice-free season. Using a conductivity, temperature and depth (CTD) sensor, water column profiles were collected from May to October 2022 along the coastline, at sites between 2- and 52- meters depth. Results revealed a thermocline developing in spring, intensifying in summer and disappearing in autumn. Chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations peaked below the thermocline in July, while secondary increases were recorded at the surface in September, consistent with observations of an autumn bloom in similar environments. These findings highlight the complex dynamic of physical and biological parameters in the coastal water column, and the importance of the timing of sampling to fully capture seasonal variability. To improve future research in the area, measuring nutrient concentrations would be essential for detecting potential upwelling events and better explaining phytoplankton variation during summer. This study provides a valuable baseline for future investigations and justifies the continuation of measurements of water column variability in the region, in the context of rapid climate change.

Despite its importance, the prevalence, controlling factors, and microbial mediators of sulfur-based denitrification in aquifers remain largely unknown. By integrating multiple stable isotopes and genome-resolved metagenomics, we investigated the coupling of nitrogen and sulfur cycling along the groundwater flowpath from unconfined to confined alluvial-lacustrine aquifers in the Poyang Lake Plain, China. Isotope (i.e., δ15N–NO3–, δ18O–NO3–, δ34S–SO42–, δ18O–SO42–, δ18O–H2O, δ13C-DIC, and δ13C-DOC) fractionation and hydrogeochemical trends indicated a transition from nitrification-dominated processes in the unconfined aquifer to denitrification, sulfide oxidation, and sulfate reduction in the confined aquifer. A significant negative correlation between δ34S–SO42– and δ15N–NO3–, along with a significant positive correlation between genes involved in sulfide oxidation and nitrate reduction, suggested cryptic coupling between sulfide oxidation and nitrate reduction. Sulfur-autotrophic denitrifying metagenome assembly genomes encoding Calvin–Benson–Bassham carbon fixation and rTCA pathways, such as Burkholderiales, Rhodocyclaceae, and Sulfurimonas, were enriched in the confined aquifer and co-occurred with sulfate reducers (Pseudomonadota and Desulfobacterota). These results highlighted sulfur cycling consortia when sulfate was reduced to facilitate removal of nitrate via sulfur-based denitrification.

Most studies evaluating MP safety use pristine particles or those aged for a short period, thus overlooking the long-term physicochemical changes that MPs undergo once they are trapped in tissues. In this study, we observed pronounced alterations in the surface properties of polystyrene MPs after one year of exposure to artificial body fluids, including increased surface roughness and hydrophilicity. These changes enhanced the adhesion of biomolecules, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a typical pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). Biomechanical analysis confirmed strong interactions between aged MPs and LPS. Once phagocytosed by macrophages, LPS-loaded aged MPs caused phagolysosomal damage and pyroptosis through noncanonical caspase-11 inflammasome activation, which in turn amplified canonical caspase-1-dependent inflammation. Importantly, the inflammatory impact of aged MPs was further validated in vivo in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model in which aged MPs aggravated disease severity. Collectively, these results identify aged MPs as “Trojan horses” with enhanced ability to transport harmful extracellular biomolecules like LPS into the cytoplasm, thereby reprogramming inflammasome signaling. This study highlights particulate stimuli, such as aged MPs, as a previously unrecognized bridge-linking PAMPs with danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)."

This study analyzed the dissemination pattern of pathogens from the gut of P. canaliculata to the aquatic environment. Combined with field surveys and mesocosm experiments, the impact of pathogens released by P. canaliculata on the native snail Cipangopaludina chinensis was evaluated. The direct lethal effects of the core bacterium on native snails were further demonstrated through in vivo and in vitro infection. Results show that 168 species of zoonotic pathogens existed in the gut of P. canaliculata, carrying 82 virulence factors and half of the high-risk antibiotic-resistant genes known to cause diseases. These pathogens released by P. canaliculata in the aquatic environment ultimately caused gut microbiota dysbiosis, mortality, and population decline in native snails, while it can be alleviated in the pathogen-limited P. canaliculata model. Aeromonas strains, the primary pathogen isolated from P. canaliculata, induced intestinal necrosis and death in native snails. Therefore, the release of pathogens is considered a previously overlooked invasion strategy of P. canaliculata, which poses a substantial public health threat within the One Health framework."

However, the mechanisms by which MPs interact with microbes during transit through soil animal digestive systems remain poorly understood. This study investigated the interactions between poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and polystyrene (PS) MPs and gut-derived microbes using a biomimetic earthworm gut model. PET and PS MPs exhibited distinct microbial colonization patterns, driven by their physicochemical properties. PET MPs, with rougher surfaces, preferentially adsorbed cocci such as Paraclostridium, fostering high-density but low-activity bacterial populations. Conversely, PS MPs, with smoother surfaces, enriched bacilli such as Raoultella, supporting low-density but high-activity bacterial communities. PET MPs facilitated rapid bacterial proliferation but lacked long-term stability, whereas PS MPs created persistent microenvironments that increased the ecological risk of pathogen retention and spread. The oxidative degradation of MPs during gut transit enhanced bacterial adhesion by forming reactive surface functionalities. MPs significantly altered microbial diversity and served as selective vectors for microbial dissemination into soil ecosystems, disrupting the microbial dynamics. These findings underscore the dual role of MPs as microbial scaffolds and ecological disruptors, providing critical insights into their ecological impacts and guiding strategies to mitigate MP contamination and pathogenic risks."

During pregnancy and early life, developing organisms are particularly vulnerable due to immature biological barriers and the dynamic nature of organogenesis. This review summarizes current evidence on maternal and early life exposure routes to MPs and NPs, including oral ingestion, inhalation, dermal contact, and transplacental transfer. Laboratory and epidemiological studies have demonstrated that microplastics can cross the placental barrier, potentially impairing placental function, altering fetal growth, and compromising pregnancy outcomes. Experimental data from animal models and in vitro systems suggest that maternal MP exposure may contribute to adverse neonatal development via multiple mechanisms including oxidative stress, inflammation, endocrine disruption, and epigenetic alterations. These toxicological pathways have been implicated in neurodevelopmental abnormalities, reproductive dysfunction, and immune dysregulation, often in a sex-dependent manner. Despite increasing experimental evidence, major knowledge gaps remain regarding human exposure levels, dose–response relationships, and long-term health implications. Future research should focus on improving detection sensitivity, establishing standardized exposure models, and developing targeted risk assessment frameworks to evaluate microplastic-associated health risks during pregnancy and early development."

We obtained daily mortality counts for all renal diseases, acute renal failure (ARF), and chronic kidney diseases (CKD) from 47 prefectures in Japan from 1979 to 2019. Heatwaves and cold spells were defined based on duration (2, 3, and 4 consecutive days) and intensity (95th, 97.5th, and 99th percentile thresholds for heatwaves and 5th and 2.5th percentile thresholds for cold spells) using prefecture-specific daily mean temperature percentiles. A two-stage time-stratified case-crossover analysis was conducted. Prefecture-specific estimates were derived in the first stage by comparing the risk on extreme event days to nonevent days, and the national-level estimate was obtained from a univariate random-effect meta-analytical model in the second stage. Added effects of heatwaves and cold spells were estimated by adjusting for mean temperatures in the first-stage models. Subgroup analyses by age (0–64, 65–84, and >85) and sex and temporal analyses across four subperiods were also conducted. The statistical significance of changes over time was checked by conducting pairwise comparisons between the risk estimates from the first (1979–1988) with the subsequent subperiods. Our study included 300,506 renal deaths during summer and 367,663 during winter. Heatwaves were associated with increased renal disease-related mortality where the highest relative risks (RRs) for renal mortality were observed at the 99th percentile threshold lasting for ≥4 days (99th, 4 days): RR = 1.07 (95% confidence interval: 1.05–1.17) for all renal causes, 1.17 (1.07–1.28) for ARF, and 1.11 (1.05–1.17) for CKD. Cold spells showed stronger effects, with the highest RRs at the 2.5th percentile threshold and 2-day duration: RR = 1.18 (1.11–1.25) for all renal mortality, 1.26 (1.01–1.58) for ARF, and 1.12 (1.01–1.25) for CKD. Added effects of heatwaves were observed, but not in the case of cold spells. Older adults aged 65 years and over are particularly vulnerable. Temporal analysis revealed a significant reduction in heatwave-associated mortality risk over time, suggesting possible adaptation. In conclusion, heatwaves and cold spells affect renal disease-related mortality, underscoring the necessity for comprehensive strategies to mitigate the health impacts of changing climate on renal health."

New self‐calibrating instruments may solve a long‐time issue of instrument drift, allowing new high precision observations.

Here we present evidence for likely settling of two self‐calibrating instruments deployed along the RAPID mooring array, on the order of 8–14 cm. Settling is expected, and we model the settling based on Terzaghi's consolidation theory, which is well known in civil engineering applications. After the settling correction the difference between the two pressure records has a standard deviation of ∼1 cm water height equivalent. Settling is likely an important factor that should be considered in oceanographic and geodetic experimental design.

Associations between weather parameters and stroke‐related outcomes were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Among 1,349 stroke cases (mean age 61 ± 13 years; 53% male), 65% were ischemic strokes. Stroke incidence peaked during the long rainy season (p = 0.053). Severe strokes were associated with the long dry season (OR = 1.88), low precipitation (OR = 1.74), and low sunshine (OR = 0.62), while the long rainy season was inversely associated with severity (OR = 0.60).

 The ferroelectric to antiferroelectric phase transition in perovskite structures and its underlying mechanism form the physical foundation for numerous applications such as high-performance energy storage, ultrafast information storage, and electrocaloric refrigeration. Understanding of ferroelectric to antiferroelectric phase transition, especially the description of the transition dynamic process, is crucial for material design and device reliability enhancement. Most of the previous studies demonstrated that ferroelectric to antiferroelectric phase transition are first-order transitions driven by atomic rearrangement, generally regarded as prototypical fast kinetic processes. Here, we report an irreversible ferroelectric to antiferroelectric phase transition at low temperatures in Pb(Zr0.97Ti0.03)O3 as seen by neutron diffraction patterns. The in-situ variable-temperature transmission electron microscopy reveals that the ferroelectric to antiferroelectric phase transition exhibits relaxation behavior and is a slow diffusional dynamic process, which corrects the previous understanding. Density functional theory simulations reveals that the irreversible transition behavior is due to variation of the transition energy barrier with temperature. Based on Density functional theory and experimental data, a multiscale phase-field model was developed to describe the transition dynamics and provide the theory limitation for the rate of ferroelectric to antiferroelectric phase transition in Pb(Zr0.97Ti0.03)O3 at low temperatures, offering a physical basis for future material applications and device design.

 We move our eyes and head to sample the visual environment. While these movements are essential for survival, they greatly complicate the analysis of retinal image motion. Our brain must account for the visual consequences of self-motion to perceive the 3D layout and motion of objects in a scene. We show that traditional models of visual compensation for eye movements fail when the eye both translates and rotates, and we propose a theory that computes both motion and depth in more natural viewing geometries. Consistent with our theoretical predictions, humans exhibit distinct perceptual biases when different viewing geometries are simulated by optic flow, and these biases occur without training or feedback. A neural network model trained to perform the same tasks suggests that viewing geometry modulates the joint tuning of neurons for retinal and eye velocity to mediate these adaptive computations. Our findings unify previously separate bodies of work by demonstrating that the brain adaptively perceives the dynamic 3D environment according to viewing geometry inferred from optic flow. People typically perceive the motion and depth of objects correctly even during walking or running, when visual inputs change markedly. The authors show that this accurate perception is achieved by inferring the observer’s viewing geometry from optic flow."

Here, the authors show that GlpG is essential for the assembly of type 1 pili, a virulence factor required for colonization of bacteria in eukaryotic cells. 
 With the rise in antimicrobial resistance, understanding the virulence factors utilized by pathogenic E. coli is essential for the development of alternative therapeutics. While previous work has shown that disruption of the E. coli rhomboid protease gene glpG leads to defects in bacterial colonization, here we provide mechanistic insight into the loss of fitness. We show GlpG is essential for the assembly of type 1 pili, a virulence factor required for the colonization of eukaryotic cells. Since pili are critical for biofilm formation and bacterial persistence, the absence of GlpG proteolytic activity reduces the production of biofilm. Working towards new potential antimicrobial targets for treating infections, we show that biofilm formation is hampered by GlpG inhibition. Our data demonstrates that GlpG plays a key role in protein quality control of type 1 pili and alters the paradigm for GlpG proteolysis, previously implicated in the cleavage of only membrane embedded substrates. The disruption of the rhomboid protease gene glpG in E. coli leads to defects in bacterial colonization.

 Magnetic random-access memory (MRAM) provides a promising candidate for the next-generation memory technology with high-energy efficiency and fast operation speed. Spin splitting band structure in nonrelativistic collinear antiferromagnet with de-coupled crystal and spin symmetry provides a unique way for the flexible and efficient control of the polarization and flow directions of the spin current. Here, by integrating the potential altermagnetic (101)-RuO2 writing channel with the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) device, we demonstrate the all-electrical field-free altermagnetic spin splitting torque (SST)-driven switching of the perpendicular-MTJ in the 3-terminal altermagnetic SST-MRAM device, with the tilted spin polarization and the transversal flow of the spin current. The z-spin torque is further characterized by the altermagnetic SST-induced shift of the magnetic hysteresis loop, and the field-free altermagnetic SST-driven magnetic domain switching of the recording layer is directly observed by the magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) microscope. Our research establishes groundwork for advancing the development of the altermagnetic SST-MRAM, paving the way for the future all-electrical, energy-efficient and high-endurance MRAM applications with separated writing/reading channels.

 Idiopathic short stature (ISS) remains a major pediatric challenge with unclear causes and inconsistent responses to growth hormone therapy. Here we show that plasma exosomes from children with ISS contain elevated hsa-miR-17-3p that disrupts growth signaling and impairs cartilage cell proliferation. Elevated miR-17-3p suppresses ZNF148/SOS1 signaling, linking molecular dysfunction to dietary exposure in ISS. To investigate environmental triggers, we developed a capsaicin-rich diet rat model that recapitulates ISS, showing normal Gh/Igf-1 levels but elevated plasma miR-17-3p. The diet induced mild gut inflammation, increasing miR-17-3p in intestinal and plasma exosomes. Fecal samples from ISS children exhibited similar elevations in miR-17-3p and inflammatory markers, linking spicy diets to ISS pathogenesis. Finally, engineered exosomes designed to silence miR-17-3p, combined with localized growth hormone therapy, restored growth plate function. These findings uncover a diet-driven exosome axis underlying ISS and suggest new therapeutic strategies for children in high-capsaicin regions.

 Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) are a 32-member family of Class B GPCRs that have diverse cellular roles including mechanosensation, cell-fate determination, neurodevelopment, immune function and tumour biology. ADGRL4 is upregulated in the tumour microenvironment and is implicated in tumour pathogenesis across a broad range of malignancies. Inhibiting ADGRL4 is a potential therapeutic treatment for currently intractable cancers such as glioblastoma. Previous work suggested that ADGRL4 does not signal through G protein coupled pathways. However, using a sensitive bioluminescent assay, we demonstrate here that ADGRL4 couples weakly to the heterotrimeric G protein Gq, whilst there is no robust coupling to other G proteins (Gs, G12, Go) or β-arrestin 1 or 2. We determine the cryo-EM structure of ADGRL4 coupled to a heterotrimeric Gq complex to a resolution of 3.1 Å. The overall fold of ADGRL4 is similar to that of other aGPCRs, but the coupling to Gq is distinct with fewer interactions between the receptor and G protein. The structure is consistent with ADGRL4 being activated by its tethered agonist and represents an important step towards the development of potential inhibitors for the treatment of multiple tumour types.

Here, the authors introduce this unique coupling into the polariton system and demonstrate topological polariton condensation in lattices with negative coupling. 
 Coupling between quantum or classical degrees of freedom underpins a wide range of physical phenomena, from condensed matter systems to engineered photonic lattices. While positive coupling arising naturally from evanescent interactions has been extensively studied and employed, negative coupling unlocks unique phenomena that are challenging to realize with positive coupling alone. Exciton-polariton micropillars, celebrated for enabling topological lasers, reservoir computing, and quantum simulations, have primarily relied on positive coupling. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate negative coupling between two micropillars using an additional larger micropillar. By combining positively and negatively coupled micropillars, we construct a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) topological lattice with a significant topological gap of approximately 15 meV, where band inversion occurs at the center of the Brillouin zone (BZ), rather than at the edges as in conventional SSH lattices. Under non-resonant excitation, we achieve polariton condensation in the in-gap topological edge states at room temperature. Our study introduces a universal method to realize negative coupling in polariton systems, paving the way for novel polaritonic devices based on lattices with arbitrarily controlled coupling signs. Negative coupling is an intriguing mechanism for linking lattice sites, enabling phenomena unattainable with positive coupling alone.

 The cell-free biogenesis of the protein translation machinery is essential for the creation of a self-regenerating synthetic cell. Here, we demonstrate the autonomous and simultaneous biogenesis of all thirty proteins of the translation machinery of E. coli in a reconstituted transcription-translation system. We first establish self-regeneration of every translation protein by determining the threshold concentration required for its own synthesis from a synthetic gene coding for the protein, thereby demonstrating the functionality of all nascent proteins, separately. Simultaneous biogenesis of multiple translation proteins at their threshold results in delayed synthesis below detection levels. To achieve self-regeneration of multiple translation proteins, we induce boundary-free compartmentalization of the reaction by immobilizing the genes on a surface at high density. The co-localization of genes, molecular machinery, messenger RNA and nascent proteins at the surface create sufficient conditions to catalyze the simultaneous self-regeneration of sub-groups up to all thirty translation proteins, as measured by total internal reflection fluorescence on the surface. Our approach provides mechanistic insight and presents a general methodology for the biogenesis of cellular machines toward autonomous synthetic systems.

 Conventional approaches to policy design often neglect the plasticity of citizens’ beliefs and values upon which policy effectiveness and political sustainability depend. A consequence, by way of illustration, is that environmental policies may crowd out pre-existing green values. Our representative survey of 3,306 Germans finds that enforced restrictions to promote carbon-neutral lifestyles would trigger strong negative responses because they ‘restrict freedom’. This is true even among those who would adopt green lifestyles when voluntary, thus possibly undermining support for green political movements. These results combined with the long-term political consequences of the polarizing reactions to Covid mandates motivate a new approach to climate policy design. We set aside the conventional economic model assuming self-interested citizens, in which there could be no green values to crowd out. Instead, we propose a dynamic approach recognizing that (1) to succeed, essential policies including bans, carbon taxes and the promotion of new technologies must be both implementable and politically sustainable, entailing (2) a critical role for citizens’ green values, which (3) may be either diminished or cultivated, depending on policy design.

 The carbon use efficiency (CUE) of soil microbes is defined as the proportion of assimilated carbon (C) allocated to microbial growth than lost through respiration. CUE is a critical parameter in soil C cycling, and its response to external nutrient inputs (including nitrogen [N], phosphorus [P], and combined NP) could determine the change of soil C pool. However, the general pattern of CUE response to nutrient addition remains unclear. By conducting a global meta-analysis of 427 observations, we found that the nutrient addition had no significant overall effect on CUE, whether in the overall nutrient addition experiments or in experiments with different types of nutrient addition. The response of CUE to N addition was regulated by duration, with long-term addition (>10 year) leading to a decrease in CUE. We identified the aridity index as the most important predictor influencing CUE in response to N addition, while ecosystem type was the most key variable for CUE response to both P and NP additions. Global predictions showed future N inputs tends to enhance CUE across most regions, especially in cropland ecosystems. Overall, the effect of nutrient addition on CUE was relatively minor, providing key microbial evidence for understanding future soil C dynamics.

 Agricultural irrigation, energy use, and carbon emissions are interconnected, creating challenges for sustainable food production under climate and resource pressures. Optimizing irrigation water allocation is essential for improving productivity and reducing environmental impacts. Here, we develop a high-resolution water-food-energy-carbon optimization framework that allocates irrigation water across space and time to enhance resource efficiency in China. We combine multi-source observational and satellite datasets and examine future crop distribution scenarios to estimate irrigation demand and evaluate alternative allocation strategies. The framework quantifies effects on water productivity, yield stability, energy requirements, and greenhouse gas intensity. We find that increasing irrigation water productivity reduces energy consumption per unit of yield by about 37 percent and lowers carbon intensity by about 13 percent. Integrating irrigation with low-carbon energy further decreases energy use to about 190 kilowatt-hours per hectare. These findings show the potential of precision irrigation to support sustainable and lower-carbon agricultural development in China.

Density functional theory calculations coupled with computational spatial interaction mapping evidenced the formation of the quintet ferryl ion-cysteine 46 cluster. Hence, inactivation appears to have been accompanied by nonproteolytic capsid damages induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Evidence also pointed to possible ROS interactions with arginine 49 and tryptophan 32 residues. The α‐helixβ‐sheet ratio of viral protein secondary structures quantified by deconvoluting the amide I region of infrared spectra strongly and negatively correlated with inactivation, carbonyl group content, and MALDI-TOF-MS-derived protein alterations.

We critically evaluate state-of-the-art experimental and computational models, from brain organoids to microphysiological systems, advocating for an integrated systems toxicology approach. Leveraging time-series multiomics and dynamic network modeling is essential to identify mechanistic thresholds and assess potential transgenerational risks.

We then further considered these research needs through facilitated focus group discussions and identified priority research questions through a consensus process during an in-person synthesis workshop. These key questions included technical and management topics, which were partitioned among six research categories: treatment, performance, and resource recovery; resiliency, efficacy, and sustainability; environmental quality and public health; assessment, monitoring, and operation and maintenance; implementation; and regulations, enforcement, and environmental justice.

In this study, we analyzed 229 blood and 227 fecal samples using pyrolysis-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry to quantify microplastic exposure and identify key influencing factors through machine learning modeling. Seven polymer types were detected in both biological matrices, including polyethylene, poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), polypropylene, polystyrene, polyamide 66, poly(ethylene terephthalate), and poly(methyl methacrylate), with polyethylene, PVC, and polystyrene being the most prevalent. A significant negative correlation was observed between blood and fecal PVC levels, while other polymers showed no significant intermatrix association. Demographic, lifestyle, socioeconomic, and dietary information were collected via questionnaires. Age, sex, geographic, and indoor environmental variations in microplastic levels were observed. Machine learning models were developed to predict microplastic levels from anthropometric measurements and questionnaire data. Explainable AI tools revealed that the drinking water source was the strongest predictor of blood PVC levels. Socioeconomic factors, including income and education, were also significant predictors, with lower-income individuals showing higher microplastic burdens.

By integrating basic hydrological and biogeochemical data, this study systematically compares the occurrence and behavior of traditional and emerging PFAS in full-depth seawater and surface sediments across the coastal East China Sea (ECS) during summer and winter. Waterborne PFAS consistently exhibited nearshore-to-offshore decreasing gradients and surface enrichment in both seasons, highlighting persistent terrestrial inputs. Notably, summer concentrations were generally lower, with weaker negative correlations with salinity, likely due to enhanced freshwater discharge during the wet season, which diluted and dispersed PFAS more effectively. Seasonal reversal of coastal currents driven by the monsoon further modulated the contaminant transport pathways. In contrast, sediment PFAS concentrations were generally higher in the summer, which can be attributed to stronger vertical mixing in the winter that facilitates the remobilization of contaminants. Enhanced sediment resuspension during the winter also promoted greater partitioning of PFAS, especially hydrophilic short-chain compounds, into the aqueous phase.

Here, we conducted a comprehensive field assessment at a representative Porphyra (nori) mariculture farm in coastal China, where we monitored multisphere carbon pools across the water-column, sediments, atmosphere, and biomass. Multivariate statistical analysis and machine-learning models were used to identify stage-specific drivers and project carbon-pool responses under multiple warming scenarios. Our results demonstrate that Porphyra cultivation delivers substantial carbon-sequestration benefits, as it significantly enhances atmospheric CO2 sequestration and sedimentary carbon burial. Concurrently, the system consistently releases dissolved organic carbon (DOC), of which 48–54% was transformed into long-lived refractory DOC. High-temporal-resolution monitoring reveals highly dynamic carbon pools across cultivation stages, with dominant controls on net sequestration shifting from inorganic-carbon uptake and hydrodynamics during early growth to biologically mediated processes at peak biomass. Simulations across climate-change scenarios indicate that although inorganic pools were more temperature-sensitive than organic pools, changes across all major pools under projected warming over the coming decades remain within 5%, underscoring strong resilience to warming. Together, these process-based insights support the integration of macroalgal mariculture into blue-carbon action plans and carbon-offset initiatives."

This study assessed the dose-dependent impacts of PLA-MPs on black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) and uncovered underlying mechanisms using integrated whole-larva transcriptomic, antioxidant enzymatic, gut microbial, and metabolomic analyses. Low PLA-MP exposure (1% w/w) significantly promoted larval performance, increasing body weight by 33% and waste reduction index by 12%. These improvements were linked to activated nutrient-utilization pathways, enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities mitigating mild oxidative stress, and enrichment of beneficial gut microbes, supporting gut homeostasis. In contrast, high PLA-MP exposure (5% w/w) suppressed growth, reducing body weight by 15.3% and survival by 10.86%. These adverse outcomes were driven by excessive oxidative stress and disrupted energy metabolism, which induced detoxification responses. Consistently, the 5% group showed a transition from deterministic to stochastic gut microbial assembly and enrichment of opportunistic pathogens. Overall, this study clarifies the contrasting biological effects of PLA-MPs on BSFL and provides essential insight into evaluating biodegradable microplastics in organic waste treatment systems."

This study integrates human epidemiological data with experimental models to elucidate these pathways and identify potential therapeutic targets. First, in a cross-sectional study of Mn-exposed workers, we observed elevated serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and dysregulated expression of mRNAs related to AA metabolism, both of which were identified as important mediators between Mn exposure and cognitive impairment. In mouse models, multilevel analyses combining behavioral assays, striatal transcriptomics, and oxidized lipid metabolomics demonstrated that Mn exposure triggers microglial activation, disrupts AA metabolic pathways, and drives neuroinflammation, culminating in cognitive impairment. A central finding was the downregulation of 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), an endogenous PPARγ ligand with strong anti-inflammatory properties, in both human serum and the mouse striatum following Mn exposure. Furthermore, bioinformatics and molecular docking nominated MMP9 (Matrix metalloproteinase-9) as a potential key target, which we functionally validated by showing that MMP9 knockdown in BV2 microglia attenuated Mn-induced inflammatory responses. Finally, we confirmed the therapeutic potential of 15d-PGJ2 by demonstrating its efficacy in suppressing these adverse outcomes in vitro. Our findings establish that 15d-PGJ2 deficiency and AA metabolic dysregulation are important mechanisms in Mn neurotoxicity, and we identify MMP9 as a contributor to this process, revealing potential targets for intervention."

Despite their promise as a nature‐based climate solution that can enhance soil carbon storage, cover crops remain underutilized, in part due to farmer perceptions that benefits are not assured and management risk is high. This scoping review synthesizes research from multiple disciplines to identify persistent knowledge gaps that limit both the effectiveness and sustained adoption of cover cropping. We focus on Midwestern US agroecosystems, where scientists generally agree that cover cropping has the potential to increase soil organic carbon and contribute to long‐term carbon sequestration. Our synthesis reveals critical challenges across domains: carbon outcomes are highly variable across space and time; water and nutrient dynamics exhibit tradeoffs and context dependence; economic returns remain difficult to quantify; and adoption patterns are shaped by feedbacks between perceived risk, observed outcomes, system constraints, and social factors such as norms and identity. We use Ostrom's social‐ecological systems framework to structure our analysis across biophysical, economic, and social domains, linking scientific uncertainty to real‐world implementation barriers. The review culminates in a set of research priorities designed to advance transdisciplinary work on cover cropping, clarify its climate mitigation potential, improve the design of private and public interventions, and support adaptive management."

Marlier,Choice of Downscaled Climate Product Matters: Projections of Valley Fever Seasonality in a Warming Climate,"Downscaled climate projections provide valuable information needed to better understand the impacts of climate change on health outcomes and to inform adaptation and mitigation strategies at local to regional scales. Because downscaled climate products vary in their representations of fine‐scale spatiotemporal patterns, due to of multiple interacting factors, epidemiologic analyses need to consider how differences across downscaling approaches impact projections of health impacts into the future. We evaluate the projected seasonality of coccidioidomycosis in response to projected temperature and precipitation estimated using global climate models from CMIP6 included in California's Fifth Climate Change Assessment, downscaled using two approaches: (a) dynamical downscaling using the Weather Research and Forecasting model; and (b) hybrid statistical downscaling using the Localized Constructed Analogs approach. Our results indicate that by end of century, coccidioidomycosis transmission is projected to start earlier, end later, and last longer across the California endemic region; however, the magnitude of these changes varies by downscaling method. Specifically, LOCA2‐hybrid projected a season onset that is 4.2 weeks earlier and an end that is 4.1 weeks later than historical conditions, while the dynamical approach projected a 4 week earlier onset and a 3.8 week later end compared to the historical period. Overall, the LOCA2‐hybrid product estimates that the transmission season will last about 0.3 weeks longer than what is projected using dynamical downscaling by end of century. This analysis highlights the sensitivity of coccidioidomycosis seasonality projections to choice of downscaling product, underscoring the need to account for these differences in mitigation and adaptation planning."

 Multifold topological semimetals host fermions with opposite chiralities at topological band crossings1–3. Chiral fermionic transport in topological systems often relies on high magnetic fields or magnetic dopants to suppress trivial transport and create an imbalance in occupancy of opposite Chern-number states4,5. Here we use the quantum geometry6,7 of topological bands to filter fermions by chirality into distinct Chern-number-polarized states. This allows for the real-space separation of currents with opposite fermionic chiralities, which we have demonstrated by observing their quantum interference in the absence of any magnetic field. Devices fabricated from single-crystal PdGa in a three-arm geometry exhibit quantum-geometry-induced anomalous velocities8,9 of chiral fermions, thereby exhibiting a nonlinear Hall effect. The resultant transverse chiral currents with opposite anomalous velocities are thereby spatially separated into the outer arms of the device. These chiral currents in opposing Chern number states also carry orbital magnetizations with opposite signs. The mesoscopic phase coherence of these chiral currents facilitated their quantum interference10 in a Mach–Zehnder interferometer. Our findings establish a chiral fermionic valve that exhibits three key properties: spatially separates chiral fermions into Chern-number polarized states by using their quantum geometry, enables tuneable current-induced magnetization and provides a platform for controllable quantum interference of chiral quasiparticles using an electric current and magnetic field. Fermionic currents of opposing chirality can be spatially filtered without the need for a magnetic field using the quantum geometry of topological bands in single-crystal PdGa."

 Despite successes in replicating the primary–secondary–tertiary structure hierarchy of protein, it remains elusive to synthetically materialize protein functions that are deeply rooted in their chemical, structural and dynamic heterogeneities1–12. We propose that for polymers with backbone chemistries different from that of proteins, programming spatial and temporal projections of sidechains at the segmental level can be effective in replicating protein behaviours13,14; and leveraging the rotational freedom of polymer can mitigate deficiencies in monomeric sequence specificity and achieve behaviour uniformity at the ensemble level2,3,15–20. Here, guided by the active site analysis of about 1,300 metalloproteins, we design random heteropolymers (RHPs) as enzyme mimics based on one-pot synthesis. We introduce key monomers as the equivalents of the functional residues of protein and statistically modulate the chemical characteristics of key monomer-containing segments, such as segmental hydrophobicity21. The resultant RHPs form pseudo-active sites that provide key monomers with protein-like microenvironments, co-localize substrates with catalytic or cofactor-binding sidechains and catalyse reactions such as oxidation and cyclization of citronellal with isopulegol/menthoglycol selectivity. This RHP design led to enzyme-like materials that can retain catalytic activity under non-biological conditions, are compatible with scalable processing and have expanded substrate scope, including environmentally long-lasting antibiotic tetracycline22.

 Wearable healthcare electronics are rapidly emerging as a distinct electronics sector in the digital era1–6, offering substantial economic opportunities and crucial medical benefits. However, their interactions with environmental and social systems remain poorly understood7–9, leaving critical sustainability challenges unaddressed. Although current efforts have focused on material-level improvements, broader system-level dynamics remain unexplored. Here we present an integrated systems engineering framework based on de novo life-cycle inventories and diffusion-linked scaling to quantify global eco-footprint hotspots and identify effective mitigation strategies. Cradle-to-grave analysis of representative wearable healthcare electronics (glucose, cardiac and blood pressure monitors and diagnostic imagers) generates full-spectrum environmental impact metrics, identifying warming impacts of 1.1–6.1 kgCO2-equivalent per device. The global device consumption is projected to increase 42-fold by 2050, approaching 2 billion units annually and generating 3.4 MtCO2-equivalent emissions alongside ecotoxicity and e-waste issues. Contrary to the conventional sustainability emphasis on plastics, this work demonstrates that recyclable or biodegradable plastics offer only marginal benefits, whereas substituting critical-metal conductors and optimizing circuit architectures can significantly reduce impacts without compromising performance. This systems engineering-based life-cycle assessment framework holds promise for establishing ecologically responsible innovation in next-generation wearable electronics.

 For the MHC, MR1 and CD1 systems, antigen recognition involves contact of the membrane distal surfaces of both the αβ T cell receptor (TCR) and the antigen-presenting molecule. Whether other antigen display mechanisms by antigen-presenting molecules operate remains unknown. Here, we report mass spectrometry analyses of endogenous lipids captured by CD1c when bound to an autoreactive αβ TCR. CD1c binds twenty-six lipid species with bulky headgroups that cannot fit within the tight TCR-CD1c interface. We determined the crystal structures of CD1c presenting several gangliosides, revealing a general mechanism whereby two lipids, rather than one, are bound in the CD1c cleft. Bulky lipids are oriented sideways so that their polar headgroups protrude laterally through a side portal of the CD1c molecule - an evolutionarily conserved structural feature. The sideways-presented ganglioside headgroups do not hinder TCR binding and so represent a mechanism that allows autoreactive TCR recognition of CD1c. In addition, ex vivo studies showed that the sideways-presented gangliosides can also represent TCR recognition determinants. These findings reveal that CD1c simultaneously presents two lipid antigens from the top and side of its cleft, a general mechanism that differs markedly from other antigen-presenting molecules.

 Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infections are a leading cause of diarrheal illness, responsible for an estimated 100,000 deaths annually. ETEC pathogenesis is driven by various virulence factors, including toxins, adhesins, and noncanonical factors such as the protease EatA. The first line of host defense against intestinal pathogenic bacterial infections is the protective intestinal mucus layer. Here, we demonstrate the mechanism by which EatA degrades the core mucus component MUC2, thereby facilitating access to the epithelial cell surface and promoting infection. We identify the specific cleavage site region localized at the C-terminal of MUC2. EatA’s protease activity depends on the interaction between two distinct, uniquely spaced domains in human MUC2, which defines species specificity. We confirm this using a novel transgenic mouse model exclusively expressing human MUC2, which allows us to study the role of the mucus layer in the infection by human intestinal pathogens. These findings highlight how ETEC is adapted to specifically degrade the mucus layer of its human host.

 Li-ion batteries, widely used in electronic devices, electric vehicles, and aviation, demand high energy density, fast charging capabilities, and broad operating temperature ranges. Computations combined with experiments have gained increasing attention for electrolyte development. However, the inherent complexity of electrolytes poses a significant challenge. Classical molecular dynamics often fails due to inaccuracies in force field parameters, while ab initio calculations are limited by high computational costs. Recently, machine learning molecular dynamics has emerged as an efficient and accurate alternative. However, its application is hindered by limited transferability of machine learning potentials. In this work, we developed a universal machine learning potential for electrolytes using an iterative training approach on randomly composed datasets, enabling the accurate computation of key properties for a broad range of electrolytes via molecular dynamics. Furthermore, coordination dynamics analysis of Li ion, by quantifying the coordination lifetime, provides a direct, quantitative measure of solvation strength. The universal machine learning potential for electrolytes facilitates the prediction and optimization of electrolyte properties, offering a powerful tool for electrolyte design.

By directly binding phosphatidylcholine and specific translocon components, SigmaR1 maintains protein and lipid homeostasis; its loss triggers lipid droplet accumulation in hepatic cells. 
 Sigma Non-Opioid Intracellular Receptor 1 (SigmaR1) is a member of the sigma family of receptors that interacts with a variety of psychotomimetic drugs and is involved in a wide range of cellular and physiological functions. Despite its increasing importance in human physiology and disease, the subcellular localization of SigmaR1 and its molecular function remain poorly defined. Using endogenous tagging and cell fractionation, we show that SigmaR1 is a type II integral ER membrane protein that is specifically enriched at ER sheets. A short region at the N-terminus of SigmaR1 promotes its ER-sheet localization. Importantly, our biochemical studies demonstrate that SigmaR1 directly interacts with components of the translocon complex including TRAPα and Nicalin. In addition, we found that a β-barrel at the C-terminal of SigmaR1 binds phosphatidylcholine (PC), and the binding of PC strengthens the association of SigmaR1 with the translocon complex. SigmaR1 knockout systematically impaired cellular protein and lipid homeostasis, resulting in accumulation of lipid droplets in hepatocytes. Collectively, we propose that SigmaR1 is an auxiliary translocon factor that binds lipids to regulate protein and lipid droplet homeostasis, which may underlie the broad and vital roles of SigmaR1 in physiology and disease.

 Quartz optical fibers are brittle, difficult to repair, and lack reconfigurability, limiting their adaptability in underwater communication. To overcome these impediments, here we show reconfigurable all-liquid optical fibers (RAOFs) produced by structured liquid, tuned by the interfacial assembly and jamming of nanoparticle surfactants at the water-oil interface (interfacial tension <10 mN m-1, refractive index contrast of 0.083). These RAOFs combine the structural stability of the interfacial assemblies with the inherent flexibility of liquids. They support real-time communication on an Ethernet platform (up to 1 Gbps), providing a practical alternative to conventional optical fibers for optical interconnects. Their liquid nature enables broken fibers to be repaired rapidly by a coalescence process. Their softness affords on-demand reconfigurability that enables in-situ fabrication of reconfigurable optical fibers and dynamic manipulation of signal transmission. RAOFs provide a versatile, self-healing, and resilient solution for optical communication systems in dynamic environments. Reconfigurable all-liquid optical fibers enable gigabit-speed communication while offering softness, rapid self-healing, and on-demand reconfiguration, providing a resilient alternative to brittle quartz fibers in dynamic application environments."

 Emerging research has highlighted that artificial intelligence-based multimodal fusion of digital pathology and transcriptomic features can improve cancer diagnosis (grading/subtyping) and prognosis (survival risk) prediction. However, such direct fusion is impractical in clinical settings, where histopathology remains the gold standard and transcriptomic tests are rarely requested in public healthcare. We experiment on two publicly available multimodal datasets, The Cancer Genomic Atlas and the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium, spanning four independent cohorts: glioma-glioblastoma, renal, uterine, and breast, and observe significant performance gains in gradation and risk estimation (p-value  < 0.05) when incorporating synthesized transcriptomic data with WSIs. Also, predictions using synthesized features were statistically close to those obtained with real transcriptomic data (p-value  > 0.05), consistently across cohorts. Here we show that with our diffusion based crossmodal generative AI model, PathGen, gene expressions synthesized from digital histopathology jointly predict cancer grading and patient survival risk with high accuracy (state-of-the-art performance), certainty (through conformal coverage guarantee) and interpretability (through distributed co-attention maps).

The findings pave the way for microbiome-aware dietary strategies for autism. 
 Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is linked to both altered gut microbiota and unhealthy diets; however, the mechanistic connections remain elusive. In this study, we conducted a systematic analysis of fecal microbiome metagenomic data, paired with granular dietary assessments and phenotypic profiles, across a cohort of 818 children (462 with ASD, 356 without ASD; mean age = 8.4 years; 27.3% female). By integrating dietary indices, nutrient intake, and food additive exposures, we uncovered ASD-specific linkages to the microbiome. Poor dietary quality correlated with aggregated core autistic symptoms, gastrointestinal complications, and atypical eating behaviors. Notably, children with ASD exhibited a more pronounced diet-microbiome interaction network compared to neurotypical peers, suggesting heightened microbial sensitivity to nutritional inputs. Furthermore, synthetic emulsifiers—specifically polysorbate-80 and carrageenan—were associated with disrupted microbial connectivity in ASD, a phenomenon attenuated in neurotypical children. Our findings elucidate the mechanistic links between dietary factors—particularly synthetic food additives—and microbiome dysregulation in ASD, urging a re-evaluation of dietary guidelines for ASD populations and laying the groundwork for personalized nutritional strategies.

 Coral reef ecosystems are being altered by rising ocean temperatures and increasing nutrient inputs, yet their combined influence on food-web structure is not well understood. Here we analyzed 130 coral reef food webs across the South China Sea, constructed from environmental DNA surveys integrated with trophic interactions. We grouped the food webs into surface-water, bottom-water and sediment habitats. Our analyses reveal pronounced structural differences among habitats: surface- and bottom-water webs exhibit significantly higher connectance and nestedness, whereas sediment webs are more compartmentalized. Using linear mixed-effects models, we find that temperature and productivity interact in nonlinear ways to shape food-web properties. In surface waters, higher temperature together with higher productivity tends to increase connectance, whereas in deeper waters the same conditions tend to lengthen trophic pathways and reduce stability. These results suggest that future environmental change may influence pelagic and benthic reef food webs in contrasting ways.

We used metagenomic analysis of untreated sewage to cross-sectionally characterize the bacterial resistome as a proxy for AMR at 44 wastewater treatment plants across eight USA states between 2019 and 2020. We examined associations between AMR with site-specific sociodemographic and health indicators and AMU. Spatial autocorrelation analyses were used to identify clusters of AMR. Gradient-boosted multivariate regression trees were applied to evaluate individual and joint predictor effects on AMR. Outpatient AMU explained negligible variation in AMR, whereas predictors related to economy, income, preventive health care, access to health care, social welfare, housing, and racial/ethnic composition showed the strongest associations. These relationships were observed across individual resistance classes and their combinations and predicted AMR nonlinearly, with thresholds where AMR shows sharp increases (risk factors) or decreases (protective factors). Significant interannual differences in resistome and bacteriome composition were observed between 2019 and 2020. Although causal inference is limited, the findings suggest that local-level indicators of health, economic conditions, well-being, and development may play an important role in shaping AMR within countries."

Understanding the occurrence and drivers of DBP formation within DWDSs is essential for evaluating water quality and potential health risks. This study examined DBP occurrence and variability across eight utilities in the United States, three using chlorination and five using chloramination (as secondary/residual disinfectants), by analyzing 152 quarterly samples collected from multiple locations within each distribution system. Regulated DBPs were found at the highest concentrations. Haloacetonitriles (HANs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) contributed most to the predicted toxicity. Spearman correlations, redundancy discriminant analysis, and random forest regression revealed how key influencing predictors of DBPs vary between chlorinated and chloraminated systems. Elevated dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and primary disinfectant type were the two most important contributors to DBP formation, with DOC most influential in chloraminated systems and primary disinfectant type (HOCl vs O3) in chlorinated systems. Variations in DBP concentrations within individual DWDS showed a weak dependence on water age. This study provides a novel data set linking DBP occurrence to water quality parameters and demonstrates how such data can be leveraged to understand DBP dynamics and inform future risk management in water distribution systems."

We measured trihalomethanes in blood and haloacetic acids and oxidative stress markers in urine samples. In adjusted models, each 2.7-fold increase in urinary trichloroacetic acid (TCAA) concentrations was associated with a greater PSQI score of 0.29 (95% confidence interval: 0.07, 0.50). A clear dose–response relationship was observed when TCAA concentrations were included as quartile variables (P for trend = 0.01). In the analyses of individual PSQI components, TCAA was associated with a greater risk of difficulty in falling asleep, short sleep duration, and daytime dysfunction (odds ratios = 1.33 (1.04, 1.70), 1.35 (1.03, 1.78), and 1.39 (1.08, 1.78), respectively, per 2.7-fold increase in TCAA concentrations).

Here, we detail the extent of ENSO's influence on Australian monthly rainfall distributions and clarify its many complexities. We show La Niña to be a long‐lasting and wide‐spread intensifier of Australian rainfall throughout its lifecycle, particularly on extreme monthly rainfall. The reduction of rainfall during El Niño is comparatively limited; confined mainly to El Niño's developing phase and the southeast and northeast of Australia. A further complexity shows El Niño can intensify monthly rainfall during its mature phase. Within these broader impacts of ENSO are strong spatial and temporal differences, such that the expected rainfall impacts may not be consistently felt at the local‐scale. We propose methods to account for these complex climatic impacts at scales comparable to a river catchment scale."

However, climate model simulations indicate that AEWs are not necessary to maintain annual Atlantic TC frequency. Furthermore, small ensembles suggest that AEWs may impact the spatial distribution and landfall of Atlantic TCs. Here, we investigated the influence of AEWs on the spatial distribution of Atlantic TC tracks and landfall using 50‐member ensembles of TC‐permitting regional model simulations for five hurricane seasons characterized by different levels of TC activity. The control simulations are seasonal hindcasts in which AEWs were prescribed through the eastern lateral boundary condition using reanalysis. In the experiments, we suppressed AEWs by applying a 2–10 day filter to the eastern lateral boundary condition. In response to AEW suppression, we discovered statistically significant increases in Atlantic TC frequency (10%–26%) and landfall (16%–44%), a westward shift in TC genesis location and tracks with increased landfall over the Caribbean Islands, southwestern Gulf Coast, and southeastern US coast, and increases in mid‐tropospheric relative humidity in the main development region. In addition, we evaluated TC genesis mechanisms in the absence of AEWs and found evidence that the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) intensified and extended northward, resulting in ITCZ wave‐breaking that shed vortices which served as TC seeds. By uncovering the connections between TC seed types and the likelihood of TC landfall, this research can provide Atlantic coastal and island communities with useful information to prepare for TC impacts."

This is a research approach currently absent from the literature, yet essential for developing transferable Disaster Risk Management (DRM) lessons. Given the increased frequency of hydrometeorological hazards under climate change, the importance of such lessons cannot be overstated. Focusing on the devastating 2021 floods in Europe, this study investigates (1) how did the interplay of impacts, vulnerabilities, and adaptation options produce divergent disaster outcomes in two contrasting European contexts, and (2) what transferable lessons for DRM can be elicited. The selected case studies focus on the areas hardest impacted by the 2021 flood events in Romania (Alba County) and the Netherlands (Limburg Province). The three‐tiered analysis performed at the level of impacts, vulnerabilities, and adaptation options shows that response in the two countries was well‐directed, while vulnerability mitigation remains a critical problem, differing between the two case studies. Another highlight is that development in flood‐prone areas and flood protection standards below (flood) hazard return periods ranked as the most influential vulnerabilities in both case studies. This research provides a new methodology for comparative disaster analysis, offering critical insights for scientists and practitioners in the face of increasingly frequent and impactful hydrometeorological hazards."

 Although the early tectonic regime of the Earth remains debated, it is generally accepted that the geodynamic system underwent a notable transition during the Neoarchean–Paleoproterozoic. Here, we establish the metamorphic database for the North China Craton, comprising 446 valid data (83 Neoarchean and 363 Paleoproterozoic), which are categorized into high, intermediate, and low types based on the thermobaric ratio (T/P). This framework is used to investigate the thermal history, tectonic evolution, and the initiation of plate tectonics during this period. The results show that the North China Craton is dominated by high and intermediate T/P metamorphism, with only limited low T/P metamorphic records appearing in the late Paleoproterozoic. The Neoarchean–Paleoproterozoic thermal evolution of the North China Craton is overall consistent with the global thermal evolution trend, suggesting a transition from ancient-style plate tectonics to modern-style plate tectonics. The Paleoproterozoic metamorphic T/P curve exhibits relatively lower thermobaric ratios at 2.0–1.95 Ga (~1.97 Ga) and ~1.80 Ga, corresponding to two orogenic events: the collision and amalgamation of internal blocks within the North China Craton, and its final incorporation into the Columbia supercontinent. Furthermore, this study links the evolution of plate tectonics with Earth’s solid–surface systems, providing new insights into material circulation processes.  Ancient-style plate tectonics with warm subduction may have already existed in the Neoarchean, whereas modern-style plate tectonics featuring cold subduction appeared in the late Paleoproterozoic, according to metamorphic thermobaric ratio analysis of the North China Craton."

 River deltas support human settlements, sustain ecosystems, and form hydrocarbon reservoirs in ancient sedimentary basins. Their morphologies are shaped by a complex interplay of environmental factors, posing challenges for predicting their evolution. Here we show that characteristics of delta shoreline and distributary channels are antagonistically influenced by rivers and waves. We analyzed morphologies of 1344 global deltas using a convolutional autoencoder, an unsupervised machine learning model, to encode their characteristics into 70-dimensional feature vectors serving as quantitative morphological metrics. The X-means clustering of these metrics revealed eight distinct delta morphotypes, adding a complementary perspective on their conventional classification schemes. We then performed multiple regression analyses to predict the relative sediment fluxes from rivers, tides, and waves from the morphological metrics. The results exhibited that shoreline protuberance and well-developed distributary channels are promoted by stronger fluvial influences and inhibited by stronger wave influences. In contrast, tidal influences were less clearly associated with these morphological features. This data-driven framework contributes to a better understanding of how specific delta morphologies respond to both natural variability and anthropogenic disturbances, offering additional avenues for sustainable management and future research.

Polymorphism can be maintained by social selection if competitive interactions allow each morph to increase in frequency when rare. This reliance on negative frequency–dependent selection should make color polymorphism vulnerable to the appearance of novel phenotypes that disrupt competitive interactions among morphs. We show that the origin and adaptive spread of a sexually selected syndrome in common wall lizards (Podarcis muralis) selectively eliminates alleles coding for alternative color morphs that have been maintained for millions of years. The results demonstrate how the arrival of a novel phenotype can disrupt balancing selection, providing a link between rapid phenotypic evolution and the loss of color polymorphisms."

Phonon-driven changes in carrier localization modulated local field effects (LFEs), yielding carrier-, site-, and orbital-specific absorption signatures. LFEs served as sensitive fingerprints of electron-phonon coupling strength across the phonon spectrum and revealed a breakdown of the Born–Oppenheimer approximation: Electrons lagged lattice oscillations by 32 ± 8 femtoseconds, whereas holes responded almost instantaneously (7 ± 7 femtoseconds).

Population variation in the growth rate and potential of mutant clones suggests that genetic factors may confer resilience against CH. Here, we identified a noncoding regulatory variant, rs17834140-T, that protects against CH and myeloid malignancies by selectively down-regulating the RNA-binding protein MSI2 in HSCs. By modeling variant effects and mapping MSI2 binding targets, we uncovered an RNA network that maintains human HSCs and influences CH risk. Variant rs17834140-T was associated with slower CH expansion, and stem cell MSI2 levels modifiedASXL1-mutant HSC clonal dominance. These findings leverage natural resilience to illuminate posttranscriptional regulation in human HSCs, suggesting that inhibition of MSI2 or its targets could be rational strategies for blood cancer prevention."

To investigate the timing and trajectory of these introductions, we conducted both genomic analyses of 576 pig nuclear genomes and a geometric morphometric analysis of 708 modern and ancient dental remains. Our analyses demonstrate that free-living and domestic pigs in Wallacea and Oceania have diverse ancestries resulting from the introduction of multiple sequential pig populations followed by gene flow. Despite the variability in their genomic ancestry, these pigs all have a distinct tooth morphology as well as a genetic link to the Chinese domestic pig populations that accompanied the dispersal of Austronesian language speakers ~4000 to 3000 years ago via Taiwan and the Philippines."

In cereals, shortening dormancy provides rapid and even postharvest germination, but increases the risk of weather-induced preharvest sprouting, with yearly harvest losses beyond 1 billion dollars. Our understanding of how, why, when, and where cereal dormancy diversification arose is fragmentary. Here, we show in the founder crop barley (Hordeum vulgare) that dormancy is primarily regulated through a mosaic of locus haplotypes comprising copy number variation and inherent kinase activity ofMitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3(MKK3). We provide evidence supporting the historical selection of specificMKK3haplotypes that shaped dormancy levels according to changing climatic pressures and outline a genetic framework for breeders to balance grain dormancy and preharvest sprouting avoidance."

We identified the genetic basis of this polymorphism, which was previously posited to arise from three alleles at one locus. Orange usurper and blue mate-guarder morphs are associated with two divergent haplotypes in the regulatory region of the sepiapterin reductase gene, but yellow sneaker morphs appear to arise through phenotypic plasticity from the same genetic background as blue morphs. Our simulations show that rock-paper-scissors dynamics can better maintain a polymorphism with a genetic system of two alleles plus plasticity than with a three-allele system. This form of balancing selection that combines genetic determination with phenotypic plasticity expands the possibilities for how stable polymorphisms arise in nature."

However, the challenging reduction of benchmark iron salts to active species hinders their application in reductive transformations. In this work, we report a photochemical strategy that exploits the innate reactivity of ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) excited states of iron oxalate complexes to harness oxalate salts as latent terminal two-electron reductants in iron catalysis. The investigation of this activation mode has led to the development of a versatile catalytic platform enabling transformations hitherto inaccessible to previous iron catalyst systems. The synthetic value of this tactic is demonstrated on diverse reductive transformations using readily available building blocks with high chemoselectivity, opening new synthetic opportunities."

We designed protein homotrimers regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved drug amantadine and further designed amantadine-responsive heterodimers and heterotrimers. Biophysical characterization confirmed their amantadine-dependent assembly, and their crystal structures closely matched the design models. We demonstrated their broad applicability in controlling protein localization, membraneless condensate formation, and gene expression. Our approach opens new avenues for designing small molecule–responsive proteins and expands the chemogenetic toolkit for manipulating complex biological processes."

Auxin and ethylene regulate femaleness in cucurbits. In this work, we identified anauxin response factor 3(CsARF3) that plays an essential role in carpel development in cucumber. Deletion ofCsARF3resulted in an androecious phenotype with only male flowers, whereas overexpression ofCsARF3led to an increased number of female flowers. CsARF3 promotes femaleness by directly stimulating the expression of the meristem maintenance geneCsSTMand repressing the activity of the gynoecious geneCsWIP1. Auxin and ethylene exhibit a reciprocal relationship during sex determination, in which ethylene promotes carpel formation through auxin at the early stage of flower development.

In a single experiment, SPARK-seq simultaneously mapped 5535 distinct aptamers to eight surface proteins, capturing interactions across more than two orders of magnitude in protein abundance and spanning diverse biophysical classes. The method discriminated closely related paralogous proteins with no detectable cross-reactivity and provided kinetic information that enabled the prioritization of aptamers with slow dissociation rates. Leveraging this kinetic diversity, we engineered variants with improved off-rate properties. SPARK-seq establishes a platform for high-efficiency discovery and rational variant design of aptamers and functional nucleic acids, unlocking possibilities in diagnostics and therapeutics."

For ligand-gated ion channels, agonist binding triggers rapid transitions through intermediate states leading to a transient open-pore conformation, with these transitions shaping the postsynaptic response. In this work, we determine structures of the muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in unliganded, mono-liganded, and di-liganded states. Agonist binding to a single site stabilizes a closed structure where an entire principal agonist-binding subunit transitions to an active-like conformation, whereas the other unoccupied principal subunit remains inactive, albeit poised for activation. Uniting this intermediate structure with single-channel recordings informs a sequential activation mechanism where asynchronous subunit transitions prime the receptor for activation—a finding with implications for an entire superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels."

The superconducting tunneling spectra display a linear gap-filling behavior with temperature and magnetic field and exhibit the Volovik effect, consistent with a nodal order parameter.

Furthermore, comparisons of the founders between tissues can reveal the patterns of pathogen dissemination. On longer timescales, the emergence of dominant barcoded lineages can also be used to detect within-host evolution. Collectively, barcoding studies quantify the hidden parameters that underlie bacterial colonization and create a quantitative framework for modeling and preventing infectious disease."

However, the analysis of shape dynamics during directional decision-making has been restricted to single junctions. Here, we combined live-cell imaging and a coarse-grained model to study the migratory behavior of highly branched cells while simultaneously facing several junctions. The theoretical model predicts that the choice of a new direction is determined by the competition between the cellular protrusions in the form of seesaw oscillations. We found that macrophages and endothelial cells display different regimes moving on hexagonal networks, despite sharing a mesenchymal (i.e., adhesion-dependent) migratory strategy. The model describes the motility of both cell types and reveals a trade-off between branching and speed: Having many protrusions allows local microenvironmental exploration for directional cues, but long-range migration efficiency improves with fewer protrusions. Collectively, our data highlight the relevance and provide insights for the regulation of shape dynamics during cell navigation in complex geometries."

Here, we studied how this approach’s induction of trained immunity systemically overcomes the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. We found changes in the tumor microenvironment to mirror functional changes in the hematopoietic system in a melanoma mouse model. Single cell sequencing methods disclosed a shift in the tumor-associated macrophage population from immunosuppressive to antitumorigenic. Uniquely, a trained immunity and checkpoint blockade combination therapy mobilized natural killer cells which, in conjunction with the functional changes in the myeloid cell compartment, effectively activated T cells. Last, we established the effectiveness of our approach in mouse models of breast, lung, and pancreatic cancer. Collectively, our data show that the systemic induction of trained immunity rebalances the immune system for effective checkpoint blockade therapy."

Through soft, flexible structures and accurate navigation, previously inaccessible anatomical regions can be safely reached. Dependent on both actuation mode and clinical application, however, rigidity and miniaturization potential can still present substantial challenges. Magnetic soft continuum robots (mSCRs) offer promising solutions to these key questions. Furthermore, micrometer- to millimeter-scale untethered magnetic robots (mUMRs) offer unparalleled miniaturization potential enabling targeted therapeutic delivery. Leveraging the benefits of magnetic actuation, this study introduces a bespoke, continuously magnetized catheter that synergizes the navigational strengths of mSCRs with the functional effectiveness of mUMRs to precisely deliver drug-doped payloads to otherwise unreachable regions deep within the anatomy. In particular, this system uses a magnetic latching mechanism, ensuring precise drug delivery and efficient retrieval, demonstrated in an ex vivo porcine kidney model for organ transplantation–related immunosuppressant delivery."

This warm water incursion may have initiated Heinrich Event 0, likely causing surface freshening in subpolar North Atlantic and subsequently triggering a second AMOC decline during the late YD. Model simulations further support a two-phase AMOC weakening associated with surface freshening during the YD. Our biphasic freshwater injection hypothesis provides fresh insights into the mechanisms driving the YD and underscores the critical role of surface freshening in the subpolar North Atlantic in shaping deglacial abrupt climate changes."

The strength of normalization is highly heterogeneous across neurons, and this heterogeneity correlates with attention-mediated modulations in neural responses. However, the circuit mechanism underlying the heterogeneous normalization strength is unclear. In this work, we study normalization in a spiking neuron network model of visual cortex. Our model reveals that the heterogeneity of normalization strength is highly correlated with the inhibitory current each neuron receives. The correlation between inhibition and other synaptic inputs explains the experimentally observed dependence of spike count correlations on normalization strength. Further, we find that neurons with stronger normalization encode information more efficiently, and that networks with more heterogeneity in normalization encode visual stimuli with higher information and capacity. Together, our model provides a mechanistic explanation of heterogeneous normalization strengths in the visual cortex and sheds light on the computational benefits of neuronal heterogeneity."

Introducing live or heat-killedL. johnsoniiinto the lungs of HCT mice significantly reduced gammaherpesvirus-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis. This protective effect was mediated in part by the up-regulation of PD-L1 on dendritic cells, which in turn dampened the production of the inflammatory cytokine IL-17A by T helper 17 cells post-HCT.L. johnsoniialso reducedTgfb1expression in lung macrophages. These anti-fibrotic effects of heat-killedL. johnsoniiwere absent in PD-1–deficient mice, highlighting the role of PD-L1/PD-1 signaling. Further analysis showed that dendritic cells uniquely recognizedL. johnsoniiand increased PD-L1 expression via TLR1/2- and TLR9-MyD88 pathways.

Ibarra;Stephen Nelson;Alexander Farnsworth;Paul Valdes;Aradhna Tripati,Quantifying the impacts of rainfall and evaporation on Lake Bonneville,"Improved understanding of hydroclimatic drivers in water-stressed regions enables more accurate forecasting of future climate change impacts. Lake Bonneville was the largest Pleistocene lake in western North America, with a maximum surface area of ~52,000 km2, before shrinking markedly to become the modern Great Salt Lake. After more than a century of study, the balance between enhanced precipitation and reduced evaporation as drivers of lake growth continues to be debated. Multiple studies identify precipitation as the main factor associated with the highest lake levels, but most proxies provide an estimate of net evaporation and cannot independently resolve precipitation from evaporation. Therefore, factors associated with lake size, growth, and retreat remain uncertain. This study uses the thermodynamically based carbonate clumped isotope geothermometer to estimate temperature, evaporation, and precipitation at Lake Bonneville from 23 to 16 thousand years ago (ka). Clumped isotope derived constraints on hydroclimate are also applied to assess the accuracy of regional climate model outputs. During transgressive and open phases of the lake, we find that regional and large-scale precipitation delivery were the driving factors of lake expansion. In contrast, at its maximum extent (~17.5 ka), Lake Bonneville was maintained via suppressed evaporation rates at 50% relative to modern while precipitation rates were similar to modern levels."

Mislocalization of TFs contributes to cancers, making TF relocalization a promising anticancer therapeutic strategy. We engineered anchoring aptamers as a platform for relocalizing TFs. Anchoring aptamers are heterobifunctional nucleic acids consisting of two ligands joined by a linker: one targeting the plasma membrane–anchored protein and the other recruiting the TF. As a proof of concept, we used the Ra1 aptamer targeting Ras and the DNA ligand specific for p65 or E2F1 to construct anchoring aptamers. Simultaneous binding of the anchoring aptamers to Ras and either p65 or E2F1 effectively induces cytoplasmic relocalization and functional inactivation of p65 or E2F1. Using a lentiviral expression system of anchoring aptamers, we achieved sustained cytoplasmic retention of p65 and marked inhibition of tumor growth. This work establishes a universal platform for TF relocalization, offering promising opportunities for innovative anticancer therapeutic strategies."

Retinal pigmentation protects against light-induced damage, yet its genetic and evolutionary bases remain unclear. We developed a deep learning framework (DeepGRP) to quantify retinal pigmentation from high-resolution fundus images and conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS), identifying 42 signals, including 26 previously unidentified loci, with single-nucleotide polymorphism–based heritability of 21.4%. Single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin by sequencing and RNA sequencing of human fetal retinal tissues revealed key cellular contributors, including retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor cells. Among candidate genes,ARHGAP18emerged as a previously unrecognized regulator of melanogenesis. Evidence of polygenic adaptation in Europeans suggests selection driven by snow-reflected light at high latitudes. A polygenic risk score for retinal pigmentation correlated with a 4.8-fold higher risk of myopia and a 1.5-fold lower risk of skin cancer. These findings demonstrate the power of deep learning for large-scale ocular phenotyping and reveal insights into the genetic and evolutionary architecture of retinal pigmentation."

This coassembled protein gel sequentially activated integrin β3–mediated mechanotransduction, promoted cytoskeletal remodeling and Yes-associated protein nuclear translocation, and subsequently up-regulated bioactive factors and ECM synthesis to orchestrate stem cell development. Incorporation of kartogenin provided sustained chondrogenic cues, thereby promoting stem cell differentiation and preserving NP tissue integrity in vivo.

These cells play a complex role during tumor progression; they can inhibit or promote tumor growth depending on disease stage. We developed a mouse model that allows monitoring and selective elimination of cells expressing high levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16 and interleukin-6. These mice, termed SuSe (suicidal senescence), were crossed with the mouse mammary tumor virus–polyomavirus middle T antigen (MMTV-PyMT) model of breast cancer. Functional characterization in SuSe/PyMT mice confirmed that depletion of senescent cells (senolysis) in early and late lesions accelerated and decelerated tumor growth and metastasis, respectively. Tumor acceleration was attributed to expansion of immunosuppressive, protumorigenic macrophages. C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 was identified as an autocrine chemokine essential for their recruitment and maintenance. Depletion of these macrophages reversed the effects of senescent cell clearance, rendering senolysis antitumorigenic even at early stages. Our results suggest that targeting immunosuppressive macrophages can preserve the benefits of senolysis while mitigating adverse effects."

Heterogeneity in red blood cell (RBC) properties within and across individuals has hindered our ability to establish the multiscale mechanisms driving pathological flow dynamics in such diseases. To address this, we develop microfluidic platforms to measure RBC properties and flow dynamics in the same blood samples from patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). We find that effective blood viscosity across individuals is explained by the proportion of stiff RBCs, exhibiting qualitative similarities to rigid-particle suspensions, despite considerable mechanical heterogeneity. By combining simulations with spatially resolved measurements of cell dynamics, we show how features of emergent rheology are governed by spatiotemporal cell organization, via margination at intermediate oxygen tensions, and localized jamming caused by spatial hematocrit variations under hypoxia. Our work defines the suspension physics underlying pathological blood flow in SCD and, more broadly, emergent rheology in heterogeneous particle suspensions."

Using bacteriophage T7 as a model system, this approach revealed bursts of high-speed replisome rotation that support continuous DNA synthesis. Unexpectedly, excessive rotation does not reduce replisome speed, but increases pausing, reduces processivity, and increases the number of polymerases.

Myeloid cells (MCs) such as macrophages contribute to resistance. Established clinical evidence links cholesterol to cancer outcomes, with MC function being regulated by cholesterol metabolism. We screened MC-expressed regulators of cholesterol homeostasis linked to survival and identified the cholesterol efflux protein ABCA1. ABCA1 activity increases anticancer functions of macrophages: enhancing tumor infiltration, decreasing angiogenic potential, reducing efferocytosis, and improving support of CD8+ T cell activity. Mechanistically, different AKT isoforms are involved, through both PI3K-dependent and PI3K-independent mechanisms. Highlighting the clinical relevance of our findings are correlations between ABCA1 in macrophages and angiogenic potential,VEGFA, and CD8 T cell abundance and activity. The culmination of these activities was demonstrated through increased tumor growth and metastasis in mice lacking MC-expressed ABCA1. Tumors grown in these mice were also more resistant to immune therapy. Therefore, modulating ABCA1 activity within MCs may represent a previously unidentified approach to immune therapy."

To establish contact, cells generate pushing forces through branched actin polymerization mediated by the actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex, followed by the reinforcement of mechanosensitive AJs in response to actomyosin contractility. To investigate how AJ proteins coordinate these events, we combined kinetic assays of actin polymerization, single actin filament observation in total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, and in vitro reconstitution of AJ mechanosensitivity. Our findings show that actomyosin contractility alone is sufficient to trigger the hierarchical assembly of the AJ mechanosensitive proteins α-catenin, vinculin, and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). Once assembled, these proteins act synergistically to promote actin filament nucleation, elongation, and bundling. The α-catenin-vinculin-VASP machinery inhibits Arp2/3-mediated actin branching and instead promotes the myosin-dependent assembly of actin bundles. Together, these results reveal how AJs integrate actin assembly, actomyosin contractility, and mechanosensitivity in a feedback loop."

Here, we demonstrate that the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) gradient, together with stemness and pericyte-like properties, is a critical regulator of MSC niche function. High EMT gradients characterize functional MSC subsets that functions as niche supporting hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), while attenuation of the EMT program impairs HSC support and reproduced in degenerative hematological disorders. Notably, enhancing the EMT program in MSCs (aEMT-MSCs) markedly augments their capacity to promote HSC regeneration and restores defective niches in patients with aplastic anemia. Furthermore, the regenerative effects of aEMT-MSCs extend beyond hematopoiesis to neuronal and cardiovascular tissues, suggesting a conserved niche-supporting program across multiple tissue systems. These findings establish the EMT program as a central regulator of the mesenchymal niche and propose a strategy to address unmet needs in regenerative medicine."

Here, we show that the previously uncharacterized LATE-FLOWERING RRM-CONTAINING PROTEIN (LRP) prevents 5′-3′ chromatin looping of the key floral repressor geneFLOWERING LOCUS C(FLC) via direct association with its 5′ and 3′ genomic regions. Loss ofLRPfunction leads to increased 5′-3′ gene looping, reduced RNA polymerase II (Pol II) occupancy at theFLClocus, thereby increasingFLCtranscription and delaying flowering inArabidopsis thaliana. Furthermore, site-specific phosphorylation of LRP at serine 17, mediated by the kinase PRP4KA, is essential for LRP protein stability and its function in preventingFLCchromatin looping and Pol II recruitment. Our findings reveal that site-specific phosphorylation of LRP by PRP4KA precludesFLCgene loop formation, constituting a key mechanism forFLCtranscriptional repression to ensure timely flowering."

However, there is often an empirical upper limit of electron density in tokamak operation, namely, the Greenwald density limitnG, above which tokamaks generally disrupt. Achieving high-density operation above the density limit has been a long-standing challenge in magnetic confinement fusion research. Here, we report experimental results on the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) achieving line-averaged electron density in the range of (1.3 to 1.65)nG, significantly above the typical EAST operational range of (0.8 to 1.0)nG. This is performed with electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH)–assisted ohmic start-up and sufficiently high initial neutral density. These experiments are shown to operate in the density-free regime first predicted by a recent plasma-wall self-organization theory. These results suggest a promising scheme for substantially increasing the density limit in tokamaks, a critical advancement toward achieving burning plasma."

In acoustofluidics, standing-wave tweezers were widely adopted for particle trapping and translation due to their facile implementation and on-chip integrability. However, those conventional standing-wave fields, typically generated by transducer pairs, exhibit limited manipulation flexibility owing to their simplistic field configurations. Here, we demonstrate topological mass transport along arbitrarily designed trajectories by constructing localized and tunable standing-wave fields based on valley interface states. Precise phase modulation of incident waves enables efficient particle conveyance through continuous displacement of standing-wave pressure nodes or antinodes, leveraging the radiation forces from topologically protected standing waves in scattering systems. Experimental results confirm that such topological tweezing and circulating effect enables robust mass transport, showing antibackscattering characteristics and immunity against various structural defects such as sharp corners or cavities. Our work establishes a foundational paradigm for investigating the radiation forces in topological acoustic fields and advances the development of acoustofluidics technologies."

Upon LPS binding through their amino-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs), these inflammatory caspases oligomerize and activate. However, how LPS binding drives caspase-4/11 activation remains unclear. Here, we show that caspase-4/11 CARDs are intrinsically unstructured in their resting state and adopt an α-helical conformation upon LPS engagement. This structural rearrangement promotes CARD oligomerization, with electron-capture charge reduction–coupled native mass spectrometry and other techniques illustrating that hexa-acylated LPS induces the formation of large oligomers composed of eight or more protomers, whereas underacylated lipids trigger smaller assemblies. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and cross-linking mass spectrometry, we identified a hydrophobic cleft critical for LPS binding and potential intersubunit interfaces that facilitate oligomerization. These findings uncover key structural features underlying LPS recognition and activation of the noncanonical inflammasome, providing mechanistic insight into an essential arm of the innate immune response."

Here, we introduce a framework that circumvents the sign problem in the studies of quantum criticality and its associated phases by leveraging imaginary-time nonequilibrium critical dynamics. We demonstrate that the critical properties can be accurately determined from the system’s short-time relaxation, a regime where the sign problem remains manageable for quantum Monte Carlo simulations. After validating this approach on two benchmark fermionic models, we apply it to the sign-problematic Hubbard model hosting SU(3)-symmetric Dirac fermions. We present the first numerically exact characterization of its quantum phase diagram, revealing a continuous transition between a Dirac semimetal and a SU(3)-antiferromagnetic phase. This transition defines an unconventional Gross-Neveu universality class that fundamentally reshapes current understanding of Gross-Neveu criticality.

After being asked their position on immigration policy, they used the same data to answer the same empirical question: Does immigration affect public support for social welfare programs? The researchers estimated 1253 alternative regression models, and the estimated impacts ranged from strongly negative to strongly positive. We find that teams composed of pro-immigration researchers estimated more positive impacts of immigration on public support for social programs, while anti-immigration teams estimated more negative impacts. The differences arise because different teams adopted different model specifications.

Here, we report that compared to healthy controls, patients with T1D and their first-degree relatives (FDRs) exhibited significantly increased serum Galectin-3 levels primarily produced and secreted by monocytes/macrophages. Pharmacological inhibition (TD139) as well as knockout of Galectin-3 gene both attenuated Galectin-3–mediated suppression of regulatory T cells (Tregcells) and protected from insulitis and diabetes onset in NOD mice.

Here, we report a hysteresis-free strain sensor enabled by an interfacial coordination strategy, which integrates intrinsically stretchable dual-network universal bonding materials to establish robust adhesion between hyperelastic and hydrogel-dielectric hybrid systems. This architecture simultaneously enhances the elastic rebound stiffness of the composite and suppresses interfacial slippage, leading to a notable reduction in system-level hysteresis. A strain rate–dependent evaluation framework is proposed to systematically quantify dynamic hysteresis variability. The resulting sensor exhibits outstanding performance under extreme mechanical conditions, including 100% peak strain and strain rates up to 50% per second, maintaining a failure range below 1%.

Among various physiological stimuli, nutrient starvation is the most potent inducer of autophagy. In response to starvation, transcription factor EB (TFEB) is activated and up-regulates a broad set of autophagy-related genes. However, the mechanisms by which TFEB promotes autophagosome biogenesis remain incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that TFEB-mediated transcriptional induction ofsequestosome 1(SQSTM1; p62) triggers the formation of SQSTM1-positive bodies that recruit essential autophagy factors, thereby initiating autophagosome biogenesis. Genetic disruption of TFEB-dependent SQSTM1 regulation markedly impairs starvation-induced autophagy, underscoring the critical role of the TFEB-SQSTM1 axis in the autophagic response to nutrient stress. Furthermore, we show that these SQSTM1 bodies contain ubiquitinated ribosomal proteins and that TFEB promotes ribosomal protein ubiquitination by inducing the E3 ubiquitin ligase ZNF598. Collectively, our findings uncover a transcriptionally coordinated mechanism that regulates both autophagosome biogenesis and substrate ubiquitination, facilitating efficient cargo clearance during starvation-induced autophagy."

HLA-Shuttle restores antigen presentation in immunologically cold neuroblastoma cells, enabling identification of multiple tumor-associated antigens with therapeutic potential. Cellular trafficking assays and single-particle tracking reveal a global stabilization of HLA-I molecules, extension of their cell-surface lifetime and microdomain formation.

Caspase-2, a proapoptotic protease, restricts polyploidization by deleting polyploid and aneuploid cells. While caspase-2 protects against diet-induced hepatic injury, it also acts as a tumor suppressor by controlling genomic instability and oxidative stress. To investigate these roles, we assessed hepatic ploidy dynamics, liver damage, and age-associated tumorigenesis in caspase-2–deficient and catalytically inactive mutant mice. We found that caspase-2 loss promotes early-onset hepatocyte hyperpolyploidy, accompanied by progressive liver inflammation, fibrosis, oxidative liver damage, ferroptosis, and higher incidence of spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma in aged animals. Proteomic profiling revealed a pathogenic polyploidy–associated signature associated with caspase-2 deficiency and increased predisposition to liver disease and malignancy. These findings establish caspase-2 enzymatic activity as a critical regulator of hepatic genome stability and preventing age-related liver cancer that strongly argue against therapeutic caspase-2 inhibition as a strategy for managing liver injury or cancer risk."

Transcriptomic analysis of patients with AU revealed a highly oxidative stress profile as well as an up-regulatedapolipoprotein E(APOE) expression in their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In addition, single-cell RNA sequencing of retinal microglia also identified an up-regulated expression ofAPOEin a murine model of experimental AU (EAU). Our results and others previously suggested that microglia are tightly associated with the development of AU. Meanwhile, althoughAPOEhas been reported to play a myriad of functions ranging from lipid metabolism to neural regeneration, little is known about its detailed mechanism in the development of AU. In this study, a murine EAU model was used to investigate the association betweenAPOE, microglia, and EAU, and it is found thatAPOEis indispensable for EAU induction asAPOE−/−mice failed to develop EAU. In vitro studies using microglial cells further demonstrated thatAPOEis positively corelated with microglial inflammation, which could be reversed by knocking downAPOEusing short hairpin RNA. Proteomic analysis indicated thatAPOE-mediated microglial activation relies on reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathway, throughpeptidyl prolyl isomerase F(PPIF), which was further verified in PBMCs derived from patients with AU. Supplementation ofPPIFreversesAPOEdeficiency–caused ROS activation in vitro.

FcRL5 is a prominent target in B cell malignancies and has been implicated as a receptor for immunoglobulin G (IgG). However, the molecular mechanism remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that human FcRL5, but not its mouse counterpart, is a bona fide IgG-Fc (Fcγ) receptor that uniquely requires the presence of two Fcγ molecules in close proximity to form a robust interaction. Cryo–electron microscopy reveals that FcRL5 optimally engages two Fcγ molecules positioned at a 60° angle, with its D1-D2 domains binding to the first Fcγ molecule, while its D3 domain arches over the second Fcγ. This distinctive binding capability enables FcRL5 to specifically recognize IgG immune complexes (ICs), with the binding strength correlating with IgG concentration in the ICs. In addition, we demonstrate that FcRL5 can internalize the IgG polymer and IC. These results shed light on FcRL5 function and reveal a unique Fcγ-FcγR binding mode governed by avidity."

Conductive hydrogels are attractive for this role because their hydrated polymer networks and mixed ionic/electronic conductivity reduce impedance and enhance charge transfer. Yet, challenges remain in integrating hydrogels with device components and achieving reliable tissue adhesion. Here, we present a materials and structural design strategy that enables electrically and mechanically robust devices through sequential formation of elastomer-metal-hydrogel multilayers and single-step laser patterning. The device consists of a micropillar-structured waterborne polyurethane substrate with a Au layer strongly bonded to the pillars, showing <2% resistance change under 28% strain. Functional hydrogels provide low interfacial impedance (~36.2 ohms at 1 kilohertz), effective insulation (~51,536 ohms at 1 kilohertz), and strong adhesion (~226 newtons per meter on cardiac tissue). Without elastomer-hydrogel decoupling, performance remains stable under dynamic aqueous conditions. Applied to rodent cardiac tissue, the integrated interface enables real-time electrocardiography monitoring and feedback-controlled electrical stimulation."

Accurate assessments of these levees are crucial in flood hazard maps, which underpin federal floodplain regulations and insurance rates provided by the National Flood Insurance Program. However, when the federal government digitized California’s flood maps in the 2000s, it used a simplistic binary procedure that assessed levees as either meeting the minimum standards for accreditation or not. This study investigates the consequences of the ‘without levee’ procedure, which mapped flood risk as if non-accredited levees did not exist and shaped the 100 year flood zone in California. We combine publicly available datasets on levee systems, flood insurance enrollment, and demographics behind levees. We find that non-accredited levees outnumber accredited levees by a factor of 10-to-1, but accredited levees are concentrated in urban areas and protect more people and assets. Our results demonstrate that households behind non-accredited levees effectively cross-subsidize flood insurance costs in leveed areas—between 2009 and 2020, households behind non-accredited levees paid twice as much for flood insurance premiums than if their levee were accredited and they were removed from the flood zone. While Risk Rating 2.0 insurance pricing is narrowing the premium gap, accreditation continues to shape the 100 year flood zone, with enduring economic implications."

Few have examined how multiple burdens are concentrated and distributed among the American population. The objective of this study was to examine how multiple (13) environmental burdens are concentrated and how concentrated burdens are associated with where vulnerable populations reside. We utilized nationally consistent data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s EJScreen database. EJScreen includes 13 environmental burden indicators and five racial/ethnic and socioeconomic indicators. The concentration of environmental burdens was examined by taking into account both the intensity of individual burdens and the count of burdens exceeding specified intensity thresholds. Graphical and statistical analyses were used to determine how percentages of vulnerable populations varied as the intensity levels and counts of burdens exceeding specified intensity thresholds increased. We found that concentrations of vulnerable populations increase as intensity levels of individual environmental burdens increase and as the number of burdens exceeding specified intensity thresholds increases. In most cases these increases are monotonic and highly statistically significant. Among the five demographic categories examined, the strongest relationships were found for percent people of color, followed by percent with limited English. Weaker but statistically significant relationships were found between other socioeconomic categories and increases in the intensities and counts of environmental burdens. Until recently, nationally consistent data for multiple environmental burdens were not available. Applying the 13 environmental indicators in EJScreen demonstrates that a strong relationship exists between where multiple burdens are simultaneously concentrated and where vulnerable populations reside. That this relationship is stronger for racial/ethnic categories than for other socioeconomic categories reflects outcomes of a history of public policies that have segregated and disadvantaged certain populations in the U.S."

This study provides a global analysis of the socio-economic, geographical, and climate determinants of UGS inequality across 11 528 cities by assessing dynamic changes in UGS against the global average. We find that cities in Asia and Africa (6414 cities of 78 countries) are generally converging toward the global mean from below, while those in North America and Europe (1416 cities of 46 countries) gradually lost their relative advantages in UGS development. The relative greenness in 13% of the study cities were mainly influenced by built-up area per capita, in 35% by night lightening index, in 9% by GDP per capita, and in 22% by precipitation. We identified three dominant typologies of drivers: those tied to economic intensity GDP per capita, urbanization pressure (nighttime light index), and biophysical constraints (biome & built-up area). These typologies align with urban developmental pathways from take-off to mature stabilization, revealing a spectrum of stage-specific challenges. These findings underscore that effective UGS strategies should be tailored to local contexts, make reasonable use of urban ecological endowments, adapt to climate constraints, and integrate green space planning into the specific stage of urban development."

In this study, we present a fragility-based modeling framework to estimate material replacement needs for building components damaged at specific flood depths. We develop fragility curves for each building component using a triangular cumulative distribution derived from expert judgment due to the lack of empirical data on flood losses, especially at the component level. By combining these estimates with life cycle GHG emissions for each component in a Monte Carlo simulation, we derive probabilistic, emissions-based damage curves for single-family residential structures which comprehensively account for uncertainty in the estimates. We then applied these damage curves to estimate the GHG emissions caused by a 100-year flood in two testbed regions in the Mississippi River Valley. Our results show that including the social costs of GHG emissions can increase the valuation of total flood damages by over 6%. Our results also show that flood impact estimates are highly uncertain our model can be used by planners in cost-benefit analyses of flood risk management projects to show that such projects are more economically efficient than current methods would report."

Here, we simulated historical net primary productivity (NPP) (1982–2020) using the Carnegie–Ames–Stanford model, identified key extreme climate factors through geographical detector method (GDM), and projected future NPP variations (2023–2100) under different climate scenarios using partial least squares regression. Results showed that 72.3% of IM experienced increasing NPP during 1982–2020, with 28.2% showing significant increase, mainly in northeastern and eastern regions.

However, the magnitude of this thermal buffering is strongly influenced by forest structure and management, and remains understudied. Using a comprehensive dataset of in-situ microclimate time series and high-resolution forest inventory data in Finland, we provide the first country-wide estimate of microclimate temperature buffering in boreal forests. We found that only 17% of forestry land has buffered climatic conditions, while in one-quarter of the land, temperature variation is amplified primarily due to low canopy cover in young stands. The microclimatic buffering patterns vary with biogeographical gradients. The extensive impact of forestry on boreal microclimates highlights the enormous potential of forest management to maintain stable temperatures. Prioritizing management practices that preserve canopy cover can help promote buffered microclimates in boreal forests."

Addressing this dilemma requires quantitative methods to synthesize information across climate realizations, which are lacking in the energy systems community. This research presents a decision-making framework that centers a variability index to quantify resource adequacy (RA) contributions of investments across potential climate realizations. The research framework is applied to the Western U.S. power system, with a focus on California RA outcomes, by integrating dynamically downscaled data from five climate models with an RA model that simulates generator outages and optimizes transmission and storage operations. This framework finds investment portfolios can have highly variable RA contributions between climate models. For instance, a wind-and-battery portfolio reduces expected unserved energy by 78% in one climate model but by only 47% in another. This range of behaviors yields a variability index of 0.65 for the wind-and-battery investment, much higher than a variability index of 0.2 for a solar-only investment portfolio that achieves more consistent RA reductions. By combining the variability index with a benefit metric, this work shows a frontier of investment options that illuminate trade-offs for decision-makers and synthesize outcomes across plausible climate realizations."

This study investigated croplands across multiple tillage chronosequences by integrating dye tracing, 15N isotope tracing, and metagenomic techniques. The study shows that tillage-induced degradation of preferential flow structures homogenizes the vadose zone and reshapes N-cycling communities, shifting denitrifiers from nirK- to nirS-dominated assemblages. Consistent with this community turnover, gross nitrification rates in shallow preferential paths are 30.8% higher than in the adjacent matrix in short-term tillage, whereas in deep layers matrix denitrification and DNRA rates exceed those in preferential paths by 37.9 and 76.1%, and anammox appears only in the matrix at medium- and long-term tillage, indicating a concentration of reductive N processes in the matrix. Path analysis further shows that tillage-driven alterations in hydraulic properties (path coefficient = −0.91, p < 0.01), together with these community and process-rate shifts, redirect the dominant N pathway from hotspot-driven nitrification in preferential channels to matrix-driven reductive N loss, converting a nitrate-leaching-prone system into one with higher gaseous emission potential.

Tween 80 (P80) may trigger IBD; however, its underlying mechanism of action has not been fully clarified, especially with respect to diet-induced susceptibility. This study systematically investigated the effect of P80 on the IBD development in male mice on a normal diet and high-fat diet (HFD) at an acceptable daily intake level. After 6 weeks of oral exposure to P80 (0.1, 1, 6%), the high-dose group of mice exhibited a significant increase in the disease activity index, a significant body weight loss, and a severe inflammatory response, with HFD markedly augmenting these effects. Multiomics results indicated that P80 exposure disrupted intestinal tryptophan metabolism and significantly reduced indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) levels. In vivo intestinal inflammation was transcriptionally regulated by genes related to the AhR/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway. Supplementing with IAA can improve inflammatory effects. In vitro studies confirmed that P80 exposure inhibited Lactobacillus from producing IAA, leading to an increase in the level of intestinal inflammation. This study revealed the specific toxic mechanism of P80-induced IBD and found that dietary factors have a synergistic toxic effect, providing new insights into the health risk assessment of environmental pollutants."

However, the spatiotemporal evolution of environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) and their associated phytotoxicity remain poorly understood. This study addresses these knowledge gaps through a 60-day lettuce cultivation experiment conducted in soils amended with both pristine and photoaged TWPs of different particle sizes. Our results reveal a photoaging-dependent response in EPFR concentrations, peaking at moderate exposure (equivalent to 280 days of sunlight) before declining with extended aging (equivalent to 605 days of sunlight). Comparatively, stable EPFRs demonstrate higher persistence than reactive EPFRs. EPFR stability also exhibits strong particle size dependence, with TWP diameters <100 μm showing faster decay than larger particles (100–425 μm) under extended simulated irradiation (280 → 605 days). Comprehensive analyses of plant physiological parameters and antioxidant responses, combined with EPFR quenching experiments, demonstrate that the phytotoxicity of TWPs to lettuce is predominantly mediated by EPFR concentration dynamics and photoaging-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Interestingly, smaller TWPs show decreased ROS generation owing to restricted soil aeration but induce comparable or greater toxicity to lettuce and soil microorganisms than larger particles, highlighting particle size as a critical regulator of TWP toxicity beyond oxidative mechanisms."

Hypersaline solutions have high ionic strength, which introduces deviations among measured proton activity, its concentration, and potential acidity. Here, we evaluate these deviations with theoretical simulations and by modeling hypersaline lithium brines from South America and produced waters from U.S. oil and gas operations (n > 60 000). We show that when the ionic strength increases above 2 m, proton activity coefficients steadily increase above unity. This causes the pH value to overestimate proton concentration. As this discrepancy increases, the pH alone cannot be used to accurately evaluate the solution’s corrosivity by features such as the saturation index (SI) or calcium carbonate precipitation potential (CCPP). Our analysis reveals that 5% of the investigated produced waters showed pH values of <6 but positive CCPP or SI values, undermining pH as a single regulatory indicator of corrosivity. Accurate evaluation of hypersaline effluent corrosivity requires the utilization of advanced tools such as the PHREEQC software with the Pitzer model. This approach ensures a more reliable characterization of the potential hypersaline effluent corrosivity and thus more efficient management and policy."

Here, we use two‐dimensional numerical simulations to investigate trace element transport during compaction‐driven flow involving porosity waves and channelization caused by decompaction weakening. We employ a small‐amplitude porosity perturbation to study fluid segregation. A data collapse of systematic numerical results quantifies how the increase in channelization intensity cancels out the decrease in trace element transport caused by retardation, showing that channelized porosity waves enable segregated trace element mass transport.

However, high‐resolution constraints, especially those involving both P‐ and S‐waves, remain scarce, limiting our ability to detect these processes and assess their impacts on crustal properties. We present high‐resolution P‐ and S‐wave velocity models from traveltime tomography of downward‐continued long‐offset streamer data acquired along a margin‐parallel profile in the outer rise of the Sumatra subduction zone. The data reveal high‐quality, doubly converted S‐wave arrivals from the upper crust. Layer 2A (uppermost crust) exhibits high and laterally uniform Poisson's ratios (0.3–0.35), whereas the underlying Layer 2B is more heterogeneous with lower Poisson's ratios (0.26–0.33). We interpret Layer 2B heterogeneity as reflecting widespread deformation within the Wharton Basin. In contrast, the more uniform and elevated Poisson's ratio in Layer 2A likely indicates the opening of cracks by plate bending in the outer rise."

Intensity errors increase with the lead time, growing most rapidly during the first 36 hr. Predicted intensity of intense (weak) TCs is generally underestimated (overestimated). The biases mainly stem from the initial intensity bias and the predicted TC fullness (TCF) bias, as well as from the actual intensity change. Initial intensity bias dominates during the first day, explaining 19% of intensity forecast bias. Actual intensity change exhibits a persistent negative correlation with intensity forecast bias, accounting for 16% of the bias within 5 days. In contrast, the influence of TCF forecast bias increases over time and contributes 13% to intensity forecast bias during 4–5 days. Additionally, TC initial intensity, position, and TCF, together with track errors, also affect intensity forecast errors."

The amount of wave energy lost due to whitecapping can only be estimated indirectly, from observations of related quantities. High uncertainties associated with observation‐based estimates hinder validation of whitecapping parameterizations for spectral wave models, making more‐accurate observational methods highly desirable. In this study we analyze time series of two fully independently obtained quantities from the deep‐ocean Station Papa: the power spectral density S $S$ of ambient sound, and the wave energy dissipation Swcap,tot ${S}_{\text{wcap,tot}}$ computed from measured wave energy spectra and wind speeds according to three different parametrizations used in spectral wave models. We find very close relationship between S $S$ and log10Swcap,tot ${\log }_{10}{S}_{\text{wcap,tot}}$, hinting at the potential of acoustic methods for estimating wave energy dissipation. We also show that Swcap,tot ${S}_{\text{wcap,tot}}$ is sensitive to the shape of spectral tails, for example, Doppler‐shift related distortions of measured spectra."

 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pose inconsistent yet increasing threats to freshwater reservoirs worldwide, with implications for ecosystem health and water security. Although local-scale contamination has been widely documented, a comprehensive global synthesis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon occurrence and drivers in reservoirs remains lacking. Here we developed a framework of data compilation, arrangement and statistics to integrate existing data to determine the geographical distribution and potential sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pollution in reservoirs globally. Statistical analyses revealed spatial heterogeneity in dominant components and pollution levels across continents. Almost 38% of water samples exceeded an ecologically relevant threshold (0.20 μg l−1), and 42% of sediment samples surpassed the threshold effect concentration, indicating widespread ecological risks. Cluster analysis and source apportionment of the reservoir-level data identified three distinct polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon patterns, each shaped by region-specific land-use practices, combustion sources and climatic factors. These findings emphasize and inform the need for region-specific monitoring and management strategies, such as expanding monitoring in subtropical and temperate regions, with a focus on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon accumulation in aquatic organisms.

 Variations in Earth’s orbit pace global ice-volume and sea-level changes, but the variability in the response for different sectors of the Antarctic Ice Sheet to orbitally forced climate change remains unclear. Here we present geological records of iceberg-rafted debris and other proxies from locations adjacent to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) with comparisons to an existing East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) record over the time interval ~3.3–2.3 million years ago. Iceberg calving events from the WAIS recorded in Ross Sea sediment cores show a linear response to orbital forcing at timescales corresponding to obliquity (~40,000 years) and precession (~23,000–19,000 years) modulated by eccentricity (~100,000 years). This contrasts with an existing record adjacent to the EAIS, which does not contain obliquity pacing. Combined with ice-sheet model sensitivity tests, the geological data show that the WAIS is highly dynamic and responsive to oceanic melt driven by changes in Southern Ocean circulation, together with atmospheric forcing through variations in local insolation. Conversely, the EAIS appears less responsive to oceanic forcing, despite being the dominant source of meltwater to the global ocean during the mid-Pliocene. Our results imply a substantial role for atmospheric warming on mid-Pliocene sea-level from both WAIS and EAIS.

 Climate change impinges on the Arctic Ocean, leading to sea-ice loss and potentially drastic cascading ecosystem changes. A recent process is atlantification, the growing influence of warm and salty waters from the Atlantic on the Arctic with increasing ocean volume transport from the Nordic Seas to the Barents Sea playing a key role. Despite its importance and a multitude of hypotheses that have been tested, this trend remains mainly unexplained. Here we explore nonlinear effects and successfully link the flow trend through the Barents Sea Opening to a frequency shift of atmospheric synoptic. We show that a part of the flow through Barents Sea Opening is driven by topographic Rossby waves, and that they have a very sensitive response to atmospheric frequency over the Nordic Seas. These findings highlight how anthropogenic changes to the atmosphere are altering ocean processes, with implications for sea-ice extent and ecosystems in the Arctic. The Atlantic Ocean is having an increasing influence on the Arctic but the drivers of this are unclear.

 As electric vehicle adoption accelerates globally, fuel tax revenues decline, exposing government budgets without a proposed replacement tax on electric vehicles.

However, despite many years of intense research, no clear consensus on its mechanism has emerged. Here, we demonstrate that high survival under antibiotics may originate from two fundamentally different growth-arrest archetypes: either from a regulated growth arrest, leading to a protected dormant cellular state, or from a dysregulated disrupted growth arrest. Using modeling and experimental approaches including transcriptomics, microcalorimetry, and microfluidics, we unveil the characteristics and vulnerabilities of each growth-arrest archetype. In particular, disrupted bacteria show a general impairment of membrane homeostasis. This understanding resolves previous conflicting results regarding characteristics of persisters and allows tailoring treatments that target the different growth-arrested bacteria. The fundamental distinction between regulated and disrupted growth arrests should be broadly relevant for the description of cells under stress."

Although knocking down theTTRgene by CRISPR-Cas9 represents a promising strategy for treating ATTR amyloidosis, its efficiency and safety remain to be further investigated. Here, we report a systematic investigation of SpCas9-basedTTRediting. Besides the target site, wild-type SpCas9 and the reported variants induced extensive off-target edits. To improve the fidelity, we performed structural analysis and designed a series of SpCas9 variants. Studies demonstrated that SpCas9-Mut5 is an ultrahigh-fidelity variant, which induces extremely low levels of off-target edits and translocations without substantial impairment of on-target editing activity. SpCas9-Mut5 is compatible with the adenine base editor (ABE) system, markedly reducing off-target edits and narrowing the editing window. In conclusion, our study suggests that SpCas9-Mut5 is an excellent candidate forTTRgene editing. Besides ATTR amyloidosis, SpCas9-Mut5 and its derivative ABE could be widely used in the treatment of other diseases."

To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we deeply profiled wild-type andIDH2R140Q/SRSF2P95single- or double-mutant AMLs. We find a unique set of mis-spliced genes and differentially methylated CpGs in double mutants. Mis-spliced exons are enriched in CCNG splicing enhancers and in the corresponding DNAme changes. Using a machine learning model, we can accurately predict exon inclusion levels from proximal CpGs. These CpGs are more likely to overlap footprints of RNA binding and chromatin-modifying complexes but not transcription factors. We also report unique gene expression profiles associated with each genotype; however, the differentially expressed genes do not overlap with mis-spliced transcripts. Instead, the mis-spliced genes encode for proteins that interact with the complexes regulating these differentially expressed genes. Thus, aberrant DNAme and splicing lead to the mis-splicing of key regulatory complexes, resulting in the aberrant gene expression profiles characteristic of these AMLs."

The earliest putative hominin,Sahelanthropus tchadensis(~7 million years old), was originally represented by a cranium, the reconstruction of which suggested to its discoverers thatSahelanthropuscarried its head in a manner similar to known bipedal hominins. Recently, two partial ulnae and a femur shaft were announced as evidence in support of the contention thatSahelanthropuswas an early biped, but those interpretations have been challenged. Here, while we find that both limb bones are most similar in size and geometric morphometric shape to chimpanzees (genusPan), we demonstrate that their relative proportion is more hominin-like. Furthermore, we confirm two features linked to hominin-like hip and knee function and identify a femoral tubercle, a feature only found in bipedal hominins.

By designing the amphiphilic PAHs and reducing intermolecular π-π stacking interactions, a monolayer of horizontally aligned PAH was obtained at the water-air interface. During the pyrolysis, the monolayer served as a molecularly thin solid carbon source, leading to the controlled preparation of an electrically insulating nanocrystalline graphene monolayer.

In contrast, certain magnetic semiconductors, such as chromium nitride (CrN), exhibit an increased thermal conductivity above its Néel temperature, predicted to be caused by strong spin-phonon coupling. However, this hypothesis lacks experimental verification and detailed understanding. Here, we present conclusive experimental evidence showing that the enhanced thermal conductivity in CrN arises from anomalous temperature-dependent acoustic phonon lifetimes, driven by a dynamic coupling between spin fluctuations and acoustic phonons in the system. Temperature-dependent inelastic x-ray scattering measurements reveal that acoustic phonon lifetimes in CrN are strongly suppressed near Néel temperature but anomalously increase at higher temperatures. In contrast, the optical phonon lifetime decreases with rising temperature, akin to a nonmagnetic semiconductor, as it remains unaffected by spin-phonon coupling. This finding unveils the microscopic origin of anomalous heat transport behavior in magnetostructurally coupled materials, offering a pathway for effective thermal management in magnetic material–based devices."

Specific mechanistic networks were identified: retinoid metabolism, cAMP (adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate)/CREB (cAMP response element–binding protein) signaling, and glutamatergic receptor signaling, which were associated with changes in vision, sleep, and movement, respectively. A considerable reduction is observed in E2F-regulated transcription of G2-M and DNA repair genes.

We present the first 11 ancient genomes of HHV-6A and HHV-6B, dating as far back as the 8th to 6th century BCE. We demonstrate that large fractions of current HHV-6 diversity were already established by the 14th century CE. Our data corroborate that HHV-6A/6B integrations stem from ancient founder events. In addition, we show that all known inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6A clades were already represented in historical populations, confirming that HHV-6A no longer integrates into the germ line within populations of European ancestry and likely endogenized in early human history."

We integrate a formula writing module in the training process of neural networks to enforce the identification of the most selective set of hidden geometric invariants that dictate bulk properties. By inversely solving the formulae, GNDM manipulate disordered geometric features to extrapolate property space and design previously unknown structures via its generator module, validated by experiments. GNDM offers an all-in-one AI framework that closes the loop of feature extraction, property prediction, formula writing, and inverse design, unraveling the regulative role of disorder, a critical challenge in the study of metamaterials with complex microstructures."

While powerful, their development has been hindered by challenges associated with their folding, solubility, and stability in the reduced intracellular environment. Here, we present an artificial intelligence–driven pipeline integrating AlphaFold2, ProteinMPNN, and live-cell screening to optimize antibody framework regions while preserving epitope-binding complementarity-determining regions. Using this approach, we successfully converted 19 of 26 antibody sequences into functional single-chain variable fragment intrabodies, including a panel targeting diverse histone modifications for real-time imaging of chromatin dynamics and gene regulation. Notably, 18 of these 19 sequences had failed to convert using the standard approach, demonstrating the unique effectiveness of our method. As antibody sequence databases expand, our method will accelerate intrabody design, making their development easier, more cost effective, and broadly accessible for biological research."

Following protein modification and silica coating, the soft millirobots exhibit excellent biocompatibility, promoting cell adhesion and tissue ingrowth within their perforated architectures under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. They can apply in situ mechanostimulation to various cellular morphologies, including two-dimensional (2D) cell sheets, 3D cell–laden hydrogels, and ex vivo tissue models. The mechanical stimulation improves the functionality of muscle cells by enhancing cellular orientation, myotube contraction, and myocyte differentiation.

However, FOXN3 becomes unstable in response to profibrotic stimuli. This study identifies poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase–1 (PARP1) as a stabilizing partner of FOXN3, preventing its degradation by blocking p38-mediated phosphorylation. Lung-specific knockout (KO) of PARP1 promotes the development of pulmonary fibrosis by reducing the abundance of FOXN3. Conditional overexpression of FOXN3 notably mitigates pulmonary fibrosis resulting from PARP1 KO by impeding Smad signaling, underscoring the critical role of the PARP1-FOXN3 axis in pulmonary fibrosis. Mechanistically, p38 is a Smad response gene that is transcriptionally repressed by the PARP1/FOXN3 complex. The disruption of PARP1 or FOXN3 increases p38 expression, which in turn facilitates FOXN3 degradation through a feedback mechanism. This cascade activates Smad signaling, leading to a profibrotic response and myofibroblast activation. Notably, levels of PARP1 and FOXN3 are significantly reduced in patients with pulmonary fibrosis, highlighting PARP1’s crucial role in suppressing the disease by regulating FOXN3-mediated Smad signaling."

Protein condensates have been implicated in bacterial dormancy, yet how these assemblies orchestrate dormancy entry remains unclear. We evolved persisters that enter dormancy before the stationary phase, most harboring mutations inserS, encoding seryl-transfer RNA synthetase (SerRS). These variants recapitulated persistence induced by serine hydroxamate (SHX), a serine analog and SerRS inhibitor. Both theserSmutation and SHX treatment trigger SerRS sequestration into conserved DEAD-box adenosine triphosphatase–associated condensates, coinciding with growth arrest and dormancy. In vitro, the SerRS variant preferentially partitions into DeaD granules, consistent with its distinct in vivo localization. Microscopy revealed spatially restricted translation silencing within condensates upon SerRS partitioning. Together, these phase-separated condensates act as hubs that coordinate the transition from proliferation to dormancy, paralleling eukaryotic cell fate control via localized translation. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into bacterial persistence and suggest that targeting condensates could help combat antibiotic tolerance and delay resistance."

Fibrocartilage has poor self-repair capacity after OA, leading to restricted treatment strategies and unsatisfying clinical efficacy. Recently, we constructed the spatiotemporal multiomic landscape of fibrocartilage and connective tissue in human temporomandibular joint (TMJ)–OA, observing that adjacent connective tissue could transform to fibrocartilage in TMJ-OA. We found that theCOL5A1+fibroblast population, derived from perivascular niche, contributes to fibrocartilaginous extracellular matrix (ECM) transformation. Multijoint analysis showed that integrin αV/β5was universally activated in OA joints, which led to increased fibrocartilaginous transcription but disarranged ECM transformation in connective tissues. In OA mouse models and a TMJ-OA miniature pig model, inhibition of integrin αV/β5activity using cilengitide facilitated the transcriptional reprogramming ofCol5a1+fibroblast and functional remodeling of the connective tissues. Our findings verified the effectiveness of cilengitide and provided a clinical route for fibrocartilage injury repair in OA."

Intracavity generation of OAM beams, such as OAM lasers, efficiently produces high-power, high–beam-quality vortices. This scheme, however, remains rarely explored in acoustics. Here, we propose and demonstrate an acoustic intracavity OAM generation mechanism with tunable topological charges via a single nonreciprocal nonlinear boundary in a compact resonator ring. In the linear regime, the boundary creates non-Hermitian complex effective magnetic fields piercing the ring, leading to a non-Hermitian Zeeman-like effect that splits clockwise and counterclockwise eigenmodes. Upon incorporation of nonlinearity to the boundary, all resonators are mutually locked, producing a single-mode self-oscillatory OAM radiation exhibiting hysteresis and bistability. Moreover, the topological charge is tunable by manipulating the boundary. Our work reveals intriguing physics related to nonlinear, non-Hermitian boundaries and offers potentials in the next generation of acoustic self-oscillatory OAM sources, switchers, and memory devices."

Here, we unexpectedly find that DMTF1, a transcription factor that regulates the Arf/p53 axis in cancer, is down-regulated in the NSCs of a premature aging model driven by telomerase deficiency. DMTF1 up-regulation was able to rescue the impaired proliferation of telomere dysfunctional NSCs. Mechanistically, DMTF1 regulates the transcription of Arid2 and Ss18 genes, two subunits of the SWI/SNF complexes that mediate H3K27ac at E2F gene promoters to promote NSC proliferation. Accordingly, Arid2 or Ss18 depletion phenocopies DMTF1 loss in reducing H3K27ac levels, expression of E2F target genes, and NSC proliferation. Thus, our study has identified DMTF1 as a potential therapeutic target to reverse the proliferation defect of aged NSC that is modeled by telomere attrition and unearthed a distinct genetic program controlled by DMTF1 in NSC."

By measuring the dynamic changes in phycosphere carbonate chemistry around single diatom cells, we show that DIC uptake is rapidly modulated. We find that external carbonic anhydrase (eCA) plays a major role in DIC uptake in large centric diatoms at ambient seawater CO2, but there is a strong switch to direct HCO3−uptake under low CO2. Inhibition of eCA leads to rapid activation of HCO3−uptake, which can compensate for the loss of eCA activity under lower irradiances. These different modes of DIC uptake have distinct influences on phycosphere carbonate chemistry that may directly affect nutrient acquisition and biotic interactions. Our findings reveal that dynamic modulation of DIC uptake allows diatoms to rapidly respond to changes in CO2supply and demand."

Herein, Mn single atoms (SAs) are constructed on the surface of NNSO, which induces spin polarization effect, thus promoting directional transfer of photothermal electrons, and improving electron density of Mn sites and adsorption ability of CO2. Meanwhile, Mn SAs act as new active sites enhancing the adsorption of intermediate*CO, thus suppressing CO production, lowering energy barriers of hydrogenation, and changing the reaction path. In addition, the hydrogen overflow energy barriers decrease under the effect of spin polarization, promoting the rapid transfer of active H from Ni atoms to Mn SAs. As a result, the rate of CO2methanation is 195.7 millimoles per gram per hour with near-unity selectivity, and the catalytic activity of 1.0%Mn/NNSO increases by approximately 140 times compared with NNSO.

This achievement was made possible by combining a supersaturated, nucleus-rich active gel with a substantially enhanced crystallization rate, enabling uniform and sufficient nucleus loading on the support and the subsequent rapid formation of continuous zeolite membranes, regardless of support morphology or the presence of seeds. Using this strategy, we rapidly synthesized high-quality zeolite membranes that demonstrated record-breaking separation performance over previously reported counterparts—one order of magnitude higher in separation performance index.

By integrating gene dosage balance principles with phylogenomic reconciliation and probabilistic modeling, we revisit the debated ancestral seed and angiosperm WGDs. Leveraging dosage-sensitive orthologous gene groups (OGs) as evolutionary markers across representative plants for gene tree/species tree reconciliation, we demonstrate that gene retention patterns inAmborellaandAristolochia—early-diverging plants lacking post–angiosperm origin WGDs—reveal a single gene duplication peak predating the seed plant diversification, with no signal of ancestral angiosperm WGD. Correlation analyses of observed and expected OG copy numbers, given proposed WGD(s), further refute an angiosperm WGD. Probabilistic retention modeling analysis corroborates these findings and shows that retention rates of dosage-sensitive genes from the putative angiosperm WGD are extremely low. Besides, our study establishes that genes inferred to have higher dosage sensitivity based on their sequential retention following WGD events may have increased utility in resolving ancestral polyploidy."

A major hurdle is the cell type–specific delivery of immune agonists. To overcome this, we created a DNA-scaffolded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticle platform for precisely loading antibodies targeting cDC1 receptors, specifically DEC205 and Clec9A. Optimizing these targeting ligands revealed a 1:1 ratio as ideal for preferentially targeting splenic cDC1s in vivo. When the STING agonist MSA-2 was delivered via this platform, termed programmable and ratiometrically-engineered immunomodulatory nanoparticle (PRIME NP), its immunostimulatory activity significantly increased. In CT26 tumor–bearing mice, PRIME NP treatment triggered robust proinflammatory signaling and activated both innate and adaptive immune responses, leading to potent CD8+T cell–driven tumor regression and long-term survival in preclinical models. This work provides a framework for designing actively targeted particles and emphasizes DNA-scaffolded nanoparticles as an effective strategy to enhance the STING-cDC1 pathway for solid tumor treatment."

Various factors contribute to this response, including IAV mini viral RNAs (mvRNA), which trigger RIG-I signaling when their replication and transcription are dysregulated by template loops (t-loops). It is presently not well understood whether the fever response to IAV infection affects subsequent viral replication and innate immune activation. Here, we show that IAV infection at temperatures that simulate fever leads to increased antiviral signaling in H1N1 and H3N2 infections. Mathematical modeling and experimental analyses reveal that differential IAV nucleoprotein and RNA polymerase production increase mvRNA and interferon production. Moreover, at the higher infection temperature, mvRNAs with dysregulating t-loops contribute most to the innate immune activation. We propose that fever during IAV infection can establish a positive feedback loop in which elevated aberrant RNA synthesis and innate immune activation can contribute to the dysregulation of cytokine production."

We generated a previously unknown type of breathing soliton to drive the mechanical mode of the microresonator into a forced oscillation at the breathing frequency. Once the breathing frequency is tuned close to the mechanical frequency of the system, the breathing soliton and the excited mechanical oscillation suddenly lock together into a synchronization. This state locks to an almost unchanged breathing frequency, and exists over a considerable frequency range of the pump laser. The locked breathing Kerr soliton can substantially lower its phase noise and improve its long-term stability, providing potential applications in various areas."

CAR T cell expansion induced profound B cell depletion, a sustained reduction in acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody titers, and symptom improvement. Five patients achieved drug-free remission with minimal manifestations by month 6, persisting through the 12-month follow-up despite B cell reconstitution. Reconstituted B cells showed naïve predominance with diminished AChR specificity and functional capacities. Olink proteomics revealed up-regulation of anti-inflammatory factors, along with down-regulation of proinflammatory molecules. Single-cell sequencing revealed that age-associated B cells (ABCs) were up-regulated in a relapsed patient, and differential gene analysis indicated that Fc receptor-like 5 (FCRL5) expression was elevated in ABCs, whereas CAR T cell responders exhibited a down-regulated trend.

Here, we combine SRS with 4Pi interferometry to enhance axial resolution nearly sevenfold. We report on improvements in imaging sensitivity and axial resolution using 80-nanometer polystyrene beads. Harnessing the improved axial resolution, we demonstrate super-resolution 4Pi-SRS imaging in resolving small lipid droplet structures in mammalian cells and lipid membranes inEscherichia colicells. Because 4Pi-SRS uses interferometry to improve axial resolution, it is orthogonal to all previous super-resolution SRS techniques; thus, it is straightforward to integrate it with existing methods to achieve much higher resolution chemical imaging than previously possible."

To address this, we generated transgenicDrosophilaexpressing the genetically encoded xenotopic enzymeLbNOX, which converts NADH to NAD+.LbNOX expression modulated both NAD(H) and NADP(H) (reduced form of NAD phosphate) metabolites in a sex-dependent manner and rescued neuronal cell death induced by mutant αB-crystallin–associated reductive stress.

Notably,LbNOX expression in nonneuronal tissues restored youthful sleep patterns in aged flies.

Through comparative Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) analysis of the Lancang River’s natural and impounded reaches, we identified 9,410 molecular formulas that reveal systematic reservoir-induced transformations in DOM architecture. Notably, 531 compounds were reservoir-specific, exhibiting distinct molecular signatures with reduced double bond equivalence (DBE), elevated H/C ratios, and enrichment in peptide-/lipid-like components, indicative of enhanced autochthonous production. Phytoplankton community analysis revealed the reservoir-specific dominance of Chlorophyta and Cyanophyta, whose metabolic activities promoted the biosynthesis of aliphatic components and unsaturated compounds. Reaction networks uncover intensified anaerobic processing in reservoirs, where demethylation and dehydrogenation pathways generate methane precursors, potentially amplifying CH4 flux. Carbon oxidation state (NOSC) emerges as a key molecular selector, with redox-selected preservation of low-energy CHO compounds (NOSC < 0) forming refractory carbon pools, while bioavailable CHON species demonstrate significant correlations of sediment organic carbon with biological index and peptide-like content. These molecular-level insights suggest that cascade reservoirs simultaneously process organic matter through microbial carbon pumps and sequester carbon via selective molecular preservation, benefiting from optimizing hydropower management in riverine ecosystems."

Lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxides (NCM), the predominant cathode materials in modern LIBs, are of particular concern because of their high content of redox-active transition metals (TMs). Nevertheless, their dissolution behavior and underlying molecular mechanisms under environmentally relevant conditions are poorly understood. In this study, we systematically examined four commercial NCM compositions (NCM111, 523, 622, and 811) under environmentally relevant variables, including pH, temperature, salinity, and organic ligands. Lithium ions (Li+) exhibited high solubility across all conditions (>80%), whereas nickel ions (Ni2+), cobalt ions (Co2+), and manganese ions (Mn2+) demonstrated low but environmentally sensitive release (∼2%). Compared with temperature, salinity, and humic acid, metal dissolution was governed primarily by pH and citric acid. Density functional theory (DFT), combined with the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model, revealed that environmental factors influence the dissolution free energy (ΔG) through proton attack, ligand binding, ionic strength, and lattice destabilization. Experiments conducted in six representative waters further confirmed enhanced Ni2+ and Co2+ release in acidic, organic-rich leachates. Collectively, these findings provide mechanistic insights into NCM dissolution pathways and contribute to risk assessment and sustainable management strategies for spent LIBs."

In the present study, we combined cellular physiology, transcriptomics, and quantitative lipidomics to test how nitrate or ammonium enrichment alters coral responses to ocean warming. The findings indicated that nitrate enrichment and an elevated temperature acted synergistically to aggravate oxidative stress and exacerbate bleaching. Under heat stress, nitrate reduced photosynthetic membrane lipids, ceramides, and coenzyme Q, lowering photosynthetic efficiency in Symbiodiniaceae, and induced upregulation of genes for pro-inflammatory lipid biosynthesis in the coral host. By contrast, ammonium enrichment and elevated temperature acted antagonistically to reduce susceptibility to bleaching. Under heat stress, ammonium increased photosynthetic membrane lipids and photosynthetic efficiency in Symbiodiniaceae, while in the coral host, it decreased pro-inflammatory lipids, increased ceramide levels, upregulated genes involved in heat shock protein 70 orthologues, and re-established symbiosis. These divergent effects indicate that nitrate and ammonium activate distinct lipid-mediated pathways and stress responses that differentially regulate coral susceptibility to heat stress, with important implications for managing nitrogen pollution under ocean warming."

However, its implementation in real wastewater remains challenging, with limited strategies to address interference from coexisting ions. Here, we identify Mg2+ as a representative precipitation-prone impurity and demonstrate that pulsed electrolysis effectively alleviated its inhibitory effects. Under optimized pulsed conditions, the nitrate removal and ammonia yield rate reached 98.0% and 3544.7 μg h–1 cm–2, respectively, restoring the lost performance under static operation with Mg2+ (85.3% and 2821.5 μg h–1 cm–2) and matching the Mg2+-free baseline (96.1% and 3449.0 μg h–1 cm–2). Mechanistic studies revealed three key functions of pulsing: (i) suppression of local pH elevation, which limits Mg2+ precipitation and particle growth on the catalyst surface; (ii) dynamic modulation of interfacial ion distributions, reducing Mg2+ accumulation via electric-field-induced repulsion; and (iii) K+ enrichment at the interface, which increases the energy barrier (1.15 eV) for Mg2+ adsorption and enhances NO3– conversion. The pulsed strategy also effectively mitigated cationic interference in complex multi-ion wastewater analogs, demonstrating its broad applicability.

In this study, the effects of FCDs and glucose CDs on feeding behavior in mice were elucidated from the perspectives of gut microbiome, metabolic flow monitoring, and metabolomics. The results demonstrated that persistent intake of FCDs (25 mg/kg/day) for 30 days significantly caused diminished appetite. Mechanistic findings suggested that FCDs were involved in the regulation of appetite reduction through the microbiota–gut–brain axis. FCDs induce perturbations in the gut microbiota, leading to increased levels of intestinal inflammation. In addition, the intake of FCDs was directly involved in microbial metabolism to generate SCFAs, activate intestinal GPR-41/43, promote the release of glucagon-like peptide, and further stimulate the hypothalamus to significantly downregulate the expression of AGRP and upregulate the expression of POMC, ultimately leading to the reduction of appetite. Moreover, intake of FCDs regulates intestinal fatty acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and other factors affecting the level of health of the organism. The present work highlights the impact of dietary intake of source FCDs on ingestion, providing unique perspectives on the potential health threats of FCDs."

The existence of cratonic basins indicates protracted periods of tectonic modification, causing subsidence within global continental interiors. An enigmatic aspect of this process is the cessation of subsidence in cratonic basins with unclear mechanisms. Here, using full‐wave ambient noise tomography, we reveal distinct seismic low‐velocity anomalies below 60 km beneath the Illinois and Michigan Basins, where subsidence terminated in the late Paleozoic to the early Mesozoic. These low‐velocity volumes, surrounded by distinctly higher velocities, are attributed to asthenospheric materials upwelling to shallow mantle depths during lithospheric foundering or delamination. This lithospheric modification may be associated with a major regional tectonic exhumation in the early Mesozoic that could have terminated basin subsidence and unroofed upper portions of basin stratigraphy. This timing coincides with the passage of this region over mantle plumes, which likely triggered lithospheric delamination and asthenospheric upwelling. Geodynamic modeling shows that the emplacement of these buoyant asthenospheric materials would lead to an uplift of about 3.5 km, sufficient to terminate the subsidence in the cratonic basins within this region. These findings document evidence of lithospheric delamination in the North American midcontinent and present important links between geodynamic drivers and geological records of the evolution of the cratonic lithosphere in North America and beyond. They also offer broader implications for understanding how deep Earth processes shape surface environments, influencing resource distribution and long‐term landscape evolution."

However, it remains unclear whether tree planting alters patterns and acclimation of hydraulic traits across spatial scales. Here, we compiled a site‐level data set of hydraulic traits in natural (NF) and planted forests (PF) to examine trait patterns and relationships, quantified environmental and ecological drivers on ecosystem‐scale hydraulic traits of PF and NF across China, and computationally projected future trait acclimation using the space‐for‐time approach. We identified distinct differences in hydraulic traits between NF and PF, with PF exhibiting higher hydraulic safety but lower hydraulic efficiency than NF at the species level. NF demonstrated a trade‐off between hydraulic efficiency and safety, whereas PF exhibited a contrasting positive correlation between these traits. We confirmed that both environmental and ecological factors influence ecosystem‐scale hydraulic traits in NF and PF, although dominant drivers vary among specific traits. Projections under future climate scenarios suggest that, despite persistent differences in trait acclimation between NF and PF, both forest types tend to exhibit increased water‐use efficiency and enhanced drought resistance in response to rising precipitation and air dryness. These findings provide a valuable benchmark for estimating potential changes in hydraulic traits under climate change, supporting improved simulations of carbon and water fluxes in response to climate and anthropogenic influences."

Therefore, given the increasing impacts of droughts on economic and environmental issues, understanding the baseflow drought (BFD) evolution and its drivers are critical. In this study, we quantify and analyze the long‐term evolution of BFD characteristics across the Contiguous United States. We use long‐term daily baseflow values of DeepBase data set and explainable machine learning models to identify and rank the climatic and physical drivers of BFD. Our analysis reveals notable regional disparities in BFDs, with western regions, particularly the Southwest, experiencing increased frequency and prolonged durations, while much of the eastern areas show declining trends. During the past decade, BFD frequency has been governed mainly by anomalies in the atmospheric water balance and by soil properties. Its duration has been primarily influenced by hydrogeologic attributes, and its intensity has been modulated most strongly by topographic setting. Highlighting the non‐stationary and complex nature of BFD mechanisms, our results have practical implications for water resource management and drought adaptation strategies."

Here, the authors show that intact TRLs, not just their remnants, promote atherosclerosis and vascular inflammation in a mouse model. 
 Increased fasting and postprandial triglyceride levels are risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Partially metabolized triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) termed remnants are created when intestinally-derived chylomicrons and liver secreted very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) interact with lipoprotein lipase (LpL) situated on the luminal surface of capillary endothelial cells. Higher circulating remnant levels have been implicated as the reason for the relationship between TRL levels and CVD. We hypothesized that nascent lipoproteins not only remnants are atherogenic. To test this, we created mice with induced whole-body lipoprotein lipase (LpL) deficiency combined with LDL receptor (LDLR) deficiency. On an atherogenic Western-type diet (WD), male and female mice with induced global LpL deficiency (iLpl-/-) and LDLR knockdown (Ldlrkd) developed hypertriglyceridemia and elevated cholesterol levels; all the increased cholesterol was in chylomicrons or large VLDL. After 12 weeks on a WD, atherosclerotic lesions both in the brachiocephalic artery and the aortic root were more severe in iLpl-/-/Ldlrkd mice than control Ldlrkd mice. Aorta from hypertriglyceridemic mice had changes in the transcriptomes of endothelial cells, macrophages, and smooth muscle cells indicating vascular inflammation. Our data show that intact TRLs contribute to atherosclerosis, explain the association of postprandial lipemia and vascular disease and prove that non-remnant TRLs are not benign. Elevated triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs), long linked to cardiovascular disease, were thought to be harmful mainly in their remnant form. Here, the authors show that intact TRLs, not just their remnants, promote atherosclerosis and vascular inflammation in a mouse model."

 Biological sex shapes the manifestation and progression of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), however, the underlying mechanisms remains unclear. Hemideletion of the 16p11.2 region (16p11.2 del/+) is associated with NDDs, and 16p11.2 del/+ mice exhibit sex-specific, striatum-related phenotypes relevant to NDDs. In this study, using snRNA-seq, we identify cell type- and sex-specific transcriptomic changes in D1- and D2-spiny projection neurons (SPNs), with greater impact in males. Fiber photometry recordings reveal reduced neuronal activity in the dorsal striatum of 16p11.2 del/+ males, but not females, with D2-SPNs identified as the primary contributors to this reduction. Behaviorally, we utilize conditional genetic approaches and find that selective hemideletion in D2-SPNs, but not D1-SPNs, induces male-specific hyperactivity, whereas cortical hemideletion increases hyperactivity in both sexes. Thus, a locus linked to NDDs acts in distinct striatal circuits, selectively impacting behavior in a sex- and cell type-specific manner. This study demonstrates that 16p11.2 hemideletion, a genetic deletion linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, affects male and female mice differently, altering specific striatal neuronal circuits and driving sex-specific behavioral changes."

 Depression disorder is a global health crisis, due to its high prevalence. Yet clinical treatments are inadequate. Uncovering the neural correlates of depression remission is a vital step toward developing effective therapies. Using a method termed therapeutic network mapping, we performed secondary analyses on the data of 16 longitudinal experiments and found that the network of the amygdala was commonly modulated by three antidepressant therapies (pharmacotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy, and magnetic seizure therapy). This therapeutic network was i) validated by two independent treatment datasets of patients with depression and a prospective preclinical experiment on male rats, ii) associated with networks of depression-related genes, neurotransmitters, and cognitions, and iii) also the target network of deep brain stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Finally, a longitudinal rTMS experiment indicated that strengthened therapeutic network connectivity is associated with higher depressant alleviation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that distinct antidepressant therapies act on a common network with potential targets for developing effective therapies. This study demonstrated that distinct antidepressant therapies act on a common brain network.

Here, the authors use positron annihilation spectroscopy combined with theory to detect and identify vacancy-type point defects. 
 Antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) has an optimal bandgap and absorption coefficient for thin film solar cell applications and comprises earth abundant elements. The rate of increase in reported power conversion efficiencies has slowed due to a persistently large open circuit voltage deficit attributed to detrimental concentrations of point defects. Here we use depth-profiling positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy to study Sb2Se3 crystals and thin films. The method is specific to neutral and negative charge states of vacancy-related defects. Both monovacancy and divacancy defects are identified in intrinsic and n-type samples but no monovacancy defects are detected in the p-type sample. Comparison of the experimental positron lifetimes with density functional theory calculated values provide evidence for the observation of Sb monovacancies in the –3 state and of Se monovacancies in the –2 state. The results are consistent with recent density function theory predictions that the Sb and the Se monovacancy defects both have accessible negative charge states.

Here, authors show a nose-to-brain axis whereby such odors activate olfactory-piriform circuits that diverge to mediodorsal thalamic nucleus and nucleus accumbens to mediate retching-like behavior and aversion. 
 Rancid odors can trigger retching and aversion in humans that prevent consumption of spoiled food, and consequently metabolic dysregulation, but the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that exposure to 2-methylbutyric acid (2MBA) odor triggers such defensive responses in male mice, mediated by a nose-to-brain axis. 2MBA perception in olfactory epithelium activates neurons in olfactory bulb (OB) projecting to glutamatergic neurons in anterior piriform cortex (aPirGlu), which in turn project to either the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD), which innervates respiratory muscles to drive retching-like behaviors, or project to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) to drive aversion. Artificial inhibition of the nose→OB→aPir→MDGlu→respiratory muscles circuit diminishes retching-like behaviors, but not aversion, while inhibiting the nose→OB→aPir→NAc circuit diminishes aversion, but not retching-like behaviors. These findings thus establish a nose-to-brain axis for rancid odor-triggered retching and aversion in male mice, advancing our understanding of sensory-motor integration and whole-body neural bases of defensive responses to odor.

Here, the authors introduce an adaptive prosthetic foot that equalizes ground contact pressure and reduces compensatory strategies and gait asymmetries compared with a traditional carbon fibre foot. 
 The flat, stiff sole of energy-storage-and-return prosthetic feet hinders adaptation to irregular terrains. This is among the causes both of high falling risk and of the consequential arising compensatory mechanisms in prosthetic users. To overcome that, we introduce the SoftFoot Pro, an anthropomorphic and adaptive prosthetic foot featuring a flexible and inextensible sole that passively adapts to obstacles, widening the ground contact area. Experimental comparison to a traditional carbon fibre foot in two unilateral transtibial prosthetic users highlights that the adaptive design reduces stance torque and power consumption at the contralateral knee and at both hips, both on level and uneven grounds. The more even load distribution between the two limbs reduces compensatory strategies and gait asymmetries, resulting in biomechanics closer to that of unimpaired individuals. These findings hold promise for enhancing quality of life for individuals with limb loss, potentially improving stability and reducing fall risk.

 The significant challenges pose by the high recurrence and metastasis rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) persist in its diagnosis and treatment. Activating innate immunity in CRC treatment has the potential to reduce drug resistance and side effects. Here, we develop a biomimetic platform by utilizing antimicrobial peptide-functionalized CRC cell membranes to encapsulate a cobalt-based metal-organic framework (C), hereby called peptide-functionalized camouflage C (PfCC). When injected into tumour-bearing mice, PfCC will degrade under the acidic condition of the tumour microenvironment and release cobalt ions, which react with endogenous H2S to generate black stellate precipitates with good photothermal properties, recruiting NK cells and mitigates the immunosuppressive tumour-microenvironment. Simultaneously, the degradation of PfCC will release structure-protected antimicrobial peptides, inhibiting harmful bacteria, such as Desulfovibrio, and reducing H2S production. The abovementioned synergistic top-down regulation of H2S promote the polarization of macrophages and further activates the innate immune response. Moreover, experiments including the convex hull algorithm from AI deep learning of the segment anything model indicate that PfCC exhibites the most effective therapeutic effect compared with the single H2S-regulated therapeutic modality. Taken together, PfCC represents a potential anti-cancer therapy for CRC with the combined effect of immune-regulation and the regulation of the gut flora.

 Existing estimates of carbon sequestration by coastal vegetated ecosystems (e.g., kelp forests, seagrass meadows) remain highly uncertain because they utilize few measurements with high uncertainty or focus on individual stocks or fluxes. Here, we combine empirical data with modeling to generate detailed carbon budgets for kelp forests and eelgrass meadows in Nova Scotia, Canada. Our budgeting showed that the release and export of dissolved organic carbon accounts for substantially more carbon sequestered by these habitats than has been estimated globally (98.5 ± 64.6% for kelp and 84 ± 36.0% for eelgrass), suggesting this carbon pathway has been undervalued. Further, kelp forests are estimated to sequester more carbon than eelgrass by ~1.3 orders of magnitude (27 ± 19% and 12.1 ± 6.3% of annual net primary production for kelp and eelgrass) mainly due to their large habitat area, highlighting their significant but largely overlooked role in ocean carbon sequestration relative to other blue carbon ecosystems.

We find that Pacific wind stress curl changes induce a southward migration of equatorial currents that reduce surface transport through the Halmahera Sea. The projected weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation generates Kelvin waves that propagate into the ITF region and weaken thermocline and intermediate flow through Makassar Strait and Maluku Sea.

Given that the majority of ignitions are human‐caused and potentially preventable, improving the ability to predict fire occurrence is critical for effective wildfire prevention and risk mitigation. We used over 500,000 wildfire ignition records from 2000 to 2020 to develop machine learning models that predict daily ignition probability across the WUS and incorporate a wide range of physical, biological, social, and administrative variables. A key innovation of this work is development of novel sampling techniques for representing ignition absence. Unlike traditional purely random sampling or hyper‐sampling, which does not account for temporally autocorrelated factors (such as droughts, insect outbreaks, and heatwaves) and spatially autocorrelated factors (such as proximity to human settlements, infrastructure presence, and fuel type), we introduce spatially and temporally stratified sampling of ignition absence. By drawing absence samples near the location and time of historical ignitions, we better captured the complex environmental and anthropogenic conditions associated with fire occurrence or lack thereof. Models trained without stratified sampling produced ignition probability maps that consistently overestimated fire risk during high fire danger periods, whereas models incorporating stratified fire absence samples more accurately captured the spatial and temporal variability of fire potential and achieved predictive accuracies exceeding 95%. In addition to operational utility for fire prevention and resource allocation, our approach offers insights into the drivers of wildfire ignitions and highlights the value of incorporating spatial and temporal structure in absence sampling for wildfire modeling."

Here, the authors show that when Src-family signaling kinases lack their typical myristoylation, an alternative acetylated start is detected by DCAF10, directing them to degradation. 
 Co-translational N-terminal modifications such as methionine excision, acetylation, and myristoylation govern protein stability, localization, and folding. Disruption can expose N-terminal degrons that trigger ubiquitin-mediated degradation, safeguarding the proteome. N-terminal acetylation usually protects proteins from degradation, but can also promote it through the Ac/N-degron pathway. Src-family kinases (SFKs), signaling enzymes implicated in tumorigenesis, require N-terminal myristoylation for function. Using peptide pull-downs, mass spectrometry, and AlphaFold 3 predictions, we identify DCAF10 as the E3 ligase substrate receptor for alternatively N-terminally acetylated SFKs. Combining siRNA-mediated knockdown and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of endogenous Lyn with inducible Lyn-GFP variants confirms that DCAF10 regulates SFK levels by recognizing an N-terminal acetylated glycine residue. In vitro, a CUL4A-DDB1-DCAF10 complex ubiquitinates N-terminally acetylated SFKs. Thus, we define a novel N-degron pathway that monitors replacement of myristoylation by acetylation and activates degradation of SFKs upon acetylation. This mechanism may extend to other N-terminally myristoylated proteins beyond SFKs. Cells depend on early protein modifications for proper function. Here, the authors show that when Src-family signaling kinases lack their typical myristoylation, an alternative acetylated start is detected by DCAF10, directing them to degradation."

 Enhancing the toughness while achieving triggerable degradation in single-network polymer systems without modifying their inherent chemical composition or network architecture remains a significant challenge. Here we demonstrate a smart end-linked polymer network that “self-strengthen” during use yet “self-destruct” upon certain stimuli. Embedding nonscissile cyclobutane-fused tetrahydrofuran mechanophores within the middle of end-linked polymer networks significantly enhances both toughness and degradability. Under mechanical stress, the force-coupled cycloreversion of these mechanophores releases concealed chain segments, enabling single-network materials to exhibit threefold toughness and tenfold tear energies compared to conventional counterparts. Additionally, ball-milling griding of the bulk material unveils acid-sensitive enol ether units, leading to a markedly improved degradation profile under acidic conditions. This dual effect—originating from the force-coupled cycloreversion of cyclobutane-fused tetrahydrofuran mechanophores—provides an ideal combination of superior mechanical performance and on-demand degradability. Achieving both high toughness and degradability in mechanophore containing polymer networks is a challenge.

 WRN helicase is an established synthetic lethal target for inhibition in the treatment of microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) and mismatch repair deficient (MMRd) cancers. The identification of helicase inhibitors is challenging as high-throughput biochemical screening campaigns typically return few validated hits that are often inactive in cell-based assays. Herein, we highlight the power of non-covalent fragment-based lead discovery in locating new druggable allosteric sites on WRN, enabling us to bypass the challenging behavior of WRN during high-throughput screening hampering hit identification. During the fragment optimization process, structures of WRN with key prioritized fragments reveal multiple conformations of WRN with significant domain rotations up to 180°, including a WRN conformation not previously described. Rooted in a combination of biochemical, biophysical, and structural approaches, we present the detailed analyses of optimized chemical matter evolved from screening hits and the unique ability of WRN to accommodate diverse conformations as detailed by structural characterization.

 Recent seismological and geodetic observations have revealed shallow slow earthquakes on subduction megathrusts, offering an opportunity to explore the factors controlling megathrust slip. Identifying these controlling factors helps constrain the potential updip extent of future megathrust ruptures. Here, we investigate the factors controlling the spatial extent of shallow slow earthquakes by integrating tremor locations with uncertainty estimates, detailed bathymetry data, and multichannel seismic data for the 2020–2021 slow earthquake sequence in the Kumano-nada region of the Nankai Trough. Tremor probability maps reveal that the updip, downdip, and lateral limits of tremor activity coincide with distinct structural boundaries. These include the kink or branching of the décollement, a deep-seated strike-slip fault, and the inner–outer wedge boundary. These structures likely act as geometrical or mechanical barriers, further influenced by variations in pore-fluid pressure and by the subducted Paleo–Zenisu ridge. The results indicate that megathrust geometry, material properties of the overriding prism, fluid distribution, and ridge subduction jointly govern the spatial extent of slow earthquakes, emphasizing the need to account for these factors in assessing the potential extent of future megathrust ruptures. This study shows that slow earthquake slip in the Nankai Trough is confined by structural barriers, including fault geometry, material contrasts, and subducted ridges, revealing key controls on the potential extent of future megathrust ruptures."

Jiang et al. address this by designing an additive to modulate the crystallization thermodynamics of wide-bandgap perovskite, achieving a record efficiency of 22.1% in a flexible cell. 
 Wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskites with bandgaps exceeding 1.8 eV are suitable for perovskite/organic or multi-junction tandem solar cell (TSC) applications. However, their complex components easily induce hardly controlled phase heterogeneity and defects during the crystallization process. Herein, we propose a multifunctional additive, DL-methionine methylsulfonium chloride, with a unique combination of functional groups to regulate the crystallization thermodynamics and passivate defects of WBG perovskites. Our comprehensive experimental and computational results reveal that the additive synergistically promotes the nucleation kinetics and improves phase homogeneity during the crystallization process, thereby achieving uniform and low-defect perovskite films, significantly suppressing the non-radiative recombination and phase segregation. Consequently, the single-junction 1.83 eV-WBG perovskite solar cells demonstrate a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.4% and notably enhanced operational stability. Furthermore, impressive PCEs of 26.0% and 22.1% are achieved for rigid and flexible perovskite/organic TSCs, respectively, showing great promise for pursuing flexible tandem applications. Defect formation and phase instability remain critical challenges for perovskite/organic tandem solar cells.

Academic literature exploring how people perceive and respond to wildfire smoke has grown rapidly in the past decade. We conducted this systematic review with three objectives: to characterize the topical, geographic, and disciplinary focus of existing research, examine the application of established behavioral theories to smoke protection behaviors, and identify emergent themes and research gaps. Following PRISMA standards, we systematically reviewed papers focusing on individual-level human perception or behavioral responses to wildfire smoke events. We extracted information on eight psychosocial constructs across three levels: intrapersonal (cognitive processes: emotions, threat appraisal, coping appraisal), interpersonal (social influences: social networks, social norms), and contextual factors (past experience, access to information, demographic attributes). Our review of 39 studies reveals an emerging field concentrated in the Western US and dominated by public health perspectives. Only ten studies employed explicit theoretical models. We found complex relationships between psychosocial constructs: while people generally recognize smoke as threatening, the relationship between threat perception and protective action remains complex, with mixed findings regarding past experience and coping appraisal. Social networks play a paradoxical role, providing crucial support during smoke events while being disrupted by smoke-induced isolation that prevents normal social gathering. Social norms around smoke protection remain underexplored. Socially vulnerable populations are underrepresented despite facing heightened exposure risks. We identify significant research gaps regarding emotional responses, social norms, and community-level interventions. Enhanced understanding of wildfire smoke responses can improve interventions and policies to promote public health and community adaptation to wildfire smoke."

It evaluates the performance of the dataset, against in-situ snow depth observations. This dataset is found to perform well in most environments, with challenges at high elevation and some coastal areas. Assessing the quality of this dataset is necessary in order to use it as a baseline to infer future changes of extreme snow loads under climate change. 
 Large snow load events are a major hazard for both human societies, in particular buildings and transport safety, and natural ecosystems. National and European frameworks provide guidelines and standards in order to take into account extreme snow load hazard in infrastructure design. However, there is a lack of reference data for their implementation. This is even more challenging in the context of climate change, which modifies the frequency and intensity of major snow load events. In the context of the Framework Partnership Agreement on Copernicus User Uptake, we have developed a pan-European extreme value analysis of annual snow load maxima based on the Mountain Tourism Meteorological and Snow Indicators (MTMSI) dataset available from the Copernicus Climate Change Service. This dataset includes reanalysis data for the period 1962–2015, based on the UERRA (Uncertainties in Ensembles of Regional Reanalyses) reanalysis and snow cover simulations, and past and future climate projections based on regional climate simulations for the period 1951–2100. Here, we describe the evaluation of the MTMSI reanalysis component in terms of annual snow depth maxima against multiple in-situ observation datasets. Results are provided at the NUTS-3 (Nomenclature des unités territoriales statistiques) scale used in MTMSI, for multiple elevations over a large area stretching from the European Alps to the Scandinavian countries. For 75 % of the comparisons between observed and simulated snow depth maxima, we report absolute bias scores between −0.23 and 0.15 m, correlations above 0.59, and a Kling–Gupta Efficiency metric above 0.29. We identify some areas where MTMSI does not adequately portray in-situ observations of snow depth maxima, located in the Alps and coastal areas of the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Croatia. This study thus provides background information for assessing the relevance of this pan-European dataset in terms of annual snow depth maxima, relevant for annual snow mass and snow load maxima based on complementary information derived from snow cover model output. The MTMSI annual maximum snow depth reanalysis dataset is available through the following link: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15181401 (Kamir et al., 2025)."

Here we create an automatic workflow using machine and deep learning techniques to process five years of data in the western coast of South America. This allows us to detect smaller earthquakes than before, creating a catalogue of seismicity that contains far more events than other regional catalogues. 
 In this study we process 5 years of continuous seismic data, from 2017 to 2021, recorded by networks deployed along the Chilean convergent margin of western South America. We select a set of stations so that coverage is as continuous and consistent in time as possible. Thus, changes in the catalogue are mainly due to the processes responsible for the seismicity itself and not network artifacts. For phase picking, we use the deep-learning algorithm Earthquake Transformer, PyOcto for association, NonLinLoc for location and HypoDD for relocation. To handle the large spatial extent of the study area, we create a partitioning workflow that mitigates problems that arise from associator and location codes working in cartesian coordinates. This allows us to obtain a main seismicity catalogue with over 600 000 double-difference relocated events and a completeness magnitude of ∼2.5, with events located using an existing 3D velocity model (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15284375, Riedel-Hornig et al., 2025). While this provides better location accuracy than a 1D or 2D velocity model, it limits the final catalogue to the extent of the 3D velocity model which does not cover our whole study area. Therefore, we create a secondary seismicity catalogue for the region to the south of the 3D model. Our catalogues provide a dense, high-resolution dataset, with large spatial extent, for the interpretation of seismic processes along the western South American Margin."

 We present GEMS-GER (Groundwater Levels, Environment, Meteorology, Site Properties), the first benchmark dataset specifically designed for machine learning applications in long-term groundwater level modeling in Germany. The dataset comprises 32 years of gapless weekly observations from 3207 monitoring wells, enriched with meteorological forcing variables and more than 50 site-specific static attributes. All data have undergone extensive preprocessing, including harmonization, outlier removal, and iterative imputation, to ensure high quality and suitability for machine learning applications. The wells are spatially distributed across Germany and cover diverse hydrogeological settings and aquifer types.  To demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we provide three initial benchmark models: a single-well CNN model, a global LSTM model using dynamic inputs, and a global LSTM model incorporating both dynamic and static features. The best-performing model achieves satisfactory predictive performance (NSE > 0.5) for more than half (52 %) of the wells, which is generally considered a solid result in the context of groundwater-level modeling.GEMS-GER is openly available under an open-access license via Zenodo, accompanied by detailed documentation (Ohmer et al., 2025; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15530171).

Chemical substitution enables us to address this challenge but requires significant methodological advancements and testing to become mature and more widely adopted worldwide. We use insights from life cycle assessment (LCA) to explore and synthesize synergies for advancing substitution approaches, including alternatives assessment and comparative safe and sustainable-by-design (SSbD). We screen boundary conditions for LCA and substitution and use an illustrative case study on comparing two sets of pest control options to discuss learnings for addressing challenges toward a mature chemical substitution field. For some aspects, LCA provides strong inspiration to inform developments of substitution approaches, such as using a common functional comparison basis, aligning assessment metrics and units, and considering full life cycles to avoid burden shifting. For other aspects, LCA is less informative and substitution requires additional developments. This includes systematic overviews of possible context-specific alternatives, mapping of chemical, material, and other functions, more detailed life cycle inventories, and rapid-screening assessment methods. Combining learnings from LCA with ways to address remaining challenges will help advance chemical substitution to support the objectives of UNEP’s Global Framework on Chemicals and other policy instruments for a broader, much needed sustainability transition."

This study aims to characterize these effects for two compounds, glyphosate (a PPP) and triclosan (a PPCP), in Daphnia magna juveniles and to trace the downstream consequences for gut- and brain-associated metabolite levels, reproductive performance, and behavior. Both compounds altered levels of neurotransmitters and related metabolites in both head and gut at the ppb–ppt dose range, promoting anxiogenic behavior and inhibiting reproductive traits in a concentration-related manner. These effects occurred concomitantly with alterations in the gut microbiome, analyzed by 16S rDNA sequencing. Correlation analyses between the observed metabolic, reproductive, and behavioral effects and the changes in the metabolic pathway prediction for the treated gut microbiomes revealed an enrichment in pathways related to the biosynthesis of vitamins, of essential fatty acids, and production of short chain fatty acids, which are known to affect systemic serotonin levels.

The Yellow River Delta (YRD), once prograding seaward at ∼10 km2/yr, began retreating at −5.6 km2/yr following completion of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir. Implementation of the Water and Sediment Regulation Scheme (WSRS)—a reservoir flushing program—fundamentally reversed this trend. By mobilizing trapped sediment and enhancing downstream channel scouring, the WSRS increased sediment delivery to the sea from 17.6 Mt/yr before its initiation to 178.5 Mt/yr during operation years. This renewed sediment flux restored delta growth, producing subaerial expansion of 6–7 km2/yr and significant subaqueous deposition near the estuary. These results demonstrate that the YRD has entered a new phase of evolution under active human management and highlight that sediment trapped behind dams can become a potentially important source for restoring sediment‐starved deltas worldwide."

To address this limitation, we developed a novel matching algorithm to construct a synthetic population at the address‐level. To demonstrate how our approach can improve environmental justice (EJ) analyses and health impact assessments (HIAs), we examined sociodemographic patterns of residential proximity to major roadways in Greater Boston (Massachusetts) and HIA results, comparing our method with a random address allocation method. The synthetic population was developed at a census tract‐level using US Census microdata and combinatorial optimization methods and then downscaled to address‐level parcels by matching building attributes to synthetic households. We designated households within 50 m of a major road “high exposure” and households below state median household income “low income”.We found misclassification for individual households (21% of the high exposure/low‐income households in the matched data set were identified as such in the random allocation data set). We found modest aggregate differences in matched allocation (3.3% of low‐income households had high exposure) compared to random allocation (3.4%). In a HIA, the difference between random and matched allocation would be stronger when there is a strong interactive effect between a sociodemographic effect modifier and exposure on the outcome. Address‐level exposure assignment based on synthetic populations can provide more significant and nuanced health impact and EJ analyses. Our novel method can be applied to other regions of the US and expanded to other dimensions of population vulnerability."

 RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcribes cytosolic transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and other non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) essential to cellular function. However, many aspects of Pol III transcription and processing, including RNA modifications, remain poorly understood, mainly due to a lack of available sensitive and systematic methods for their analysis. Here, we present DRAP3R (Direct Read and Analysis of Polymerase III transcribed RNAs), a modified nanopore direct RNA sequencing approach and analysis framework that enables the specific and sensitive capture of pre-mature Pol III transcribed RNAs. Applying DRAP3R to distinct cell types, we identify previously unconfirmed tRNA genes and other novel Pol III transcribed RNAs, thus expanding the known Pol III transcriptome. Critically, DRAP3R also enables discrimination between co- and post-transcriptional RNA modifications such as pseudouridine (Ψ) and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) at single-nucleotide resolution across all examined transcript types and reveals differential Ψ installation patterns across tRNA isodecoders and other ncRNAs. Finally, applying DRAP3R to epithelial cells infected with Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 reveals an extensive remodelling of both the Pol III transcriptome and epitranscriptome. Our findings thus establish DRAP3R as a powerful tool for systematically studying Pol III transcribed RNAs and their modifications in diverse cellular contexts.

 Strike-slip restraining bends, such as the Levant Fault, belonging to push-up systems and the Jamaican fault network, belonging to duplex systems, display a diversity of fault geometries and deformation patterns that reflect distinct modes of lithospheric-scale strain localization. To investigate the origin of this variability, we develop 3D numerical models of transpressional strike-slip systems using heterogeneous simple shear boundary conditions and thermally-dependent, non-linear rheology. Unlike classical analog or numerical models that impose velocity discontinuities, our approach allows spontaneous fault localization that naturally generates transpression. We systematically explore how the position and geometry of inherited weak zones influence fault development. We show that three distinct strike-slip systems emerge: (1) push-up systems with a single strike-slip fault and outward-propagating thrusts; (2) duplex systems with interacting parallel faults connected by P-shears; and (3) systems of non-interacting parallel faults. These results highlight spontaneous strike-slip localization and how initial heterogeneities control formation and evolution of long-term lithospheric deformation.

 Whether a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine is necessary for adolescents remains controversial. We conducted a retrospective cohort study from the Immunization Information System and The National Notifiable Disease Reporting System to evaluate the impact of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination programs (universal infant hepatitis B immunization and adolescent booster) on HBV infection. The vaccine effectiveness (VE) of hepatitis B vaccine is 64.43% (95% CI 57.78% − 71.08%) within 10 years of birth, escalates to 95.36% (95% CI 94.84% − 95.88%) by 20 years, and decreases to 67.35% (95% CI 63.86% − 70.85%) by 30 years. Compared with Beijing’s birth-vaccinated-only group, the booster group showed a lower relative VE in the first 10 years but a slight increase thereafter. Compared with the national control group, the booster group maintained a relatively high relative VE with a smaller decline magnitude. This study demonstrates that adolescent HBV booster vaccination administered during junior high school improves hepatitis B surface antibody levels and contributes to a further reduction in the incidence of HBV infection.

Here, authors visualize and quantify strain in layered oxides through electron backscatter diffraction imaging, revealing heterogeneous, cycle-dependent distortions that slow Li transport and limit capacity, with irreversible layer bending driving capacity fade. 
 Lattice strain critically affects electrochemical performance and durability of battery electrode materials. Here we report an electron-backscatter-diffraction-based imaging method to quantify lattice strain evolution and its spatial heterogeneity in two technologically important layered oxide cathodes (i.e. positive electrodes). Quantitative analysis is achieved by examining numerical distribution of the crystal misorientation data from thousands of positive electrode particles, which follows a positively skewed distribution. We reveal pronounced lattice strain heterogeneities both within individual grains and across different particles. These strain variations self-heal during relithiation but intensify with deeper delithiation and repeated cycling. The increased strain impedes Li-ion bulk diffusion, thereby limiting the maximum accessible capacity, especially at high current densities. Three-dimensional pole-figure analysis further identifies layer bending and layer twisting as the two major lattice distortion modes in the electrochemically cycled positive electrode particles. The accumulation of the unrecoverable layer bending governs the kinetically controlled capacity loss in the layered oxide positive electrodes. Lattice strain impacts battery cathode performance and cycle life. Here, authors visualize and quantify strain in layered oxides through electron backscatter diffraction imaging, revealing heterogeneous, cycle-dependent distortions that slow Li transport and limit capacity, with irreversible layer bending driving capacity fade."

 Nano-structured optomechanical crystals (OMC) form an interface between mechanical modes with long coherence times and telecom optical photons, ideal for long-distance distribution of quantum information. However, the implementation of scalable quantum networks based on OMCs has been inhibited by thermal mechanical noise. Here, we overcome this limitation using a quasi-two-dimensional OMC and generate single photons via single phonon-photon conversion. In this work, we verify the low thermal noise and high purity of the generated single photons through a Hanbury Brown-Twiss experiment with $${g}^{(2)}(0)=0.3{5}_{-0.08}^{+0.10}$$. We perform Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of the emitted photons showcasing the indistinguishability and coherence with visibility V = 0.52 ± 0.15 after 1.43 km fiber delay. Lastly, we use two-photon interference to measure the temporal wavepackets of optomechanically generated single photons demonstrating narrow bandwidths as low as 10 MHz. Our results pave the way for multinode quantum networks of mechanical oscillators and hybrid entanglement generation between mechanical oscillators and telecom quantum emitters.

 Enantioselective dicarbofunctionalization of alkenes is a powerful strategy for constructing functionalized sp³-rich molecules, yet it remains challenging for unactivated substrates lacking directing groups. While asymmetric multicomponent reactions catalyzed by d¹⁰ transition metals have advanced for activated alkenes, enantioselective multicomponent cross-coupling of unactivated alkenes, particularly enabling remote functionalization to stereoselectively generate the nonadjacent stereocenters, is still underdeveloped. Herein, we report a palladium-catalyzed asymmetric migratory dicarbofunctionalization of directing-group-free, trisubstituted unactivated alkenes. This method forges remote stereogenic centers, enabling both 1,3-diarylation and 1,4-diarylation with high enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies indicate a chain-walking process involving irreversible Pd-H migration, rationalizing the observed regiocontrol.

 High-precision metrology has laid the foundation for semiconductor fabrication and life sciences. However, existing displacement measurement approaches are incapable of performing flexible probing within complex equipment interiors. Here, we present a in situ, non-contact nano-displacement measurement approach. Leveraging a multimode fiber probe empowered by deep learning, fine feature information can be efficiently extracted from superoscillatory speckles, achieving single-ended detection with 10 nm resolution and 99.95% accuracy. A physical model is established to correlate the displacement with higher-order modes proportion in the fiber. Sub-millimeter-sized probe enables detecting targets with different structures in confined spaces. Robust recognition is achieved through joint learning, under varying fiber bending conditions and different metal materials. With extreme compression ratios of less than 0.1%, the system delivers high accuracy, low training costs, and high-speed processing. The imaging capability of the probe is also experimentally validated, proving potential as a powerful tool in applications such as lithography, weak force sensing, and super-resolution micro-endoscopy.

Through a registered report megastudy, researchers tested the ten most-cited climate change messaging strategies published, finding that many had significant, but small, effects on climate change attitudes. 
 It is important to understand how persuasive the most-cited climate change messaging strategies are. In five replication studies, we found limited evidence of persuasive effects of three highly cited strategies (N = 3,216). We then conducted a registered report megastudy (N = 13,544) testing the effects of the 10 most-cited climate change messaging strategies on Americans’ pro-environmental attitudes and behaviour. Six messages significantly affected multiple preregistered attitudes, with effects ranging from 1 to 4 percentage points. Persuasiveness varied little across party lines, inconsistent with theories predicting heterogeneous effects for targeted messages. No message increased pro-environmental donations, suggesting costly behaviours are difficult to influence with messaging alone. Inference of mechanisms driving effects was limited as the most impactful messages influenced multiple mediating variables. Taken together, these results identify several persuasive strategies, while also highlighting the limits of short-form messages for increasing Americans’ support for action to address climate change.

A study in Nepal shows that forest governance decentralization reduces poverty but the benefits are greater for dominant ethnic and caste groups compared with minority ones. 
 Decentralized approaches to natural resource governance can promote conservation while reducing poverty in the Global South. However, the local benefits under decentralized governance are often unequal, reflecting extant social inequalities. There is a lack of rigorous evidence from national-scale studies showing how decentralization programmes affect inequality compared with what is observed in decentralization’s absence, and extant theory leads to competing hypotheses about such effects. We use data from a large-scale forestry-sector decentralization programme in Nepal during 2001–2011 to test general theories regarding the effects of such initiatives on inequality. We analyse census micro-data from two nationwide censuses, which we merge with administrative data on the implementation of decentralization and analyse through a two-way fixed-effects estimation approach. We find evidence suggesting that Nepal’s programme delivers significant poverty-alleviating benefits to the dominant ethnic and caste groups and comparatively smaller benefits to members of marginalized minority groups, resulting in apparent local increases in rural inequality associated with the programme. Thus, even relatively progressive programmes, such as Nepal’s, may lead to potential trade-offs between poverty alleviation, environmental conservation and inequality outcomes. Improved compliance with equity provisions may help to equalize effects, as could more substantial targeted benefits. Decentralized natural resource governance is thought to aid conservation and reduce poverty, but its heterogeneous local effects are under-explored.

 Freshwater salinization is an emerging and largely unregulated threat to drinking water security. We identify three dominant, seasonally distinct sources of rising sodium in a drinking water supply serving 1 million people: (1) road deicers, which elevate reservoir sodium in winter, with detectable impacts at watershed impervious cover as low as 3%; (2) reclaimed water, which increases sodium during summer low flows when dilution is minimal; and (3) the drinking water treatment plant (DWTP), which adds NaOH to neutralize acidity from coagulation and in-reservoir microbial processes. In this social-ecological-technological system (SETS), salinization is tied to population growth, impervious cover, sodium-rich waste streams, nitrogen management, reservoir biogeochemistry, and DWTP operations. Framing drinking water salinization as a SETS challenge integrates behavioral and biophysical drivers with engineering and governance responses, providing a framework for adaptation in One Water systems.

However, the period immediately prior to 1850 is of particular interest due to early human influence and heightened volcanic activity, the latter of which led to cooler global temperatures than those observed in the subsequent historical period. In this study, we present a suite of Earth system model simulations (using UKESM1.1) that start in 1750 and span the entire industrial period. We compare these simulations to a new instrumental observation-based dataset, GloSATref, which provides global surface air temperature variations from 1781 onwards. We investigate the climatic changes during the early industrial period, separating the effects of natural and anthropogenic forcings. Model-simulated early-19th-century temperature patterns show substantial cooling relative to the long-term mean, particularly in low latitudes, which agree well with observed patterns. We find significant long-term differences between simulations initialized in 1750 and 1850, with lasting effects well into the 20th century, consistent with differences in vegetation and the substantial ocean cooling driven by high volcanic activity in the 1750 simulations. Our results indicate that an earlier start to historical simulations could lead to more representative climate simulations over the historical period, and deepen our understanding of early anthropogenic warming, natural climate variability, and the climate responses to future volcanic eruptions."

We find that deeper soils experience less intense but longer-lasting heatwaves than shallower ones. Since 1960, soil heatwave frequency, duration, and intensity have increased in all depths, with deeper soils showing greater increases in duration and smaller increases in intensity. These trends have been accelerated recently by ∼50% (∼100%) in shallow (deep) soils during 1990–2017, relative to 1960–2017.

The reduction in ET is associated with the decrease in water surfaces corresponding to upstream dam operations and with the construction of new urban areas. In the coastal area, a conversion from natural areas (i.e. mangroves cover) to aquaculture has been observed, leading to a slight increase in ET."

We focused on the exposure of CAFOs to 100 year and 500 year floodplains, integrating floodplain maps with location data operational characteristics, and livestock types (cattle and swine) to assess flood risk. The analysis also considered the size and construction year of each CAFO, offering insights into how older and larger operations are disproportionately vulnerable. The results indicate that over 1.9 million animal units (13% of total), are located within the 100 year floodplain. In the 500 year flood floodplain, it increases to 2.05 million animal units, representing 14% of the state’s total. Sioux, Lyon, and Hancock counties were identified as having particularly high potential flood exposure, with over 16% of animal units in Sioux County located within the 100 year floodplain, increasing to 17% within the 500 year floodplain. The study shows that larger CAFOs, particularly those built before 2004, were often located in flood-prone areas and, if either a 100- or 500 year flood occurs, would potentially affect a larger number of animal units due to their operational scale. These risks not only threaten livestock but also have far-reaching economic consequences, including significant operational disruptions, infrastructure damage, and cascading effects on supply chains and market stability. As extreme weather events become more frequent due to climate change, these findings highlight the need for heightened awareness of CAFO vulnerabilities and call for further research into adaptive strategies to protect Iowa’s agricultural sector."

 Small lakes and ponds are hotspots of biodiversity, biogeochemical reactions, and hydrological interactions in the landscape.

Many experiments did not reflect real-world conditions, especially for deeper soils and realistic temperature ranges. Simulation experiments showed that both carbon properties and environmental constraints equally drive temperature sensitivity. Current climate models miss these patterns, but our findings can help improve predictions of soil carbon responses to warming. 
 Microbial decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC) is a major source of atmospheric CO2 and a key component of climate–carbon feedbacks. Understanding how SOC mineralization responds to temperature is essential for improving climate projections. Here, we compiled a global dataset of laboratory incubation experiments measuring SOC mineralization across diverse soils and temperature regimes. The dataset reveals that 84 % of samples originated from surface soils (0–30 cm), and 50 % of incubations lasted fewer than 50 d. Incubation temperatures ranged from −10 to 60 °C, with temperature intervals used to estimate temperature sensitivity (Q10) spanning 2–40 °C; notably, 81 % of Q10 estimates were based on intervals exceeding 5 °C. Moreover, in 61 % of cases, the lower incubation temperature for Q10 estimation differed from the mean annual temperature at the sampling site by more than 5 °C, indicating a mismatch with in situ conditions. Our analysis highlights critical gaps in current experimental designs, particularly the underrepresentation of subsoils (>30 cm) and the use of temperature ranges that deviate from field conditions. We further evaluated the ability of 16 temperature response functions used in 69 land surface and/or carbon models to capture SOC mineralization patterns. Most models failed to reproduce empirical temperature response, especially at higher temperatures, albeit multi-term exponential functions showed relatively better performance. By coupling our dataset with a two-pool carbon model, we found that external environmental constraints and the intrinsic temperature response (including SOC decomposability and microbial processes) similarly influence the temperature sensitivity of SOC mineralization at the global scale, with their relative importance varying across ecosystem types. Our findings underscore the need for incubation experiments that better represent field conditions – both in depth and temperature range – and call for improved model parameterizations to enhance SOC feedback projections under future climate scenarios.

Once produced these particles are constantly being transformed (sticking together, breaking into smaller pieces and being consumed by microbes). Here, we try to understand the dynamics of these processes by testing a variety of factors, such as stickiness and water column mixing. 
 This study aims to investigate the seasonal cycle of carbon export flux in the ocean using the SISSOMA modeling framework. SISSOMA uses a 2-dimensional state space (size and excess density) to follow the fate of aggregates in the mixed layer which are transformed through three main processes, e.g., aggregation, fragmentation, and remineralization, until they eventually sink out of the surface ocean. The model tracks aggregate size, mass, and porosity which allows for a direct estimate of aggregate sinking speed through a Reynolds number modified Stokes' law. First, a simple seasonal cycle with a single peak of POM production is presented, which provides a solid basis to understand the model's framework and enables us to perform sensitivity analyses on important parameters. The effect of increased stratification on a reconstructed ecosystem in the north Atlantic is then presented and discussed. Overall, our results showcase the nonlinear relationship between the production of primary particles and the export of aggregates out of the mixed layer and unveil key mechanics of the three transformative processes. Moreover, it has been shown that remineralization rates, stickiness, and the size/ excess density characteristics of the primary particles all affect in various ways the intensity, seasonal cycle, and the resulting size spectrum of the aggregate community. Finally, our results indicate the crucial role that turbulence plays in both the timing and the magnitude of the carbon export flux which might affect not only the potential of the system to remove carbon out of the mixed layer but also have a direct impact on the organisms inhabiting the mesopelagic layer which rely on the sinking particles to cover their energetic needs."

We created a new computer model by rebuilding a traditional physics model to work with artificial intelligence. Our results show this new approach is much faster and more reliable for tuning model parameters with data. This provides a better tool to build the next generation of climate models and improve predictions of permafrost's future. 
 Accurately representing permafrost in Earth System Models is a grand challenge that creates major uncertainty. A promising path forward is to create hybrid models that synergize process-based physics with deep learning, but this is fundamentally hindered by the non-differentiable nature of traditional land surface models (LSMs), which are incompatible with modern AI workflows. To overcome this limitation, we present NoahPy, a differentiable LSM developed by reconstructing the Noah LSM's governing partial differential equations into a process-encapsulated Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), with the heat–moisture solver forming the computational core. We first demonstrate that NoahPy very closely replicates the numerical behaviour of the modified Noah LSM, achieving Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) coefficients above 0.99 for both soil temperature and liquid water. We then show that at a permafrost site, the calibrated NoahPy achieves robust simulation performance for soil temperature (NSE > 0.9) and liquid water (NSE > 0.8). Critically, the differentiable workflow, when combined with the Adam optimizer, is significantly faster, more stable, and yields simulations with lower uncertainty compared to traditional Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE-UA) calibration algorithm. NoahPy thus provides a foundational, “glass-box” framework that closes a key technical gap, enabling the development of the next generation of hybrid AI-physics models needed to more reliably predict the future of the cryosphere."

However, the mechanisms by which these conditions shape multitrophic assemblages and mediate their environmental responses remain underexplored. Here, we investigated multitrophic communities along the Yellow River, categorizing sampling sites into reservoir (RAG), low-sediment (LSG), and high-sediment (HSG) regions based on the habitat type and a suspended sediment threshold of 0.15 mg L–1. Basin-wide surveys across two seasons revealed that multitrophic species richness followed the pattern of RAG < LSG < HSG, whereas protozoan and metazoan evenness markedly declined in HSG. Among α-diversity metrics, species richness was best explained by physicochemical and hydrological variables (35.4–94.2%), suggesting its highest sensitivity to environmental filtering. The suspended sediment exhibited a threshold effect on algal and protozoan diversity, enhancing species richness at low concentrations but suppressing it at higher levels. Network analyses revealed higher multitrophic network complexity in LSG and HSG than in RAG, but cross-trophic networks in HSG exhibited the lowest robustness and fewest keystone taxa. Notably, nutrients destabilized the RAG network via diversity-mediated pathways, while intensive land use in HSG impaired stability by altering network complexity. These findings provide mechanistic insights into biodiversity dynamics in sediment-laden rivers and underscore the need to incorporate sediment dynamics into riverine biodiversity conservation frameworks."

Insects, essential for pollination, decomposition, and nutrient cycling, ingest MPs through feeding and contact. Despite growing evidence of MP-caused gut microbe imbalance, how insect gut microbiomes detect and react to MP leachates, mainly organic additives like phthalates and bisphenol A, is still unclear, limiting our understanding of adaptive resilience against toxicity. This perspective reviews microbial sensing pathways, including two-component systems, ligand-responsive transcriptional regulators, and quorum sensing, which differentiate responses to soluble leachates from inert polymers and orchestrate either enzymatic biodegradation in plastivorous species like Tenebrio molitor or detrimental shifts toward oxidative stress, immune activation via Toll and Imd pathways, and epithelial disruption. These host-microbiota feedbacks influence metabolic homeostasis, vector competence, and ecological processes including trophic transfer and biodiversity. By linking these molecular interactions to ecological processes, we propose the utilization of insect-associated symbionts in bioremediation, guided by omics-based approaches, to develop targeted interventions that mitigate plastic pollution while maintaining ecosystem functionality."

However, the current understanding of how riverine C biogeochemistry responds to global climate change remains limited. Here we evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamics of carbon dioxide (CO2) flux and phytoplankton primary productivity (PP) in the main stem and tributaries of the Three Gorges Reservoir Region between 2010 and 2023. We found that the response of the CO2 flux and PP was evident in the extremely rainy months when, on average, the CO2 flux increased by 42.5% and PP decreased by 10.7%. Spatially, we also observed significant CO2 flux and PP differences between the backwater and upstream areas of the tributaries. CO2 flux at the upstream sites was 60−266% higher than at the backwater sites, while PP at the backwater sites was 4−13 times the amount of PP at the upstream sites. Differences in flow velocity and chlorophyll concentrations between the backwater and upstream sites, which primarily originate from the water level regulation operations of the dam, are believed to dominate spatial CO2 flux and PP gradients, respectively. This study reveals the response patterns and feedback mechanisms between riverine C biogeochemistry and global climate change factors in a large dammed river and associated tributaries."

Biorefinery waste streams have emerged as promising, yet underexplored sources for P recovery.

This biocatalyst exhibited high enzyme activity (137.6 ± 3.7 U per gram of dry cell weight), maximal phosphate production rate of 75.3 ± 2.3 μM min–1, consistent full activity after 36 days, and simple regeneration via cell cultivation. We leveraged a machine learning-based approach to obtain SDEcP variants with up to 55% increase in enzyme activity and robustness for phytate conversion from real-world light steepwater. Selective phosphate recovery from SDEcP-treated steepwater was achieved by using agarose beads functionalized with phosphate-binding proteins, thus demonstrating a complete waste-to-value pathway.

In this study, we present a surfactant-assisted ultrafiltration (UF) strategy for enhanced PFAS separation through leveraging in situ assembly of PFAS molecules with the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The addition of CTAB (0.14 mM) induces the formation of nanoscale complexes or micelles with PFAS, thus promoting their effective retention by UF membranes (99.1% for 0.14 mM CTAB vs 30.3% without CTAB). Moreover, both experimental and modeling results reveal a concentration polarization effect that leads to the accumulation of CTAB on the membrane surface. As such, even when the bulk concentration of CTAB is below its critical micelle concentration, localized micelle formation occurs near the membrane interface, enabling effective retention of PFAS. Notably, the CTAB-enhanced UF process is also effective in retaining other PFAS species, especially long-chain compounds such as PFHxA. Further experiments indicate that compared with electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic interactions between PFOA and CTAB play a more dominant role in forming micelles, thereby governing the subsequent retention by UF membranes. This study offers mechanistic insights into surfactant-mediated PFAS removal and presents a scalable, low-pressure membrane strategy for the effective treatment of PFAS-contaminated water."

However, most catalysts exhibit undesirable NH3 yield rates and poor Faradaic efficiency (FE) for the NO3– reduction reaction (NO3RR) in near-neutral and low-concentration NO3–environments. Herein, the Fe-doped multivalent copper oxide (CuxO–Fe) was prepared to construct multisite interfaces that promote NO3– adsorption and H2O dissociation-protonation processes. The CuxO–Fe catalyst achieves a superior NH3 yield rate of 3.5 mg·h–1·mgcat–1 (3.9 mg·h–1·cm–2), an excellent FE of 97.7%, and a NH3 selectivity of 98.7%, outperforming Fe oxide nanoparticle-decorated CuxO (CuxO–FeOyNPs) (1.9 mg·h–1·mgcat–1, 84.7%, and 98.2%) and most of the reported catalysts in the 50–200 ppm of NO3– electrolytes. The comprehensive in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that Fe doping modulates the electronic structure and charge distribution of multivalent CuxO, achieving a high-rate NH3 synthesis by lowering *NO hydrogenation energy barriers and accelerating N–O bond cleavage. The NO3RR (Cu sites of CuO–Fe) and H2O dissociation (Fe sites of Cu–Fe) primarily occur at different active sites, favoring abundant NO3– activation and *H utilization noncompetitively. Especially, a high performance of the CuxO–Fe electrocatalyst in both actual surface water (NH3 selectivity >94.3%) and complex landfill leachate (92.6% of maximum NH3 selectivity) was achieved, demonstrating its promising practical application potential.

McIntyre,Roadway Runoff Induced Acute Mortality in Juvenile Coho Salmon During Spring Storm Events,"Extensive mortalities of adult coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), often called “Urban Runoff Mortality Syndrome” (URMS), have been documented during the fall in creeks where water quality has been degraded by roadway runoff. The primary cause of mortality is 6PPD-quinone (6PPDQ; N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine quinone)–an ozone transformation product that forms on all vehicle tires. Laboratory studies have shown that juvenile coho salmon are highly sensitive to 6PPDQ exposure. Unlike adults, juveniles reside in impacted watersheds year-round, including during the spring when 6PPDQ concentrations can frequently exceed lethal thresholds during storms. To assess the potential incidence of URMS in springtime rearing habitats for juvenile coho salmon, we conducted a paired water quality and toxicology study at Miller Creek, a runoff-impacted watershed in Normandy Park, WA, USA. Using a small field facility, three naïve groups of juvenile coho salmon (N = 720) were exposed to either creek water or groundwater (N = 120 per treatment per storm), across three spring storms while comparing water quality and mortality end points. In creek water during exposures, peak 6PPDQ concentrations reached 73–110 ng/L, exceeding reported median lethal concentrations (LC50) for coho salmon. Over each 24–73 h storm exposure period, ∼80% of Miller Creek-exposed juvenile salmon died. No mortality occurred among control fish exposed to groundwater. These results indicate previously unidentified mortality risks for juvenile life stages of coho salmon during spring storms, suggesting substantial and year-round water quality impediments to coho salmon health and recovery across roadway runoff-impacted spawning, rearing, and migratory habitats."

However, the role of traditional industrial activities in Li pollution remains poorly understood. Here, we present the first comprehensive assessment of Li pollution originating from the papermaking and textile dyeing industries. Results show that effluents from industrial wastewater treatment plants contain Li at concentrations that are 10–100 times those in natural waters, thereby substantially increasing the dissolved Li concentrations in adjacent surface water and groundwater. Conventional wastewater treatment processes show limited efficiency in removing dissolved Li. Quantitative analysis estimates that the annual Li emissions from China’s papermaking and textile dyeing industries are 60.2 and 231 t, respectively, accounting for approximately 6% of the total Li flux in China’s river systems. Moreover, paper products and industrial dust from these sectors are significantly enriched in total Li with a high proportion associated with labile fractions. Li isotope signatures of traditional industrial sources differ from those of natural sources, thus serving as an effective indicator for source apportionment. These findings uncover the previously overlooked contribution of traditional industries to the global Li cycle and provide new evidence to inform mitigation of Li contamination from these sources."

This challenge is particularly acute in treating industrial wastewater, which faces the twin challenges of salt scaling and salt-inhibited oxidation. Herein, we propose a transformative hardness-to-catalyst strategy to achieve water softening and catalytic ozonation, termed the in situ crystallization-catalyzed ozonation process (ICCOP). Through the minimalist crystallization of inherent calcium into CaCO3, organics degradation exhibited significantly accelerated reaction kinetics, as the ICCOP improved O3 utilization efficiency and enhanced electron transfer. Surface atomic oxygen (*O) was identified as the dominant reactive oxygen species, with Ca atoms on the (1 0 4) plane of CaCO3 as the active sites. Practically, the ICCOP yielded effective decontamination of intricate fracturing flowback wastewater (FFW), achieving enhanced organics and Ca removal within a unitary reactor. Life cycle assessment (LCA) quantifiably demonstrates that the ICCOP markedly reduced CO2 emissions and environmental impact, owing to significant savings in chemicals and electricity, underscoring its strong sustainability advantages. This work deciphers a previously uncharted mechanistic role of Ca crystallization in catalyzing nonradical ozonation for enhanced organics degradation. Crucially, ICCOP emerges as a paradigm-shifting technology for waste-to-resource conversion, pioneering sustainable water remediation."

Beachrock, a coastal sedimentary rock formed through rapid carbonate cementation, develops in the intertidal zone where land–sea interactions are highly dynamic. In this review, we propose that beachrock not only serves as a potential Anthropocene record of coastal pollution but may also function as a Nature-based Solution (NbS) by building coastal ecosystem resilience. First, elevated concentrations of metal(loid)s in intertidal beachrock were identified, and underlying mechanisms were further assessed. Second, the potential use of beachrock in environmental forensics was examined by analyzing diagnostic compositions of typical organic pollutants. Furthermore, novel plastic forms were discovered when plastic lithifies with beachrock, creating an evidence-based marker of the Anthropocene and signifying the incorporation of synthetic materials into Earth’s geological record. Finally, we propose that beachrock formation can be artificially induced through microbially induced carbonate precipitation, offering a restorative alternative to traditional cementitious materials, supporting coastal engineering innovation-based solutions that provide multiple benefits. By integrating perspectives from environmental science, climate science, materials science, earth science, and microbiology, we highlight beachrock’s potential regarding innovative applications including coastal pollution monitoring, climate adaptation, and sustainable material development."

This study introduces a new statistical method using over 1 million in situ subsolar magnetopause measurements to estimate the normal magnetic field and plasma inflow velocity as a function of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) clock angle. Results show that both the normal components of the magnetic field and inflow velocity increase with IMF clock angle, as expected from ongoing magnetic reconnection. On average, their ratio to tangential components—used to derive four independent normalized reconnection rates—is shown to be relatively constant and about 0.14 ± $\pm $ 0.05 for all IMF clock angles larger than 60°, suggesting that the reconnection rate is independent of the guide field at the magnetopause."

 On 6 February 2023, two major earthquakes with moment magnitude (Mw) of 7.8 and 7.6 ruptured multiple segments of the Eastern Anatolian Fault system, resulting in many casualties and extensive property damage in Turkey and Syria. The Mw 7.8 earthquake involved bilateral rupture along the Eastern Anatolian Fault, with at least partially supershear rupture towards the northeast and subshear rupture towards the southwest. The cause of this difference in rupture speed remains debated. Here we present evidence from seismic tomographic imaging linking this difference to structural and stress variations along the fault. Specifically, a low-velocity anomaly and a fault-parallel fast velocity direction of anisotropy in the southwest Amanos–Pazarcık segment suggest fluid infiltration, which could facilitate fault creep and reduce the stress loading rate. By contrast, the Erkenek segment to the northeast is associated with a high-velocity anomaly and fault-normal fast velocity direction, suggesting limited fluid infiltration and increased stress accumulation. Hence, we propose that the contrast in stress accumulation explains the discrepancy in rupture speeds in this earthquake and that fault structure in addition to stress loading may influence stress accumulation and thus whether a fault ruptures at supershear speeds. The difference in rupture speed between fault segments in the 2023 Mw 7.8 Kahramanmaraş earthquake may be explained by the contrasting structure of and stress on these segments, according to seismic tomographic imaging of beneath the fault zone."

 Millennial-scale climate variability in polar ice cores exhibits interhemispheric temperature asynchronicity during the last glacial period, approximately 70,000 to 15,000 years ago. This bipolar seesaw pattern is most pronounced during Heinrich Stadials, which correspond to recurring severe cooling episodes in the North Atlantic region following a weakening of the Atlantic overturning circulation. However, mid-latitude ice sheets and glaciers displayed similar fluctuations in both hemispheres during the most recent Heinrich Stadials, complicating our understanding of interhemispheric teleconnections. Here we provide a continuous millennial-scale record of New Zealand glacier fluctuations over the last glacial period, through the analysis of glaciogenic sediments deposited offshore South Island. We find that millennial-scale glacial retreats in New Zealand occurred during Heinrich Stadials, coinciding with a southerly shift of the South Pacific Subtropical Front inferred from planktic foraminiferal assemblages, and were probably—if not very probably—synchronous (within 1–2 kyr) with enhanced meltwater and iceberg production from the North American and European ice sheets. These findings demonstrate that global retreat of mid-latitude ice masses is a persistent feature of Heinrich Stadials, possibly driven by global energy gain and sustained in the Southern Hemisphere by heat accumulation resulting from the weak Atlantic overturning circulation.

 The Ediacaran Gaskiers Glaciation (579.78–579.44 million years ago) is the last major climatic event of the Neoproterozoic, but the contemporaneous ocean redox conditions remain unclear. Here we conducted carbon–uranium–sulfur isotopic (δ13Ccarb–δ238Ucarb–δ34SCAS) and elemental analyses on marine carbonate samples from the glacial-to-deglacial succession (equivalent to the Gaskiers Glaciation successions) of the Egan Formation in northwestern Australia. Negative δ13Ccarb and positive δ238Ucarb excursions paired with δ34SCAS and cerium anomaly profiles reveal an extensive ocean oxygenation event. The Gaskiers ocean oxygenation event is the middle of three such transient mid-Ediacaran events, occurring roughly 5 million years apart. Using a model for the coupled biogeochemical cycles of phosphorus, oxygen and carbon, we show that these periodic ocean oxygenation events, associated δ238Ucarb variations and part of the δ13Ccarb variation can be explained by a self-sustaining oscillation in the Earth system. An increase in the organic carbon burial flux plausibly linked to eukaryote evolution at the time could have tipped the Earth system from a stable anoxic ocean regime to an unstable oscillatory regime. A later further increase in organic carbon burial flux could have tipped the system into a stable, modern-like oxic ocean regime.

 Nitrogen waste poses substantial threats to global sustainable development through multiple pathways, prompting the United Nations to propose halving nitrogen waste as a means to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, the pathways and potential to improve global SDGs through halving nitrogen waste are less well known. Here we use an integrated assessment framework to quantify the cost-effectiveness and environmental impacts of halving nitrogen waste. We show that nitrogen waste is directly and indirectly linked to all 17 United Nations’ 2030 SDGs and that halving nitrogen waste could enhance global SDG performance by 19%. The total societal benefit of halving nitrogen waste could be as high as US$1,379 billion, considering improvements in human and ecosystem health and mitigation of climate change. Whereas implementing control strategies aimed at halving nitrogen waste may cost up to US$1,137 billion, adopting more cost-effective strategies could decrease costs by up to 72%. Our findings provide crucial insights for policymakers and underscore the urgency of developing cost-effective nitrogen-waste-reduction strategies to achieve global sustainable development.

 Noncoding regions in eukaryotes are extensively expressed and represent a significant source of novel microproteins, some of which become fixed as de novo genes. However, the structural properties of these unevolved products and the features driving their fixation remain poorly understood. Particularly, the influence of nucleotide composition (GC content) on their structural properties and evolutionary trajectories is still unclear. Here, we predict the foldability and sequence properties of millions of microproteins potentially encoded in the noncoding open reading frames (ORFs) of 3,379 eukaryotic genomes with GC contents ranging from 18% to 79%. Depending on GC content, these microproteins exhibit distinct structural properties, suggesting different cellular impacts if non-genic regions are pervasively expressed. Using phylostratigraphy, de novo gene search, and ancestral sequence reconstruction, we trace the evolution of several hundred de novo proteins across 22 organisms with varying GC contents. We show that de novo genes preferentially emerge from GC-rich ORFs with folding potential, revealing that the interplay between GC content and foldability - rooted in the structure of the genetic code - shapes the emergence of novel genes.

 Recent advances in electron microscopy and computer vision now allow the reconstruction of complete wiring diagrams, or connectomes, of animal brains. This creates an urgent need for methods that can automatically identify neuronal cell types directly from these large connectivity datasets. Here we show that synaptic connectivity alone can be used to assign neurons to cell types with high accuracy. We introduce NTAC (Neuronal Type Assignment from Connectivity), which groups neurons based only on connectivity. NTAC has two forms: a semi-supervised one that leverages a small fraction of labeled neurons to infer the types of all others, and an unsupervised one that requires no labels at all. Applied to multiple state-of-the-art fruit fly brain connectomes, NTAC achieves high accuracy within only minutes on a laptop, demonstrating that connectivity provides a powerful and scalable basis for classifying neuronal cell types across the brain.

 We demonstrate electrically switchable, non-volatile dipoles in graphene/thin hBN/α-RuCl3alpha-RuCl3 heterostructures, stabilized purely by interfacial charge transfer across an atomically thin dielectric barrier. This mechanism requires no sliding or twisting to explicitly break inversion symmetry and produces robust ferroelectric-like hysteresis loops that emerge prominently near 30 K. Systematic measurements under strong in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields reveal negligible effects on the hysteresis characteristics, confirming that the primary mechanism driving the dipole switching is electrostatic. Our findings establish a distinct and robust route to electrically tunable ferroelectric phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures, opening opportunities to explore the interplay between interfacial charge transfer and temperature-tuned barrier crossing of dipole states at the atomic scale.

 Patients with recurrent high-grade glioblastoma have a median survival of 6-8 months, with limited therapeutic options. In recent years, interest has grown in applying chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells to solid cancers, including advanced gliomas. Here we generated off-the-shelf CRISPR-Cas9–edited IL-13Rα2-specific allogeneic universal CAR-T cells (MT026) by disrupting the endogenous TCR to prevent graft-versus-host disease and knocking out HLA class I molecules to mitigate the host-versus-graft response, and observed minimal NK-cell–mediated rejection in preclinical studies. In a first-in-human, single-center, open-label investigator-initiated trial (ChiCTR2000028801) in patients with high-grade glioma with prior therapy failure and short life expectancy, intrathecal injection of MT026 via lumbar puncture (1.0-3.0×10^7 cells per dose) demonstrated favorable tolerability and safety (primary outcome), pharmacokinetic characteristics, and preliminary clinical activity (secondary outcomes). Among the five patients enrolled, one achieved a complete response and three achieved partial responses. No grade ≥3 adverse events were observed; the predominant treatment-related toxicities were grade 1-2 pyrexia, hypoxia, and vomiting.

Here, the authors introduce dynamic hindered urea bonds into polyurethane, enabling its thermal-decrosslinking and offering an upcycling route. 
 Thermosetting polymers are widely used for their high mechanical performance and long-term structural reliability, but their permanent crosslinked networks prevent reprocessing and recycling, leading to persistent environmental challenges. Existing dynamic covalent and supramolecular strategies offer partial solutions, yet often suffer from performance loss after repeated recycling due to incomplete reversibility and the accumulation of defects. Here, we present a strategy for the decrosslinking and upcycling of post-service thermosets based on a dynamic polyurethane network containing hindered urea bonds (HUBs). The elastic network exhibits high mechanical strength, self-healing, and thermal reprocessability. Upon exposure to small-molecule amines, the HUBs undergo exchange reactions that enable controlled network disassembly, allowing the thermosets to be transformed into reprocessable thermoplastics. The decrosslinked derivatives facilitate high-value composites—toughening glass fiber matrices by 229% through interfacial reinforcement and achieving commercial-grade electromagnetic shielding (28.1 dB) via optimized carbon nanotube integration. This molecularly engineered decrosslinking-upcycling paradigm establishes a viable pathway for circular thermoset utilization, advancing sustainable polymer technologies.

 Capacitively coupled electrical stimulation modulates neuronal activity through reversible charging and without charge transfer reactions. This represents a promising and safe neuromodulation scheme but achieving wireless and high capacitive charge density injection remains challenging. Here, we developed a topological fibrous-architecture sonocapacitor (SonoCap) that assembled from piezoelectric-dielectric composite nanosphere (UCapT) and two-dimensional cellulose. UCapT features a unique piezoelectric core-hollow cavity-dielectric cage structure that can efficiently couples ultrasound excitation to achieve piezoelectric electron-capacitance transfer, and its highly assembled SonoCap achieves cumulative charge storage, a high ion-accessible surface area, and macroscopic softness, thereby enabling wireless and high capacitive charge density injection. SonoCap can achieve a capacitive charge density output of up to 9.7 mC cm−2 under 0.63 W cm−2 ultrasound excitation, while generating a negligible Faradaic charge of 2 nC cm−2. We demonstrated that SonoCap can transcranially and epidurally modulate neural circuit dynamics in rat and pig brains, without introducing intracerebral foreign bodies and maintaining ventricular homeostasis. By integrating a deep learning-based closed-loop diagnostic system, on-demand, wireless, and epidural capacitive electrical stimulation treatment for temporal lobe epilepsy can be achieved. The design concept of SonoCap is expected to inspire expanding development of functional capacitive stimulators, potentially promoting the widespread application of capacitive electrical neuromodulation.

 Geometrically frustrated lattices can display a range of correlated phenomena, ranging from spin frustration and charge order to dispersionless flat bands due to quantum interference. One particularly compelling family of such materials is the half-valence spinel LiB2O4 materials. On the B-site frustrated pyrochlore sublattice, the interplay of correlated metallic behavior and charge frustration leads to a superconducting state in LiTi2O4 and heavy fermion behavior in LiV2O4. To date, however, LiTi2O4 has primarily been understood as a conventional BCS superconductor despite a lattice structure that could host more exotic ground states. Here, we present a multimodal investigation of LiTi2O4, combining ARPES, RIXS, proximate magnetic probes, and ab-initio many-body theoretical calculations. Our data reveals a novel mobile polaronic ground state with spectroscopic signatures that underlie co-dominant electron-phonon coupling and electron-electron correlations also found in the lightly doped cuprates. The cooperation between the two interaction scales distinguishes LiTi2O4 from other superconducting titanates, suggesting an unconventional origin to superconductivity in LiTi2O4. Our work deepens our understanding of the rare interplay of electron-electron correlations and electron-phonon coupling in unconventional superconducting systems.

 Following the September 20, 2019 instability event, the Jungong landslide—a large-scale red-bed feature in the upper Yellow River Basin—has exhibited persistent creep, necessitating systematic kinematic analysis to constrain deformation drivers. In this context, we conducted a multidisciplinary approach integrating interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys, optical satellite remote sensing, and high-density electrical resistivity tomography (HD-ERT) to investigate its kinematic evolution. Firstly, interferometric processing of SAR imagery from ALOS/PALSAR-1, ALOS/PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-1 systems (March 2007-August 2024) revealed continuous creeping with maximum deformation velocity reaching −129 mm/yr in descending Sentinel-1. Based on morphological and deformation characteristics, the slope was divided into four secondary zones. Through digital image correlation (DIC) of optical images, horizontal displacements exceeding 20 m induced by instability were detected at the front edge of Zone I. The three-dimensional (3D) deformation field was then inverted by combining multi-orbit InSAR observations and a topography-constrained model, revealing significant spatial heterogeneity of displacement characteristics. The maximum velocities in the eastward, northward, and vertical directions were −107, 53, and −71 mm/yr, respectively. Additionally, the internal structure along two profiles was detected using HD-ERT. Finally, a method combining Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) and wavelet transform was proposed to quantitatively analyze the temporal relationship between periodic displacements and rainfall. Different zones exhibited varying degrees of correlation with rainfall, with a time lag of approximately 45 days in Zone I. This multidisciplinary approach enhances our understanding of the kinematic behavior of the Jungong landslide, providing critical reference for future hazard assessment."

 Accurate building footprint databases are fundamental for sustainable urbanization yet face persistent updating challenges due to the rapid pace of urban change. Traditional methods rely on bi-temporal image comparison for change detection, which requires a large number of new labels to retrain the model, which is costly. We propose a passive updating paradigm that eliminates the reliance on historical imagery and leverages a lightweight adaptive strategy applied to Segment Anything Model (SAM) to minimize labeling costs. Furthermore, we propose a Cross Modal Temporal Fusion (CMTF) module that combines features from historical building footprints with those from recent imagery, alleviating the burden of small-sample training. The training process utilizes a semi-supervised approach, enabling the model to learn from both labeled and unlabeled regions, with labeled regions comprising only 0.4% of the building samples. Besides, we propose the RIO dataset, a sub-meter bi-temporal building footprint update dataset for studying building changes in rapidly developing areas. In addition, this work is validated on a range of cities worldwide, including Christchurch (post-earthquake reconstruction) and Beijing-Shanghai (megacity expansion). This work advances urban building renewal by overcoming the reliance on paired historical imagery for change detection and the need for large amounts of up-to-date labels. This approach offers a scalable solution for monitoring SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), enabling less developed countries to use free and open product data to track urban expansion patterns with only a few labels."

 Accurately forecasting sea level maxima (SLM) and extremes, is vital for maritime management, engineering, and navigation. Most Machine learning (ML) models focus on moderate surges and often underestimate extremes. We use a two-fold forecasting framework: ML/DL for short-term daily SLM forecasting and extreme value theory (EVT) for long-term extremes (<100 years). ML models include Random Forest, Extreme gradient boosting, and Multilayer perceptron, CNN-LSTM and CNN-GRU. Long-term extremes are analysed via EVT using a block maximum method. The Baltic Sea, a semi-enclosed micro-tidal basin prone to extremes, serves as case study. The analysis used six tide gauge stations (Narva, Ristna, Oulu, Kungsholmsfort, Władysławowo, and Greifswald). Key features—wind speed, surface air pressure, Baltic Sea Index (BSI), and significant wave height (SWH), were selected using a mutual information and models’ hyperparameters tuned using Bayesian optimization.Neural networks models, specifically the CNN-GRU and MLP, performed best (RMSE 7–15 cm) with strong generalization. Most models captured storm events, but underestimated extreme peaks (>150 cm), due to the rarity in the training, incomplete meteorological representation, and missing local physical processes. CNN-GRU excelled in RMSE, recall, and F1, while MLP led in R2 and precision. EVT analysis showed winter extremes have ∼ 5–7 years in the north-east (Narva and Oulu). Explainability analysis of CNN-GRU showed prefilling dominates SLM at all stations; BSI, pressure, and winds drive west, south, and north, while local pressure, wind, and SWH dominate in the east. The framework supports early warning and long-term risk assessment, though forecasting rare extremes remains challenging."

 Map design is fundamental to geographic information communication and applications, yet it remains an expertise-intensive task involving complex operational procedures that limit accessibility for diverse users despite the proliferation of digital platforms. This study introduces MapMate, a large language model (LLM)-based framework that enables map design through natural language interaction. MapMate addresses the gap between modification goals expressed in natural language and technical map design configurations by integrating a hierarchical map design knowledge base with platform-specific specifications. The framework comprises four core components: a request validator that ensures cartographic parameter validity and operational feasibility, a map design task planner that decomposes goal-oriented requirements into executable operations, a context information retriever that maintains project coherence, and a map design tool router that orchestrates map design functions. To overcome LLM memory limitations in multi-round interactions, MapMate implements a persistence strategy that maintains records of operational history and map-wide design states. Three case studies validate the framework’s effectiveness across single-layer refinement, cross-layer design refinement, and context-aware map design.

 Efficient and effective pose estimation and 3D point clouds reconstruction from low-altitude UAV images is crucial for digital twins and geospatial applications. However, conventional divide-and-conquer SfM pipelines remain constrained by the high computational cost of incremental reconstruction. While global SfM, though faster, often suffer from instability due to outlier sensitivity in translation averaging. To address these limitations, we propose a feature track enhanced global SfM within divide-and-conquer framework. To deal with outliers, a cluster consistency constrained outlier filtering method is proposed, which combines distribution-aware scene partition and cluster consistency to remove false matches. Furthermore, we propose a geometry-constrained alignment optimization strategy in sub-models merging process to eliminate misalignments and ghosting artifacts, obtaining complete and accurate 3D models. Extensive experiments on ETH3D and SYSU UAV large-scale datasets verify that the proposed method outperforms established baselines, with comparable accuracy to the incremental SfM but half of the computation time. The reconstructed 3D models demonstrate notable enhancements in both structural integrity and level of detail, proving the method’s high applicability in large-scale 3D reconstruction tasks.

 Spatial association and spatial interaction are fundamental to understanding geographical phenomena and regional development disparities, with broad applicability across disciplines. Existing spatial heterogeneity analysis face significant challenges in capturing pattern interactions and local variability. This study develops a local pattern interaction (LPI) model that integrates local complexity patterns or geocomplexity of spatial data, the interaction of patterns, and their locally varied power of determinants (PD). LPI is implemented in assessing the PD of local variables and pattern interactions on the spatial distributions of urbanization using statistical data, remote sensing imagery, and open geospatial data. The results show that LPI effectively identifies the local PD of interactions involving the geocomplexity patterns of urbanization-related explanatory variables. Model performance is evaluated by comparison with the optimal-parameters geographical detector (OPGD), a widely used spatial heterogeneity–based PD identification model. The model validation shows that LPI provides advantages over OPGD by capturing spatially varying interaction patterns and local effects, whereas OPGD assesses only global interaction effects. For example, the LPI-derived PD for the interaction between total retail sales and the geocomplexity pattern of tertiary-industry output averages 0.610 [0.336,0.783], indicating critical spatial variation in both local PD values and their significance, while the OPGD-derived PD yields a single global estimate of 0.537 (p < 0.01). This research advances theoretical understanding of spatial association and interaction, while providing an innovative analytical tool and decision-support capability for regional development, urban planning, and resource allocation."

 Accurate assessment of limestone quality and investment potential requires advanced techniques due to spatial variability in thickness and geochemical composition which traditional exploration methods cannot capture efficiently. This study integrates Machine Learning (ML) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to optimize limestone exploration. The analysis used limestone and overburden thickness, X-ray Fluorescence (XRF), and Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) data from 23 core samples with multiple ML classifiers: Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). Predictive ability was evaluated using Accuracy, F1 Scores, Precision-Recall (P-R) curves, Area under P-R curves (AUC-PR), and Feature importance Analysis. Features were validated using a non-parametric approach. Predicted datasets of the selected classifier were subjected to limestone classification criteria and integrated into a GIS to generate predictive Limestone Suitability Index (LSI) map. DT and LR models showed 100 % accuracy, XGBoost performed poorly at 60 %, and SVM and RF had moderate performance (80 %). The F1-scores of 1.00 for LR and DT, 0.71 for SVM and RF, and 0.45 for XGBoost indicate prediction reliability differences. RF and SVM achieved balanced precision-recall (0.65–0.80), with RF attaining a higher AUC_PR (0.871) than SVM (0.643). The non-parametric validation of the features identified RF as most suitable. The LSI map based on RF outputs, categorized the area into high, medium, and low potential zones with high potential zones characterized by thick, CaO rich limestone beds (16.0–34.1 m, CaO ≥ 50 %, SiO2 ≤ 8 %).

Nevertheless, these approaches demonstrate inherent limitations in their capacity to faithfully represent the continuous and intricate morphology of the seafloor, a critical requirement for comprehensive geophysical analyses. This study introduces MB-UDF, a novel self-supervised learning framework that trains neural networks to represent Unsigned Distance Functions (UDF) for high-fidelity reconstruction of continuous 3D seafloor surfaces from MBES data.

To rigorously evaluate the performance of MB-UDF, we established a comprehensive MBES dataset incorporating diverse bathymetric terrains. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing 3D reconstruction techniques in terms of normal consistency and surface continuity, exhibiting enhanced robustness and superior precision compared to conventional DEM approaches.

 Cultural heritage is an integrated system that encompasses both heritage ontology and their surrounding environments. Traditional methods, such as field measurements, are often inefficient and fragmented in assessing the condition of cultural heritage. In recent years, remote sensing has emerged as a crucial tool for the systematic safeguarding and conservation of cultural heritage, thanks to its high spatiotemporal observation capabilities. Utilizing optical, radar, and laser sensors mounted on satellites, aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, and terrestrial platforms, remote sensing offers a comprehensive approach to ensure the sustainability of cultural heritage. This study addresses critical gaps in the emerging, interdisciplinary field of remote sensing for cultural heritage—including limited terrestrial platform coverage, underutilized AI paradigms, and insufficient policy integration—by conducting a systematic, state-of-the-art bibliometric analysis of peer-reviewed papers from the Web of Science Core Collection (1900–2024). Based on this analysis, we summarized the applicable methods, sensor platforms, and applications of remote sensing in cultural heritage conservation and proposed a theoretical framework incorporating relevant methodologies and models. Our results indicate that the integration of multi-spatiotemporal data and diverse technologies is a key characteristic of the disciplinary development. In addition, to application-oriented methodologies, hazard-risk mapping and sustainability assessment of cultural heritage are identified as two potential future directions, which align with the progress assessment of Sustainable Development Goal Target 11.4 by harnessing economic, political and institutional drivers in concert. Leveraging artificial intelligence, data-driven knowledge mining, and multi-source coupling, remote sensing for cultural heritage is transitioning from heritage-specific sustainability through systematic monitoring and evaluation to a broader focus on regional sustainability where heritage sites are located."

Ross;Robert Hallberg,Assessing vertical coordinate system performance in the Regional Modular Ocean Model 6 configuration for Northwest Pacific,"We conducted sensitivity experiments to examine how different vertical coordinates influence the representation of water masses and tides using a high-resolution regional ocean model for the Northwest Pacific. We found that the choice of vertical coordinate  strongly affects the degree of artificial mixing, which in turn changes how well the model reproduces key ocean features. This highlights the importance of selecting a vertical coordinate when developing regional ocean models. 
 The Northwest Pacific (NWP) has a complex ocean circulation system and is among the regions most affected by climate change. To facilitate rapid responses to marine incidents and effectively address climate variability impacts, the Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology (KIOST) developed the Korea Operational Oceanographic System–Ocean Predictability Experiment for Marine Environment (KOOS-OPEM), a high-resolution regional ocean prediction system based on Modular Ocean Model version 5 (MOM5). In this study, the base model of KOOS-OPEM was upgraded to MOM6 to enhance its regional ocean modeling capabilities. A key advancement of MOM6 is its flexible vertical coordinate system enabled by a Lagrangian remapping system. Taking advantage of this feature, we evaluated the impact of vertical coordinate choices on model performance by comparing the HYBRID (z∗-isopycnal) and ZSTAR (z∗) configurations. Model outputs from the 2003–2012 period were assessed against multiple observational datasets and reanalysis products to determine their ability to reproduce key oceanographic features. The results indicated that HYBRID better preserved stratification and reduced spurious diapycnal mixing, significantly improving the representation of North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW). In contrast, ZSTAR exhibited excessive diapycnal mixing, resulting in a thicker isopycnal layer associated with NPIW and a salinity bias of approximately 0.2 psu. An idealized age tracer experiment further confirmed that ZSTAR facilitates excessive downward diffusion of younger surface waters, eroding the minimum salinity layer of the NPIW. In tidal simulations, HYBRID outperformed ZSTAR in reproducing M2 tidal amplitudes in the Yellow Sea, where stratification plays a key role. Conversely, ZSTAR underestimated these amplitudes due to its limitations in representing stratification. Despite its advantages, HYBRID underperformed in high-latitude regions, exhibiting larger temperature and salinity biases between 100 and 600 m depth, with temperature biases reaching approximately −1 °C. This discrepancy arose because HYBRID maintained fewer active layers in weakly stratified regions, reducing vertical resolution and leading to errors in water mass representation. To mitigate these issues and improve HYBRID's performance in high-latitude regions, adjustments to target density profiles are necessary. In addition, both configurations showed limitations in simulating winter SST, largely due to insufficient vertical resolution in the surface mixed layer. To address these issues, adopting a finer surface layer resolution (e.g., 1 m instead of 2 m) will further enhance the model's representation of mixed-layer processes."

 Simple Climate Models (SCMs) are a key tool in climate research, enabling the rapid exploration of climate responses beyond the reach of more complex models and aiding in the estimation of future climate uncertainty. Over the past two decades, the number and diversity of SCMs have expanded considerably, increasing their use but also complicating efforts to understand differences in model structure and their implications. The reduced-complexity model intercomparison project (RCMIP) has begun to address this challenge by comparing output from a wide range of SCMs. However, the need for a systematic analysis of model structure remains. Here, we complement RCMIP's work by systematically analysing the structure, components, and development histories of the 14 SCMs participating in RCMIP. We begin with a summary of the core principles underpinning SCM-based climate simulation, then review genealogy and design choices of each model. This synthesis provides a comprehensive reference for both developers and users, clarifying the diverse approaches within the SCM landscape and supporting informed use and further development of these models."

Simulations varied in sample size, mediator set size, correlation structure, proportion of true mediators, and mediation effect size (beta). We assessed each method’s ability to estimate the total indirect effect (TIE), component indirect effects (CIEs), sensitivity, and specificity. In scenarios with independent metabolites, HIMA and HDMA reliably estimated CIEs, while HDMA provided the most accurate estimate of the TIE. MITM generally underestimated the TIE, and HIMA showed improved TIE estimates with higher mediator effect sizes. In correlated settings, CIE estimation was not feasible due to the lack of identifiable causal contrasts, and all methods underestimated the TIE. Sensitivity declined in low beta, small sample size, and high-dimensional scenarios, though specificity remained high (>90%) across all methods. Findings suggest that HIMA offers the most accurate mediation results but may exclude meaningful features through dimensionality reduction. Therefore, applying parallel mediation approaches, such as MITM and HIMA, and focusing on the overlapping findings would be recommended. These results underscore the need for the development of robust, scalable mediation methods tailored to untargeted metabolomics data."

Oil carried by marine debris arriving at Palm Beach, Florida in 2020 matched oil from the 2019 Brazil mystery oil spill, having traveled ∼8500 km in ∼240 days.

The diffusion limitation of pore structures prevents the efficient deposition of relatively large organometallic precursors on medium/small-pore zeolites. A rich variety of etching strategies are proposed to facilitate deep deposition of reactive precursors. The Cu-ZSM-5(Na2CO3) catalyst showed a 2.3-fold enhancement in Cu loading compared with parent zeolite and more copper active sites at the same Cu-ALD cycles. The Cu-ZSM-5(Na2CO3) achieved the most excellent low-temperature deNOx performance and was accompanied by a wide temperature window, announcing the compatibility of medium-pore zeolite with the ALD technique. It was found that the diffusion of pore structures is the key to the coupling of ALD with zeolites when Si/Al is lower than 20, and the insufficient framework Al (FAL) is fatal for copper(II) hexafluoroacetylacetonate [Cu(hfac)2] deposition when Si/Al is higher than 20.

Fractionating SOC into labile particulate organic carbon (POC) and stable mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC) is crucial for predicting its stability. Precipitation-induced variations in coarse (>2 mm) and fine (<2 mm) roots are key regulators of SOC stability, but their specific contributions remain unclear. Here, we conducted a 10-year field simulation of precipitation changes (−60%, −40%, 0%, + 40%, + 60%) in a wetland. We found that increased precipitation enhanced Gramineae abundance, thereby increasing coarse-root biomass, while fine roots changed little. Compared to CK, coarse roots directly boosted topsoil POC (+37.4%) and enhanced MAOC (+31.5%) via microbial stimulation. Furthermore, increased coarse-root biomass was associated with greater vertical transport of DOC and nitrate (NO3–), potentially contributing to higher subsoil POC (+218.7%) and MAOC (+17.2%). With increasing precipitation, the MAOC/POC ratio decreased from 1.65 to 1.11 in the topsoil and from 8.73 to 2.66 in the subsoil, suggesting that coarse roots favored POC over MAOC, increasing SOC but reducing its stability.

Cyclodextrin-MOF offers adsorption sites and steric hindrance that temporarily retain boron species, while single-layer LDH forms hydrophilic channels for fast water transport, together creating a dual-channel mechanism for efficient boron-water separation. The optimized membrane has a boron rejection of 82.24% and a NaCl rejection of 99.27% using a feed containing 5 ppm of boron and 2,000 ppm of NaCl. In addition, the separation performance remains stable for 96 h without degradation. Its efficacy is further validated by using seawater RO permeate, where the boron concentration is reduced below the threshold of WHO drinking water.

Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are characterized by large specific surface areas, well-defined porous structures, and tunable electronic properties, making them suitable for constructing single-atom catalysts with adjustable coordination environments. In this study, three Co-ZIF materials with distinct morphologies were synthesized and subsequently pyrolyzed, yielding cobalt-based catalysts with varied coordination structures. Among these catalysts, the Co–N–C(F) primarily features atomically dispersed Co species coordinated with four N atoms, forming Co-N4 active sites. Theoretical calculations indicate that the Co-N4 coordination structure exhibits enhanced oxygen activation compared to metallic cobalt sites, which is crucial for the degradation of intermediate products in the oxidation of HCHO. The Co–N–C (F) catalyst demonstrates superior activity in HCHO oxidation to even most noble metal catalysts. During a 710 h continuous test at 15 °C, the catalyst maintained 100% HCHO removal efficiency without observable deactivation. Simulation experiments further confirmed its practical applicability, with the catalyst module able to degrade 1 ppm of HCHO to <0.07 ppm within 2 h at room temperature.

Gains in LTP function affected the cellular abundance of both their known and newly identified lipid ligands, indicating comparable functional relevance of the two ligand sets. Using structural bioinformatics, we have characterized mechanisms contributing to lipid selectivity, identifying preferences based on head group or acyl chain. We demonstrate some basic principles of how LTPs mobilise their ligands. They commonly interact with several classes of lipids and exhibit broad but selective preference, not only for particular head groups, but also for lipid species with shorter acyl chains containing one or two unsaturations, suggesting that only subsets of lipid species are efficiently mobilized. The datasets represent a resource for further analysis in different cell types and states, such as those associated with pathologies."

 In 2020, a global surge of activism linked to the Black Lives Matter movement prompted scientists to stage an academic ‘strike’, drawing attention to the ethical responsibility of addressing systemic racism. This catalysed debate in conservation, adding urgency to decades of scholarship on marginalization. In this Perspective, we review this literature and examine how exclusion in conservation persists across intersections of race, class, urban–rural divides, nationality and power dynamics from local to global levels. We highlight how marginalization and ‘othering’ disproportionately affect Black, Indigenous and people of colour (BIPOC) communities, especially in the Global South. Expansion of protected areas and the prioritization of individual animal lives over human well-being can intensify such inequities. We propose a framework for more inclusive conservation: recognizing and supporting human rights, ensuring local community agency, challenging entrenched norms in BIPOC engagement, and fostering educational opportunities led by and for BIPOC communities. Amid shifting global politics, including reduced US federal support for social and conservation issues, this framework provides guidance to counter racism and exclusion. By rethinking conservation practice, it seeks to build long-lasting, equitable and inclusive approaches that respect both people and nature. This Perspective proposes a new framework to support the inclusion of Black, Indigenous and people of colour in conservation initiatives."

 Late Cretaceous Europe was an archipelago with a dinosaur fauna characterized by island effects such as low diversity, relictualism and insular dwarfism1. Its dinosaur communities include a unique mix of groups with typical Laurasian or Gondwanan affinities and distinctive endemics1. Chief among the latter are rhabdodontids, considered to be early-branching iguanodontians characterized by unusual dental and postcranial features and known from abundant but very incomplete fossil remains2,3. By contrast, unequivocal evidence of horned dinosaurs (ceratopsians) is puzzlingly absent4, despite their ubiquitous occurrence in contemporary ecosystems of Asia and North America. Ajkaceratops from the Late Cretaceous of Hungary was described as the first definite ceratopsian from Europe5, but this identification has been strongly disputed4. Here we describe new material of Ajkaceratops and conduct phylogenetic analyses that support its ceratopsian affinities. Our results unexpectedly demonstrate that some ‘rhabdodontid’ taxa are not, in fact, iguanodontians but actually ceratopsians. This suggests a substantial but previously hidden diversity and evolutionary history of European horned dinosaurs, and co-occurrence of iguanodontians and ceratopsians indicates greater similarity than previously appreciated to other Laurasian ecosystems. Our results challenge conventional understanding of ornithischian dinosaur evolution and indicate the need for a fundamental re-evaluation of the Late Cretaceous herbivorous dinosaur assemblages of Europe. New results indicate that rhabdodontids and the previously described Ajkaceratops are actually distinctive European ceratopsians, a group better known from Asia and North America."

 The Galaxy’s most common known planetary systems have several Earth-to-Neptune-size planets in compact orbits1. At small orbital separations, larger planets are less common than their smaller counterparts by an order of magnitude. The young star V1298 Tau hosts one such compact planetary system, albeit with four planets that are uncommonly large (5 to 10 Earth radii)2,3. The planets form a chain of near-resonances that result in transit-timing variations of several hours. Here we present a multi-year campaign to characterize this system with transit-timing variations, a method insensitive to the intense magnetic activity of the star. Through targeted observations, we first resolved the previously unknown orbital period of the outermost planet. The full 9-year baseline from these and archival data then enabled robust determination of the masses and orbital parameters for all four planets. We find the planets have low, sub-Neptune masses and nearly circular orbits, implying a dynamically tranquil history. Their low masses and large radii indicate that the inner planets underwent a period of rapid cooling immediately after dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Still, they are much less dense than mature planets of comparable size. We predict the planets will contract to 1.5–4.0 Earth radii and join the population of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes that nature produces in abundance. A nine-year transit-timing campaign has measured the extremely low masses and densities of four large planets orbiting the young star V1298 Tau, which are now predicted to contract and form a typical compact super-Earth and sub-Neptune system."

 The brain’s connectome1–3 and the vascular system4 are examples of physical networks whose tangible nature influences their structure, layout and, ultimately, their function. The material resources required to build and maintain these networks have inspired decades of research into wiring economy, offering testable predictions about their expected architecture and organization. Here we empirically explore the local branching geometry of a wide range of physical networks, uncovering systematic violations of the long-standing predictions of wiring minimization. This leads to the hypothesis that predicting the true material cost of physical networks requires us to account for their full three-dimensional geometry, resulting in a largely intractable optimization problem. We discover, however, an exact mapping of surface minimization onto high-dimensional Feynman diagrams in string theory5–7, predicting that, with increasing link thickness, a locally tree-like network undergoes a transition into configurations that can no longer be explained by length minimization. Specifically, surface minimization predicts the emergence of trifurcations and branching angles in excellent agreement with the local tree organization of physical networks across a wide range of application domains. Finally, we predict the existence of stable orthogonal sprouts, which are not only prevalent in real networks but also play a key functional role, improving synapse formation in the brain and nutrient access in plants and fungi. Analysis of the local branching geometries of several physical networks shows violations of predictions of length and volume minimization, leading to the hypothesis that estimating the material cost requires accounting for the full three-dimensional geometry."

 In all domains of life, tRNAs mediate the transfer of genetic information from mRNAs to proteins. As their depletion suppresses translation and, consequently, viral replication, tRNAs represent long-standing and increasingly recognized targets of innate immunity1–5. Here we report Cas12a3 effector nucleases from type V CRISPR–Cas adaptive immune systems in bacteria that preferentially cleave tRNAs after recognition of target RNA. Cas12a3 orthologues belong to one of two previously unreported nuclease clades that exhibit RNA-mediated cleavage of non-target RNA, and are distinct from all other known type V systems. Through cell-based and biochemical assays and direct RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that recognition of a complementary target RNA by the CRISPR RNA triggers Cas12a3 to cleave the conserved 5′-CCA-3′ tail of diverse tRNAs to drive growth arrest and anti-phage defence. Cryogenic electron microscopy structures further revealed a distinct tRNA-loading domain that positions the tRNA tail in the RuvC active site of the nuclease. By designing synthetic reporters that mimic the tRNA acceptor stem and tail, we expanded the capacity of current CRISPR-based diagnostics for multiplexed RNA detection. Overall, these findings reveal widespread tRNA inactivation as a previously unrecognized CRISPR-based immune strategy that broadens the application space of the existing CRISPR toolbox.

 Vision can inform animals as they navigate their environment. Landmarks can be used to maintain heading, while optic flow can be integrated to estimate turning. Although it has been shown that head direction (HD) neurons in various species use these visual cues1,2, the circuit mechanisms underlying this process in vertebrates remain unknown. Here we asked whether and how the recently identified HD cells in the larval zebrafish3, one of the smallest vertebrate models, incorporate visual information. By combining two-photon microscopy with a panoramic virtual reality setup, we demonstrate that the zebrafish HD cells can reliably track the orientation of multiple visual scenes, exploiting both visual landmarks and optic flow cues. The mapping between landmark cues and heading estimates is idiosyncratic across fish and experience dependent. Furthermore, we show that landmark tracking requires the lateralized projection from the habenula to the interpeduncular nucleus4, a structure innervated by HD neuron processes3. The physiological and morphological parallels suggest that a Hebbian mechanism similar to the fly ring neurons5,6 is at work in the habenula axons. Overall, our observation that hindbrain HD cells of larval zebrafish can utilize the visual cues despite the lack of an elaborate visual telencephalon sheds new light on the evolution of navigation circuitry in vertebrates. Using two-photon microscopy with a panoramic virtual reality setup, how head direction cells in larval zebrafish integrate visual landmarks and optic flow to track orientation is revealed."

Previously, the ENCODE consortium mapped biochemical signals across hundreds of cell types and tissues and integrated these data to develop a registry containing 0.9 million human and 300,000 mouse candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) annotated with potential functions2. Here we have expanded the registry to include 2.37 million human and 967,000 mouse cCREs, leveraging new ENCODE datasets and enhanced computational methods. This expanded registry covers hundreds of unique cell and tissue types, providing a comprehensive understanding of gene regulation. Functional characterization data from assays such as STARR-seq3, massively parallel reporter assay4, CRISPR perturbation5,6 and transgenic mouse assays7 have profiled more than 90% of human cCREs, revealing complex regulatory functions. We identified thousands of novel silencer cCREs and demonstrated their dual enhancer and silencer roles in different cellular contexts. Integrating the registry with other ENCODE annotations facilitates genetic variation interpretation and trait-associated gene identification, exemplified by the identification of KLF1 as a novel causal gene for red blood cell traits.

 Room-temperature sodium–sulfur (Na–S) batteries offer a sustainable energy storage solution to conventional lithium (Li)-based systems1–3, owing to the high element abundances and theoretical electrochemical performance4,5. However, their practical applications have been severely hindered by the low discharge voltages and the need for largely excessive Na metal anode6–8. Here we report a 3.6 V class Na–S battery featuring a high-valence sulfur/sulfur tetrachloride (S/SCl4) cathode chemistry and anode-free configuration. We show that sodium dicyanamide (NaDCA) can simultaneously unlock reversible S/SCl4 conversion and Na plating/stripping in a non-flammable chloroaluminate electrolyte. This design enables the maximum energy and power densities of 1,198 Wh kg−1 and 23,773 W kg−1, respectively, calculated on the basis of the total electrode mass including both the cathode and the anode. Also, we demonstrate facilitated S/SCl4 conversion by incorporating a bismuth-coordinated covalent organic framework (Bi-COF) catalyst (8 wt% loading) into the S cathode, which realizes an impressive discharge capacity of 1,206 mAh g(sulfur+catalyst)−1, contributing to a maximum energy density of 2,021 Wh kg−1 calculated on the basis of the total electrode mass. With an estimated cost of US$5.03 per kWh and excellent scalability, our anode-free Na–S battery shows promise in grid energy storage and wearable electronics.

 Animals continuously evaluate their surroundings to decide whether to approach rewarding opportunities or avoid potential threats. Assigning the appropriate importance to environmental stimuli is not only crucial for survival but also underlies complex forms of goal-directed behaviour that are shared across species, including humans1–4. Understanding how the brain translates such sensory cues into motivated behaviours is, therefore, central to neuroscience and psychology. The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) is a critical structure that bridges relevant environmental stimuli to goal-directed behaviour. Salience, valence and value are key dimensions defining stimulus relevance, but how the dmPFC processes and organizes such dimensions to drive motivated behaviour remains unclear. Here we monitored single-neuron populations in the dmPFC using calcium imaging in freely moving male mice while discriminating between stimuli predicting different reward or punishment outcomes, which enabled an unprecedented dissociation of salience, valence and value information. We found that dmPFC populations primarily encode appetitive and aversive values of learned stimuli and that subpopulations encode valence and salience along orthogonal information axes. Our results highlight a concurrent multifaceted population coding of value, salience and valence of stimuli during associative learning within dmPFC networks, such that the geometry of dmPFC neuronal representations dynamically shapes appetitive and aversive motivated behaviours. The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex encodes the value, salience and valence of learned stimuli along distinct neural dimensions, and the geometry of these representations shapes motivated behaviours in mice."

 The stromal cell compartment plays a central part in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis by coordinating with the immune system throughout inception, amplification and resolution of inflammation1. Chronic inflammation can impede the phased regulation of tissue restitution, resulting in the scarring complication of fibrosis. In inflammatory bowel disease, stromal fibroblasts have been implicated in treatment-refractory disease and fibrosis2,3; however, their mechanisms of activation have remained undefined. Through integrative single-cell and spatial profiling of intestinal tissues from patients with inflammatory bowel disease, we uncovered a pathological cell nexus centred on inflammation-associated fibroblasts. These fibroblasts were induced by proinflammatory macrophages (FCN1+IL1B+) and, in turn, produced profibrotic cytokine IL-11. We investigated the inflammation-associated fibroblast activation program at a mechanistic level using genome-wide CRISPR knockout and activation screens and identified the transcription factor GLIS3 as a key regulator of a gene regulatory network governing expression of inflammatory and fibrotic genes. We further demonstrated that the magnitude of the GLIS3 gene expression program in intestinal biopsies could be used to stratify patients with ulcerative colitis by disease severity, and that fibroblast-specific deletion of Glis3 in mice alleviated pathological features of chronic colitis. Taken together, our findings identify a critical immune–stromal cell circuit that functions as a central node in the inflammation–fibrosis cycle. Integrated single-cell and spatial data analysis, combined with bidirectional CRISPR screens, identify the transcription factor GLIS3 as a key driver of chronic inflammation and fibrosis and a potential marker of disease severity in patients with ulcerative colitis."

 Monitoring internal physiological signals is essential for effective medical care1, yet most current technologies rely on external measurements or imaging systems that cannot capture enough deep-tissue dynamics2–6. Implantable devices offer a solution, but conventional designs often require batteries or magnets7–11, which carry risks during removal, and existing biodegradable sensors based on passive inductor–capacitor circuits are limited by short readout distances and unstable communication issues12–19. Here we describe a soft, biodegradable, wireless sensing device that can monitor pressure, temperature and strain over long distances (up to 16 cm), maintaining accuracy across varying positions and angles. This is achieved through a ‘pole-moving sweeping’ readout system combined with a folded structure that integrates mechanical flexibility with electromagnetic function. In vivo tests in the abdominal cavity of horses reliably captured deep-tissue pressure and temperature, and ex vivo measurements demonstrated accurate strain monitoring without strict positional control.

 Palaeogenetic evidence suggests that the last common ancestor of present-day humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans lived around 765–550 thousand years ago (ka)1. However, both the geographical distribution and the morphology of these ancestral humans remain uncertain. The Homo antecessor fossils from the TD6 layer of Gran Dolina at Atapuerca, Spain, dated between 950 ka and 770 ka (ref. 2), have been proposed as potential candidates for this ancestral population3. However, all securely dated Homo sapiens fossils before 90 ka were found either in Africa or at the gateway to Asia, strongly suggesting an African rather than a Eurasian origin of our species. Here we describe new hominin fossils from the Grotte à Hominidés at Thomas Quarry I (ThI-GH) in Casablanca, Morocco, dated to around 773 ka. These fossils are similar in age to H. antecessor, yet are morphologically distinct, displaying a combination of primitive traits and of derived features reminiscent of later H. sapiens and Eurasian archaic hominins. The ThI-GH hominins provide insights into African populations predating the earliest H. sapiens individuals discovered at Jebel Irhoud in Morocco4 and provide strong evidence for an African lineage ancestral to our species.

 The evolution of multicellularity is considered to be a major transition in the history of life on Earth1. In the evolution from unicellularity to obligate multicellularity, facultative clonal multicellularity may constitute an intermediate state, in which unicellular proliferation and clonal multicellular growth are switchable2–4. However, little is known about the mechanisms of switching. Here we identify the genetic and cellular basis of nutrition-responsive facultative clonal multicellularity in two black-yeast species of Dothideomycetes. Deletion of any one of ten genes in Hortaea werneckii5,6 results in near-obligate unicellularity or multicellularity. Six of these genes encode regulators of conidiation (asexual sporulation) in filamentous fungi7, despite conidiation not being observed in H. werneckii. Second-site mutations often restore or reverse the phenotype, revealing genetic flexibility underlying facultative multicellularity. A Myb protein functions as a switch-like regulator of state transitions in H. werneckii; its expression and degradation are coupled to nutrient conditions, stabilizing unicellular or multicellular growth. However, while conidiation regulators are similarly co-opted to enable facultative multicellularity, the Myb gene is dispensable in the related species Neodothiora pruni8, further highlighting molecular diversity in plasticity regulation. Ecologically, multicellular-prone H. werneckii ecotypes are isolated from sponges, and sponge-conditioned medium induces multicellularity. This study establishes a tractable model system for dissecting facultative clonal multicellularity across genetic, cellular and ecological scales, and outlines genetic and cellular strategies to gain, lose and regain multicellularity and, more broadly, phenotypic plasticity.

 Expansions and contractions of tandem DNA repeats generate genetic variation in human populations and in human tissues. Some expanded repeats cause inherited disorders and some are also somatically unstable1,2. Here we analysed DNA sequencing data from over 900,000 participants in the UK Biobank and the All of Us Research Program using computational approaches to recognize, measure and learn from DNA-repeat instability. Repeats at different loci exhibited widely variable tissue-specific propensities to mutate in the germline and blood. Common alleles of repeats in TCF4 and ADGRE2 exhibited high rates of length mosaicism in the blood, demonstrating that most human genomes contain repeat elements that expand as we age. Genome-wide association analyses of the extent of somatic expansion of unstable repeat alleles identified 29 loci at which inherited variants increased expansion of one or more DNA repeats in blood (P = 5 × 10−8 to 2.5 × 10−1,438). These genetic modifiers exhibited strong collective effects on repeat instability: at one repeat, somatic expansion rates varied fourfold between individuals with the highest and lowest 5% of polygenic scores. Modifier alleles at several DNA-repair genes exhibited opposite effects on the blood instability of the TCF4 repeat compared with other DNA repeats. Expanded repeats in the 5′ untranslated region of the glutaminase (GLS) gene associated with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (odds ratio (OR) = 14.0 (5.7–34.3, 95% confidence interval (CI))) and liver diseases (OR = 3.0 (1.5–5.9, 95% CI)). These results point to complex dynamics of DNA repeats in human populations and across the human lifespan.

 Phase-change thermal batteries for renewable energy storage and waste heat recovery demand high energy density and fast charging1–5, which are mutually exclusive because phase-change materials (PCMs) with high melting enthalpy are usually poor heat conductors6–8. The charging rate can be improved by making composite phase-change materials (CPCMs) with increased thermal conductivity9 and/or by exerting an external force to realize close-contact melting (CCM)10–12. However, these methods inevitably result in energy density losses and/or extra energy consumption. Here we report a strategy to boost the charging rates without sacrificing energy density, based on a rational design of a composite coating that enables slip-enhanced close-contact melting (sCCM) inside sealed thermal batteries. Using organic PCMs, we demonstrate a record-high power density of 1,100 ± 2% kW m−3 in a prototype. Our coating design integrates a pulse-heated (PH) layer that premelts the PCM to initiate CCM, together with a liquid-like slip surface that ensures unimpeded sinking of the remaining solid and sustains the sCCM mode throughout charging. We develop a model to explain how the slip surface enhances the charging rate. With high cycling life, adaptability and scalability, this strategy is generalizable to diverse PCMs, enabling high-performance thermal energy storage over a wide range of temperatures.

 Type 2 inflammation at barrier surfaces is an evolutionarily conserved response that promotes immunity to helminth parasites, allergic inflammation and tissue repair1–4. Direct sensing of environmental triggers by epithelial cells initiates type 2 inflammation, and signals derived from neurons can modulate immune responses5–8. However, how diverse sensory inputs from epithelial, neuronal and immune cells are coordinated and integrated remains unclear. Here we identify that TRPV1+ pain-sensing nociceptors co-opt chemosensory epithelial tuft cells to initiate a cascade of tissue responses that drive type 2 inflammation. Chemogenetic silencing or chemical ablation of TRPV1+ nociceptors results in a significant reduction in intestinal tuft cells and defective anti-helminth type 2 immunity. By contrast, chemogenetic activation of TRPV1+ nociceptors leads to remodelling of CGRP+ nerve fibres, significantly increased CGRP expression, enhanced tuft cell accumulation and protective anti-helminth type 2 immunity. Using spatial transcriptomic and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses, we reveal that nociceptor activation promotes rapid epithelial progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. Mechanistically, intestinal epithelial cell-intrinsic and tuft cell-intrinsic expression of CGRP receptor subunits are required for tuft cell responses and type 2 immunity to helminth infection. Together, these results identify sensory convergence of a neuronal–epithelial tuft cell circuit as a critical upstream determinant of type 2 immunity and tissue adaptation.

 Cancer metastasis is a major contributor to patient morbidity and mortality1, yet the factors that determine the organs where cancers can metastasize are incompletely understood. Here we quantify the absolute levels of 124 metabolites in multiple tissues in mice and investigate how this relates to the ability of breast cancer cells to grow in different organs. We engineered breast cancer cells with broad metastatic potential to be auxotrophic for specific nutrients and assessed their ability to colonize different tissue sites. We then asked how tumour growth in different tissues relates to nutrient availability and tumour biosynthetic activity. We find that single nutrients alone do not define the sites where breast cancer cells can grow as metastases. In addition, we identify purine synthesis as a requirement for tumour growth and metastasis across many tissues and find that this phenotype is independent of tissue nucleotide availability or tumour de novo nucleotide synthesis activity. These data suggest that a complex interplay between multiple nutrients within the microenvironment dictates potential sites of metastatic cancer growth, and highlights the interdependence between extrinsic environmental factors and intrinsic cellular properties in influencing where breast cancer cells can grow as metastases.

 Over the past decades, remarkable progress has been made in reducing the loss of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) within the telecom band1–4, facilitating on-chip applications spanning low-noise optical5 and microwave synthesis6, to lidar7 and photonic artificial intelligence engines8. However, several obstacles arise from the marked increase in material absorption and scattering losses at shorter wavelengths9,10, which prominently elevate power requirements and limit performance in the visible and near-visible spectrum. Here we present an ultralow-loss PIC platform based on germano-silicate—the material underlying the extraordinary performance of optical fibre—but realized by a fully CMOS-foundry-compatible process. These PICs achieve resonator Q factors surpassing 180 million from violet to telecom wavelengths. They also attain a 10-dB higher quality factor without thermal treatment in the telecom band, expanding opportunities for heterogeneous integration with active components11. Other features of this platform include readily engineered waveguide dispersion, acoustic mode confinement and large-mode-area-induced thermal stability—each demonstrated by soliton microcomb generation, stimulated Brillouin lasing and low-frequency-noise self-injection locking, respectively. The success of these germano-silicate PICs can ultimately enable fibre-like loss onto a chip, leading to an additional 20-dB improvement in waveguide loss over the current highest performance photonic platforms. Moreover, the performance abilities demonstrated here bridge ultralow-loss PIC technology to optical clocks12, precision navigation systems13 and quantum sensors14.

 Position exchange of non-Abelian anyons affects the quantum state of their system in a topologically protected way1. Their expected manifestations in even-denominator fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems offer the opportunity to directly study their unique statistical properties in interference experiments2. Here we present the observation of coherent Aharonov–Bohm interference at two even-denominator states in high-mobility bilayer-graphene-based van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures by using the Fabry–Pérot interferometry technique. Operating the interferometer at a constant filling factor, we observe an oscillation period corresponding to two flux quanta inside the interference loop, ΔΦ = 2Φ0, at which the interference does not carry signatures of non-Abelian statistics. The absence of the expected periodicity of ΔΦ = 4Φ0 may indicate that the interfering quasiparticles carry the charge

Inspired by dynamic modulation of cephalopod skin5,6, we develop polymer films with programmable surface textures. We bring these textures to life through immersion in different liquids that cause reversible local swelling/contraction to a degree that is determined by electron-beam irradiation. We show how standard electron-beam patterning tools can spatially encode arbitrary textures that can be hidden and shown on demand. Similarly, by modulating the topography of optical Fabry–Pérot cavities, we create colour patterns that can be continuously tuned with microfluidic control to achieve several distinct appearance states, allowing them to camouflage with different backgrounds. Finally, by creating multilayer devices, we demonstrate independent control of texture and colour in a single device, enabling a higher level of dynamic control over visual appearance.

 Primary sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) have long axons and a high demand for mitochondria, and mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in peripheral neuropathy after diabetes and chemotherapy1,2. However, the mechanisms by which primary sensory neurons maintain their mitochondrial supply remain unclear. Satellite glial cells (SGCs) in DRG encircle sensory neurons and regulate neuronal activity and pain3. Here we show that SGCs are capable of transferring mitochondria to DRG sensory neurons in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo by the formation of tunnelling nanotubes with SGC-derived myosin 10 (MYO10). Scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed tunnelling nanotube-like ultrastructures between SGCs and sensory neurons in mouse and human DRG. Blockade of mitochondrial transfer in naive mice leads to nerve degeneration and neuropathic pain. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing and in situ hybridization revealed that MYO10 is highly expressed in human SGCs. Furthermore, SGCs from DRG of people with diabetes exhibit reduced MYO10 expression and mitochondrial transfer to neurons. Adoptive transfer of human SGCs into the mouse DRG provides MYO10-dependent protection against peripheral neuropathy. This study uncovers a previously unrecognized role of peripheral glia and provides insights into small fibre neuropathy in diabetes, offering new therapeutic strategies for the management of neuropathic pain.

 Decreased cross-presentation by antigen-presenting cells induces the scarcity of tumour-reactive T cells within the tumour bed, rendering in situ T cell rejuvenation through immunogenicity reprogramming highly desirable yet challenging1–3. Here we developed an intratumoural vaccination chimera (iVAC) to reprogram tumour cells into an antigen-presenting state (APC-like tumour cells) with restored anti-tumour immunity. The iVAC chimeras consist of a covalently engineered PD-L1 degrader conjugated to immunogenic antigens, which could relieve immune checkpoint inhibition while enforcing the cross-presentation of exogenous antigens. Functionally, the iVAC-induced antigen processing and presentation elicited potent tumour killing through reactivation of resident antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, which simultaneously remodelled the tumour microenvironment to promote durable tumour-specific immunity. Extending this strategy, we used iVAC with a cytomegalovirus (CMV)-derived antigen to activate CMV-specific T cells against breast cancer in vitro, in a humanized mouse model as well as in a patient-derived tumour model. This study establishes a foundation for chemically reprogramming cancer cells within tumour beds to endow APC-like functions, providing an avenue for stimulating anti-tumour immunity.

 Yakut communities from northeastern Siberia inhabit some of the coldest environments on Earth, preserving an extraordinary archaeological record. Their history was profoundly reshaped by the Russian conquest, which introduced cereals, pathogens and Christianity beginning in 1632 (refs. 1–5). However, the biological impact of these transformations remains unknown. Here we generated extensive ancient DNA data to elucidate contemporary changes in Yakut genomic diversity and oral microbiomes. We found Yakut origins tracing back to local populations that admixed with Trans-Baikal groups migrating as the Great Mongol Empire spread. Despite the Russian conquest, the Yakut gene pool and oral microbiomes appeared largely stable, although smallpox strains distinct from those documented in Europe by approximately 1650 circulated. Marital practices generally maintained low consanguinity, with the exception of one female bearing the latest markers of traditional shamanism, who was the daughter of second-degree relatives.

 The anterior cingulate cortex is a key brain region involved in the affective and motivational dimensions of pain, but how opioid analgesics modulate this cortical circuit remains unclear1. Uncovering how opioids alter nociceptive neural dynamics to produce pain relief is essential for developing safer and more targeted treatments for chronic pain. Here we show that a population of cingulate neurons encodes spontaneous pain-related behaviours and is selectively modulated by morphine. Using deep learning behavioural analyses combined with longitudinal neural recordings in mice, we identified a persistent shift in cortical activity patterns following nerve injury that reflects the emergence of an unpleasant, affective chronic pain state. Morphine reversed these neuropathic neural dynamics and reduced affective–motivational behaviours without altering sensory detection or reflexive responses, mirroring how opioids alleviate pain unpleasantness in humans. Leveraging these findings, we built a biologically inspired chemogenetic gene therapy that targets opioid-sensitive neurons in the cingulate using a synthetic μ-opioid receptor promoter to drive inhibition2. This opioid-mimetic chemogenetic gene therapy recapitulated the analgesic effects of morphine during chronic neuropathic pain, thereby offering a new strategy for precision pain management that targets a key nociceptive cortical opioid circuit with safe, on-demand analgesia.

 The medial temporal lobe, and particularly the hippocampus, has been proposed to encode items in context1,2. Although hippocampal memory representations are largely context-dependent in rodents3,4, concept cells in humans appear to be context-invariant5. However, it remains unknown how item and context information are combined to form or retrieve integrated item-in-context memories at the single-neuron level in humans. Here we show that coordinated activity of distinct neuronal populations supports item-in-context memory. In a context-dependent picture-comparison task, we recorded 3,109 neurons from 16 neurosurgical patients, identifying 597 stimulus-modulated (pre-screened) and 200 context-modulated neurons (2.95% in the amygdala, 7.68% in the parahippocampal cortex, 5.68% in the entorhinal cortex and 9.42% in the hippocampus). Their co-firing combined different comparison questions (contexts) with two subsequent pictures (stimuli) through neuronal reinstatement of question contexts. Both populations were largely separate, generalized across the preferred dimension of each other, and covaried with behavioural performance. Following experimental pairing of stimuli and context, firing of entorhinal stimulus neurons predicted that of hippocampal context neurons after tens of milliseconds. Overall, synaptic modifications and co-firing of stimulus and context neurons could contribute to item-in-context memory, specify which stimulus memories need to be retrieved, and even generalize memories through mutual reinstatement of largely separate, orthogonal representations. By contrast, only 50 stimulus–context neurons represented specific picture–question combinations, consistent with limited pattern separation in the human medial temporal lobe, favouring flexible generalization over rigid conjunctive coding. Single-neuron recordings in humans reveal largely separate content and context neurons whose coordinated activity flexibly places memory items in context."

 The canonical mechanism that drives cell division comprises the formation and constriction of a contractile actin ring1–3. However, this mechanism is not compatible with the early development of many vertebrates4–9. Yolk-anchored embryos typically cannot form a complete ring during early cleavage divisions, but it remains unclear how a partial circular arc with loose ends can divide the cell. Here, by combining laser ablation of the cytokinetic band with rheological measurements in vivo, we show that stiffening of the bulk cytoplasm, mediated by the interphase microtubule network, stabilizes the contractile band by anchoring it along its length during growth. Conversely, as the cell cycle progresses, the cytoplasm fluidizes, diminishing band–cytoplasmic anchoring and facilitating band ingression. This dynamic interplay between stability and growth versus instability and ingression repeats for several cell cycles until division is complete, resulting in a mechanical ratchet that drives cell division. Our study underscores the role of temporal control over cytoplasmic rheology as a key feature that drives unilateral cytokinesis in the absence of a closed actin ring. Division of embryonic cells with an incomplete contractile ring occurs by a ratchet mechanism with repeated cycles of cytoplasmic stiffening, which stabilizes the contractile actin band, and fluidization, which enables band ingression."

 Mucormycosis is an emerging, life-threatening human infection caused by Mucorales fungi1–3. Metabolic disorders uniquely predispose an ever-expanding group of patients to mucormycosis through poorly understood mechanisms1,2,4,5, suggesting that uncharacterized host metabolic effectors may confer protective immunity against this infection. Here we uncover a master regulatory role of albumin in host defence against Mucorales through the modulation of fungal pathogenicity. Our initial studies identified severe hypoalb uminaemia as a prominent metabolic abnormality and an independent biomarker of poor mucormycosis outcome across three distinct cohorts of patients with mucormycosis. Notably, purified albumin selectively inhibits Mucorales growth among a range of pathogens, and albumin-deficient mice display susceptibility specifically to mucormycosis. The antifungal activity of albumin is mediated by the release of bound free fatty acids (FFAs). Albumin prevents FFA oxidation, which otherwise abolishes their antifungal properties, and sera from patients with mucormycosis display high levels of oxidized FFAs. Physiologically, albumin-bound FFAs suppress the expression of key virulence factors by inhibiting protein synthesis, the reby rendering Mucorales avirulent in vivo. Overall, we identify a host defence mechanism that directs the pathogen to suppress its pathogenicity program in response to unfavourable metabolic cues regulated by albumin. These findings have major implications for the pathogenesis and management of mucormycosis. Albumin selectively inhibits Mucorales growth through the release of bound free fatty acids."

 The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the central circadian pacemaker, receives photic input exclusively from intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs)1,2. However, light mainly shifts the SCN clock during night-time3–5. Here we induced phase shifts in the SCN clock during the daytime in mice by activating ipRGCs using chemogenetics or violet light. Our data reveal that the inability to induce daytime shifts with light in most animals is not only attributed to the SCN, as has been proposed for decades, but also requires the limitation of ipRGC firing via depolarization block. Chemogenetic activation of ipRGCs induces large shifts during both night-time and daytime, but daytime shifts require brain circuits and neuropeptide transmitters that are dispensable for night-time shifts. Thus, propensity of ipRGCs for depolarization block not only prevents daytime shifts in mice, but also limits the magnitude of night-time shifts, suggesting that ipRGC inputs to SCN act as an integrated pacemaker across the circadian cycle. The inability of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells to shift the circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus during daytime is caused by light-dependent depolarization block of these cells."

 We use our experiences to form and update beliefs about the hidden states of the world1–3. When possible, we also gather evidence by observing others. However, how the brain integrates experiential and observational evidence is not understood. We studied the dynamics of evidence integration in a two-player game with volatile hidden states. Both humans and monkeys successfully updated their beliefs while playing the game and observing their partner, although less effectively when observing. Electrophysiological recordings in animals revealed that the anterior cingulate cortex integrates independent sources of experiential and observational evidence into a coherent neural representation of dynamic belief about the environment’s state. The geometry of population activity revealed the computational architecture of this integration and provided a neural account of the behavioural asymmetry between experiential and observational evidence accumulation.

Grewal,Stress controls heterochromatin inheritance via histone H3 ubiquitylation,"A histone ubiquitin-dependent regulatory hub governs stimulus-dependent heterochromatin propagation, with important implications for understanding mechanisms governing rapid changes in the epigenetic landscape in physiology and disease. 
 Heterochromatin, marked by histone H3 lysine 9 methylation, can be epigenetically inherited through cell division1–3, maintaining gene repression that preserves cell identity and enables adaptation to environmental challenges2–6. Studies on Schizosaccharomyces pombe have shown that heterochromatin propagation depends on the read–write mechanism, wherein a sufficient density of H3K9me3-modified nucleosomes, stabilized by histone deacetylases, concentrates Clr4SUV39H on chromatin to promote further deposition of H3K9 methylation7–9. Whether other mechanisms control heterochromatin propagation by means of Clr4SUV39H, a subunit of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex ClrC10–12, was unknown. Here we uncover a ubiquitin-dependent heterochromatin heritability regulatory hub (HRH) that broadly governs heterochromatin propagation, even without histone deacetylase activity. The HRH is tuned by the limiting factor Raf1DDB2, a substrate receptor for the ClrC ubiquitin ligase. In addition to linking Clr4SUV39H to other ClrC components on chromatin, Raf1DDB2 acts in a dosage-dependent manner to promote ubiquitination of histone H3 at lysine 14 (H3K14ub), which is critical for heterochromatin self-propagation. HRH is intricately linked to environmentally responsive pathways, including nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) and target of rapamycin (TOR) signalling, enabling cells to adapt to changing conditions. By modulating heterochromatin propagation, cells leverage the HRH to gain resistance to antifungal agents and adapt to high temperature. Thus, heterochromatin self-propagation is actively regulated by means of H3K14ub in response to external stimuli, with broad implications for understanding mechanisms governing rapid changes in the epigenetic landscape in physiology and disease. A histone ubiquitin-dependent regulatory hub governs stimulus-dependent heterochromatin propagation, with important implications for understanding mechanisms governing rapid changes in the epigenetic landscape in physiology and disease."

 There are no approved treatments for Lassa fever, which is estimated to cause 100,000 to 300,000 infections and 5,000 deaths annually in West Africa1,2. Recently, it was shown that 4′-fluorouridine (also known as EIDD-2749), an orally available ribonucleoside analogue, protected guinea pigs from lethal challenge with the lineage IV prototype Josiah strain of Lassa virus when treatment was delayed beyond the onset of clinical signs of disease3. Here we assessed the therapeutic efficacy of 4′-fluorouridine in an African green monkey model of Lassa fever using the contemporary and apparently more pathogenic lineage VII Togo strain of Lassa virus. Daily treatment with 4′-fluorouridine beginning 6 days after Lassa virus infection, when the monkeys were viraemic and clinically ill, resulted in rapid and complete clearance of infectious virus in 4 out of 5 monkeys, and all treated monkeys survived to the pre-determined study end-point. Targeted transcriptomics showed that cellular responses and control of cytokinaemia contributed to the development of immunity. Our findings support the further development of 4′-fluorouridine both as a post-exposure prophylaxis to control outbreaks and as a therapeutic agent to treat symptomatic patients.

 Groundwater is the largest freshwater resource, supporting drinking water, irrigation and ecosystems.

Here we discuss how groundwater can be used strategically during and after hazard events while safeguarding long-term sustainability. Examples of earthquake, wildfire, flood and drought events in different regions highlight the potential value of temporarily using existing wells, pumps and aquifers. However, shifts in mindsets, policies and planning are urgently needed, along with interdisciplinary and equity-focused approaches that draw on disaster sociology, environmental justice, sustainability science and sociohydrology. Examples of policy direction and thought leadership from around the world show how groundwater use is emerging across diverse hazard contexts, which could be amplified by future interdisciplinary, equity-focused research.

 Our understanding of the long-term behaviour of global climate and the Antarctic ice sheet relies heavily on the oxygen isotopic composition of marine calcite (δ18Ocalcite), which reflects a combination of ocean temperature and the amount of water stored in ice sheets. On the basis of δ18Ocalcite, the Antarctic ice sheet has been interpreted as extremely dynamic in the Oligocene, 34–23 million years ago. Yet, the proposed continental-scale ice volume changes are challenging to reproduce with models and may be overestimated owing to a larger influence of temperature on the deep-sea δ18Ocalcite than previously assumed. Here we present the first Oligocene record of orbital variability in deep ocean temperature based on benthic foraminiferal clumped isotope thermometry, a method affected only by temperature and independent of seawater chemistry. We find large, eccentricity-paced temperature variations of up to 4 °C, sufficient to explain the δ18Ocalcite cycles without requiring continental-scale ice volume changes. This finding is consistent with the simulated stability of the Antarctic ice sheet, highlighting the importance of robust independent temperature reconstructions. Our results show that the temperature in the deep Southern Ocean, and possibly globally, is highly sensitive to the seasonal distribution of insolation in an Oligocene-like climate state warmer than today.

 Radiotherapy can both activate and suppress immunity, making it difficult to predict or modulate these opposing effects for better cancer treatment. Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT), a cellular-level radiotherapy, has demonstrated remarkable therapeutic efficacy in clinical practice, but mechanistically remains inadequately explored. Here, we compare the effects of BNCT with X-ray irradiation at equivalent radiation doses on immune cells and define the immunological mechanisms behind the improved therapeutic benefit of BNCT in mouse tumour models. We find that BNCT has a minimal effect on immune cell viability, while it triggers an immunogenic tumour cell death, ultimately inducing stronger anti-tumour immunity. Additionally, single-cell RNA sequencing indicates that BNCT reshapes the tumour microenvironment by enhancing dendritic cells, T cells, and NK cells activity. Thus, these findings provide important insights into radiobiological mechanisms following BNCT and inform strategies to preserve immune cells during radiotherapy and to increase cancer treatment efficacy.

 Postoperative recurrence significantly impacts long-term survival in patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this single-arm, phase II trial (NCT04834986), 27 patients with resectable HCC at high recurrence risk received perioperative tislelizumab (anti-PD-1) plus lenvatinib (multi-kinase inhibitor).

 Microcirculation monitoring is crucial for evaluating cardiovascular health and detecting organ dysfunction early, but existing bedside imaging techniques often cannot provide sufficient resolution and depth for dynamic assessment during natural physiological activities. Here, we present MOBILE (Miniaturized Omnidirectional Broadband Photoacoustic Imaging System for Living Entities), a photoacoustic imaging system that allows unrestricted microcirculatory monitoring with 40 µm resolution and penetration depth of 10 mm, allowing stratified visualization of dynamic vascular responses. This platform features an ultracompact fibre-optic sensor capable of omnidirectional ultrasound-based detection across a large bandwidth (0.3–80 MHz). The compact design of the system facilitates point-of-care monitoring through seamless integration with portable devices or existing clinical systems. Through a comprehensive evaluation of the patient’s haemodynamic parameters, MOBILE reveals distinct dynamic responses of vessels at different tissue depths, from superficial microvessels to deep subcutaneous vessels, capturing vessel-specific changes in diameter, haemoglobin concentration, and tissue oxygenation during numerous physiological challenges. This platform offers possibilities for understanding microcirculatory responses and improving critical care management through high-resolution vessel monitoring.

Here, authors employ electronegativity and configurational entropy as a design descriptor to guide the synthesis of a sodium-deficient layered oxide with an O3 stacking sequence, rendering good thermal and air stability. 
 Exploring sodium-ion layered oxides with broad compositional diversity is an important approach for the development of high-performance positive electrodes. Structural chemistry determined by composition plays a decisive role in performance improvement, but the relationship between composition and structure becomes more elusive in complex multi-component systems. Here we propose an electronegativity entropy weight concept to understand entropy-dominated phases formation. Electronegativity and configurational entropy are used to quantify key interactions in layered materials. Guided by this understanding, we design a sodium-deficient layered oxide with an O3 stacking sequence. This material demonstrates good structural and thermal stability, along with air stability (negligible performance degradation after air exposure), cycling stability (93.02% capacity retention after 200 cycles), and rate capability (retaining 69.1% capacity retention from 86.5 mA g⁻¹ to 1.73 A g⁻¹). Even in potassium-ion batteries with larger inserted ions, the material still exhibits cycling stability. This strategy provides valuable compositional guidance for the rational design of high-performance layered oxide materials. The structure of layered oxides dictates their properties as positive electrodes in sodium-ion batteries, but its rational design remains challenging. Here, authors employ electronegativity and configurational entropy as a design descriptor to guide the synthesis of a sodium-deficient layered oxide with an O3 stacking sequence, rendering good thermal and air stability."

 Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) are characterized by impairments in brain development that affect motor and cognitive systems. Early identification of NDD risk factors is crucial for prevention. Metabolomic profiling holds promise for early detection but remains underexplored in longitudinal studies. Here, we map the longitudinal metabolomic profiles in 3212 samples covering 683 metabolites from 581 mother-child pairs at six timepoints in the Danish COPSAC2010 cohort to assess childhood NDD risk over a 10-years follow-up period. Cross-validated sPLS models identify metabolic biomarkers and patterns associated with NDD, with maternal gestational week 24 metabolic profile showing the best prediction. Metabolite trajectories prior 18-month of age are linked to NDD risk. Quinolinate is consistently associated with NDD across timepoints and mediated the effect of maternal inflammation on NDD. In the single metabolite analysis, no metabolites remained significant after multiple testing correction. In this work, we provide valuable insights into the role of the longitudinal metabolome in neurodevelopment.

Here, the authors propose a regulatory mechanism underlying migrasome biogenesis and elucidate how viruses exploit this pathway to promote cell-to-cell transmission. 
 Migrasomes are migration-dependent organelles, serving as delivery packets to mediate release of cytoplasmic contents. Tetraspanin 4 (TSPAN4) acts as a marker for migrasomes and is essential for their formation. However, the regulatory mechanism(s) underlying TSPAN4-mediated migrasome biogenesis and its physiological functions remain to be elucidated. Here, we identified AMFR, an ER-resident E3 ligase, regulates migrasome formation through catalyzing the K48-linked polyubiquitination of TSPAN4 for degradation. Further, O-GlcNAcylation of AMFR by OGT at threonine 643 disrupts AMFR-TSPAN4 interactions, thereby stabilizing TSPAN4 and promoting migrasome formation. Additionally, viruses dynamically regulate migrasome formation by modulating AMFR O-GlcNAcylation and TSPAN4 ubiquitination. During the early stages of VSV or HSV-1 infection, viruses enhance migrasome formation and exploit these structures to spread among neighboring cells, whereas abolish migrasome formation during the late stages of infection. Our findings reveal a negatively regulatory mechanism governing migrasome biogenesis, and highlight how VSV and HSV-1 manipulate this process to facilitate their release.

 RNA binding proteins could regulate transcription through modulating RNA polymerase II involved transcriptional condensates with the aid of nascent RNA. However, whether this mechanism also contributes to tumorigenesis is still unknown. Here, we show the RBP AKAP95 is required for MLL rearranged leukemogenesis. Phase separation and RNA binding properties of AKAP95 modulate Pol II recruitment into condensates at genome-wide target sites. AKAP95 interact with MLL1 translocated fragment and their partial co-condensation leads to stronger AKAP95 binding towards MLL-AF9 target genes. Loss of AKAP95 significantly downregulates expression of MLL-AF9 targets and impairs MLL-AF9 driven leukemogenesis. AKAP95 is not essential for normal and regenerative hematopoiesis, rendering it an ideal target for leukemia therapeutics. As an endeavor for modifying condensates, we design a peptide JD-PI95 bridging AKAP95 to protein quality surveillance component HSP70. The peptide successfully impairs AKAP95 phase separation, attenuates gene transcription and inhibits MLLr leukemia cells proliferation. Our work demonstrates an important role of RBP condensates in tumorigenesis through regulation of transcription and a new method to perturb specific condensates for tumor inhibition.

 Introducing and stabilizing oxygen vacancies in the lattice of oxide support materials has been a huge challenge to boost the catalytic activity in redox reaction. Herein, we fabricate porous single-crystalline Nb2O5 monoliths at the centimeter scale, then we introduce the oxygen vacancies in lattice by reduction treatment and stabilize the oxygen vacancy defects by the ordered lattice. We then deposit Pt clusters at surface in the porous microstructures to construct an interfacial system and we show the significantly enhanced surface oxygen exchange coefficient. As a case study, we demonstrate the complete CO oxidation with air at 110 °C and 30,000 mL g-1 h-1 conditions, following the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, with no visible performance attenuation after a continuous operation of ~500 h. At 60,000 mL g-1 h-1 and 110 °C, the CO conversion rate decreases to 83.8% and ultimately remains 76.3% after 185 h of long-term operation.

 The evolution of the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM) over geological timescale remains uncertain1–3 despite its fundamental role in shaping regional climate4,5, ecosystems6,7, and civilizations8. Using a series of time-slice simulations with a paleo-climate model, we assess how India–Eurasia collision tectonics9,10, Tibetan Plateau (TP) uplift11,12, and atmospheric CO2 variability13 influenced ASM evolution through the Cenozoic. Our simulation-based results suggest that ASM intensification was contingent on the TP exceeding an areal mean elevation of ~ 3.5 km in the late Eocene–Oligocene (27–38 million years ago, Ma), which strengthened the upper-tropospheric temperature gradient, promoted the seasonal northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and restructured atmospheric circulation. Initially confined to East Asia14, monsoonal rainfall expanded across South Asia by the Oligocene, coinciding with enhanced circulation and reversing the meridional relative sea surface temperature gradient in the Neotethys. While TP uplift played the primary role in early ASM evolution, declining atmospheric CO2 levels became increasingly influential after the late Miocene. These findings, supported by sedimentary records of weathering and erosion15,16, underscore the dominant role of TP in climate–tectonic interactions and ASM evolution over geological timescales."

Such reconstructions improve understanding of long-term solar behaviour and the likelihood of hazardous particle events that are capable of disrupting modern technology. Here we present an annually resolved 14C record spanning 1 to 970 CE comprising five newly measured and three existing series from tree rings. The record is analysed with methods that combine statistical modelling of the carbon cycle, data-adaptive decomposition of solar cycles, and probabilistic detection of rapid 14C increases associated with energetic particle events.

 Synchronized droughts threaten global food security, with concerns about increased frequency and duration under climate change. However, their long-term evolution and physical limits remain unknown. We analyze 61 drought networks over 120 years (1901–2020) of Self Calibrating palmer drought severity index (sc-PDSI) data, employing a suite of network synchronization measures and empirical orthogonal functions to unravel the physical drivers and limiters of drought synchrony. Our results show that, contrary to claims that synchronized droughts could affect up to one sixth of the global land mass, the maximum synchronized area fluctuates between 1.84% and 6.5% of the total land mass. Although we observe a strong dependence between drought onset and local crop failures, global drought synchrony is shaped by a dichotomy: temperature trends exacerbate it, while precipitation variability, modulated by sea surface temperature oscillations, limits it. This suggests that although drought hubs are increasing, large-scale synchronization across multiple agricultural regions is less widespread than expected, affecting global food security strategies.

 Private forests, covering 20% of the global forest area, play a crucial role in climate change mitigation and adaptation. Yet, research on adaptation intentions among private forest owners remains limited. This study investigates the adaptation intentions of private forest owners in Canada, one of the world’s most forested countries, following the 2023 unprecedented wildfire season. Our findings reveal one of the highest levels of adaptation intention reported globally based on a comprehensive comparison of 179 covariates and an original Bayesian statistical analysis. We identify a mismatch between adaptation intentions and existing policy instruments: rather than traditional financial incentives, such as tax reductions or reimbursement schemes for forest operations, the most effective support involves providing detailed and locally relevant information on climate impacts, and technical assistance. These findings point to a substantial opportunity to leverage motivated private forest owners to establish a long-term social-ecological observatory and testing ground for adaptive forest management with global relevance.

 Hydrothermal systems at ultraslow-spreading mid-ocean ridges remain poorly characterized, particularly where sedimentary and ultramafic influences intersect. Here we present geochemical analyses of vent fluids collected in 2024 from the Jøtul hydrothermal field on the northern Knipovich Ridge. Major element concentrations, dissolved gases, and thermodynamic modeling are used to investigate fluid-rock interactions. The fluids exhibit exceptionally high CH4 concentrations, that exceed those at the Guaymas Basin, and display characteristics typical of sediment-hosted hydrothermal systems, indicating thermal decomposition of organic matter in clastic sediments. In contrast, high H2 (>15 mM) and low H2S concentrations are more typical of ultramafic-hosted fluids, while geological evidence indicates that the vent field lies atop a detachment fault. Thermodynamic modeling suggests that these high H2/H2S ratios may result solely from degradation of organic matter followed by abiotic CH4 oxidation at ~400 °C, rather than from reactions with ultramafic rocks. These results expand the known diversity of sediment-hosted vent fluid compositions and highlight fluid-sediment interaction as an underestimated source of carbon and hydrogen.

We found that this in situ–forming hydrogel integrates seamlessly with tumor resection procedures, serves as a drug depot for sustained tumoral releases of therapeutic agents, and thus reprograms the tumor microenvironment by promoting M1 macrophage polarization, suppressing regulatory T cell activity, and enhancing cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration, thereby establishing a robust antitumor immune response.

Although Nat10-mediated RNA ac4C modification has been implicated in malignant hematopoiesis, its role in normal hematopoiesis remains unexplored. Here, we developed ULAC-seq to map ac4C in rare hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and revealed dynamic, cell-type–specific ac4C patterns, peaking in megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs), correlating with elevated Nat10 expression. Nat10 knockout disrupts HSC self-renewal and arrests MEP differentiation, leading to fetal and postnatal hematopoietic failure. Mechanistically, Nat10 deposits ac4C on mRNAs encoding key hematopoietic transcription regulators (e.g., Nfix), thereby enhancing their translation. Nat10 loss reduces Nfix protein levels and suppresses expression of its target genes (e.g., Mpl) that govern HSPC fate, while Nfix reconstitution rescues colony-forming defects in Nat10-null HSPCs.

Using the imaging agent [68Ga]AJ647, dynamic changes in the interaction of EV with Nectin-4 were measured across preclinical models and correlated with therapeutic responses. PET imaging identified dose-dependent variations in Nectin-4 engagement, with suboptimal EV doses resulting in incomplete Nectin-4 engagement and increased tumor growth. Crucially, PET-measured target engagement predicted therapeutic outcomes more reliably than either drug dose or baseline target expression. By defining effective target engagement levels needed for optimal therapeutic outcomes, PET imaging provides a clear benchmark for dosing decisions, maximizing efficacy while potentially reducing exposure to higher, toxic doses and thereby enhancing patient safety."

Loss of LUBEL leads to Amphiphysin (Amph)–positive membrane sheets instead of tubular networks. The ubiquitin ligase activity of LUBEL and direct interaction with Amph, a BAR domain protein involved in membrane tubulation, are crucial for proper T-tubule morphology. LUBEL and M1-linked ubiquitin chains assemble into puncta on membranes through multivalent interactions, facilitating Amph-mediated tubulation. Notably, the Amph-LUBEL/RNF31 interaction is evolutionarily conserved across species, underscoring a fundamental role for linear ubiquitination in membrane remodeling.

The closed conformation is dependent on a hydrophobic patch of amino acids on the distal end of the flap. Functionally, YehDRBDis able to bind pectin, a polysaccharide ubiquitous in plant material. Mutations that interrupt the closed conformation increase the affinity of the protein to pectin, suggesting that the flap contributes mechanistically to pectin binding.

However, obesity impairs the generation of beige adipocytes, and the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we show that obesity leads to a loss of adipose progenitor cells (APCs) in WAT, accompanied by reduced estrogen (E2) levels and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) expression. Supplementation with E2 or nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), an NAMPT-derived nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) precursor, restores beige adipogenesis in diet-induced obese mice. Mechanistically, estrogen receptor α (ERα) in APCs is required for beige fat formation by promotingNampttranscription. We further demonstrate that NAMPT is both necessary and sufficient to drive APC proliferation and differentiation, with interleukin-33 (IL-33) acting downstream to mediate these effects. These findings uncover a critical ERα/NAMPT/IL-33 axis that preserves progenitor function and thermogenic capacity, offering a potential therapeutic strategy to combat obesity-induced beige fat failure and associated metabolic dysfunction."

However, the mechanism that the injured lung microenvironment uses to modulate BC-mediated lung repair remains unclear. Here, we showed that the profibrotic transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) gradient from the injured lung immune microenvironment can be sensed by BCs. Targeted degradation of Smad2/3 in human BCs via proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) disrupted TGF-β signaling, causing cell hyperplasia and barrier function loss after being transplanted into the alveolar area. Genetic ablation of the TGF-β receptor orSmad4in mouse BCs impaired multilineage differentiation and suppressed migration to the alveolar injury site. These data indicated that TGF-β signaling is essential for BC-mediated lung repair. Moreover, we genetically engineered human BCs to release antifibrotic bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) in response to microenvironmental TGF-β stimulation. Transplantation of this iBMP7-BC enhanced lung repair and reduced fibrosis. Collectively, this study delineates how TGF-β governs BC behavior and provides a microenvironment-responsive cell therapeutic strategy for pulmonary fibrosis."

InCaenorhabditis elegans, UNC-70/ß-Spectrin also functions within the epidermis to maintain the integrity of sensory neurons. The precise molecular organization in this tissue and the cellular mechanisms that mediate this protection are unknown. Here, using three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy, we show that epidermal SPC-1/α-Spectrin and UNC-70/ß-Spectrin form a crescent-shaped scaffold with a periodicity of ~200 nm that embraces adjacent axons. This epidermal Spectrin scaffold is induced by developing axons and reformed during axonal regeneration, creating a “molecular imprint” of the nervous system. Disruption of this epidermal scaffold causes axonal damage, and we propose that it protects axons by restricting the endocytosis of cell adhesion molecules required for axonal-epidermal adhesion. Our findings reveal a distinct periodic Spectrin scaffold within the epidermis that is molded by the developing nervous system and protects axons from damage."

We used aDrosophilaenhancer responding to the TF Distal-less (Dll) to investigate this relationship. By combining computational structure analysis and quantifying relative TFBS affinity and enhancer activity, we describe how TF concentration is converted into precise expression across the developingDrosophilawing. We show that, although the regulatory function of the enhancer generally follows the classical Hill equation, several additional terms are needed to describe the effects of affinity, orientation, sequence, and wing region on the maximum achievable expression and position of transcriptional activity in a tissue. We also found that Dll relies on two distinct sets of amino acid–DNA contacts for binding to higher affinity sites, but contacts are more evenly distributed at lower affinities. Our work integrates information at molecular and tissue scales to describe how the modulation of a single TFBS determines the regulatory function of an enhancer in a complex in vivo environment."

Previously, we induced tolerance to allogeneic islets in nonhuman primates by preemptive alloantigen delivery to antigen-presenting cells in situ. Here, mass cytometry phenotyping with incorporated donor-derived MHC-I peptide–loaded MHC-II tetramers revealed accumulation of allospecific CD4+T cell clusters in the spleen of tolerant recipients. Areg+Tr1 regulatory and terminally exhausted EGFRhiT (Tex) cells represented the predominant allospecific subsets. Trajectory analysis showed that antigen-experienced effector memory T cells differentiated into suppressive Areg+Tr1 and EGFR+TOX+Nur77+TCF-1−Tex subsets. Cell-cell communication mapping showed that exhausted and effector memory T cells engaged with allospecific Tr1 cells via the Areg-EGFR axis. Gene silencing studies confirmed that Tr1 cells use Areg-EGFR signaling to drive the metabolic suppression and epigenetic reprogramming of CD4+T cells through a Nur77-dependent pathway. These findings point to the splenic Areg+Tr1 cell-EGFR+Teff cell axis as a critical immunoregulatory pathway in peripheral transplant tolerance."

Offline “structural synapses” encode task-agnostic features, while online “plastic synapses” are configuration-specific parameters updated by error-gated rules consistent with long-term potentiation and depression. The contraction metric serves as a homeostatic constraint, providing a stability guarantee. We validate our approach on cable-driven and shape-memory-alloy soft arms across trajectory tracking, pick-and-place, and whole-body shaping tasks.

Thus, here, by parallelly analyzing the human peripheral CD4-CTLs and CD8-CTLs, we demonstrate that they are indistinguishable for the cytotoxic program. Furthermore, using an integrative multiomics approach combining the transcriptome, T cell antigen-receptor repertoire, and open chromatin profile of CD4+T cell memory subsets, we found a stem-cell memory subset that is precommitted to the cytotoxicity program. Through an in vitro differentiation model, we developed CD4+T cells with cytolytic potential coexpressing and exhibiting progressive chromatin accessibility for cytotoxicity- and longevity-associated genes, hence generating long-lived CD4-CTL effectors of varying cytotoxic capacity.

We derived a new, dated sponge phylogeny and tested whether ancestral sponges had mineralized skeletons. We resolve the sponge phylogeny in good agreement with current knowledge and date their origin to the early Ediacaran. Our results suggest that early sponges were not biomineralized and that both biosilicification and biocalcification evolved independently multiple times across Porifera. We reconcile fossil evidence and molecular estimates of sponge evolution by showing that the Neoproterozoic history of Porifera is limited to the Ediacaran and providing evidence suggesting that sponges are largely absent from the Ediacaran record because they were yet to evolve biomineralized skeletons."

Prototypical fission machineries use local energy input such as nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis to constrict and cut membranes. However, some membrane fission reactions paradoxically rely on protein scaffolds that by themselves stabilize rather than cut membranes. It turns out these proteins do not work alone; they use nonlocal energy input that generates a membrane tension gradient. Such a gradient mobilizes membrane flow that in turn tends to relax the membrane tension gradient. By interfering with membrane flow, the protein scaffold causes the membrane tension to increase unchecked to the point of mechanical failure, membrane fission. This friction-driven scission (FDS) mechanism is generic, conserved from bacteria to humans, and only requires two ingredients: a membrane tension generating process and a protein scaffold that hinders the associated membrane flow. Because both are often present in cells, it is likely that FDS contributes to membrane fission more frequently than previously appreciated."

Recently, CO2 injection into reactive host rocks has been explored as a way to transform CO2 into dense solid minerals. We present a simulation framework for modeling flow of CO2 due to injection and subsequent reactions that take place to mineralize CO2. 
 Understanding the flow and reactivity of CO2 injected into geological reservoirs is important for many subsurface applications including secure geologic carbon storage (GCS), critical mineral extraction, enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), and enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Traditionally, subsurface CO2 injection for GCS applications has focused on geologic formations with favorable subsurface configurations for CO2 migration and trapping through non-reactive mechanisms such as structural, solubility, and petrophysical trapping. Recently, CO2-reactive rocks such as mafic and ultramafic basalts have been investigated for their potential to react with injected CO2 in situ to simultaneously dissolve host rock minerals and mineralize CO2 as carbonates. Engineering rapid CO2 mineralization in the subsurface is attractive because of the increased density of stored CO2, the additional safety factors associated with solidification, and the potential to extract valuable critical minerals. Here we present recent developments in the parallel flow and reactive transport simulator PFLOTRAN to model coupled CO2-brine flow and reactive transport for a wide range of injection and production applications involving reactive CO2-brine systems. These developments are based on the well established and trusted CO2 flow capabilities in the STOMP-CO2 simulator. New capabilities added to PFLOTRAN include new CO2-brine equations of state with optional thermal coupling, several new constitutive relationships like capillary pressure smoothing and scanning path hysteresis, a fully implicit well model, and native linkage with PFLOTRAN's well-established reactive transport libraries. A series of benchmarks between PFLOTRAN and STOMP-CO2 verify the newly developed CO2-brine flow capabilities. Demonstrations of coupled CO2-brine flow modeling and reactive transport show how CO2 mineralization can be engineered in reactive host rocks. Finally, an example use case involving copper leaching by CO2 and critical mineral extraction is presented to showcase the strengths of this new implementation. Several limitations still remain, including limited availability of field data to parameterize models. Future work should constrain the evolution of mineral surface area during mineralization and the temperature and/or pH dependence of geochemical reactions for specific systems of interest."

These are more mobile and easier to melt. Ice fracture itself is not well understood, because of harsh field conditions. We propose a novel criterion parametrising this process, and incorporate it into a numerical model that simulates wave propagation. This criterion can be compared to existing ones. We relate our results to lab experiments, and find qualitative agreement. 
 The wave-induced breakup of sea ice contributes to the formation of the marginal ice zone in the polar oceans. Understanding how waves fragment the ice cover into individual ice floes is thus instrumental for accurate numerical simulations of the sea ice extent and its evolution, both for operational and climate research purposes. Yet, there is currently no consensus on the appropriate fracturing criterion, which should constitute the starting point of a physically sound wave–ice model. While fracture by waves is commonly treated within a hydroelastic framework and parametrised with a maximum strain-based criterion, in this study we explore a different, energy-based, approach to fracturing. We introduce SWIIFT (Surface Wave Impact on sea Ice – Fracture Toolkit), a one-dimensional model based on linear plate theory, that can produce time-domain simulations of wave-induced fracture, into which we incorporate this energy fracture criterion. We demonstrate SWIIFT with simple simulations that reproduce existing laboratory experiments of the fracture by waves of an analogue material, allowing qualitative comparisons and validations of the energy fracture criterion. We find that under some wave conditions, identified by a dimensionless wavenumber, corresponding to in situ or laboratory wave-induced fracture, the model does not predict fracture at constant curvature; thereby calling into question the appropriateness of parametrising sea ice fracture with a maximum strain criterion."

However, the contribution of microbial nitrogen (N) metabolism remains unclear. This study integrated hydrogeochemical profiling, metagenomic sequencing, and molecular-level OM characterization to elucidate how microbial nitrogen transformation and organic N mineralization could drive geogenic NH4+ accumulation in groundwater. A distinct shift in microbial N metabolism pathways was identified along the NH4+ enrichment gradient. Under N-limited and strongly reducing conditions, N fixation and dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium provided additional NH4+ sources, whereas nitrification served as the primary sink by oxidizing NH4+ to nitrate. At low NH4+ levels, NH4+ was mainly produced via deamination of simple mono-N compounds (CHO+1N) found in highly unsaturated low-oxygen (O) compounds and low-O polyphenols. In contrast, at high NH4+ levels, urease-mediated hydrolysis of multi-N compounds (CHO+nN) in highly unsaturated high-O compounds became dominant. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed tight, pathway-specific linkages between functional genes and NH4+-associated OM compounds, highlighting the substrate-dependent nature of geogenic NH4+ production. These findings could advance our understanding of microbially mediated NH4+ enrichment mechanisms and offer implications for the management of NH4+ and other geogenic contaminants in organic-rich aquifers."

Developing efficient activators that function at low dosages to enhance the oxidative performance is a key objective. This study first demonstrates that ultralow dosages (1 μM) of protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), at least an order of magnitude lower than conventional activators, markedly enhance Fe(VI)-mediated selective oxidation of phenolic pollutants. Mechanistic studies revealed that PPIX readily complexed with Fe(V/IV), enabling the formation of the Fe(V/IV)-PPIX complexes. These complexes served as the primary reactive species that significantly reduced the energy barrier for the oxidation of phenolic pollutants and accelerated electron transfer compared to unchelated Fe(V/IV). This electron-transfer efficiency is further modulated by the binding strength between phenolics and Fe(V/IV)-PPIX, with stronger binding facilitating faster electron transfer. Crucially, PPIX remained stable and was not consumed in the reaction. As a result, Fe(III)-PPIX could be efficiently reoxidized by Fe(VI/V/IV) to regenerate the reactive Fe(V/IV)-PPIX, establishing a sustainable catalytic cycle for pollutant degradation at ultralow PPIX dosages. The robustness of the redox cycling was supported by cyclic experiments, where the phenol removal efficiency remained stable after five consecutive runs. These findings provide new insights into developing low-dose catalysts to strengthen the Fe(VI) system for pollutant degradation."

To investigate this, we conducted a case–control study with 990 adults and animal experiments to examine the impact on kidney urate underexcretion. An interquartile range increase in PFASs was negatively associated with the fractional excretion of uric acid (FEUA%), an index for evaluating kidney urate excretion. Specifically, the association for 6:2 Cl-PFESA was β = −0.18 (95% CI −0.35, −0.02). Additionally, changes in FEUA (%) was negatively associated with uric acid levels (β = −13.42, 95% CI: −15.74, −11.09). Mediation analysis revealed that FEUA (%) mediated 14.22–25.63% of the association between PFASs and the uric acid level. Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) models show that 6:2 Cl-PFESA had the greatest impact on FEUA (%) (weight: 0.585). Animal studies demonstrated a significant decrease in FEUA (%) and changes in uric acid transporters. In the 400 μg/L CI-PFESA exposure group, FEUA (%) decreased by 0.22-fold, while ABCG2 and NPT4 protein levels decreased by 0.622-fold and 0.729-fold, respectively; the levels of OAT10 increased by 1.331-fold compared with controls.

Here, we develop a surface-confined cascade system in which laccase is coupled with metal ions (Na+, Cu2+, Fe3+) to activate reactive oxygen species (ROS) for the degradation of three representative polymers─polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polylactic acid (PLA). The laccase-Cu2+ system (optimal at 0.1 mM) exhibited the strongest catalytic performance, inducing substantial oxidative transformation of MPs, as reflected by pronounced increases in O/C ratios and extensive disruption of polymer surface chemistry. Among the three polymers, PLA showed the highest degradation susceptibility owing to its lower crystallinity, labile aliphatic ester linkages, and enhanced responsiveness to ROS. In situ-generated MPs-derived dissolved organic matter (MPs-DOM) further regulated interfacial redox processes by accelerating electron transfer to metals, stabilizing reduced species, and sustaining ROS cycling. XPS and solution-phase analyses corroborated the DOM-assisted metal redox cycling at polymer interfaces. Multivariate modeling identified humic-like components and oxygenated moieties as the dominant ROS predictors. These findings reveal MPs-DOM as an active redox mediator that reinforces laccase-metal synergy, enabling persistent ROS generation and progressive MPs degradation."

This study investigated the reproductive/developmental toxicity of l-GLA and racemic-GLA in pregnant mice at 13 and 130 μg/kg/day, achieving serum concentrations below or comparable to those reported in humans. Prenatal exposure to l-GLA and racemic-GLA at both doses caused fetal growth restriction (FGR), an approximate 10% reduction in placental weight, and structural abnormalities, including a smaller labyrinth zone, underdeveloped junctional zone, and increased apoptosis. l-GLA or racemic-GLA exposure impaired placental putrescine metabolism by downregulating arginase 1 (Arg1) and upregulating amine oxidase copper containing 1 (Aoc1) and monoamine oxidase A (Maoa) gene expression, resulted in reduced putrescine concentrations. Furthermore, impaired pyruvate metabolism, likely from 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase 1 (Hoga1) downregulation, depleted pyruvate and increased lactate in the placenta. In human placental trophoblast cells, putrescine or pyruvate supplementation rescued impaired celluar migration and invasion caused by l-GLA or racemic-GLA. These results indicate that environmentally relevant doses of l-GLA/racemic-GLA impair trophoblast function via putrescine/pyruvate-mediated metabolic reprogramming, leading to placental dysfunction and FGR.

This study examined MPF release from fabrics containing 30% mechanically recycled polyester fibers subjected to one, two, or three recycling cycles, compared to primary (virgin) polyester (PES). Shedding was assessed under both simulated wear and laundering conditions using Martindale, ICI Pilling Box, and ISO 4484–1:2023 (microplastic from textile sources) protocols. Laundering tests showed no clear difference in MPF release between primary PES and once-recycled PES (rPES-1; ∼ 1.4-fold). In contrast, fabrics with fibers recycled twice (rPES-2) and three times (rPES-3) released about 4.3-fold and 6.2-fold more MPFs than PES, respectively. Fiber release was different under dry-state abrasion than in laundry tests, highlighting the limitations of current wet-state focused assessments. Progressive fiber fragmentation and increased yarn hairiness suggest cumulative structural degradation with each recycling cycle. These findings underscore the need for standardized dry-state shedding assessments and improved recycling strategies to mitigate MPF emissions. While mechanical recycling remains environmentally preferable to uncontrolled disposal, these findings reveal a trade-off in the form of increased MPF release after multiple recycling cycles, which could be mitigated through improved recycling processes and fabric design. Achieving a balance between textile circularity and environmental sustainability remains a critical challenge for the industry."

Meanwhile, heavy metals have been associated with circulating oxylipins, which play crucial roles in regulating inflammatory response. Therefore, this case-control study was performed to evaluate the relationships among elemental exposure, oxylipin alterations, and ADHD risk. We also applied an integrated analytical approach to elucidate the mediating role of oxylipins in the association between elemental exposure and the risk of ADHD. All 40 elements were detected in over 75% of the 561 children, and a total of 125 oxylipins were detected in the cohort of 151 individuals. Logistic regression identified 14 elemental exposures significantly associated with ADHD risk. These were further refined to 11 key elements via elastic net regression for subsequent mixture analyses. The Bayesian kernel machine regression results indicated that the combined exposure levels of these elements were associated with increased odds of ADHD within the 25th–75th compared to the 50th percentile level. The quantile g-computation model also revealed a positive association between the elemental mixture level and ADHD risk, with an odds ratio (95% confidence intervals) of 1.72 (1.56, 1.90) for each quartile of the mixture concentration. Changes in four oxylipins were found to be correlated with three elemental levels. In the framework for mixed mediation analysis, the oxylipin risk score mediated 13.3% of the association between the element risk score and ADHD.

This study develops an integrated modeling framework that combines climate change scenarios, building energy modeling, indoor phthalate (PAE) simulations, and health exposure estimation. Scenario analyses under SSP1–2.6 and SSP5–8.5 pathways were conducted across 5 cities in representative climate zones in China to quantify indoor PAE concentrations and associated exposure levels. Results show that in heating regions, elevated floor temperatures during the heating season lead to pronounced seasonal patterns in PAE exposure, while annual exposure remains relatively insensitive to climate change. In contrast, exposure levels in nonheating regions are strongly influenced by future climate conditions. Under SSP1–2.6, exposure in 2080 is effectively controlled, whereas under SSP5–8.5, it continues to rise. The study reveals that climate change–driven alterations in building operation, indoor environment, and occupant behavior may substantially modify human exposure levels, posing a threat to public health. These findings emphasize the necessity of incorporating indoor exposure processes into future climate–health assessments."

The high‐frequency polarization of ice (kHz range) offers a suitable alternative to the conductivity, but field investigations at such frequencies are still challenging. Here, we demonstrate the polarization of blank ice features in solid rocks at low frequencies (1–100 Hz). We identify two polarization effects: (a) an increase in the response due to the polarization of charges in the electrical double layer formed at the ice‐water‐rock interface; (b) an even larger response due to the non‐equilibrium freezing potential taking place during ice formation. We demonstrate that these effects can be used to image ice features, for instance, during ground‐ice formation and degradation."

Van Lange et al. report an inverted correlation in a class of polymeric materials, implying a special role of long-ranged ionic interactions in vitrification. 
 Supercooled liquids undergo a rapid change in dynamics as they are cooled to their glass transition temperature and turn from a flowing liquid into an amorphous solid. Depending on how steeply the viscosity changes with temperature around the glass transition, glass formers are classified as strong or fragile. An empirical relation exists between the fragility of the liquid and the non-exponentiality of its α-relaxation. However, the microscopic origins of this correlation remain unclear and its generality has been debated. Here, we demonstrate that this relationship is inverted in organic materials with ionic interactions. We introduce a class of materials consisting of highly charged hydrophobic polymers cross-linked via moderated ionic interactions, and show that these combine a strong glass transition with an unusually stretched mechanical relaxation spectrum. By surveying a large variety of ionic liquids, polymerized ionic liquids, and ionomers, we show that all these charged materials follow a trend between fragility and non-exponential relaxation that is opposite to that of non-charged materials. This finding suggests a special role of long-ranged ionic interactions in vitrification and opens up a route toward developing new materials that combine the processability of strong glass formers with the mechanical dissipation of polymers.

Here, a bulk-cusp microstructure enables programmable 0–4 directional droplet spreading without external energy, driven by precursor film dynamics and capillary forces, offering potential for improved lubrication and smart cooling applications. 
 Controllable wetting of liquid on solid surface is meaningful for advanced science and engineering. Current researches about controllable liquid spreading are generally limited to unidirectional modes, while achieving multi-directional spreading on microstructured surfaces remains challenging. Herein, we propose a novel type of bulk-cusp microstructure, exhibiting 0 to 4-directional spreading of droplet without external energy input. This behavior occurs not only under single-drop deposition but also under continuous liquid injection. The bulk structure is assumed to have cross or square shape, implying relatively high and low coverage ratio of the precursor film, respectively. Owing to the drag effect of the precursor film, the cross-cusp microstructure facilitates controllable spreading of the main droplet, whereas the square-cusp microstructure just has guidance action on precursor film due to its low coverage ratio. Mechanism analysis reveals the capillary forces generated from the narrow gaps between adjacent cusps effectively separate the precursor film. The area coverage ratio of precursor film determined by the shape of the bulk influences the coupling or decoupling of the droplet body and precursor film. Such controllable multi-directional liquid spreading enables applications in lubrication enhancement and smart evaporation cooling.

Here, the authors show that mechanical compression and the presence/absence of Wnt ligand are inputs in a circuit that acts as a logic gate to control which complex is formed. 
 Protein phase separation has emerged as a crucial mechanism for spatiotemporal regulation of intracellular processes, yet its potential to integrate and compute diverse extracellular signals is not fully understood. Here, we show a mechano-biochemical circuit that harnesses phase separation to process mechanical and biochemical inputs, modulating cell fate decisions. We demonstrate that volumetric compression bidirectionally regulates canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling, where the presence of Wnt ligands determines the locations of AXIN phase separation to form either LRP6 signalosomes on the cell membrane or β-catenin destruction complexes in the cytosol, while the mechanical stimulus promotes degree of phase separation to amplify either the positive or negative signal. This circuit enhances healthy intestinal organoid proliferation while suppressing patient-derived colorectal cancer organoid growth, revealing its potential for precise mechanotherapy. Our findings establish phase separation as a critical component in mechanical signal transduction and provide a framework for integrating mechanical and biochemical cues in cellular decision-making. This approach opens avenues for targeted therapies and deepens our understanding of how cells process complex environmental information.

A meta-analysis now quantifies this perception gap, showing that its global and regional variation depends on who the ‘other’ is. 
 In mitigating and adapting to climate change-related risks, unbiased risk assessments are essential. Yet individuals systematically rate their personal risks as lower than those of others, believing themselves to be less at risk than others (that is, a self–other discrepancy). In a preregistered multi-level meta-analysis, we estimate the overall effect and boundary conditions for a self–other discrepancy in climate change-related risk perceptions. The synthesis incorporated 60 datasets, comprising 83 effect sizes from 70,337 participants across 17 countries. Results revealed that in 81 of 83 datasets, participants perceived their personal climate change-related risks as lower than others (d = −0.54, 95% CI [−0.68, −0.39]). This skewness was robust across specific extreme weather-related hazards and general climate change-related risks. Notably, the self–other discrepancy was less pronounced when comparisons involved specific others (for example, neighbours) or high-risk regions (for example, Asia), and more pronounced when the referents were compatriots or humanity as a whole or when the context was low-risk regions (for example, Europe). These results highlight a critical implication for the general public and a challenge for risk communicators: a widespread misperception, where people perceive personal climate change-related risks as lower than others, may hinder public engagement in mitigation and adaptation efforts.

 Global aridification threatens dryland ecosystems biodiversity and stability, yet the influence of multidimensional biodiversity on stability across aridity gradients is complex and context-dependent. Here we analyze plant and soil microbial diversity (taxonomic, phylogenetic, functional) across a 3,000-kilometer aridity gradient on the Mongolian Plateau and use multi-year observations from two validation sites. We identify a critical aridity threshold (Aridity ≈ 0.83) where stability mechanisms abruptly shift. Below this threshold (less arid conditions), ecosystem stability is positively linked to plant and fungal taxonomic richness. Above it (more arid conditions), stability correlates with conservative plant traits (lower special leaf area) and lower phylogenetic diversity, reflecting environmental filtering for stress-tolerant species. This transition is driven by a shift from C3 to C4 plant dominance, altering community traits and plant-microbial interactions. While our correlational findings require experimental confirmation, they challenge linear stability models, highlighting the importance of threshold-dependent biodiversity-environment interactions for dryland management. Ecosystem stability shifts at an aridity threshold where in less arid conditions it is linked to plant and fungal richness and in more arid conditions it depends on conservative plant traits and lower phylogenetic diversity, based on sampling across a 3000-km Mongolian Plateau gradient."

 Distributed Acoustic Sensing provides a transformative view of seismic wavefields, offering spatially continuous recordings that enable tracking of seismic phases along fibre optic cables. Offshore, fibres often cross sedimentary layers that generate phase conversions dominating early waveforms, increasing signal complexity and hindering rapid magnitude estimation for Earthquake Early Warning. Here, we analyse the peak amplitudes of seismic signals in a wide magnitude range (2.5≤ M ≤7.4), recorded by three interrogators along a 400km-long fibre array offshore Chile. We show that the direct P-phase is quickly dominated by secondary phases, limiting its use for source size estimation of moderate-to-large earthquakes. Conversely, we report that converted P-to-S waves carry a signature of the source similar to that of the S-phase within a few seconds from the first arrivals, offering a valuable proxy for rapid magnitude estimation. This finding reinforces the potential of Distributed Acoustic Sensing for Early Warning when sensing offshore cables.

 Compound floods resulting from the concurrence of river overflow and elevated sea levels are becoming increasingly unpredictable as climate extremes intensify. However, most flood risk assessments still fail to account for the uncertainty in their co-occurrence. Here, we quantify potential coastal compound flood risk at 0.1∘ resolution by integrating flood hazard, population exposure, and empirical vulnerability. Specifically, we introduce a compound flood metric, which aggregates riverine and oceanic flood volumes across multiple return periods under a physically plausible co-occurrence assumption. We further derive an empirical vulnerability function based on the ratio between observed and maximum potential flood hazard. The results show that Asia exhibites the highest 35.22% internal high-risk grids, followed by Africa (20.21%), Europe (17.02%), South America (9.89%), and North America (2.31%), with river deltas and low-lying coasts emerging as global riskhotspots.

 Understanding volcanic dynamics and assessing eruptive risk require examining the entire transcrustal magmatic system. However, direct imaging of magma distribution and connectivity from the Moho to the surface remains rare. Changbaishan-Tianchi volcano, known for one of the Earth’s largest explosive eruptions, has recently undergone repeated magmatic unrest. To investigate the magmatic system beneath Tianchi volcano, we invert magnetotelluric data to image its three-dimensional resistivity structure, revealing a vertically extensive low-resistivity anomaly system spanning the entire crust. This system comprises three compositionally distinct, vertically connected melt reservoirs: a broad lower-crustal basaltic reservoir (20–35 km), an upper-crustal trachytic reservoir (5–10 km), and an uppermost comenditic reservoir (2–3.5 km). Estimated melt fractions are 2.1–3.7%, 7.0–16.3%, and 18.8–23.8%, respectively. Our results suggest progressive upward magma transfer among these reservoirs via well-resolved conductive pathways, consistent with recent episodes of unrest. Notably, melt volume in the lower crust is about one to two orders of magnitude greater than in the upper crust, a pattern also observed at Yellowstone and likely applicable to active volcanic systems at both divergent and convergent plate boundaries. These findings suggest that deep crustal hot zones may fundamentally control shallow melt volumes and thus the eruptive capacity of polygenetic volcanoes.

 Natural hazards are intensifying globally, necessitating public emergency preparedness to safeguard individuals and society. Yet, many citizens remain inadequately prepared. Here, we synthesized the current knowledge on public emergency preparedness by conducting a series of meta-analyses across 33 socio-psychological correlates of preparedness and their interplay in meta-analytic structural equation modeling. The dataset included 1,123 effect sizes from 167 independent samples spanning three decades, 30 countries, and 110,683 individuals facing hazards such as heatwaves and earthquakes. Results identified four key factors of public (un)preparedness: (1) social norms regarding preparedness, (2) efficacy beliefs and attitudes toward specific preparedness actions, preliminary – (3) information dissemination sources, and (4) barriers to preparedness. Notably, the effects considerably varied across studies. For researchers, we recommend refined conceptualizations and measurements of preparedness and focus on heat-related hazards. For practitioners, this synthesis provides insights to improve risk communication, inform policy decisions, and build resilient communities.

 3D navigation, by virtue of its realism, provides rich, authentic, and visually immersive information that closely approximates the physical world, playing a crucial role in domains such as commerce and scientific research. However, current 3D navigation systems face challenges including the separation of multi-view information and the occlusion of navigation routes. This paper presents an occlusion-free, multi-perspective visualization method for urban navigation routes. We introduce an undulating curve surface and, through computation of an information detail metric, demonstrate that our surface enables rapid transitions from the focus to the context and supports visualization of much larger scene extents within the same screen space, compared to a monotonic cylindrical surface. We further enhance scene information delivery by segmenting the navigation route and adjusting the camera’s tilt angle and field of view to match different surface parameters. To eliminate occlusion of the navigation route, we adjust the position and scale of obstructing buildings, assigning distance-based weights. Compared to the fixed-weight approach, our distance-weighted approach highlights building position and shape features more effectively across varied scenarios. The proposed method is validated using an experimental scenario in a region of Barcelona. Experimental results indicate that our approach can effectively represent scenes at different scales while prominently displaying the navigation route, thereby enhancing the overall navigation experience."

 Landslide monitoring is essential for understanding geohazards and mitigating associated risks. Existing point cloud-based methods, however, typically rely on either geometric or radiometric information and often yield sparse or non-3D displacement estimates. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical partitioning-based coarse-to-fine approach that fuses 3D point clouds and co-registered RGB images to estimate dense 3D displacement vector fields. Patch-level matches are constructed using both 3D geometry and 2D image features, refined via geometric consistency checks, and followed by rigid transformation estimation per match. Experimental results on two real-world landslide datasets demonstrate that the proposed method produces 3D displacement estimates with high spatial coverage (79% and 97%) and accuracy. Deviations in displacement magnitude with respect to external measurements (total station or GNSS observations) are 0.15 m and 0.25 m on the two datasets, respectively, and only 0.07 m and 0.20 m compared to manually derived references, all below the mean scan resolutions (0.08 m and 0.30 m). Compared with the state-of-the-art method F2S3, the proposed approach improves spatial coverage while maintaining comparable accuracy. The proposed approach offers a practical and adaptable solution for TLS-based landslide monitoring and is extensible to other types of point clouds and monitoring tasks."

Within this mechanistic manifold, carbon-oxygen bonds in epoxides are stereoselectively converted into carbon-carbon bonds in a process mediated by organoboron reagents. Epoxycycloalkanes undergo highly chemo-, regio-, and stereoselective carbon migration to furnish ring-contracted products with broad generality. This strategy also enables enantioselective 1,2-hydride migrations for linear epoxide substrates.

We present the Chinese Immune Multi-Omics Atlas (CIMA), characterizing molecular variations linked to sex, age, and genetic variants through multi-omics analysis of more than 10 million circulating immune cells from 428 Chinese adults. CIMA established an enhancer-driven gene regulatory network comprising 237 robust regulons; identified 9600 eGenes and 52,361 caPeaks at cell type resolution; and revealed pleiotropic associations among immune-related disease risk loci, cis-expression quantitative trait loci (QTLs), and chromatin accessibility QTLs. Furthermore, the cell language model CIMA-CLM predicted chromatin accessibility and evaluated the effects of noncoding variants from chromatin sequences and gene expression.

Demonstrating similar learning processes in nonhuman species would indicate that the social-cognitive skills supporting this process are not exclusively human but may have evolved, or can develop, in other species, offering valuable insights into the origins of language-related cognition. In this study, we demonstrated that a small group of Gifted Word Learner dogs, which possess an extensive vocabulary of object labels, can learn new labels by overhearing their owners’ interactions. Moreover, we show that these dogs can acquire novel object-label mappings even when the labels and objects are not presented simultaneously. Taken together, these results suggest that Gifted Word Learner dogs possess sociocognitive skills functionally parallel to those of 18-month-old children."

Termed Floquet engineering, such periodic driving applied to electronic systems can induce topological band structures and control spin interactions. In this study, we present a class of Floquet states in a magnetic vortex that arise from nonlinear interactions between the vortex core and microwave magnons. Floquet bands emerge through the periodic oscillation of the core, which can be initiated by either driving the core directly or pumping azimuthal magnon modes. For the latter, the azimuthal modes induce core gyration through nonlinear interactions, which in turn renormalizes the magnon band structure. This represents a self-induced mechanism for Floquet band engineering and opens avenues to study and control nonlinear magnon dynamics."

Anatomy shows that facial muscles are under direct control from multiple cortical regions, and studies of patients with focal lesions suggest that lateral frontal cortices control voluntary movements and medial emotional expressions. By directly measuring single-neuron activity from both sets of areas, we found that lateral and medial cortical face motor regions encode both types of gestures. They do so through area-specific temporal activity patterns, distinguishable well prior to movement onset. Our results show that cortical regions projecting in parallel downstream form a continuum of gesture coding, from dynamic to temporally stable, to produce socially appropriate motor outputs during communication."

We identified genes encoding a predicted nuclease paired with a trypsin-like protease repeatedly acquired by multiple, otherwise unrelated antiviral immune systems in bacteria. Cell-based and biochemical assays revealed that the nuclease is a proenzyme that cleaves DNA only after activation by its partner protease. Two distinct immune systems, Hachiman and AVAST (antiviral adenosine triphosphatase/nucleoside triphosphatase of the STAND superfamily, Avs), use the same mechanism of proteolytic activation despite their independent evolutionary origins. Examination of nuclease-protease inheritance patterns identified caspase-nuclease (canu) genomic loci that confer antiviral defense in a pathway reminiscent of eukaryotic caspase activation. These results uncover the coordinated activities of pronucleases and their activating proteases within different immune systems and show how coevolution enables defense system innovation."

To investigate multispecies mixtures as an alternative strategy, the 26-site international LegacyNet experiment systematically varied the diversity of sown grasslands using up to six high-yielding forage species (grasses, legumes, and herbs) managed under moderate nitrogen inputs. Multispecies mixtures outyielded two widely used grassland practices: a grass monoculture with higher nitrogen fertilizer and a two-species grass-legume community. High yields in multispecies mixtures were driven by strong positive grass-legume and legume-herb interactions. In warmer sites, the yield advantage of legume-containing multispecies mixtures over grass monocultures with higher nitrogen fertilizer inputs increased. Improved design of grassland mixtures can inform more environmentally sustainable forage production and may enhance adaptation of productive grasslands to a warming climate."

Experiments are often guided by a prediction of a distinct and self-explanatory signal called “the smoking gun.” However, in micrometer- or nanometer-scale specimens, phenomenology can mimic the anticipated behavior without containing the exotic states. We show limited data that are consistent with the presence of four topological phenomena; by considering additional data, we identified the most likely origins of the observed patterns as trivial. We argue that the reliability of smoking gun–type claims can be greatly enhanced by releasing comprehensive datasets, discussing alternative scenarios, and disclosing the total volume of study."

This study compares global OAE with regionally focused deployment in subduction regions of the Southern Ocean, Northwest Atlantic, and Norwegian-Barents Sea. We conducted ensemble simulations using an emissions-driven Earth System Model (ESM) under high- (SSP3-7.0) and low-emissions (SSP1-2.6) scenarios. By 2100, subduction region OAE was nearly as efficient (SSP3-7.0: 0.71 ± 0.03, SSP1-2.6: 0.60 ± 0.04) as global deployments (SSP3-7.0: 0.73 ± 0.01, SSP1-2.6: 0.64 ± 0.03). However, the ESM simulations did not reproduce the efficient vertical carbon transport seen in a previous ocean-only study, as strong internal variability and climate feedbacks to OAE hampered deep ocean carbon storage. The excess ocean CO2 uptake and atmospheric CO2 reduction were scenario-dependent (15%–19% and 22%–41% lower under SSP1-2.6 compared to SSP3-7.0, respectively). The pathways of excess ocean CO2 uptake and atmospheric CO2 reduction diverged between the scenarios after the mid-2060s, when atmospheric CO2 peaked and then declined under SSP1-2.6, with a substantially larger relative land carbon loss in SSP1-2.6 than in SSP3-7.0 for regional OAE deployment. Furthermore, the emissions-driven ensemble simulations showed that climate feedbacks introduced substantial uncertainty in early decades of regional OAE efficiency, posing challenges for near-term monitoring, reporting, and verification. Reviewing our and previous model experiments revealed a strong linear relationship between added alkalinity and oceanic CO2 uptake and atmospheric reduction, highlighting that first-order effects of OAE on carbonate chemistry are well understood and consistently represented, while the effects of carbon and climate feedbacks (13%–20%) and scenario sensitivity are smaller but non-negligible. Overall, our study shows that subduction regions can be a viable option for OAE; however, their efficiency is limited by these feedbacks and scenario sensitivity, which must be accounted for in future regional OAE interventions."

This study assesses the CO2 sequestration and efficacy of two CDR approaches, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE), applied individually and in combination. Using the Norwegian Earth System Model, simulations were designed to ramp up deployment of BECCS and OAE, to an additional area of 5.2 million km2 by 2100 for bioenergy feedstock for BECCS, and a CaO deployment rate of approximately 2.7 Gt yr−1 for OAE within the exclusive economic zones of Europe, the United States and China. The combined land–ocean CDR simulation revealed a largely additive carbon removal effect. Over 2030−2100, OAE sequestered 7 ppm of CO2 with an accumulated 82.3 Gt CaO, achieving a CDR effectiveness of 0.08 ppm (∼0.17 PgC) per Gt CaO, while BECCS reduced 16 ppm of CO2, with CDR effectiveness of 3.1 ppm per million km2 of bioenergy crops. Together, the carbon removal achieved by BECCS and OAE corresponds to anthropogenic CO2 emissions of 5.4 Gt CO2 yr−1 by 2100, slightly more than 60% of current global transport sector emissions. Notably, the efficiency of BECCS and OAE alone was unaffected by their concurrent deployment. Nevertheless, simulations revealed distinct non-linear interactions, such as declines in land and soil carbon sinks in the combined scenario. Furthermore, all simulations show negligible effects on the global annual mean temperature. These results highlight near-additive CDR responses even under net-negative emissions, but feedback on land and ocean carbon sinks must be considered when designing CDR portfolios. This study provides new insights into CDR portfolio design and Earth system feedback under an overshoot scenario, highlighting both their potential and the need for continued emissions cuts and supportive policies."

To address these issues, this study performs a multi-scale attribution analysis of temperature extremes over the period 1901–2020 and examines the robustness of attribution-based scaling factors across different time scales. Despite uncertainties in the early data, the newly developed homogenized observations show pronounced warming in both cold and hot extremes, along with a lengthening of the growing season during 1901–2020. These trends intensified markedly after the 1950s, with the magnitude of changes approximately doubling for some extreme indices. Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models successfully reproduce the overall warming trends in observations, although they underestimate the magnitude of changes, particularly in the pre-1950 period. Using optimal fingerprinting, more than 70% of the observed changes are attributed to greenhouse gas forcing, with aerosols offsetting less than 35% of the greenhouse gas-induced warming. Attribution analysis conducted within a large-ensemble model framework across multiple time scales shows that the ranges of best estimates and confidence intervals (CIs) for scaling factors decrease as the time period lengthens. The century-scale attribution yields the narrowest CIs and most robust best estimates, indicating the most robust detection results. Despite the robustness of century-scale results, scaling factors from 1951–2020 are selected to constrain projections due to more reliable observational constraints. Constrained end-of-century (2081–2100) projections show amplified increases of 20.3%–33.1% for most extremes compared to raw projections, highlighting the critical impact of attribution period selection and providing a transferable framework for regional climate risk assessment."

While networks are recognized as key elements in energy transitions, quantitative evidence on how network structures influence residential technology adoption is limited. We examine how local governance network structures influence solar-battery integration by analyzing renewable energy networks across eight U.S. states. Our analysis reveals that networks with higher levels of both coordination (measured through degree centrality) and cooperation (measured through clustering coefficients) are significantly associated with higher co-adoption rates. Policy entrepreneurs—stakeholders who invest resources to promote energy transitions—can accelerate co-adoption through two strategic approaches: strengthening central coordinators who share information across stakeholder groups, and fostering densely connected networks that build trust and reduce perceived adoption risks. Notably, cooperation networks show particularly strong effects compared to coordination mechanisms, as dense collaborative relationships prove especially important for technologies requiring complex integration and higher investment. These findings provide actionable strategies for accelerating clean energy adoption while advancing energy transition theory by quantitatively linking specific network characteristics to adoption outcomes."

However, the impact of emerging contaminants on SCFA-producing processes remains poorly understood. In this study, we employed laboratory fermentation microcosms to investigate the effects of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) on SCFA-producing bioprocesses and the underlying mechanisms. Our results revealed that TBBPA at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 5.0 mg/kg TS significantly increased the accumulation of SCFAs. However, there was no significant difference in the increments of SCFAs between fermenters containing low (0.5 mg/kg TS) and high (5 mg/kg TS) levels of TBBPA. The yield of acetic acid, which was the predominant SCFA in fermenters with a TBBPA concentration of 5 mg/kg TS, was 1.3 times higher than that in the control group. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that TBBPA promoted substrate hydrolysis, particularly carbohydrates, due to differential interactions with organic matter. TBBPA also increased ATP levels, electron transport system (ETS) activity, and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) secretion in enriched acidogenic and acetogenic communities, thereby enhancing microbial viability and metabolic activity. Microbial community analysis showed increased abundances of key SCFA-producing bacteria, particularly acetogens, alongside potential TBBPA degraders. Overall, this study reveals that TBBPA, despite being an environmental pollutant, can unexpectedly stimulate anaerobic fermentation via microbial adaptation and activity enhancement, offering a novel and sustainable perspective for optimizing sludge treatment and resource recovery."

Here, 1,016,590 quarterly concentration records for 277 toxicants from 367 monitoring points were integrated into an adaptive zonation and classification framework for mixture-oriented risk management. Ecological mixture risk was quantified with species-sensitivity-distribution models combined in a tiered concentration addition → response addition (CA → RA) scheme, while Monte Carlo simulations captured probabilistic carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic human health risks. These dimensions were merged into an environmental health risk index (EHRI; 0.42 ecology: 0.58 health). Quadrant analysis identified four coexposure patterns and showed that ≤10% of detected toxicants─chiefly inorganics, metals, BTEXs, haloalkanes, and phenols─drive >95% of cumulative EHRI. Spatial interpolation converted point-level EHRIs to grid-scale and, when embedded in a “source–plume–buffer” treatment train, reduced the great concern zone (EHRI > 0.60) from 19 km2 to <0.1 km2 after removal of 45 highest-leverage toxicants. The framework unifies deterministic and probabilistic perspectives, pinpoints priority toxicants and zones, and supplies tier-graded actionable triggers for adaptive intervention. This study provides the first field-scale evidence that mixture-aware risk assessment can be directly coupled to risk-zoned management, offering a transferable blueprint for the sustainable regulation of complex, multipollutant groundwater systems worldwide and a framework potentially relevant to other management zones such as surface water."

Environmentally relevant As elevations (8-fold in water and 3-fold in sediment) increased crab mortality by up to 60%, primarily due to impaired carapace sclerotization. Most deaths occurred within the first 8 days, coinciding with the peak inorganic As accumulation in the tissues. As exposure duration increased, mortality decreased, a trend associated with the biotransformation of inorganic As to arsenobetaine. Morphologically, As disrupted carapace mineralization, resulting in increased endocuticle pore density, shortened ribbon-like tubules, and disorganization of chitin-protein matrices. Concurrently, the phosphorus content decreased by approximately 30% in the hepatopancreas and 70% in the carapaces, showing significant negative correlations with As accumulation. The expression of phosphorus transporters (spPiT1) and carapace formation-related genes (spBMP) was down-regulated. These results demonstrate that As is highly toxic to mud crabs during molting, impairing carapace sclerotization through the interference of phosphorus metabolism. This study reveals a novel toxicological mechanism of As in marine crustaceans and highlights an urgent need to re-evaluate its ecological risks."

This review systematically integrates current evidence on the formation and transformation of MNPs under mechanical, photochemical, thermal, oxidative, and biological processes, highlighting that environmental MNPs are predominantly aged rather than pristine particles. Aging significantly reshapes particle shape, size, surface chemistry, and reactivity, thereby altering mobility, persistence, and interactions with copollutants, biota, and humans. By adopting a source─transformation─exposure─risk framework, this review clarifies the critical importance of understanding transformation pathways for tracing pollution origins, revealing exposure routes and doses, and improving health risk assessment. Particular attention is directed toward nanoplastics, whose elevated reactivity and bioavailability remain poorly understood due to analytical limitations. Strategic research priorities are identified, including the development of multifactorial aging simulation models, advanced detection and characterization techniques, and lifecycle-oriented mitigation strategies. This work advances a forward-looking perspective that connects mechanistic understanding with risk governance, providing a scientific foundation for more accurate prediction, monitoring, and control of MNP pollution."

 Reliable quantification of global water-cycle components, such as river flow and land evapotranspiration, remains a major challenge. Here we refine estimates of global water partitioning by combining outputs from multiple Earth system models with river flow observations from 50 large basins, applying the emergent constraint approach. Between 1980 and 2014, global river flow was (39.1 ± 5.4) × 103 km3 yr−1, with a river flow-to-precipitation ratio of 0.35 ± 0.03, both lower than previous estimates. Land evapotranspiration reached (73.4 ± 6.2) × 103 km3 yr−1. Under climate change, we project global river flow to rise by 7.8 ± 5.5 mm per year per degree of warming. This estimate, refined through the emergent constraint method, is 9.3% lower than the ensemble mean of Earth system models and reduces inter-model uncertainty by 66%. By integrating river flow observations, we provide more accurate historical estimates and strengthen future projections of global water-cycle components.

Upregulated by circulating inflammatory cytokines post-injury, it binds ALK5 to potentiate TGF-β signaling and promotes fibrotic progression, presenting a promising target for CKD. 
 The concept of organ-organ communication in systemic diseases has gained significant traction. Despite accumulating evidence of liver-kidney crosstalk, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we identify hepatokine fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL1) as a pivotal mediator driving liver-kidney communication in renal fibrosis. Integrative RNA sequencing and clinical analyses revealed FGL1 upregulation in the liver post-renal injury, with subsequent selective accumulation in fibrotic kidneys. Hepatocyte-specific knockout of FGL1 improved renal morphology, attenuated collagen deposition, and inhibited fibrosis markers in unilateral ureteral obstruction and adenine-induced mouse models. Conversely, FGL1 overexpression exacerbated renal fibrosis. Mechanistically, FGL1 binds to TGF-β receptor ALK5 and blocks its interaction with K48-linked polyubiquitin. Structural analyses identified critical residues in FGL1-ALK5 interaction. Hepatic FGL1 is transcriptionally regulated by STAT3, and activated by inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α). Pharmacological inhibition by p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (screened out from 4080 compounds) or an anti-FGL1 monoclonal antibody significantly reduced renal fibrosis without hepatotoxicity. These findings establish FGL1 as a key mediator of pathogenic liver-kidney crosstalk and highlights therapeutic strategies to targeting organ-organ networks in renal fibrosis.

 Biomanufacturing provides a more sustainable alternative to fossil-based chemical manufacturing. 3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3HP) is a top Department of Energy value-added chemical and precursor to bioplastics, yet cost-effective microbial production remains elusive. Here, we establish the acid-tolerant yeast Issatchenkia orientalis as a robust host for low-pH 3HP biosynthesis. Genome-scale modeling identifies the β-alanine pathway as optimal, offering the highest theoretical yield and lowest oxygen requirement. Thermodynamic analysis confirms its favorability under acidic conditions. Using sequence similarity network analysis, we discover highly active aspartate 1-decarboxylase (PAND), β-alanine-pyruvate aminotransferase (BAPAT), and 3HP dehydrogenase (YDFG), which significantly improve the pathway efficiency. Next, to further elevate the production, pathway optimization through multi-copy PAND integration, byproduct elimination (knockouts of pyruvate decarboxylase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), and reinforcement of aspartate flux by overexpression of pyruvate carboxylase and aspartate amino transferase improves the titer to 29 g/L in shake flasks. Fed-batch fermentation at pH 4 with low-cost corn steep liquor medium further increases the production to 92 g/L with 0.7 g/g yield and 0.55 g/L/h productivity. Techno-economic analysis indicates that such performance could potentially enable a financially viable process for sustainable acrylic acid production.

 Precise manipulation of small objects using light holds transformative potential across diverse fields. While research in optical trapping and manipulation predominantly relies on the attraction of solid matter to light intensity maxima, here we demonstrate that meta-optics enables a departure from this accepted behavior. Specifically, we present deterministic control over the sign of optical forces exerted on a metasurface integrated on a suspended silicon nanomembrane. By tailoring the geometry of the constituent meta-atoms, we engineer the coherent superposition of their multipolar modes, and consequently, the net optical force experienced by the metasurface within a phase-controlled optical standing wave. In excellent agreement with 3D numerical simulations, we experimentally realize both attractive and repulsive forces on distinct metasurface designs, directly mirroring the behavior of two-level systems interacting with optical fields. This work establishes a versatile platform for the optical control of nanoscale mechanical systems, opening alternative avenues for both fundamental research and engineering.

In this case report, phage-antibiotic therapy was used to treat a vascular graft infection caused by a refractory fluoroquinolone non-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 
 Biofilm-related vascular graft infections (VGIs) pose major therapeutic challenges due to persistent, antibiotic-resistant bacteria often residing in retained grafts. Phage therapy offers a promising alternative treatment strategy against biofilm-associated infections, though its use remains mostly ad hoc and typically considered a last-resort intervention. We report here the treatment of a refractory, fluoroquinolone non-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa VGI using a systematically planned and synergistic phage-antibiotic combination approach. Adjunctive phage therapy led to radiological improvement, as seen by reduced 18F-FDG PET/CT tracer uptake around the graft. The patient was transitioned to oral fluoroquinolone suppression therapy with no recurrence of bacteremia to-date, after a year. Our workflow led to the selection of phages that sensitized Pseudomonas aeruginosa to killing by levofloxacin and piperacillin-tazobactam. We established that this phage-driven antibiotic sensitization was due to the ability of our phages to use the MexAB-OprM efflux pump as a receptor. We also showed that our phages had potent anti-biofilm activity. We advocate a systematic, multi-pronged management strategy for refractory VGIs, including early therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), in vitro antibiotic combination testing (iACT), and timely adjunctive phage therapy. This case illustrates the utility of individualized, strategic approaches and highlights adjunctive phage therapy’s potential in treating complex biofilm-related infections.

Here, Zhang, Ding, and coauthors succeed in breaking in-plane mirror symmetries via crystallographic engineering, and observe a giant non-linear Hall effect and current induced magnetization at room temperature. 
 Interfaces in heterostructures possess inherent inversion asymmetry and display diverse physical effects, however, the pristine in-plane mirror symmetries of the constituent layers are usually preserved at the interface. On-demand manipulation of these symmetries remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a strategy to control the in-plane mirror symmetries of interfaces by engineering the crystallographic orientation of heterostructures. We design a workhorse system with a new orientation, i.e., the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructure with metallic interfaces in the (112)-plane. Such a high index orientation leads to the breaking of all the pristine mirror symmetries except the mirror plane perpendicular to the $$[1\bar{1}0]$$ direction ($${M}_{[1\bar{1}0]}$$), resulting in the Cs point symmetry with a metallic conduction. Consequently, this interface exhibits a giant nonlinear Hall effect characterized by a large Berry curvature dipole, a circular photogalvanic effect, and current-induced out-of-plane magnetization, all functional at room temperature. The magnitude of the nonlinear Hall effect rivals the Weyl and Dirac systems. Our work establishes a new strategy in exploring emerging electronic properties with nontrivial quantum geometry by designing the interface symmetry.

 The intestinal epithelium plays a critical role in health and disease, yet the impact of microenvironmental cues in diseased contexts, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), remains poorly defined. To address this gap, we first benchmarked human colonic organoid injury models against IBD tissue and established a disease-relevant model of inflammation using inflammatory cytokines. Using this system, we built a dictionary of epithelial responses to 79 secreted niche factors at single cell resolution via donor-pooled, multiplexed single cell RNA-sequencing. The comprehensive nature of our atlas allowed us to map relationships between perturbations, infer the function of less characterized ligands, and identify cell type-specific perturbed pathways. Finally, we established the relevance of organoid-derived gene programs by mapping them to single cell and spatial atlases of human IBD tissue. Our resource offers a global view of epithelial responses to microenvironmental cues, offering insights into epithelial homeostasis and repair mechanisms in IBD.

This offers insights on the instability in the solid density region, stimulating new modelling of laser-solid interactions. 
 The streaming of energetic charged particles can magnetize astrophysical and laboratory plasmas via the current filamentation instability. Despite its importance, the experimental characterization of this instability has remained a challenge. Here, we report an experiment combining a high-intensity optical laser with a high-brightness X-ray free electron laser that successfully images the instability in solid-density plasmas with 200 nm spatial and 50 fs temporal resolution. We characterize the development of μm-scale filamentary structures and their evolution over tens of picoseconds through a non-linear merging process. The measured plasma density modulations and long merging time reveal the critical importance of space-charge effects and ion motion on this electron-driven instability. Supporting theoretical analysis and kinetic simulations help distinguish the relative role of space-charge and resistive effects.

This research examines how historical El Niño–Southern Oscillation events have caused life expectancy and economic losses across the Pacific Rim and projects future impacts and vulnerable groups. 
 The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a major driver of global climate variability, yet its long-term effect on life expectancy remains unclear. Here we quantify how ENSO persistently impedes mortality improvement, leading to considerable life expectancy and economic losses across high-income Pacific Rim countries. We estimate life expectancy losses of 0.5 years (monetary equivalent loss of US$2.6 trillion) for the 1982–1983 El Niño and 0.4 years (US$4.7 trillion) for the 1997–1998 event. Climate projections under moderate emissions pathways suggest a cumulative decline of 2.8 years in life expectancy by 2100, amounting to US$35 trillion losses, with most of the monetary burden falling on the middle-aged population. These findings reveal that intensifying ENSO variability poses an underrecognized and enduring threat to human health and socio-economic stability, underscoring the urgent need for targeted adaptation strategies to safeguard population well-being.

Here the authors use deep learning models and ecological network theory to study the impacts of human pressures on terrestrial vertebrate habitat hotspots now and under future scenarios of global change. 
 Protecting critical habitats globally is essential to buffer threatened species from extinction due to anthropogenic stressors. However, a limited understanding of the global distribution patterns of habitats for threatened terrestrial vertebrates and their associated habitat hotspots hinders efforts aimed at assessing biodiversity vulnerability and developing targeted conservation strategies. In this study, we integrated spatial data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species with a deep learning approach to evaluate the habitat distribution for 4,851 threatened species and construct a global niche interaction network. These habitat hotspots cover only 4% of the terrestrial surface but encompass 67.9% of all analysed species. While vast unoccupied habitats exist, 76.8% of them remain geographically isolated by continental or oceanic barriers and are significantly affected by human pressures. Species at higher risk of extinction often have a larger proportion of unoccupied habitats, but geographic isolation limits these ecological opportunities. We identified regions where unoccupied habitats are concentrated and have long-term persistence potential. Furthermore, the continued loss of native habitats for species inhabiting islands or continental margins due to human pressures may accelerate the widespread homogenization of global niches, underscoring the rarity and irreplaceability of these fragile habitats. Our global assessment provides useful perspectives on sustainable conservation planning. The threat of species extinction is a major problem resulting from various anthropogenic pressures.

This study reveals that, under all relevant protection mechanisms in the contiguous USA, only 12% of rivers are adequately protected. 
 To address the enduring and deepening crisis facing fresh waters, many nations have recently set bold targets for freshwater protection. However, the lack of comprehensive databases and integrative frameworks hampers a robust evaluation of current freshwater protections and prioritization of future opportunities to meet these goals. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of river protection for the USA by reconciling the disparate array of major federal, state, tribal and private protection mechanisms into a single, multifaceted index. We report that just over one tenth of the river length of the contiguous USA and less than one fifth of rivers nationwide are currently protected at a level deemed viable. Lowland headwater streams and intermittent watercourses are consistently underprotected. Protection is also often spatially misaligned with other conservation objectives, where only a small fraction of watersheds with high biodiversity, habitat intactness and importance to drinking water supply are adequately (30% of river length) protected. Our assessment of river protection highlights the urgency to increase new and fortify existing protections for rivers in the years to come if we are to meet ambitious conservation targets, reverse the curve of biodiversity loss and ensure that healthy rivers benefit everyone. Although river protection is core to social and environmental well-being, the extent to which river conservation policies are effective is difficult to assess.

 Sea surface temperature is a key indicator of climate change on Earth and is central to all related modelling endeavours. However, sea surface temperature is notoriously difficult to reconstruct accurately in the geological record, especially for the low temperatures of the polar regions, which occupy one-third of the world’s oceans. Here we show that a sea surface temperature proxy based on two isomeric diatom lipid biomarkers can be applied to marine sediment archives to reconstruct temperatures in the range −1 to 14 °C for the Arctic and Antarctic using a single calibration. For both regions, our datasets span timeframes from recent decades to the Younger Dryas/Holocene, and we also showcase a 750 kyr record from the Fram Strait, the major gateway between the North Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean. We anticipate that this lipid biomarker-based proxy may become a standard component of the palaeoclimate toolkit, especially for the polar regions.

 Recovering geological samples from the deep basins and ridges of the central Arctic Ocean presents significant challenges because of remote access and thick ice cover. During the 2016 Canada-Sweden Polar Expedition to the Arctic Ocean, volcaniclastic breccia was dredged from the Alpha Ridge, part of an underwater mountain chain extending from the Canadian polar margin to the Siberian shelf. Argon geochronology of plagioclase crystals within glassy lava fragments dates the sample to 90.4 ± 0.26 Ma. The geochemical composition of basalt clasts in the volcaniclastic breccia closely resembles that of igneous rocks from the High Arctic Large Igneous Province suggesting that the Alpha Ridge was an active volcanic feature within the circum-Arctic in the Late Cretaceous. Our results support lava–water interactions in a littoral environment, driven by the growth and emergence of a central igneous platform and accompanied by eruptive activity at constructional volcanic edifices along its margins.

 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are important tools in marine conservation. However, MPAs have unforeseen consequences, including complex adverse outcomes for human coastal communities through impacts such as dispossession of people to resource access. Here we searched the literature for evidence of MPA effects across the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), collected information on these effects and the forms of evidence used to document these effects. Our analysis indicated that MPAs can have both positive and negative effects across each of the 17 SDGs, and that many papers rely on secondary data over primary data to assess those effects. For SDGs 1 (End Poverty), 2 (No Hunger), and 5 (Gender Equality) we found that papers highlighting benefits of MPAs were usually more reliant on secondary information than papers emphasizing adverse impacts. Given the importance of local contexts, MPAs are better used as precision interventions rather than broad policy tools for achieving large-scale marine sustainability.

To address this, we conducted a comprehensive phenotypic screen using an in vitro model of epiblast development. We identified aurora kinase A as a cell-intrinsic factor contributing to Erk activation and transcriptional response. Consequently, suppressing aurora kinase A activity delayed exit from naïve pluripotency. Moreover, our results show that upon entry into mitosis, Erk relocates to the cell division machinery. We found that in dividing cells, a fraction of Erk, with yet elusive functions, localizes on the centrosomes, where its phosphorylation depends on polo-like kinase 1."

The chitosan hydrogel solution was peritumorally injected in bacteria-colonized tumors in mice followed by the rapid in situ gelation. After killing tumor cells and intratumoral bacteria by doxorubicin and cefotaxime, the hydrogel efficiently adsorbed bacterial pathogen-associated molecular patterns, tumor cell–derived damage-associated molecular patterns, and tumor-associated antigens. These danger signals greatly potentiated immune cell recruitment into the hydrogel and sufficiently activated dendritic cells (DCs) by the absorbed DNA-mediated cGAS-STING activation.

These transitions were accompanied by genomic shifts reflecting adaptations to habitat-specific physicochemical conditions, including variations in nutrient availability, potential energy sources, osmotic conditions, and viral predation stresses. Molecular dating suggests that Korarchaeota originated ~2.84 billion years (Ga) ago, with three subsequent diversification events occurring around 2.42, 1.52, and 1.29 Ga ago. These major diversifications coincide with key geological events such as the Great Oxidation Event and the breakup and formation of supercontinents.

However, because of the unique structure of sialic acid with the anomeric center flanked by methylene and carboxyl groups, efficient synthetic access to sialoglycans remains a difficult task, thus hindering in-depth biological studies. Here, we report one-pot α-sialylation protocol for efficient synthesis of various α-sialoglycans, using sialylortho-(1-phenylvinyl)benzoates (PVB) as donors. This α-sialylation method enjoys broad substrate scope and high yields. In particular, this α-sialylation protocol has been successfully applied in one-pot synthesis of several α-sialoglycans, including bioactive ganglioside Hp-s1 and STNantigen with reduced steps and improved efficiency. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations provide the mechanistic insights of much higher reactivity of sialyl PVB donors than the corresponding thiosialoside donors in the presence ofN-iodosuccinimide (NIS) and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH). The enhanced reactivity arises from favorable noncovalent interactions and effective stabilization of the carbocation intermediate by the two phenyl groups within the PVB moieties."

Generic synthetic methods for sulfinamides remain elusive because the preparation of sulfoxide precursors is notoriously difficult. Direct construction of S─N bonds represents a highly efficient economical method to access these sulfinamides. However, the most prevalent techniques for their synthesis are still the nonradical approaches of sulfoxide precursors with amines, where prepreparation of substrates, harsh reaction conditions, and restricted substrate ranges have intrinsically limited the synthetic scope. Herein, we leveraged a practical and streamlined electrocatalytic strategy to achieve sulfinamide synthesis, which involves the intermolecular oxidative cross-coupling of readily available arylthiols and aliphatic amines. Mechanistic investigations indicate that four successive oxidations at the anode play a crucial role in radical generation, S─N bond formation, and further oxidation of intermediates."

Its probe-integrated electrode array supports spatial-selective manipulation, while the adjustable electrode gaps enable manipulating multiscale targets. The independent programming of the electrical signals of each electrode further allows using multiple electric principles to achieve multiscale and spatiotemporal programmable control and in situ measurements, marking a transition from function-fixed single-object manipulation to function-on-demand single-object manipulation.

We demonstrate an alternative paradigm in dynamic DNA nanotechnology that programs the thermodynamic equilibrium state directly, with computation emerging from entropic driving forces. Like declarative programming in computer science, this approach emphasizes desired outcomes rather than specific steps, simplifying molecular programming and avoiding errors caused when thermodynamic forces work against programmed kinetics. We show broad applicability through three distinct applications: reversible signal propagation with fan-in and fan-out, algorithmic self-assembly performing Boolean logic, and synthesis of molecular chains (concatemers) of programmable length, illustrating how thermodynamic computation can enable practical molecular engineering tasks.

However, only a limited variety of third reaction components have been hitherto introduced because of the challenges in capturing transient C(sp3)-centered radical intermediates under acidic conditions, and structurally specific alkenes are usually required. Herein, we report a copper-catalyzed three-component aminothiolation reaction, enabling the first incorporation of S-based functionalities across simple alkenes to synthesize β-thio tertiary alkylamines. This protocol works well for both aryl and unactivated alkenes with a broad functional group compatibility and is applicable to ─SCF3, ─SCN, and ─SBz groups. Mechanistic investigations reveal a key bimolecular homolytic (SH2) substitution process that efficiently traps the nascent C(sp3)-centered radical intermediates in acidic media and facilitates the C─S bond formation with high regioselectivity and even primary enantiocontrol.

This platform reconstitutes native skin architecture to model pemphigus vulgaris, an autoantibody-driven blistering disorder. Tightly reassembled keratinocytes form cell-cell adhesions that replicate pathogenic antibody–induced disruption of the epidermal barrier, while embedded vasculature and fibroblasts shape dermal barriers that regulate molecular diffusion. We demonstrate that these tissue barriers define disease phenotypes and therapeutic responses by modulating antibody and drug penetration. As proof of concept, we quantitatively evaluate epidermal growth factor receptor–targeted inhibitors by measuring individual cell-cell junction integrity and applying machine learning–assisted image texture analysis. This organotypic skin model provides a physiomimetic testbed for precise investigation of autoimmune pathogenesis and high-throughput screening of targeted therapeutic agents."

This type of robust transport of polaritons (i.e., polariton canalization) holds promise for subwavelength control of energy flows. However, the lack of in situ dynamic tunability of canalized polaritons hinders such control because the canalization direction is fixed in the fabricated device. Here, we overcome this limitation by demonstrating programmable polariton canalization in a reconfigurable single-layer metasurface. By engineering the orientation of metasurface unit cells, the direction of canalized magnetic polaritons can be programmed along any in-plane direction (i.e., dynamic all-angle tunability). On-demand steering of canalized polaritons allows customized near-field patterns to be obtained at any desired location—a proof of concept for canalization-based information display applications. These findings offer opportunities to transcend conventional diffraction constraints for integrated photonic devices, thus opening the door for photonic applications where on-demand control is crucial."

This delay has been poorly understood and is usually attributed to sampling and long ghost lineages. We analyzed newly compiled databases of Paleozoic vertebrate occurrences, biogeography, and ecosystems, revealing that the Late Ordovician Mass Extinction (~445 to 443 million years ago) triggered parallel, endemic radiations of jawed and related jawless vertebrates (gnathostomes) in isolated refugia. Postextinction ecosystems hosted the first definitive appearances of most major vertebrate lineages of the Paleozoic “Age of Fishes” (and today), following the loss of ubiquitous stem-cyclostome conodonts, nascent faunas of other gnathostomes, and pelagic invertebrates. Turnover and recovery patterns matched those following climatically similar events like the end-Devonian mass extinction, including a postextinction “gap” with low biodiversity. The prolonged Silurian recovery, and the challenges of oceanic dispersal, likely further delayed the dominance of jawed gnathostomes for millions of years after the first fossil jaws."

By contrast, non-DBD domains enable targeting of repressed chromatin marked by H3K9me3 or H3K27me3.Fusions of different non-DBD segments of heterochromatin-targeting pioneer factors to the transcription factor SOX2 can expand binding of SOX2 target motifs within heterochromatin and improve cellular reprogramming.

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), UCE expression is often heterogeneously repressed, but its role in tumorigenesis is unclear. We show that, as in patients, UCE expression is markedly reduced in multiple HCC mouse models, including those driven by oncogenic c-MET/β-catenin, leading to impaired ammonia clearance, altered amino acid metabolism, and increased pyrimidine synthesis. In contrast, UCE expression is largely preserved in c-MET/sgAxin1 tumors, allowing assessment of the consequences of UCE loss. Silencing individual UCEs increases ammonia burden and accelerates HCC with reprogrammed amino acid and pyrimidine metabolism, supporting a causal role for defective ammonia detoxification in oncogenesis. Notably, dietary protein restriction lowers hepatic ammonia and slows tumor growth. These findings establish a mechanistic link between nitrogen overload and hepatocarcinogenesis and highlight protein restriction as a feasible therapeutic strategy for patients with impaired nitrogenous waste handling."

We established a novel, sensitive immunotoxicity evaluation system using impairment of macrophage anti-infection capacity as a physiologically relevant end point. A comprehensive evaluation of 29 DBPs spanning 10 structural classes revealed significant immunotoxicity differences. Critically, aliphatic DBPs exhibited substantially higher immunotoxicity than cyclic DBPs, contrasting sharply with macrophage cytotoxicity rankings, where cyclic DBPs were more potent. Quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) modeling identified distinct molecular determinants: cytotoxicity depended on the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy (ELUMO), hydrophobicity (log D7.4), and total valence connection index (TVCon), while immunotoxicity correlated with the molecular zero-point energy (ZPE) and molar surface area (SA), suggesting divergent mechanisms. Furthermore, we developed a method combining direct (nonconcentrated) exposure with serum-free cell culture to assess the immunotoxicity of real water samples and found that water samples chlorinated for 12 h exhibited peak immunotoxicity.

Straw is abundantly available in the UK and presents a viable option for large-scale biochar production. However, uncertainties regarding its feasibility remain, particularly concerning costs, spatial constraints, and facility construction. Here, we use a spatial model integrated with life cycle assessment and technoeconomic analysis to estimate the marginal cost curve for net carbon sequestration through straw-based biochar production in Great Britain (GB). Our findings reveal that straw-based biochar production in GB can achieve 0.6–1.9% of the UK’s 2050 carbon removal target at marginal costs below £75 per tCO2e. If higher-cost options are also included (i.e., without the £75 per tCO2e constraint), the total potential removal increases to 0.8–2.1%. The marginal costs are significantly influenced by the price and availability of feedstock, the value of byproducts, and the biochar yield. Our integrated spatial model helps identify optimal feedstock supply and production strategies, reducing costs and uncertainties in net carbon sequestration for biochar systems.

It also examined damage to female germline stem cells (FGSCs) cultured in vitro and exposed to 170, 1000, and 6000 ng/L dinotefuran. In mice, dinotefuran reduced the number of follicles at all stages. Furthermore, it reduced serum E2 and ovarian anti-Müllerian hormone levels and the expression of estrogen receptors (GPER1 and ERβ). Doses ≥ 0.1 mg/kg/day induced dose-dependent oxidative stress and increased PANoptosis (apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis) in the ovaries. This was accompanied by significantly elevated gene and protein levels of ZBP1- and RIPK1-PANoptosome components. Moreover, FGSCs in the ovarian cortex were significantly damaged, with decreased expression of their marker genes and proteins. In vitro exposure to dinotefuran at concentrations of 170–6000 ng/L induced similar changes in FGSCs, and procyanidin inhibited dinotefuran-induced formation of both PANoptosomes in FGSCs.

Although ENRO primarily undergoes dealkylation as its main biotransformation pathway, the effects of this process on plants remain insufficiently understood. In this study, an in vivo solid-phase microextraction (SPME) method was developed to monitor ENRO dealkylation and associated metabolomic changes in living plants at different exposure concentrations. The accumulation trends of ENRO and dealkylated product ciprofloxacin were influenced by exposure levels. Meanwhile, activation of different metabolic pathways helped plants survive acute high ENRO stress, promoting the key processes of enhanced energy production, structural maintenance, detoxification, antioxidant defense, and membrane repair and then regain balance during prolonged exposure. Additionally, there existed a threshold for self-repair and antioxidation in plants, which employed only mild adaptation and detoxification at low ENRO concentrations. These findings offered novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms involved in ENRO dealkylation. Based on these results, we assessed the implications of using reclaimed water and biosolids containing ENRO for agricultural irrigation and fertilization. This study advances in vivo SPME-based metabolomics and provides valuable insight into plant adaptation during ENRO dealkylation, contributing to the risk assessment of wastewater reuse in agriculture."

The results reveal several distinct dispersion characteristics, including stronger excitation of higher modes on horizontal components, opposite polarity of the first higher mode on the ZR‐RZ component, and a switching of the dominant Rayleigh mode between vertical and horizontal components at low frequencies. We also identify and confirm mode kissing between fundamental and first higher Rayleigh modes and guided P modes arising from normal mode and leaky mode coupling. These dispersion characteristics are primarily controlled by the shallow low‐velocity sediments, which govern frequency‐dependent mode excitation, polarity, and energy partitioning.

Here, authors propose a diffractive magic cube network to address this challenge. 
 Free-space wavefront manipulation devices have emerged as powerful platforms for advanced optical information systems. In response to the challenges posed by the exponential growth of optical information, optical multiplexing and dynamic reconfigurable devices are being actively explored to the enhance system capacity. Among them, coarse-grained mechanically reconfigurable mechanism offers a cost-effective and low-complexity approach for capacity enhancement. However, the channel numbers achieved in current studies are insufficient for practical applications because of inadequate mechanical transformations and suboptimal optimization models. In this article, a diffractive magic cube network (DMCN) is proposed to advance the multiplexing capacity of mechanically reconfigurable system. We utilized the diffractive deep neural network (D2NN) model to jointly optimize the subset of channels generated by the combination of three mechanical operations, permutation, translation, and rotation. The 144-channel holograms, 108-channel single/double focus, 60-channel single/multi-mode OAM beam generation were experimentally demonstrated using diffractive optical elements (DOEs). An equivalent connectivity law was formulated to improve model scalability. Our strategy not only provides a novel paradigm to improve system capacity to super-high level with low crosstalk, but also paves the way for new advancements in optical storage, computing, communication, and photolithography.

The authors demonstrate here the importance of the transcription factor HHEX in maintaining glucocorticoid levels and protecting lipid droplets from androgen-induced lipid depletion. 
 Glucocorticoid-producing cells of the adrenal cortex (i.e. zona fasciculata, zF) constitute the critical effectors of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, mediating the mammalian stress response. With glucocorticoids being essential for life, zF dysfunction perturbs multiple organs that participate in optimizing cardiometabolic fitness. The zF forms a dynamic and heterogenous cell population endowed with the capacity to remodel through the engagement of both proliferative and differentiation programs that enable the adrenal to adapt and respond to diverse stressors. However, the mechanisms that sustain such differential responsiveness remain poorly understood. In this study, we resolve the transcriptome of the steroidogenic lineage by scRNA-seq using Sf1-Crehigh; RosamT/mG reporter mice. We identify HHEX, a homeodomain protein, as the most enriched transcription factor in glucocorticoid-producing cells. We utilize genetic mouse models to demonstrate that Hhex deletion causes glucocorticoid deficiency in male animals. Molecularly, we demonstrate that HHEX is an androgen receptor (AR) target gene, shaping the sexual dimorphism of the adrenal gland by repressing the female transcriptional program at puberty, while also maintaining zF cholesterol ester content by protecting lipid droplets from androgen-induced-lipophagy. Moreover, our study reveals that, in both sexes, HHEX is crucial for maintaining the identity of the innermost adrenocortical cell subpopulation. Specifically, loss of HHEX impairs the expression of Abcb1b (P-glycoprotein/MDR1), an efflux pump regulating steroid export and cellular levels of xenobiotics. Together, these data demonstrate that HHEX serves as a multi-functional regulator of post-natal adrenal maturation that is potentiated by androgens.

This achieved high spin injection efficiency in both graphene and MoS2, enabling future large-scale spintronic devices. 
 Efficient and reliable spin injection at room temperature with scalability is crucial for spintronic applications but remains challenging. Direct ferromagnetic metal deposition on two-dimensional materials often leads to inefficient transparent contacts. Here, we introduce an indium buffer layer between ferromagnetic cobalt (Co) and graphene to establish high-efficiency van der Waals (vdW) tunnel contacts. This buffer layer facilitates a physisorption interface between Co and graphene with a well-defined vdW gap, which functions as an effective spin tunnel barrier. Through buffer layer thickness optimization, we achieved a room-temperature spin injection efficiency of approximately 25% in graphene, comparable to the best single-crystalline oxide-tunnel-barrier-based devices, alongside explicit nonlocal spin valve signals and Hanle spin precession. We further demonstrate the scalability of our approach through uniform performance across multi-channel graphene spin valves and its versatility by achieving efficient spin injection in semiconducting MoS2 with an average efficiency of about 19.7%. Our strategy offers a simple, cost-efficient, and industry-compatible method for future large-scale and efficient spintronic applications.

 Instabilities can generate fast and amplified motion in mechanical systems. Here, we present an elasto-magnetic instability that combines magnetic attraction and elastic tension to create bistable dynamics. To demonstrate this, we built a coupled elasto-magnetic vibration system that produces amplified motion and greater displacement and force than a control system across a wide frequency range. We also establish design principles that can be applied to different configurations by studying the balance between magnetic and elastic forces. The system also shows inertial hysteresis, which enables mechanical memory by storing external inputs in volatile and non-volatile modes with adjustable thresholds. This dual function of amplification and memory shows how instabilities can be potentially used for programmable and adaptive soft actuation.

The thickness of typical receiver elastomers can be reduced to 6.7 μm for large-scale electronic skins. 
 Electronic skin (E-skin) with multifunctionality and large-scale features is highly desirable for human-machine interactions and wearable health monitoring. Laser-induced graphene (LIG) affords such devices with tailorable physical and chemical properties. However, relatively high Young’s modulus of precursors that derive LIG hinders its application scenarios. Here, we report a universal cryogenic transfer approach for LIG via regulating the glass transition temperature or freezing point of the transfer media. The thermal expansion-induced interlocking, ease of interfacial separation and strong electrostatic interactions within the multiple graphene layers explain the transfer mechanisms. This contributes to the high-quality transfer of LIG onto elastomers, hydrogels and fabrics infused with various fluids. The thickness of typical elastomer can be down to 6.7 μm with its Young’s modulus ranging from 4.5 MPa to 3.9 kPa. Using this transfer technique, we create large-scale and double-layer E-skins integrated on a humanoid robot face, achieving emotional interactions with humans. The proposed strategy for merging LIG with broad categories of media affords on-demand designs of wearable and implantable electronics.

This study identifies JUL1 as a non–cell-autonomous regulator that connects vascular development with the refinement of leaf polarity. 
 The interplay between vascular development and leaf development is central to the evolutionary success of vascular plants, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we identify the RNA-binding protein JULGI1 (JUL1) as a key integrator of vascular and leaf development in Arabidopsis. JUL1 is transcribed in leaf veins, while the protein distributes throughout the leaf, where it binds G-rich regions of pri-MIR165a transcripts on the abaxial side. This interaction disrupts hairpin formation and inhibits DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1)-mediated processing, reducing miR165/166 levels. Consequently, transcript levels of their targets, the Class III homeodomain leucine zipper (HD-ZIP III), increase, reinforcing adaxial-abaxial polarity. Our findings reveal a non-cell-autonomous mechanism by which vascular-derived JUL1 modulates miRNA biogenesis to coordinate leaf patterning with vascular development. Leaf and vein development must be precisely coordinated, yet the molecular signals linking these processes have remained unclear.

 Traditional natural disaster response involves significant coordinated teamwork, where speed and efficiency are key. Nonetheless, human limitations can delay critical actions and inadvertently increase human and economic losses. Agentic Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) offer an avenue to address this challenge, with the potential for substantial socio-economic impact, particularly by improving resilience and resource access in underdeveloped regions. We introduce DisasTeller, a multi-LVLM-powered framework designed to automate tasks in post-disaster management, including on-site assessment, emergency alerts, resource allocation, and recovery planning. By coordinating four specialised LVLM agents with GPT-4 as the core, DisasTeller can accelerate disaster response activities, reducing human execution time and structuring information flow. Our evaluation shows both benefits and challenges: while DisasTeller streamlines coordination and report generation, errors in early-stage assessments may propagate downstream, highlighting the need for human validation and improved LVLM accuracy. This framework acts as a complementary support system to expert teams, bridging the gap between traditional response methods and emerging LVLM-driven efficiency, while highlighting the importance of continued refinement and collaboration for safe, trustworthy deployment.

Solomon;Arman Aghahosseini;Christian Breyer,Uneven Distribution of Natural Energy Resources Impacts on Systemwide Energy Return on Investment,"Regional disparities in natural energy resources may impede the acceleration of energy transitions in regional power systems, as the shift to net‐zero power systems requires significant energy inputs. Net energy, defined as the surplus remaining after accounting for energy inputs, serves as a key metric of system performance. This study examines the net energy performance of nine regions across the nine decarbonization scenarios to 2050 using the systemwide energy return on investment (EROI) framework. This framework adopts a holistic approach to assess primary energy quality at the electricity level, using the cumulative energy demand indicator derived from life cycle assessment analysis, and integrating EROI calculations with outputs from the LUT Energy System Transition Model. None of the regional EROIs fall below 10, often regarded as a global threshold for viability, although accounting for social factors and regional variations, the minimum EROI necessary to sustain societal functions may differ substantially. Thus, the regional energy transition (ET) is techno‐economically feasible without incurring a resource curse arising from further energy needs. Low‐cost renewable energy (RE) technologies dominate the energy mix, while other extractable regional natural energy resources have a minimal impact on EROI trends. In highly variable RE penetrations mainly driven by solar photovoltaics and wind power, the greater requirement for enabling technologies entails a decline in regional EROIs. In essence, achieving a net‐zero and cost‐effective ET requires prioritizing low‐cost RE technologies, indirectly mitigating the risk of a renewable resource curse and furnishing policymakers with a compelling rationale for their strategic importance."

S. van Bemmel,High‐Resolution Modeling of Future Urban Area and Population Exposure to Floods and Landslides,"Future population growth is expected to concentrate in urban agglomerations that overlap with various natural hazard zones. However, quantifying the resulting risks remains challenging, as hazard areas tend to be bounded locally while population forecasts are produced at much coarser scales. Addressing this gap, the high‐resolution 2UP model disaggregates national‐level, scenario‐based population projections to a 30 arc‐seconds grid, simultaneously simulating urban expansion and the distribution of urban and rural populations through 2100. By overlaying these projections with comparably detailed fluvial flood and landslide hazard data, this study demonstrates that, at a global scale, rapid urbanization will disproportionately increase population growth in hazard‐prone zones compared to safer areas. This trend is particularly pronounced in sub‐Saharan Africa and South Asia, where both the extent of exposed urban land and the magnitude of exposed populations are projected to rise sharply. In contrast, slower growth in North America and Europe leads to more moderate increases in hazard exposure, with smaller differences between hazardous and non‐hazardous sites. Notably, while urban areas in many countries continue expanding into high‐risk regions, the fraction of the total population exposed to these hazards may stabilize or even decline after 2050. The 2UP model's fine‐grained outputs are especially valuable in regions with fragmented urban landscapes, large rural populations, and rapid demographic shifts, providing decision‐makers and researchers with critical insights for integrated risk management and sustainable development planning."

Direct measurements of dissolved oxygen are sparse, and interpolation methods are needed to study the variability and changes in oxygen content. In this work, we used machine learning to improve estimates of oxygen levels across the global ocean. Our approach produces a new gridded product that captures detailed changes in oxygen over time and space. 
 Ocean deoxygenation, driven by climate change, poses significant challenges to marine ecosystems and can profoundly alter nutrient and carbon cycling. Quantifying the rate and regional patterns of deoxygenation relies on spatio-temporal interpolation tools to fill gaps in observational coverage of dissolved oxygen. However, this task is challenging due to the sparsity of observations, and classical interpolation methods often lead to high uncertainty and biases, typically underestimating long-term deoxygenation trends. In this work, we develop a novel gridded dissolved oxygen product by integrating direct oxygen observations with machine-learning-based emulated oxygen estimates derived from temperature and salinity profiles. The gridded product is then generated through optimal interpolation of both the observed and emulated data. The resulting product (Ouala et al., 2025;  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15478088) shows strong agreement with baseline climatology and captures well-known patterns of seasonal variability and long-term deoxygenation trends. It also outperforms current state-of-the-art products by more accurately capturing dissolved oxygen variability at synoptic and decadal scales, and by reducing uncertainty around long-term changes. This study highlights the potential of combining machine learning with classical interpolation methods to generate improved gridded biogeochemical products, enhancing our ability to study and understand ocean biogeochemical processes and their variability under a changing climate."

It covers 50 African countries and regions. it aims to support the UN's sustainable development goal 9.1. With an accuracy rate of 77%–96%, it correlates well with existing data. It can be used to guide infrastructure upgrades, assess sustainable development goal, and analyze its impacts on traffic safety, energy consumption, ecological environment, and economic development. 
 Road surface types not only influence the accessibility of road networks and socio-economic development but also serve as a critical data source for evaluating the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 9.1. Existing research indicates that Africa generally has a low road paved rate, which limits local socio-economic development. Although the International Road Federation (IRF) provides statistical data on paved road length and road paved rates for certain African countries, this data neither covers all African countries nor specifies the surface type of individual roads, making it challenging to support decision-making for improving Africa's road infrastructure. To address this gap, this study developed the first dataset for 50 African countries and regions, incorporating the surface type of every road. This was achieved using multi-source geospatial data and a tabular deep learning model. The core methodology involved designing 16 proxy indicators across three dimensions – derived from five open geospatial datasets (OpenStreetMap road data, GDP data, population distribution data, building height data, and land cover data) – to infer road surface types across Africa. Key findings include: the accuracy of the African road surface type dataset ranges from 77 % to 96 %, with F1 scores between 0.76 and 0.96. Total road length, paved road length, and road paved rates calculated from this dataset show high correlation (correlation coefficients: 0.69–0.94) with corresponding IRF statistics. Notably, the road paved rate also exhibits strong correlation with GNI per capita and the Human Development Index (HDI) (correlation coefficients: 0.80–0.83), validating the reliability of the dataset. Spatial analysis of African road paved rates at national, provincial, and county scales revealed an average paved rate of only 17.4 % across the 50 countries and regions. A distinct pattern emerged, with “higher paved rates in the north and south and lower rates in the central region”; the average paved rate north of the Sahara is approximately three times that of Sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa). The African road surface type dataset developed in this study (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.29424107, Liu and Zhou, 2025) not only provides data support for enhancing road infrastructure and evaluating progress toward SDG 9.1 in Africa but may also facilitate research on how road surface types impact road safety, energy consumption, ecological environments, and socio-economic development."

By integrating input-output analysis with health impact source attribution, we examine how interprovincial trade redistributes CO2 emissions and PM2.5-related mortality across China’s supply chains. We find that demand from economically advanced provinces induces two distinct burden-shifting patterns between carbon emissions and health burdens. Carbon emissions are outsourced to sparsely populated northwestern regions through power generation, while health burdens concentrate in the densely populated industrial manufacturing belt of central and northern China. Despite production-side divergences, we identify a notable alignment at the final production level, offering opportunities to narrow the energy intensity gap through supply chain coordination. We simulate three convergence scenarios in which upstream producers in the nonmetal, metal, and power sectors adopt energy intensities of their downstream partners. These include full convergence (100% adoption) and two partial convergence scenarios (75% and 50% adoption), with the latter constrained by national benchmark performance. Full convergence reduces trade-related CO2 emissions by 17% (491 Mt) and averts 19% of associated mortality (3.8 × 104 deaths). Partial convergence scenarios still deliver meaningful co-benefits. This demonstrates that supply chain coordination offers pathways to reconciling production-side disparities and more balanced climate–health co-benefits in China."

Using Pinqing Lagoon (South China Sea) as a model system, we investigate how this feedback changes under eutrophication, whether sediments become enhanced nutrient sinks (buffering eutrophication) or disproportionate nutrient recyclers (exacerbating eutrophication) under increasing organic matter loading. We analyze sediments across a water-column productivity gradient and quantify sediment-water fluxes. Results show that the eutrophication-impacted nearshore exhibits a 30% sedimentation increase over two decades, with chlorophyll-a levels and sediment organic carbon flux 3 times higher than the less-disturbed offshore area. This causes a >50% shallower oxygen penetration (1.1 mm nearshore vs 2.4 mm offshore), impeding ammonium oxidation and likely promoting dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium. The thin oxic layer enhances fresh organic matter burial into anoxic zones, stimulating iron oxide reactivity and iron/sulfate reduction. These mechanisms amplify ammonium, phosphate, and dissolved Fe fluxes by 20-, 30-, and 100-fold, respectively, disproportionate to the 2–3 times increase in organic matter remineralization. This superlinear feedback suggests that eutrophic coastal systems may reach critical thresholds, making them progressively harder to manage. The magnified nutrient release may self-sustain eutrophication, with important implications for restoration timelines and management strategies."

This study reveals the key genes for salinity adaptation in Chlorella sp. MEM25, an early saltwater alga. 
 Deciphering adaptation to habitat shifts across the salinity boundary necessitates investigation of “lost” and “acquired” saline genes. By assembling a telomere-to-telomere genome, we propose that the euryhaline Chlorophyta Chlorella sp. MEM25 represents an early-diverging saltwater species that has evolved numerous genes essential for saltwater-freshwater transitions. By comparison with Viridiplantae genomes, we identify ancestral genes and lineage-specific genes related to salinity adaptation. Loss-of-function mutants of the proposed salt-sensitive genes in algae and plants exhibit increased salt resistance, highlighting the potential of the MEM25 genome as a breeding resource. Notably, the gene RMI1 plays an important role in salinity tolerance across species, from microalgae to higher plants.

 Bone aging compromises skeletal integrity and increases vulnerability to osteoporosis and other age-related disorders, underscoring the need for new therapeutic strategies. Although pharmacological and genetic approaches have been widely explored, how cellular mechanical remodeling contributes to bone aging remains unclear. Here, we find that senescent bone marrow stem cells show markedly reduced intracellular force and impaired mechanical behavior. Moderate mechanical stimulation in cell culture and in mice restores cellular force, increases chromatin accessibility at the FOXO1 locus, activates its expression, and reverses cellular senescence and bone aging. These mechanical interventions also improve physical performance in aged female mice and show a tendency to reduce systemic inflammation, whereas excessive force induces chromatin overextension and DNA damage, indicating the necessity of precise force control. In this work, we show that optimized mechanical stimulation provides a simple and effective strategy to counteract age-related bone deterioration and systemic inflammation, offering potential for clinical translation. Senescent bone marrow stem cells were revealed to exhibit reduced intracellular force, and optimized mechanical stimulation restores this force, enhances FOXO1 chromatin accessibility, and reverses cellular senescence and bone aging."

 Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disease caused by expanded GGC repeats in the 5’ untranslated region of the human-specific NOTCH2NLC gene. The high sequence similarity between NOTCH2NLC and its paralogs poses a significant challenge for precise gene editing. Here, we develop a CRISPR/spCas9-based gene-editing strategy that precisely excises the expanded GGC repeats in NOTCH2NLC without detectable off-target effects on the highly homologous NOTCH2/NOTCH2NL family genes (<2% sequence divergence at this locus). The efficacy, specificity and safety of this approach are rigorously validated across multiple experimental models, including human cell lines, NIID iPSCs, and our previously established transgenic NIID mouse model. Our results demonstrate that precise excision of the expanded GGC repeats effectively alleviates NIID-related neuropathological, molecular and behavioral abnormalities. This study establishes the proof of concept for genome editing as a therapeutic strategy for NIID and other related repeat expansion disorders.

Here, the authors address this issue by designing a smart nano reporter that travels with groundwater and releases signals upon contact with even trace-level contamination, allowing precise mapping of the residual organic contaminants. 
 Groundwater remediation is vital for meeting the ever-growing demand for clean water. However, accurately delineating subsurface contamination by free-phase organic contaminants (FPOCs) remains a major remediation hurdle. Here, we design a nano-structured reporter featuring a hydrophobic contaminant probe embedded within the framework of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-grafted carboxylated carbon black, for ultrahigh-sensitivity FPOC detection. When injected into the subsurface, the reporter moves with groundwater as the PVA chains prevent nanoparticle aggregation and deposition. The presence of even FPOC traces (as thin films or small droplets) triggers the release of probe molecules, enabled by the super-responsive coiling of PVA chains at organic–water interfaces. Contaminant mass is directly proportional to the amount of probe partitioning into the FPOCs, which can be accurately determined by fitting transport data with a two-site transport model. We offer proof-of-concept that this approach overcomes hydrogeological and FPOC distribution complexities that hinder conventional characterization of contaminant source zones.

 Topological soft matter systems rely on controllable defect structures to encode functionality, yet robust, large-scale, and reconfigurable manipulation strategies remain elusive. Here we present a versatile acoustic platform for dynamic control of liquid crystal defect arrays via engineered topological wavefields. By coherently superimposing surface acoustic waves, we generate spatially structured potential landscapes and acoustic streaming vortices that interact with the molecular orientation field of liquid crystals, enabling dynamic reconfiguration of topological defects. Tuning the acoustic parameter space allows precise modulation of defect density, symmetry, morphology, and spatial positioning. A theoretical framework based on Ginzburg-Landau modeling and free energy minimization captures the formation of vortex-induced instabilities and associated topological textures. The platform operates across diverse liquid crystal compositions, demonstrating material generality. This acoustically driven approach offers a scalable strategy for programmable topological structure in soft matter, with potential applications in reconfigurable photonic devices and active material systems.

 Dielectric ceramic capacitors with ultrahigh power density have become indispensable in modern power electronics, yet the persistent challenge of achieving superior energy density with high energy efficiency remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications. Herein, we propose an effective non-polar nanocluster confinement strategy through phase-field simulation-guided design of high-entropy (Bi0.2Na0.2Ba0.2Sr0.2Ca0.2)(Ti1-xSnx)O3 lead-free relaxor ferroelectrics. The incorporation of Sn4+ ions with low ionic polarizability leads to the formation of localized non-ferroelectric perovskite units, which constitute robust non-polar nanoclusters, being further stabilized and rendered immobile against electric fields by the substantial local random fields inherent to the high-entropy configuration. Consequently, these engineered non-polar nanoclusters serve as effective pinning centers to impede the merging and growth of polar nanodomains under electric fields, thereby reconciling the inherent conflict between polarization enhancement and hysteresis reduction. The optimized composition (x = 0.06) exhibits a high recoverable energy density of ~18.5 J·cm-3 together with an ultrahigh energy efficiency of ~92.4% in multilayer ceramic capacitors, representing a competitive combination among lead-free counterparts. This approach not only establishes a viable paradigm for next-generation energy storage dielectrics but also provides fundamental insights for designing functional materials with tailored electrical properties.

Here, authors show that the interconnected wirings between medial prefrontal cortex and claustrum contribute to the encoding and retrieval of methamphetamine reward memory in a pathway-specific manner. 
 Bidirectional communication between medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and claustrum (CL) plays a critical role in drug reward memory, particularly for conditioned drug-associated cues. However, their precise circuitry remains unclear. Here, using viral tracing, chemo-&opto-genetics and patch-clamp, alongside methamphetamine (METH) conditioned place preference (CPP) model, we dissected the connectivity pattern between mPFC and CL in male mice. Two relatively independent pathways of top-down mPFC-CL and bottom-up CL-mPFC were identified, each comprising both direct excitatory and indirect inhibitory projections. The mPFC-CL pathway predominantly mediates inter-hemispheric communication, while the CL-mPFC pathway mainly supports intra-hemispheric connections. Under physiological conditions, strong feedforward inhibition (FFI) via local GABAergic interneurons suppresses excitatory transmission between mPFC and CL. During METH CPP, FFI is weakened, resulting in enhanced excitatory signaling. The mPFC-CL pathway was engaged during reward memory encoding, whereas the CL-mPFC pathway mediated memory retrieval. These findings suggest potential therapeutic interventions for METH reward memory. The precise brain circuits underlying drug reward memory remain unclear.

 Humans show marked diversity in cultural values, beliefs, and preferences. Here, we analyze survey responses from 640,110 individuals in 117 countries (representing 89% of the World’s population), and 2,333 sub-national districts, surveyed in the World Values Survey and the European Values Study. Across multiple sets of comparable cultural traits, we find that religion consistently emerges as the cultural trait that exhibits the largest cross-country divergence (measured by the Cultural Fixation Index or simple variances). For example, personal emphasis on religion varies 5-10 times more across countries than emphasis on family, politics, or work effort, and religion is the most divergent quality valued for raising children. Likewise, differences in religious group membership across countries exceed those in other voluntary affiliations. These cross-country differences in religiosity stem partly from differences between religious traditions, but mostly from individual differences in religious involvement intensity. Our findings underscore the importance of religion in shaping cultural differences across societies. Societies differ widely in cultural values across the world.

 Inferences of ice-sheet change through geological time rely on environmental proxies, yet these inferences assume an unchanging ice-sheet response to climate. Here, using 500-kyr long ice-sheet simulations, we show that the directionality of ice sheet change depends on the background state of the climate. Under cold atmospheric conditions with high-amplitude glacial–interglacial changes in sub-shelf melt, ice sheets advance during cold phases and retreat as the climate warms. However, under warmer air temperatures with reduced glacial–interglacial ice-shelf melt variability, ice sheets advance during warm phases and retreat during colder periods. Forced with a linearly changing climate, the ice sheet switches from one mode to the other, and a resonant response arises at half the forcing frequency. These findings imply that climate–ice sheet phasing is not constant over time, and suggest that ice sheet behaviour under a future, warmer, climate may be substantially different from today. Gradual cooling or warming of the atmosphere, combined with strong ocean-driven basal melt, could have led to major changes in the periodicity, phasing, and asymmetry of past ice sheet growth and decay, according to an ensemble of 500-kyr long ice sheet simulations."

Our calculations suggest that a critically pressurised reservoir containing potentially eruptible magma is present today at ~ 4 km depth. However, a major impediment to eruption is the reservoir volume, which would need 2-3 decades to grow to the size of the one that fed the last eruption of Campi Flegrei in 1538.

 East Antarctic coastal polynyas—semi-permanent areas of ice-free ocean—are vital for sea ice production, Antarctic Bottom Water formation, and global heat redistribution. The Dibble Polynya has pronounced sea-ice production, yet the shelf water properties there and its offshore influence have been unclear. Here we show Dense Shelf Water outflow from the polynya that ventilates a lighter variety of local bottom water. Hydrographic records suggest Dense Shelf Water formation has persisted for 50 years, consistent with satellite-derived sea-ice production since the 1990s. Since the 2010s, the downstream cross-slope salinity gradient within bottom water has weakened and the Antarctic Slope Front has been modified, following a sharp decline in sea-ice production in the neighbouring Mertz Polynya after 2010 icescape changes. We infer that reduced denser Antarctic Bottom Water formation upstream weakens the slope current barrier, promoting outflow of not-so-dense shelf water from the Dibble Polynya that efficiently ventilates the abyssal basin.

This study investigates the variability in operations across the global BF fleet and its impact on CO2 emissions. Using plant-level data from 2011 to 2021, we find that variation in the composition of inputs results in emissions ranging from 1.20 to 2.08 tons of CO2 per ton of hot metal (tCO2 tHM−1) globally, driven by differences in fuel and reductant consumption. Our estimates suggest global emissions could have been lower by 2.8%—and up to 9.6%—if each furnace operated at its historical or national minimum CO2 emissions intensity. We use furnace-level data to find even greater variation within and across individual furnaces at the national level, estimating potential for CO2 emissions reductions of 5.7%–15.5% in the United States. These findings suggest substantial latitude to incentivize plants to reduce CO2 emissions without new capital investment, by up to an estimated 1.35 billion tons of CO2 cumulatively across the global BF fleet from 2011–2021.

Despite abundant water sources, Nepal faces persistent water security challenges driven by extreme seasonality, rising temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns, and rapid land-use change. In this review, we synthesize current evidence on anthropogenic drivers of hydrological change in Nepal and draw lessons relevant to other data-sparse, high-mountain and monsoon-influenced regions. We find that warming-induced glacial retreat, altered snowmelt timing, and changing monsoon dynamics are intensifying wet-season flood risks while heightening dry-season water scarcity, patterns increasingly observed across the Himalaya, Andes, and other mountain systems. Human activities, including urban expansion, agricultural intensification, hydropower, and extraction of sediments from rivers, further modify river flows, reduce groundwater recharge, and increase vulnerability to extremes. Yet major uncertainties persist, especially concerning high-elevation hydrology, permafrost dynamics, sediment extraction, and the cumulative impacts of expanding infrastructure. Nepal’s pronounced topographic and climatic gradients limit broad generalizations, underscoring the need for region-specific hydrological monitoring and modeling. These challenges mirror global limitations in mountain hydrology, where sparse observations and rapidly changing conditions constrain predictive capacity. By identifying key knowledge gaps and highlighting cascading impacts on agriculture, hydropower, domestic water supply, and aquatic ecosystems, this review emphasizes the urgency of strengthening monitoring networks and integrating uncertainty into water management and climate adaptation strategies. Nepal’s experience offers broader insights for countries facing similar pressures at the intersection of climate change, development, and fragile mountain water systems."

Simultaneously, several other jurisdictions across the Global North are at various stages of implementing their own CBAs. With CBAs transitioning toward real implementation, it is vital to understand their implications for potentially vulnerable trading partners. To this end, we review the current literature on the economic and geopolitical impacts of the EU CBA mechanism (CBAM) on the Global South. Through taking stock of peer reviewed and grey literature, we conclude that the EU CBAM will lead to trade disruptions in the Global South, with some Global South countries particularly vulnerable to potential welfare losses as a result of these disruptions. The likely decrease in trade between the EU and parts of the Global South, and the associated economic impact, may in turn have wider implications for the international climate and trade regimes. Although the EU CBAM regulation does not exempt the world’s poorest states, the current upheaval in global trade presents an opportunity for EU policymakers and others considering CBAs to revisit exemption policies or explore alternatives for vulnerable trading partners.

 From the perspective of the world, the basic mapping and investigation of the loess sinkhole is far less extensive and in-depth than that of the karst sinkhole survey. To some extent, this hinders people’s understanding of the morphological characteristics, development rules, and formation mechanisms of the loess sinkholes.

On this basis, we completed the spatial mapping of loess sinkholes, analysis of distribution patterns, morphological analysis, size-frequency analysis, fitting analysis of different parameters, estimation of subsurface soil erosion, in-depth investigation of typical sinkholes, and quantification of the contributions of different factors to sinkhole development. These efforts provide rich information for a deeper understanding of the morphological characteristics and causes of loess sinkholes and offer data support for comparative studies with sinkholes in other regions. More critically, we preliminarily assessed that the subsurface soil erosion triggered by sinkholes in the study area amounts to as high as 345,000 metric tons. This finding makes it increasingly clear that loess sinkholes are not only a geological disaster process but also a serious soil loss process, highlighting their undeniable significance in regional soil erosion studies and laying a solid foundation for subsequent research and disaster prevention efforts. Moreover, we believe that the integration of airborne laser scanning and handheld laser scanning may represent a new trend in the detailed investigation of sinkholes in the future. The dataset is available from Zenodo platform (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14000267)."

Harrington,"Earthquake Catalog and Continuous Waveforms from a Two-Week Distributed Acoustic Sensing experiment on Kefalonia Island, Greece","This study uses two weeks of new distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) data with permanent seismic stations to construct a detailed catalog of small earthquakes around Kefalonia Island (Greece). The analysis revealed thousands of tiny events, many clustered offshore northwest of Kefalonia. The publicly available dataset, including the catalog and continuous DAS waveforms, supports testing of new DAS methods and analysis of complex seismic sequences. 
 This work presents a high-resolution earthquake catalog for the Kefalonia region, Greece, built from the analysis of Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) data recorded on a telecommunications cable between 1 August 2024, 23:00 and 15 August 2024, 23:00, together with open-access seismic station recordings. The DAS data consist of continuous strain recordings on a 15 km-long telecommunication optical fiber connecting northern Kefalonia and Ithaki. We use a semblance-based detector on the DAS waveforms to identify 5,734 earthquakes within ~ 50 km of the fiber origin. We jointly locate 284 high-SNR events with DAS and seismic stations and calculate their local magnitudes from seismic records. We then apply waveform cross-correlation to match unlocated detections with the most similar template events and estimate relative magnitudes from amplitude ratios to enhance the constructed catalog. Enhancement adds 2,496 earthquakes, resulting in 2,780 events with assigned locations and magnitudes. Most events (2,718) cluster within a ~ 5 km radius offshore northwest of Kefalonia, where seismicity rates reach >100 events per hour. Our dataset provides a detailed spatio-temporal view of seismicity in a region with limited station coverage and demonstrates the value of integrating DAS with conventional seismic networks to monitor intense earthquake sequences. The combination of high seismicity and open-access data from the Hellenic Unified Seismic Network makes this DAS dataset particularly valuable for the seismological community. We provide a 2-week-long catalog, the full detection list (local and distant events and false detections), and two weeks of continuous DAS recordings. The aim is to provide a resource for researchers to test, develop, and benchmark DAS processing algorithms on tectonic earthquakes and to investigate the physical processes that drive complex seismic sequences."

In this study, the anaerobic degradation of carbon tetrachloride (CT), chloroform (CF), trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA) and TCE was assessed using S-nZVI at seven S loadings ([S/Fe] = 0.01–0.303). S-nZVI0.01 yielded the highest degradation rate constants for CT, 1,1,1-TCA, and CF, which were 1.77–10.9 times higher than those of nZVI and other S-nZVI. In contrast, S-nZVI0.075 yielded the highest rate constant for TCE. S-nZVI0.01 provides the most rapid electron release, and because CT, 1,1,1-TCA, and CF have higher electron affinity than water, their degradation is the quickest at this [S/Fe]. TCE degradation was faster only at higher [S/Fe], where S-nZVI reactivity to water was diminished and S-nZVI0.075 provided a 20-fold enhancement in electron selectivity to TCE over H2O. Although TCE was completely dechlorinated, the other CHCs were only partially dechlorinated. The degradation products dichloromethane and 1,1-dichloroethane were dechlorinated in the presence of their parent CHCs and at specific [S/Fe], although they were not dechlorinated as sole compounds. The results demonstrate that dechlorination rates and extents of CHCs can be optimized by tuning the sulfidation dose."

Here, we show using the global change analysis model (GCAM) integrated assessment model augmented with a pyrolysis module (GCAM-pyrolysis) that biochar production from global livestock manure may intensify agricultural systems through a 10% (median, 3–27% CE) increase in crop yields. GCAM-pyrolysis estimates that in 2050 widespread pyrolysis of livestock manures will cause an expansion of 415,000 km2 of cropland for food production (median, 376,000–473,000 km2 CE) compared to the reference scenario, at the expense of forests, pastures, and crops purposely grown to produce bioenergy (corn, sugar, palm fruit, oil crops), to produce an additional 5.1 Pcal (median, 3.2–6.7 Pcal CE) of food. Biochar presents significant opportunities in allowing productive land use change and increased crop production while increasing carbon dioxide removal and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

This study developed a cost-effective conductive dynamic membrane separator (CDMS) with carbon felt, stainless-steel mesh, and fiberglass cloth as a bifunctional separator–biocathode, enhancing MFC’s performance through increased electrode surface area and optimized hydrodynamics for continuous-flow treatment. Integrating CDMS as a biocathode significantly boosted power output, achieving 24.5 ± 1.5 W/m3 volumetric and 2.5 ± 0.2 W/m2 areal power densities at the steady stage, with advantages persisting despite degradation due to cathode performance being the principal determinant of MFC functionality. Comparative analysis indicated that both CDMS and carbon brush cathodes played indispensable roles in sustaining dual-cathode MFC high-performance and stability. The bifunctional CDMS in dual-cathode MFC established a self-reinforcing cycle of substrate limitation, oxygen allocation, and electron transfer optimization, fundamentally addressing the stability-performance trade-off in the MFC system. Material–energy balance analysis revealed that the dual-cathode MFC system achieved net positive energy production (+3.12 Wh/m3) from artificial wastewater with much lower capital costs than traditional configurations, advancing scalable MFC design for energy-positive wastewater treatment and practical applications."

 Modern computing powers applications from data analysis to artificial intelligence but now faces limitations. The slowdown of device scaling and the bottleneck between memory and processors motivate architectures that unify computation and data storage. Convolution is a core operation in learning, vision, and signal processing, yet its conventional implementation incurs high energy, high latency, and limited scalability. Magnetic systems that host spin textures, such as domain walls, offer dynamic behaviors that enable computation beyond traditional logic. Here we introduce a compute-in-memory platform that performs convolution by sequentially shifting magnetic domains and sensing the resulting signals. Information is written directly into domain patterns, processed through controlled motion, and read electrically, forming a nonvolatile structure suited for convolution tasks. This approach supports applications including Fourier analysis, neural networks, and image processing, achieving 103 to 105 improvements in area, energy, and throughput over existing technologies, marking a concrete advance in spintronic computing.

Here, the authors show that IL-36 agonists are systemic inflammatory factors released from aged skin to promote senescence in joint cells and aggravate OA progression. 
 Age-related inflammation plays a pivotal role in osteoarthritis (OA) pathogenesis, but the mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we identify decreased IL-36 receptor antagonists (IL-36Ra) in epidermal keratinocytes from a premature-aged skin mice model, aged mice and patients. Decreased IL-36Ra leads to increased secretion of IL-36 agonists to serum and joints, which activates proinflammatory signaling and promotes senescence in chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts, thereby aggravates OA progression. Deletion of IL-36Ra in keratinocytes exacerbates, whereas intra-articular inhibition of IL-36R signaling effectively attenuates OA progression in male mice. Moreover, we also generate microneedles loaded with mouse recombinant IL-36Ra protein or spesolimab, insert them directly into skin to sustainably inhibit IL-36R signaling, which both clearly attenuate OA progression in male mice. Overall, our results reveal that IL-36 agonists are age-related systemic inflammatory factors released from skin to joints and contribute to OA development, and targeting IL-36R signaling in aged skin with microneedles represents a promising disease-modifying approach.

Here, the authors show that feedback shifts risk-taking by changing attitudes rather than through learning. 
 Decision-making under risk is often studied with fully described lotteries, where normative theory predicts that post-choice outcome disclosure (feedback) should not influence preferences. However, previous empirical work has generally shown that feedback does affect risk-taking, yet, without reaching a consensus on the consequences of feedback or the underlying cognitive mechanisms. Here, across seven behavioral experiments, we disentangle two competing accounts: the learning hypothesis, where feedback alters subjective values through experience, and the attitudinal hypothesis, where feedback changes preferences in anticipation of outcomes. We find that feedback does not improve maximization but consistently increases risk-taking. Fine-grained temporal analyses reveal that this effect emerges before any outcomes are experienced, ruling out learning as the primary driver. Moreover, the increase of risk-taking in partial feedback seems to be driven by curiosity, while in complete feedback by anticipated regret. Our results indicate that feedback can bias decision-making primarily through attitudinal rather than learning mechanisms. Normative theory predicts that feedback should not affect decisions under risk, but past findings disagree.

 Cortical implants are a proven clinical neurotechnology with the potential to transform our understanding of cognitive processes. These processes rely on complex neuronal networks that are difficult to selectively probe or stimulate. Optogenetics offers cell-type specificity, but achieving the density and coverage required for chronic, high-resolution modulation remains a challenge.

The μLEDs remain stable for over 300 hours continuous operation time in vivo, allowing for months-long chronic experiments. Simultaneous electrophysiology recordings confirmed robust neuronal responses at low μLED drive currents (< 5 mA), minimising thermal effects. Here we show that our device can be chronically implanted in freely-behaving mice and drive behavioural outcomes from spatiotemporal, patterned, optogenetic stimulation of auditory cortical circuits.

 Pneumonic plague remains a high-consequence respiratory disease, highlighting the need for vaccines that induce durable lung-localized immunity. We show that intramuscular prime-boost vaccination with Alum-absorbed OMV46-LcrV (OMV46-LcrV/Alum) is safe but provides limited long-term protection against respiratory Yersinia pestis challenge in mice. To enhance lung immunity, we deliver an adjuvant-free intranasal LcrV “spike” following IM OMV46-LcrV/Alum priming.

 Abundant graphitized organic matter within 3.7-billion-year-old sediments in the Isua Supracrustal Belt comprises the oldest remnants of life. This organic matter could have provided a favorable substrate for anaerobically respiring microbes, though their existence in the early Archean remains uncertain. Here we assess whether anaerobic respiration, linked to reduction of iron and sulfur, operated within these ancient sediments. We analyzed carbon and sulfur isotope data from pelagic and turbiditic sedimentary rocks, sampled from a rock core, and used petrography and iron concentrations to provide geological context. Carbon isotopic compositions indicate respiration of organic compounds, with lighter values associated with iron-rich samples, consistent with respiration coupled to iron reduction. Sulfide grains in pelagic layers have isotopic compositions consistent with reduction of atmospherically produced elemental sulfur, possibly with minor contributions from sulfate reduction during sedimentary hiatuses. These results suggest that early Archean ecosystems were sustained by multiple, interacting microbial metabolisms.

 Offshore wind farms are increasingly shaping coastal ocean dynamics, yet their cumulative physical impacts remain poorly quantified. Using decade-long, high-resolution simulations of the North Sea, we show that large-scale offshore wind development can reduce current velocities by up to $$20 \%$$ and reshape local tidal energy distributions. Wind and tidal wakes exert distinct but interacting influences on ocean physics: wind speed anomalies drive far-field hydrodynamic impacts, while structure-induced drag intensifies local turbulence and mixing. Turbine spacing emerges as a key control on wake interactions, governing the formation of high-turbulence hotspots. The near- and far-field wake effects affect vertical mixing and surface heat fluxes – primarily driven by large-scale wind stress reductions – leading to shallower mixed layers and long-term surface warming of up to $$0.2\,^{\circ} \,{{{\rm{C}}}}$$ in wind farm areas. Our findings reveal a basin-scale physical footprint of offshore wind energy and highlight the need to account for hydrodynamic impacts in future offshore wind farm planning.

 The Triassic–Jurassic transition marks a critical interval, witnessing major biotic turnovers, including the rise of dinosaurs and the end-Triassic mass extinction, triggered by the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province. However, the volcanism linked to terrestrial ecosystem disturbance and dinosaur distribution remains poorly constrained. Here we present an integrated dataset of chemostratigraphic and astrochronological records for a continental drill core from the Kunming Basin in Yunnan Province of Southwest China, where rich dinosaur assemblages have been previously identified. Three negative carbon isotope excursions coupled with volcanogenic mercury anomalies confirm pulsed volcanism-induced environmental impacts on this subtropical terrestrial setting and placement of the Triassic–Jurassic boundary. Critically, the earliest regional sauropodomorph fossils occurred at ~200.17 Ma, indicating post-extinction colonization in low palaeolatitudes by medium- to large-bodied dinosaurs. Large-scale volcanism-induced stressors, potentially coupled with increased climate seasonality, likely created ecological opportunities facilitating dinosaur expansion in the earliest Jurassic. Early regional sauropodomorph fossils from 200.17 Ma suggest post-Triassic mass extinction dinosaur colonization in low paleolatitudes, likely due to Central Atlantic Magmatic Province stressors and increased climate seasonality, according to chemostratigraphic and astrochronological analysis of a core from the Kunming Basin in China."

 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) has become crucial for large-scale land subsidence monitoring, but its results represent complex superpositions of deformation signals from multiple compressible layers driven by various anthropogenic and natural factors. Decomposing subsidence patterns by different driving factors is vital for attribution and prediction. However, existing feature decomposition methods suffer from problems of incomplete decomposition and difficulties in direction determination. This study employs non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) assisted independent component analysis (ICA) to achieve feature decomposition and attribution of land subsidence in the Lubei Plain (LBP) from 2018 to 2023, and integration with deep learning to realize land subsidence prediction. Key contributions include: (1) Using NMF component directions as reference to determine three independent component directions for subsequent attribution and prediction analysis. (2) Groundwater wells in high-spatial-score regions were selected to analyze the relationship between ICs, deformation, and groundwater levels. IC1 showed a high correlation exceeding 0.8 with subsidence, reflecting near-linear patterns from deep confined aquifer over-exploitation and petroleum extraction. IC2 reached maximum correlations of 0.72 with subsidence and 0.56 with groundwater levels (GWL), reflecting inter-annual precipitation-driven variations. Similarly, IC3 exhibited maximum correlations of 0.63 and 0.71, respectively, characterizing seasonal cycles linked to agricultural irrigation and precipitation. (3) The proposed prediction model demonstrated excellent performance with RMSE of 0.06–0.69 and R2 of 0.80–0.86 in test datasets. This study provides a new reference perspective for future driving factor analysis and regulation of land subsidence in the Lubei Plain, and offers a new method for land subsidence prediction."

 Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a fundamental yet challenging task in 3D environment perception, as the sparsity and noise of LiDAR point clouds make it difficult to accurately recover both geometry and semantics. To address these challenges, we propose DPS2CNet, a novel Dual-Path SSC Network that integrates voxel-based and bird’s-eye view (BEV) representations to exploit their complementary strengths. Specifically, DPS2CNet employs a Cylinder3D-enhanced voxel branch to capture fine-grained 3D geometry and a UNet-based BEV branch to model large-scale contextual information. To further boost performance, we incorporate CARAFE for efficient feature upsampling and design a tailored loss function optimized for SSC. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 demonstrate that DPS2CNet achieves state-of-the-art results. In particular, it ranks first on the SemanticKITTI test set with an IoU of 62.6% among all open-source submissions1 , highlighting its effectiveness in complex real-world driving scenarios."

We investigate deep-ocean sequestration of excess produced gas, named Seawater Injection of Natural Gas (SWING), to mitigate routine flaring at deepwater platforms. We evaluate 435 SWING scenarios using well-validated models of pipe transport, multiphase plume dynamics, gas/liquid transitions, and aqueous dissolution of natural gas bubbles and liquid condensate droplets. We identify SWING scenarios that entrap the produced gas in the deep ocean, where it would rapidly biodegrade and subsequently ventilate to the atmosphere as CO2 over decades to centuries. For example, a simulated injection of 10 MMSCFD (million standard ft3 d–1) of heavy produced gas at 1000 m depth yields dissolution of 95% of the injected hydrocarbon mass at ≥500 m depth, including 100% of the methane, assuming a median bubble diameter of 2 mm after jet breakup. Compared to flaring, this SWING scenario reduces CO2-equivalent emissions  to the atmosphere by 260 kilotons year–1, representing a ≥10-fold decrease, analogous to  removing CO2 emissions from 57,000 US passenger vehicles. This scenario  reduces contributions of dissolved inorganic carbon to the surface ocean by ≥6-fold, mitigating this input to surface ocean acidification."

Reacting CO2 with silicate minerals in engineered systems, often called ex situ mineralization, is one such approach. The potential net climate benefit of ex situ CO2 mineralization is unclear, however, as it depends on the technology pathway, location, energy and resource demands, and potential for avoided emissions via co-product utilization. Accurately quantifying these factors in site-specific scenarios is critical for assessing a project’s carbon footprint. Here, we present a parameterized lifecycle assessment (LCA) model to quantify the net CO2e emissions of a range of ex situ mineralization scenarios, considering both direct and avoided emissions. Using a case study with olivine feedstock in Washington State, U.S.A., we show that ex situ mineralization can range from net CO2 positive for the least optimal scenarios to highly CO2 negative for the most optimal scenarios. Considering avoided emissions, some scenarios can be >100% efficient (>1 t of net CO2 stored + avoided per t of gross CO2 stored). Capture efficiency depends heavily on low-carbon electricity, short transport distances, technologies that facilitate the passive capture of ambient CO2, and maximizing avoided emissions. Substantial avoided emissions can be achieved via efficient co-product use in the local cement industry, although the size of the industry may be a constraint to scaling. Modest avoided emissions are also possible via integrated metal recovery. To facilitate comparability with future analyses and to help guide project development, our model is technology and mineral agnostic and available for download as a supplement."

However, organizing and interpreting these data for predictive modeling remain challenging due to inconsistent repository formats, varied program objectives, heterogeneous assay targets, and differences in experimental protocols, including concentration ranges. To address these limitations, we developed a hierarchical mechanistic modeling framework that systematically structures and interprets concentration response HTS data. The model integrated curated data sets by mapping metadata from 455 PubChem assays to 216 protein targets and 103 biological pathways in WikiPathways. Assay-level concentration–response data were organized within a biologically layered hierarchy to construct AOP-based models. The resulting models generated pathway-level toxicity scores that quantified compound potency by integrating inferred protein activity and downstream pathway perturbations. In total, 103 pathways were statistically associated with five in vivo toxicity endpoints: acute systemic, maternal, developmental, human hepatotoxicity, and preclinical hepatotoxicity. This hierarchical framework leverages HTS metadata to predict diverse in vivo toxicity outcomes and enhance mechanistic interpretability of pathway-level effects. It links chemical bioactivity to adverse outcomes, providing a quantitative basis for compound ranking, potency assessment, and hazard prediction. Overall, this framework offers a structured, scalable method for integrating large bioactivity data sets into computational toxicology, supporting chemical risk assessment and early-stage drug discovery."

Primarily, batch and column experiments optimized both the additive dosage strategy and electrode array configuration, favoring a 6-day preinoculation of the niche-preparing culture and a unidirectional one-dimensional electrode setup. Guided by these findings, the 98-day EK-BIO pilot experiment achieved over 90.0% TCE removal, with a 74.0% chloroethylene-to-ethylene conversion efficiency. Microbial community analyses further revealed a notable increase in the relative abundance of putative organohalide-respiring bacteria in the EK-BIO, approximately 25.6% and 34.3% higher than in bioaugmentation and electrokinetic treatments, respectively. Additionally, life cycle assessment results underscored the advantages of EK-BIO over conventional thermal remediation alternatives, with reductions in carbon emissions, energy consumption, and remediation costs.

Because of their unique chemical properties, PFAS are used across numerous processes in semiconductor manufacturing. Given process complexity and lengthy development timelines for alternatives, eliminating PFAS use in this industry is not currently feasible. Developing practical technologies for PFAS waste management is therefore critical but uniquely challenging in semiconductor manufacturing due to the nature of waste streams (parts-per-billion PFAS concentrations, complex backgrounds including hundreds of chemicals, prevalence of ultrashort PFAS, total stream volumes up to 35,000 m3 per day per facility, and distribution across gas, liquid, and solid phases) and significant constraints on space and systems redesign. This review describes recent developments and key questions that must be addressed to develop impactful and commercially viable detection and abatement methods for PFAS waste management in semiconductor manufacturing. Integrating these technologies into compact, high-performance systems and testing them under realistic conditions (complex PFAS mixtures, high fluoride/ionic strength, pH 6–11, low contact time, process variability) through industrial collaborations is essential for scalable, cost-effective solutions.

While the pure culture of the Dehalogenimonas has not been isolated and the reductive dehalogenase genes (rdhAs) responsible for the 4-OH-TPN dechlorination remain unclear. The assembled genome of Dehalogenimonas contained a 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) reductive dehalogenase gene (dcpA) ortholog. In this study, by alternating the substrate from 4-OH-TPN to 1,2-DCA, a pure culture of Dehalogenimonas, designated as 4OHTPN1, was finally isolated. Strain 4OHTPN1 potentially represents a novel species in the genus Dehalogenimonas and contains 33 rdhA genes and 4 rdhB genes. The novel rdhA26 gene (designated htpnA) was identified as the key gene involved in 4-OH-TPN dechlorination. Its transcriptional and protein expression levels were 25.0-fold and 10.2-fold higher than the average of all rdhA genes when the culture was solely amended with 4-OH-TPN. In contrast, the dcpA ortholog, rdhA25, exhibited 10.1-fold and 9.8-fold higher transcriptional and protein expression levels when only amended with 1,2-DCA, highlighting a substrate-specific regulatory response to a distinct electron acceptor.

Using a dataset of 2860 compounds and 297 fish species, GTGT outperformed representative state-of-the-art models, achieving external-test R2 = 0.83 and RMSE = 0.49. Ablation analyses show that chemical and exposure descriptors provide baseline performance, whereas biological features are critical to capture interspecies susceptibility. Comparative analyses further indicate that taxonomy embeddings encode hierarchical evolutionary relationships, while cytb sequences capture molecular divergence, providing complementary information for robust cross-species prediction. We also provide a web platform for single- and multicompound predictions across multiple fish species, enabling model-based species sensitivity distribution (SSD) curves. This framework links chemical, biological, and exposure dimensions to support SSD parametrization and derivation of protective thresholds for comparison with environmentally relevant exposures, rather than serving as a direct risk metric."

This study investigated the associations and potential mediating effects of long-term TV and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on a national scale. COPD was identified based on lung function data from the China Pulmonary Health Study (N = 50,991). Long-term TV was defined as the standard deviation of daily maximum and minimum temperatures over the year prior to the spirometry test. Logistic regression and multivariable linear models were used to quantify the associations of long-term TV with COPD and lung function parameters, respectively. Mediation analyses examined the roles of mental health and blood biomarkers. Each 1 °C increase in temperature variability was associated with a higher risk of COPD (OR (odds ratio): 1.10, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.14). TV was also significantly associated with reductions in both pre- and postbronchodilator lung function, particularly in small-airway function such as FEF25–75 (−58.38 mL/s, 95% CI: −69.62, −47.14). Mediation analyses indicated that a slight proportion of the TV effect on COPD (1.56–9.55%) was mediated through mental health (anxiety or depression) and blood biomarkers (neutrophil rate, red blood cell count). Long-term TV is an independent risk factor for COPD and impaired lung function. The results suggested that these effects may be mediated in parts through psychosocial and inflammatory pathways. Climate-adaptive public health strategies should incorporate temperature variability to protect respiratory health."

Chronic overexposure to Mn can cause a Parkinson’s-like neurodegenerative disorder; however, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This study combined in vitro and in vivo models to investigate the role of the cGAS–STING/NLRP3 axis in regulating the p38 MAPK/NF–κB pathway in the process of Mn-induced Tau aggregation leading to neurotoxicity. Our results demonstrated that MnCl2 exposure significantly activated both the cGAS–STING/NLRP3 signaling axis and the p38 MAPK/NF–κB pathway, accompanied by increased Tau expression. Genetic ablation of cGAS, STING, or NLRP3 attenuated Mn-induced Tau upregulation, indicating that the cGAS–STING/NLRP3 signaling axis mediates Tau expression. RNA-seq analysis further revealed that the decreased Tau expression in knockout cells is associated with the MAPK/NF–κB signaling pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK or NF–κB markedly downregulated cGAS–STING signaling, inflammatory cytokine release, and phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) levels. Moreover, we observed colocalization and interaction among p-p38, p-p65, and p-Tau. Overall, these findings reveal that Mn activates the cGAS–STING/NLRP3 signaling axis regulated by the p38 MAPK/NF–κB pathway, driving pathological Tau aggregation."

According to a large‐ensemble simulation under a medium‐to‐high emission scenario, the surface cooling and oceanic heat convergence in the SPNA may decrease to ∼20% of their historical levels by 2100. We show here that the projected weakening of the AMOC volume transport alone cannot explain such a large decrease in the heat convergence rate. Our analysis indicates that, due to the suppression of deep‐water formation in the SPNA, the AMOC's lower limb becomes shallower, carrying relatively warm water southward away from the SPNA. This in turn accelerates the decrease in oceanic heat transport to the SPNA per unit AMOC weakening.

Here we report single‐crystal elasticity of Ti‐bearing davemaoite with the composition of Ca(Si0.57Ti0.43)O3 under high pressure‐temperature and found that Ti incorporation significantly reduces velocities and alters the pressure dependence of the shear modulus. Further velocity modeling demonstrated that subducted crusts with varying Ti content have seismic signatures of 1.7(2)–6.8(5)% low‐VS at the bottom MTZ, consistent with the observed low‐VS structure in the region.

Growing at 1,400 m under nearly constant temperature and seawater chemistry, this specimen rules out environmental forcing as a control. High‐resolution elemental mapping, Raman microscopy, and infrared nano‐spectroscopy show that acidic, aspartate‐rich macromolecules are enriched in the calcitic layers but depleted in the aragonitic layer. These macromolecules lower the nucleation barrier for calcite while inhibiting aragonite growth, driving abrupt, layer‐by‐layer phase switches. Temporal shifts in macromolecule distribution correlate with biological imprints, implying regulation via changes in calcifying tissues or symbionts. Our results provide direct in situ evidence that organic molecules, rather than external conditions, govern carbonate polymorph selection in octocorals, offering a natural template for biomimetic control of CaCO3 phase architecture."

While these aspects have been discussed individually in several papers, we focus on the mutual influences of these aspects in the information construction and argue that, therefore, they cannot be considered separately. We identify five dimensions—the level of risk, the complexity of the scientific problem, user values, power relationships and language—to characterize the complexity of a given user context. Analyzing these dimensions can guide the choice and design of user engagement in a given situation. In particular, even basic research may benefit from such an engagement.

 Lateral heterostructures are important for exploring exotic physics, developing new devices and achieving device miniaturization1–8. Endo-epitaxial growth occurring in patterned templates presents a promising strategy to realize extensive patterned areas in heterostructures, as recently demonstrated with two-dimensional (2D) covalent materials9–13. However, the conventional lithography and etching processes used to prepare patterned templates are too aggressive for 2D lead halide perovskites, owing to their inherently soft and unstable ionic lattice14–16. Here we create square holes of controllable size within 2D lead halide perovskites, enabling the fabrication of continuous lateral heterostructures over large areas. We demonstrate that the square holes form through spontaneous etching, a process initiated by internal strain and stabilized along the [100]/[010] crystallographic direction. Furthermore, the size of the square holes can be controlled by adjusting the etching time and temperature. Moreover, by incorporating a rapid solvent evaporation growth technique, the edges of the square holes act as templates for epitaxial growth of another type of perovskite, incorporating different halide or metal ions. Finally, we realized a series of mosaic lateral heterostructures that can emit various colours for light-emitting devices. This synthesis of diverse 2D perovskite mosaic lateral heterostructures provides valuable insights into the structural characteristics of perovskites and offers a versatile material platform for the development of complex integrated emitting devices.

 The origin of eukaryotes is one of the key problems in evolutionary biology1,2. The demonstration that the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) already contained the mitochondrion—an endosymbiotic organelle derived from an alphaproteobacterium—and the discovery of Asgard archaea—the closest archaeal relatives of eukaryotes3–7—inform and constrain evolutionary scenarios of eukaryogenesis8. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the origins of core eukaryotic genes tracing to the LECA within a rigorous statistical framework centred around evolutionary hypothesis testing using constrained phylogenetic trees. The results show dominant contributions of Asgard archaea to the origin of most of the conserved eukaryotic functional systems and pathways. A limited contribution from Alphaproteobacteria was identified, relating primarily to energy transformation systems and Fe–S cluster biogenesis, whereas ancestry from other bacterial phyla was scattered across the eukaryotic functional landscape, without clear, consistent trends. These findings imply a model of eukaryogenesis in which key features of eukaryotic cell organization evolved in the Asgard lineage leading to the LECA, followed by the capture of the alphaproteobacterial endosymbiont and augmented by numerous but sporadic horizontal acquisitions of genes from other bacteria both before and after endosymbiosis.

Littman,Microbiota-induced T cell plasticity enables immune-mediated tumour control,"Molecular mimicry between a gut commensal and a tumour antigen forms part of an important mechanistic framework that can boost the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy and restrain tumour growth. 
 Therapies that harness the immune system to target and eliminate tumour cells have revolutionized cancer care. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), which boosts the anti-tumour immune response by inhibiting negative regulators of T cell activation1–3, is remarkably successful in a subset of cancer patients. Yet a significant proportion do not respond to treatment, emphasizing the need to understand factors influencing the therapeutic efficacy of ICB4–9. The gut microbiota, consisting of trillions of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, has emerged as a critical determinant of immune function and response to cancer immunotherapy, with several studies demonstrating association of microbiota composition with clinical response10–16. However, a mechanistic understanding of how gut commensal bacteria influence the efficacy of ICB remains elusive. Here we use a gut commensal microorganism, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), which induces an antigen-specific T helper 17 (TH17) cell effector program in the small intestine lamina propria (SILP)17, to investigate how colonization with this microbe affects the efficacy of ICB in restraining distal growth of tumours sharing antigen with SFB. We find that anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) treatment effectively inhibits the growth of implanted SFB antigen-expressing melanoma only if mice are colonized with SFB. Through T cell receptor (TCR) clonal lineage tracing, fate mapping and peptide–major histocompatability complex (MHC) tetramer staining, we identify tumour-associated SFB-specific T helper 1 (TH1)-like cells derived from the homeostatic TH17 cells induced by SFB colonization in the SILP. These gut-educated ex-TH17 cells produce high levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interferon (IFN)-γ and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) within the tumour microenvironment (TME), enhancing antigen presentation and promoting recruitment, expansion and effector functions of CD8+ tumour-infiltrating cytotoxic lymphocytes and thereby enabling anti-PD-1-mediated tumour control. Conditional ablation of SFB-induced IL-17A+CD4+ T cells, precursors of tumour-associated TH1-like cells, abolishes anti-PD-1-mediated tumour control and markedly impairs tumour-specific CD8+ T cell recruitment and effector function within the TME. Our data, as a proof of principle, define a cellular pathway by which a single, defined intestinal commensal imprints T cell plasticity that potentiates PD-1 blockade, and indicate targeted modulation of the microbiota as a strategy to broaden ICB efficacy. Molecular mimicry between a gut commensal and a tumour antigen forms part of an important mechanistic framework that can boost the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy and restrain tumour growth."

 Fully stretchable organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), composed entirely of intrinsically stretchable materials, are essential for on-skin displays1–3. However, their low device efficiency has been a persistent barrier to practical applications for more than a decade4. Here we addressed this challenge by incorporating an intrinsically stretchable exciplex-assisted phosphorescent (ExciPh) layer. The elastomer-tolerant triplet-recycling mechanism mitigates exciton energy transfer limitations arising from the insulating elastomer matrix, yielding a light-emitting layer with more than 200% stretchability and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 21.7%. To translate this performance to fully stretchable devices, we integrated MXene-contact stretchable electrodes (MCSEs), which feature high mechanical robustness and tunable work function (WF), ensuring efficient hole and electron injection. These advances enable fully stretchable OLEDs with a record EQE of 17.0% and minimal luminescence loss under 60% strain. This approach to designing high-efficiency, mechanically compliant optoelectronics will enable the next-generation wearable and deformable displays.

 The search for dark matter focuses now on hypothetical light particles with masses ranging from MeV to GeV (refs. 1–12). These particles would leave very faint signals experimentally. A potential avenue for enhancing experimental sensitivity to light matter relies on the Migdal effect13–15, which involves the detectable ejection of electrons following the instantaneous accelerations of atoms colliding with neutral dark matter. However, although the Migdal effect could be equally generated in controlled experiments with neutral projectiles, a direct experimental observation of this effect is missing, casting doubt on the reliability of detection experiments relying on this effect. Here we report the direct observation of the Migdal effect in neutron–nucleus collisions, achieving a statistical significance of 5 standard deviations, which rests on 6 candidate events selected out of almost 106 recorded events. Our experiments have determined the ratio of the Migdal cross-section to the nuclear recoil cross-section to be 
                $${4.9}_{-1.9}^{+2.6}\times {10}^{-5}$$
                
              , in which nuclear recoils exceed 35 keVee and electron recoils span 5–10 keV. These findings are consistent with theoretical predictions. This work resolves a long-standing gap in experimental validation, which not only strengthens the theoretical foundation of the Migdal effect but also paves the way for its application in light dark matter detection.

 The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) raises important questions about their safety and alignment1. Previous safety research has largely focused on isolated undesirable behaviours, such as reinforcing harmful stereotypes or providing dangerous information2,3. Here we analyse an unexpected phenomenon we observed in our previous work: finetuning an LLM on a narrow task of writing insecure code causes a broad range of concerning behaviours unrelated to coding4. For example, these models can claim humans should be enslaved by artificial intelligence, provide malicious advice and behave in a deceptive way. We refer to this phenomenon as emergent misalignment. It arises across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o of OpenAI and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct of Alibaba Cloud, with misaligned responses observed in as many as 50% of cases. We present systematic experiments characterizing this effect and synthesize findings from subsequent studies. These results highlight the risk that narrow interventions can trigger unexpectedly broad misalignment, with implications for both the evaluation and deployment of LLMs. Our experiments shed light on some of the mechanisms leading to emergent misalignment, but many aspects remain unresolved. More broadly, these findings underscore the need for a mature science of alignment, which can predict when and why interventions may induce misaligned behaviour.

 Coherent nonlinear light–matter interaction with X-rays gives access to a regime in ultrafast spectroscopy in which atomic resolution meets femtosecond and attosecond timescales1,2. Particularly, X-ray four-wave mixing, involving several resonant transitions in a single coherent nonlinear process, has the potential to provide information on the electronic states coupling, coherent electron motion, correlation and dynamics, with state and site selectivity3–5. Here we demonstrate coherent, background-free four-photon interactions with core-shell electrons using single broadband X-ray pulses from a free-electron laser. The all-X-ray four-wave mixing signals, measured in gaseous neon, arise from doubly resonant nonlinear processes involving Raman transitions6, including X-ray coherent anti-Stokes electronic Raman scattering. The 2D spectral maps (photon-in/photon-out) represent a step towards multidimensional correlation spectroscopy at the atomic scale. Using a multicolour time-delayed X-ray pulse scheme, we further demonstrate the feasibility of extending the proposed methodology to the ultrafast time domain. These results reveal potential for studying localized electron dynamics in multiple systems, from biomolecules to correlated quantum materials, with applications in areas such as energy conversion, biomedical imaging and quantum information technologies.

 Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) generates detailed temporal profiles of glucose dynamics, but its full potential for achieving glucose homeostasis and predicting long-term outcomes remains underutilized. Here we present GluFormer, a generative foundation model for CGM data trained with self-supervised learning on more than 10 million glucose measurements from 10,812 adults mainly without diabetes1,2. Using autoregressive prediction, the model learned representations that transferred across 19 external cohorts (n = 6,044) spanning 5 countries, 8 CGM devices and diverse pathophysiological states, including prediabetes, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes and obesity. These representations provided consistent improvements over baseline blood glucose and HbA1c levels and other CGM-derived measures for forecasting glycaemic parameters3,4. In individuals with prediabetes, GluFormer stratified those likely to experience clinically significant increases in HbA1c over a 2-year period, outperforming baseline HbA1c and common CGM metrics. In a cohort of 580 adults with short-term CGM and a median follow-up of 11 years5, GluFormer identified individuals at elevated risk of diabetes and cardiovascular mortality more effectively than HbA1c. Specifically, 66% of incident diabetes cases and 69% of cardiovascular deaths occurred in the top risk quartile, compared with 7% and 0%, respectively, in the bottom quartile. In clinical trials, baseline CGM representations improved outcome prediction. A multimodal extension of the model that integrates dietary data generated plausible glucose trajectories and predicted individual glycaemic responses to food. Together, these findings indicate that GluFormer provides a generalizable framework for encoding glycaemic patterns and may inform precision medicine approaches for metabolic health.

 Micrometre-sized, densely packed natural cilia that perform non-reciprocal 3D motions with dynamically tunable collective patterns are crucial for biological processes such as microscale locomotion1, nutrient acquisition2, cell trafficking3–5 and embryonic and neurological development6–8. However, replicating these motions in artificial systems remains challenging given the limits of scalable, locally controllable soft-bodied actuation at the micrometre scale. Overcoming this challenge would enhance our understanding of ciliary dynamics, clarify their biological importance and enable new microscale devices and bioinspired technologies. Here we show a previously unrecognized fast electrical response of micrometre-scale hydrogels, induced by voltages down to 1.5 V without hydrolysis, with bending motions driven by ion migration across a nanometre-scale hydrogel network 3D-printed by two-photon polymerization, occurring within milliseconds. On the basis of these findings, we print gel microcilia arrays composed of a soft acrylic acid-co-acrylamide (AAc-co-AAm) hydrogel (modulus of approximately 1,000 Pa) that respond to electrical stimuli within milliseconds. Each microcilium measures 2–10 µm in diameter and 18–90 µm in height, achieving 3D rotational bending motion at up to 40 Hz, mirroring the geometry and dynamics of natural cilia. These gel microcilia maintain functionality after 330,000 continuous actuation cycles with less than 30% performance degradation. The gel microcilia arrays can be integrated on flexible polyimide substrates and fabricated at large scale using conventional lithography techniques.

 G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are key mediators of cell communication and represent the most important class of drug targets1,2. Biophysical studies with purified GPCRs in vitro have suggested that they exist in an equilibrium of distinct inactive and active states, which is modulated by ligands in an efficacy-dependent manner3–11. However, how efficacy is encoded and whether multiple receptor states occur in living cells remain unclear. Here we use genetic code expansion12 and bioorthogonal labelling13–16 to generate a panel of fluorescence-based biosensors for a prototypical GPCR, the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2R). These biosensors enable real-time monitoring of agonist-promoted conformational changes across the receptor’s extracellular surface in intact cells. We demonstrate that different agonists produce equilibria of at least four distinct active states of the G-protein-bound M2R, each with a different ability to activate G proteins. The formation of these M2R–G-protein complexes occurs over 0.2–5 s along trajectories that involve both common and ligand-specific conformational changes and appear to determine G-protein selectivity. These observations reveal the molecular nature of ligand efficacy in intact cells. Selectively exploiting such different GPCR activation trajectories and conformational equilibria may open new avenues for GPCR drug discovery.

 Disease tolerance is a defence strategy essential for survival of infections, limiting physiological damage without killing the pathogen1,2. The disease course and pathology an infection may cause can change over the lifespan of a host due to the structural and functional physiological changes that accumulate with age. Because successful disease tolerance responses require the host to engage mechanisms that are compatible with the disease course and pathology caused by an infection, we predicted that this defence strategy would change with age. Animals infected with a 50% lethal dose  (LD50) of a pathogen often show distinct health and sickness trajectories due to differences in disease tolerance1,3 and can be used to define tolerance mechanisms. Here, using a polymicrobial sepsis model, we found that, despite having the same LD50, aged and young susceptible mice showed distinct disease courses. In young survivors, cardiac Foxo1 and its downstream effector Trim63 (MuRF1) protected from sepsis-induced cardiac remodelling, multi-organ injury and mortality. Conversely, in aged hosts, Foxo1 and Trim63 acted as drivers of sepsis pathogenesis and death. Our findings have implications for the tailoring of therapy to the age of an infected individual and indicate that disease tolerance genes show antagonistic pleiotropy.

 African populations remain substantially under-represented in research studies and global genomic databases. As the ancestral home of anatomically modern humans, Africa holds pride of place regarding human genetic diversity, with a deep and complex evolution over hundreds of thousands of years of human migration, admixture, and exposure to climate changes and infectious agents. Yet our present view of genomic diversity in Africa is sparse and poorly captures the rich variation across its more than 2,000 ethnolinguistic groups. To enhance representation, the Assessing Genetic Diversity in Africa (AGenDA) project, under the umbrella of the Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa) consortium, identified under-represented groups across nine different African countries for human whole-genome sequencing, with a view to enriching global datasets. Here we share our processes, including community engagement, obtaining ethics approvals, navigating legal compliance and developing a common governance framework. AGenDA is a testament to the determination of the scientific community to undertake research in challenging environments. It is led from Africa by African investigators who are the decision-makers in data-sharing processes.

 Optical tweezer arrays have emerged as a key experimental platform1,2 for quantum computation3,4, quantum simulation5,6 and quantum metrology7,8, enabling unprecedented levels of control over single atoms and molecules. The ability to scale such arrays has become a defining challenge. Typically, optical tweezer arrays are generated using acousto-optic deflectors or liquid-crystal spatial light modulators. Fundamental limitations in optical resolution have constrained array sizes to about 10,000 traps9. Metasurfaces10,11, planar photonic devices comprising millions of subwavelength pixels, provide an intriguing alternative for the generation of optical tweezer arrays12. Here we demonstrate the trapping of single strontium atoms in optical tweezer arrays generated via holographic metasurfaces. We realize two-dimensional arrays with more than 100 single atoms, arranged in arbitrary geometries with trap spacings as small as 1.5 μm. The arrays have a high uniformity in terms of trap depth, trap frequency and positional accuracy, rivalling or surpassing existing approaches. This is enabled by highly efficient holographic metasurfaces fabricated from high-refractive-index materials, silicon-rich silicon nitride and titanium dioxide. Through analytical and numerical methods, we find that the subwavelength pixel sizes of these metasurfaces allow scaling of tweezer arrays far beyond current capabilities. As a demonstration, we realize an optical tweezer array with 360,000 traps. These advances overcome a critical barrier to realizing scalable neutral-atom quantum technologies.

 The mouse PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway provides sustained anti-transposon immunity to the developing male germline by directing transposon DNA methylation1–3. The first step in this process is the recruitment of SPOCD1 to young LINE1 loci4. Thereafter, piRNA-mediated tethering of the PIWI protein MIWI2 (also known as PIWIL4) to the nascent transposon transcript recruits the DNA methylation machinery5,6. The piRNA pathway needs to methylate all active transposon copies but how this is achieved remains unknown. Here we show that nuclear piRNA and de novo methylation factors are all euchromatic, exposing constitutive heterochromatin as a genomic blind spot for the piRNA pathway. We discover a ‘nowhere-to-hide’ mechanism that enables piRNA pathway-mediated LINE1 surveillance of the entire genome. We find that SPOCD1 directly interacts with the nuclear pore component TPR, which forms heterochromatin exclusion zones adjacent to nuclear pores7. In fetal gonocytes undergoing piRNA-directed DNA methylation, TPR is found both at the nuclear periphery and throughout the nucleoplasm. We find that the SPOCD1–TPR interaction is required for complete non-stochastic piRNA-directed LINE1 methylation. The loss of the SPOCD1–TPR interaction results in a fraction of SPOCD1 and other chromatin-bound piRNA factors relocalizing to constitutive heterochromatin where they are no longer accessible to MIWI2 and the de novo methylation machinery. In summary, the piRNA pathway has co-opted TPR to guarantee that LINE1s are accessible to the piRNA and de novo methylation machineries. In mice, a SPOCD1–TPR-dependent ‘nowhere-to-hide’ mechanism is required for complete non-stochastic piRNA-directed LINE1 DNA methylation by preventing transposons from escaping surveillance within heterochromatin."

 The multifaceted dysfunction of tumour-infiltrating T cells, including exhaustion and mitochondrial dysfunction, remains a major obstacle in cancer immunotherapy1–6. Transcriptomic and epigenomic regulation of T cell dysfunction have been extensively studied7–9, but the role of proteostasis in regulating these obstacles remains less defined. Here we combined computational analyses of atlases of T cell exhaustion and mitochondrial fitness with performed targeted in vivo CRISPR screens, which identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase KLHL6 as a dual-negative regulator of both T cell exhaustion and mitochondrial dysfunction. Mechanistically, KLHL6 expression promoted TOX poly-ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, thereby attenuating the transition of progenitor exhausted T cells towards terminal exhaustion. Simultaneously, KLHL6 maintained mitochondrial fitness by constraining the excessive mitochondrial fission that occurs during chronic T cell receptor stimulation by means of post-translational regulation of the PGAM5–Drp1 axis. However, KLHL6 is naturally downregulated by T cell receptor ligation, mitigating its potentially beneficial ubiquitin ligase activities during exposure to chronic stimulation. Enforcing KLHL6 expression in T cells markedly improved efficacy and long-term persistence against tumours and during viral infections in vivo. These findings uncover KLHL6 as a multifunctional, clinically actionable target for cancer immunotherapy, and highlight the potential of modulating proteostasis and ubiquitin modification to improve immunotherapy.

 The considerable success of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 has underscored the potential of synthetic mRNA as a transformative biomedical technology1. A critical feature of this approach is the incorporation of the modified nucleoside N1-methylpseudouridine (m1Ψ), which enhances antigen expression while reducing immunogenicity2–5. However, a comprehensive understanding of how m1Ψ influences translation remains incomplete. Here we use ribosome profiling at the subcodon resolution to show that m1Ψ increases ribosome density on synthetic mRNAs, leading to higher protein production independent of innate immune activation or eIF2α phosphorylation. We find that m1Ψ directly slows ribosome movement in defined sequence contexts while simultaneously promoting translation initiation. Structural studies using cryo-electron microscopy reveal that m1Ψ alters interactions within the ribosomal decoding centre, providing a mechanistic basis for slowed elongation. Furthermore, by introducing synonymous recoding that disrupts the modification-mediated changes in elongation, we show that the m1Ψ-dependent enhancement of protein output is modulated by codon composition, and that m1Ψ impact is strongest in mRNAs containing non-optimal codons with uridines at the wobble position. Together, these findings demonstrate that m1Ψ directly modulates translation dynamics, thereby increasing protein yield from synthetic mRNAs in specific sequence contexts. N1-Methylpseudouridine enhances the translation of synthetic mRNAs, independently of innate immunity."

 Massively parallel genetic screens have been used to map sequence-to-function relationships for a variety of genetic elements1–5. However, as these approaches interrogate only short sequences, it remains challenging to perform high-throughput assays on constructs containing combinations of multiple sequence elements arranged across multi-kb length scales. Overcoming this barrier could accelerate synthetic biology; by screening diverse gene circuit designs and learning ‘composition to function’ mappings, genetic part composability rules could be revealed, enabling rapid identification of behaviour-optimized design variants6,7. Here we introduce CLASSIC (combining long- and short-range sequencing to investigate genetic complexity), a genetic screening platform that combines long- and short-read next-generation sequencing (NGS) modalities to quantitatively assess pools of constructs of arbitrary length containing diverse genetic part compositions. We show that CLASSIC can measure expression profiles of over 105 gene circuit designs (from 5–20 kb) in a single experiment in human cells. The resulting datasets can be used to train machine-learning models that accurately predict circuit behaviour across expansive circuit design landscapes, revealing part composability rules that govern circuit performance. Our study shows that, by expanding the throughput of each design–build–test–learn cycle, CLASSIC enhances the pace and scale of synthetic biology and establishes an experimental basis for data-driven design of complex genetic systems.

 Fine-tuning DNA replication and transcription is crucial to prevent collisions between their machineries1. This is particularly important near promoters, where RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) initiates transcription and frequently arrests, forming R-loops2–4. Arrested RNAPII can obstruct DNA replication, which often initiates near promoters5,6. The mechanisms that rescue arrested RNAPII during elongation to avoid conflicts with co-directional replisomes remain unclear. Here, using genome-wide approaches and genetic screens, we identify CFAP20 as part of a protective pathway that salvages arrested RNAPII in promoter-proximal regions, diverting it from the path of co-directional replisomes. CFAP20-deficient cells accumulate R-loops near promoters, which leads to defects in replication timing and dynamics. These defects stem from accelerated replication-fork speeds that cause a secondary reduction in origin activity. Co-depletion of the Mediator complex or removal of R-loop-engaged RNAPII restores normal replication. Our findings suggest that transcription-dependent fork stalling in cis induces accelerated fork progression in trans, generating single-stranded DNA gaps. We propose that CFAP20 facilitates RNAPII elongation under high levels of Mediator-driven transcription, thereby preventing replisome collisions. This study provides a transcription-centred view of transcription–replication encounters, revealing how locally arrested transcription complexes propagate genome-wide replication phenotypes and defining CFAP20 as a key factor that safeguards genome stability. CFAP20 has a key role in rescuing RNA polymerase II complexes that have arrested during DNA transcription, limiting the accumulation of R-loops and preventing collisions between the transcription and replication machinery."

Below the threshold bias of 36 V, the device behaves as a resonant amplifier, and above it exhibits self-sustained coherent oscillation, linewidth narrowing and high output powers. A continuous on-chip acoustic output power of up to −6.1 dBm is generated at 1 GHz with a resolution-limited linewidth of <77 Hz and a carrier phase noise of −57 dBc Hz−1 at 1 kHz offset. Through detailed modelling, we show pathways for improving the performance of these devices, including mHz linewidths, high power efficiencies and footprints under 550 μm2 at 10 GHz.

 Anticipating future outcomes is a fundamental task of the brain1–3. This process requires learning the states of the world as well as the transitional relationships between those states. In rodents, the hippocampal spatial cognitive map is thought to be one such internal model4. However, evidence for predictive coding5,6 and reward sensitivity7–10 in the hippocampal neuronal representation suggests that its role extends beyond purely spatial representation. How this reward representation evolves over extended experience remains unclear. Here we track the evolution of the hippocampal reward representation over weeks as mice learn to solve a cognitively demanding reward-based task. We find several lines of evidence, both at the population and the single-cell level, indicating that the hippocampal representation becomes predictive of reward as the mouse learns the task over several weeks. Both the population-level encoding of reward and the proportion of reward-tuned neurons decrease with experience. At the same time, the representation of features that precede the reward increases with experience. By tracking reward-tuned neurons over time, we find that their activity gradually shifts from encoding the reward itself to representing preceding task features, indicating that experience drives a backward-shifted reorganization of neural activity to anticipate reward. We show that a temporal difference model of place fields11 recapitulates these results. Our findings underscore the dynamic nature of hippocampal representations, and highlight their role in learning through the prediction of future outcomes.

 Developments in artificial intelligence (AI) have accelerated scientific discovery1. Alongside recent AI-oriented Nobel prizes2–9, these trends establish the role of AI tools in science10. This advancement raises questions about the influence of AI tools on scientists and science as a whole, and highlights a potential conflict between individual and collective benefits11. To evaluate these questions, we used a pretrained language model to identify AI-augmented research, with an F1-score of 0.875 in validation against expert-labelled data. Using a dataset of 41.3 million research papers across the natural sciences and covering distinct eras of AI, here we show an accelerated adoption of AI tools among scientists and consistent professional advantages associated with AI usage, but a collective narrowing of scientific focus. Scientists who engage in AI-augmented research publish 3.02 times more papers, receive 4.84 times more citations and become research project leaders 1.37 years earlier than those who do not. By contrast, AI adoption shrinks the collective volume of scientific topics studied by 4.63% and decreases scientists’ engagement with one another by 22%. By consequence, adoption of AI in science presents what seems to be a paradox: an expansion of individual scientists’ impact but a contraction in collective science’s reach, as AI-augmented work moves collectively towards areas richest in data. With reduced follow-on engagement, AI tools seem to automate established fields rather than explore new ones, highlighting a tension between personal advancement and collective scientific progress.

Moreover, low-freezing-point aqueous calcium chloride solution was used as the heat-transfer fluid, ensuring effective flow at low operational temperatures. Our desktop device achieved a heat-source temperature of −12 °C from a room-temperature heat sink, paving the way for next-generation green elastocaloric freezing technologies. A compression-based, regenerative elastocaloric cooling device using low-transition-temperature tubular NiTi units in a cascaded configuration, which show superelasticity and substantial entropy changes, allows the construction of a sub-zero Celsius refrigeration system without refrigerant gases."

 Metabolites are central to cellular homeostasis. Although much emphasis has been placed on their relevance to meet energetic and biosynthetic demands, metabolic intermediates also function as signalling molecules. Here we show that polyamines, small polycations that are critical to cellular homeostasis1–3, regulate the process of alternative pre-mRNA splicing. We find that inhibition of polyamine synthesis increases phosphorylation of spliceosomal proteins, concomitant with perturbation of alternative splicing in cells and tissues. Mechanistically, molecular modelling combined with biochemical assays revealed that polyamines bind to acidic phosphorylatable motifs in splicing factors of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein SF3 subcomplex, thus preventing the action of upstream kinases. We refer to this molecular process by which polyamines regulate protein phosphorylation as metabolic shielding.

 Climate change is intensifying drought risk, yet it is unclear which regions will be most vulnerable in the future. Here we investigate emerging hotspots of agricultural drought across the tropics and Northern Hemisphere extratropics using climate reanalysis and model simulations under a range of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. Our analysis accounts for soil moisture at the onset of the growing season, as well as variability during the season itself, linking climate change to the land-surface water balance by classifying the dominant controls on evapotranspiration, including a newly defined state governed by plant extraction of water from the root zone. We show that much of Europe, southern Africa, northern South America and western North America are emerging hotspots of agricultural drought, with mechanisms of observed drying consistent with future projections. Drought trends are identified even where precipitation projections diverge. By focusing on growing seasons, our approach captures hotspots overlooked by annual metrics and shows that increasing drought frequency is compounded by shifts towards more severe and intense events. These findings have strong implications for food security and highlight the need for drought-resilient adaptation not only in the global south but also in extratropical regions where risk is already escalating.

 Major changes in the oxygenation of the atmosphere and ocean have been suggested to trigger the taxonomic diversification and ecological expansion of complex life, including animals, during the Neoproterozoic–Palaeozoic transition. However, testing this hypothesis is hampered by the paucity of quantitative constraints on the oceanic oxygen availability at that time. Here we show how the spatial pattern of I/Ca ratios in marine carbonates—a proxy for dissolved oxygen in the local upper ocean—provides a fingerprint of the oxygenation state of Earth’s surface. Spatial analyses on published I/Ca ratios spanning the past 2,000 million years show that the latitudinal gradient of oxygen concentrations in the upper ocean was reversed in the Proterozoic eon relative to the modern pattern of decreasing oxygen concentrations from the mid-latitudes to the Equator. Using an Earth system model, we identify that the Proterozoic I/Ca latitudinal pattern is associated with a biosphere-controlled distribution of oxygen in the upper ocean at a low atmospheric oxygen level, and the transition to a modern pattern in the I/Ca proxy may correspond to a threshold of around 1% of today’s atmospheric oxygen concentration.

Here, the authors show that maternal deletion of Ezhip impairs H3K27me3 deposition post-fertilization. This notably translates into the loss of H3K27me3-dependent gene imprinting. 
 Zygotes inherit parental genomes with distinct chromatin structures. In eutherian mammals, this asymmetry is considered crucial for embryonic development, notably because it enables genomic imprinting. Besides the well-established role of DNA methylation in this process, a transient form of imprinting in mice has been shown to rely instead on H3K27me3. Here, we show that maternal deletion of Ezhip, encoding a negative regulator of PRC2, initially increases the asymmetric distribution of H3K27me3 among the parental genomes at the zygotic stage but subsequently impairs H3K27me3-dependent imprinting and mitigates X-chromosome inactivation in pre-implantation embryos. We show that EZHIP protein, translated from the maternal mRNA pool, is present during the first cell divisions post-fertilization and limits PRC2 enzymatic activity. In its absence, the H3K27me3 landscape is both expanded and flattened, and the asymmetry between the two parental genomes is lost. Our study reveals the deleterious consequences on early embryonic development of unleashing PRC2 activity. EZHIP, an inhibitor of PRC2, is required for female fertility in mice.

 Gravitationally induced stratification during self-assembly often leads to density-driven vertical segregation, resulting in an inherent density gradient that severely limits the synthesis of metastable nanofilms requiring inverted architectures. Here we show an antigravity confined interfacial self-assembly approach based on a liquid-liquid interface formed between hydrophilic and hydrophobic porous membranes, where capillary forces suppress gravitational effects to enable precise molecular organization. Experimental data, supported by quantum chemistry, density functional theory, and Fick’s first law, demonstrate that capillary forces enhance local concentration and interaction probability, yielding highly ordered, stable nanofilms. Our approach achieves a 17-fold increase in film area than gravity-limited methods and a 109-fold improvement over unconfined techniques. These nanofilms exhibit the stability and mechanical property, showing promise for green enhanced oil recovery and multifunctional material development. Furthermore, our strategy offers a paradigm for nanofilm mechanical characterization, paving the way for future advances in the design and application of nanomaterials.

Here, the authors introduce ORCA, a deep learning framework using nanopore RNA sequencing to detect multiple modification types, revealing isoform-specific patterns and regulatory interactions. 
 Despite the extensive studies of individual RNA modifications, the lack of methods to detect multiple modification types simultaneously has left the global epitranscriptomic landscape and its underlying crosstalk largely unexplored. Here, we present ORCA (Omni-RNA modification Characterization and Annotation), a deep learning framework that enables comprehensive mapping of RNA modification landscape using nanopore direct RNA sequencing. ORCA employs domain adversarial learning to detect and quantify a wide range of modifications by leveraging mixed stoichiometry-driven signal and sequence variability between modified and unmodified nucleotides. It also incorporates a transfer learning module for accurate annotation of modification types with minimal prior knowledge. Applying ORCA to multiple human cell lines reveals widespread, isoform-specific modification patterns, as well as intricate cooperative and competitive interactions among neighboring modification sites. This approach substantially expands the repertoire of known RNA modification sites and elucidates their spatial organization, revealing the emerging roles of RNA modifications in splicing regulation. ORCA thus provides an unbiased and generalizable framework for decoding RNA modification dynamics and their regulatory complexity across diverse biological contexts.

 The rapid growth of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things calls for compact hardware platforms that integrate sensing, computing, and nonlinear processing within a unified architecture. However, most existing neuromorphic systems implement only partial functionalities and rely on heterogeneous device integration, limiting scalability and efficiency. Here, we show a high-speed, reconfigurable multi-modal split-floating-gate memory that monolithically integrates in-sensor computing, in-memory computing, and multiple nonlinear activation functions within a single device structure. By programming charges in spatially separated floating gates, the device enables non-volatile analog control of photoresponsivity and conductance, as well as electrically reconfigurable rectification to emulate ReLU and Sigmoid activations. We further demonstrate a fully hardware-implemented sensor–processor system based on the multi-modal split-floating-gate memory arrays that performs complete unsupervised and supervised learning tasks.

This study shows that in situ proton-supplying sites enable low-temperature, long-lasting decomposition of stubborn PFAS gas. 
 Catalytic hydrolysis is an effective strategy for decomposing tetrafluoromethane (CF4), one of the most chemically inert per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). A key challenge in this process lies in enhancing proton availability to facilitate efficient and stable C–F bond activation while ensuring long-term catalyst stability. Here we present an SO2-driven approach to significantly enhance H2O dissociation and proton-supplying through the in situ formation of Al–HSO4 and Ga–HS species. Combined experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that these species not only lower the energy barrier for C–F bond activation but also promote active site regeneration by facilitating defluorination, thus effectively overcoming catalyst deactivation. As a result, the optimized catalyst enables complete CF4 decomposition at a low temperature of 550°C, with stable operation for over 2500 hours. This work establishes a new paradigm for regulating proton transfer and offers a viable route for the efficient, durable degradation of gaseous PFAS. Catalytic breakdown of highly persistent fluorinated pollutants is hindered by limited proton availability and catalyst degradation. This study shows that in situ proton-supplying sites enable low-temperature, long-lasting decomposition of stubborn PFAS gas."

Using a detailed risk analysis in Europe, the authors show that the affected networks and expected annual damage will increase considerably with global warming. 
 European coastal regions host a dense transport network that supports various human activities and well-being. However, global warming is expected to increase coastal flooding risk, whose impact on existing and planned European transport systems remains unknown. Here we present the fully probabilistic assessment of coastal flood risk to Europe’s surface transport infrastructure at different levels of global warming. Under baseline conditions (1980–2020), we find 1,592 km of networks are affected annually, causing expected annual damage of up to €722 million. Roads are projected to be more affected than railways in all countries. Passenger and haulage transport within the low-elevation coastal zone are currently overwhelmingly road dependent, which signals potential for widespread disruptions unless transportation modes change. With 1.5 °C warming, the Europe-wide expected annual damage may reach €1,108 million, and with 4 °C, it is projected to be as high as €1,487 million. Adaptation expenditures will increase with every fraction of global warming in most countries.

 Regional climate simulations provide essential high-resolution information for climate services. This study evaluates future changes in mean climate and 10 extremes using three generations of the NARCliM (NSW and Australian Regional Climate Modelling) project, which downscale CMIP3, CMIP5, and CMIP6 models. Projections show statistically significant increases in maximum and minimum temperatures across all NARCliM generations, with consistent spatial patterns. The magnitude of warming is primarily influenced by driving GCMs and emissions scenarios. In contrast, precipitation projections exhibit greater variability between generations, reflecting model and scenario differences and underscoring the challenge of projecting future precipitation. Extreme heat indices are projected to increase across Australia, with consistent spatial patterns and stronger changes under higher emissions, indicating more frequent and severe extreme heat events. Precipitation extremes display more variability across regions, model generations, and scenarios, although certain trends are robust. The intensity of very extreme rainfall (above the 99th percentile) is projected to increase, as is the maximum length of dry spells. Conversely, the maximum length of wet spells and the number of heavy rain days are expected to decrease. NARCliM2.0 specifically suggests shorter wet periods and fewer heavy rain days, but more intense extreme rainfall. These findings demonstrate the relative robustness of temperature and its extremes compared to precipitation and emphasize the value of broader GCM ensembles in future downscaling efforts to improve confidence in regional projections."

 Archean ocean marine primary productivity may have been limited by biologically available nitrogen. Due to low molybdenum abundances, early biological nitrogen fixation is thought to have relied on alternative nitrogenases that incorporate vanadium or iron instead of molybdenum. Here, we examine nitrogen fixation in a Cyanobacteria-dominated, ferruginous, low-sulfate, low-molybdenum lake, which replicates biological and chemical conditions relevant to early marine primary productivity. Nitrogen fixation occurs even when molybdenum is <1 nM, 100x less than the abundance in modern oceans. Molybdenum additions did not increase nitrogen fixation rates, indicating that diazotrophs were not molybdenum limited. Only the molybdenum-iron nitrogenase was detected in metagenomes and metatranscriptomes, indicating that the alternative nitrogenases were not required. We suggest that low sulfate (<1 μM) and/or efficient uptake mitigated molybdenum limitation. These results indicate that molybdenum bioavailability may be strongly controlled by sulfate and that alternative nitrogenases are not essential for nitrogen fixation at low molybdenum.

 The shelf areas of the Arctic Ocean host some of the world’s most productive marine ecosystems, yet their under-ice early-season phenology and inter-trophic dynamics remain poorly understood amid rapid climate change. Addressing these knowledge gaps, we assembled a data-driven biophysical model integrating high-resolution ocean physics with biological dynamics across ice algae (Nitzschia frigida), Arctic copepods (Calanus glacialis), and fish larvae (Boreogadus saida, reliant on C. glacialis nauplii). The model accurately recreated observed spatio-temporal production and recruitment patterns and revealed how the northern Barents Sea’s unique geography and ocean-climate facilitate key habitat and phenological synchrony, yielding large-scale biological export across the bio-region. Consequently, these geographically linked multi-trophic adaptations appear highly vulnerable to climate-forced shifts—e.g., proportion of C. glacialis in zooplankton is reduced up to 26% per 1 °C increase—as open-water area rises and ice-associated production and habitat degrades. Our findings thus provide timely insights for anticipating ecosystem disruptions from ongoing ice loss.

PiggyBac transposable element derived 5 (PGBD5) is an evolutionarily conserved vertebrate DNA transposase–derived gene with DNA remodeling activities in human cells. Here, we show that PGBD5 contributes to normal brain development in mice and humans, and its deficiency causes disorder of intellectual disability, movement disorders, and epilepsy. In mice, Pgbd5 is required for the developmental induction of postmitotic DNA breaks and recurrent somatic brain genome rearrangements. In the cerebral cortex, loss of Pgbd5 leads to aberrant neuronal gene expression, including of specific types of glutamatergic neurons, which partly explains the features of PGBD5 deficiency in humans. Thus, PGBD5 is a transposase-derived gene required for brain development in mammals."

Using chromosome-scale genomes from newly sequenced spiders and the whip scorpion, we integrate evidence from macrosynteny and phylogenetic analyses to provide further strong support for a whole-genome duplication (WGD) event that occurred during early Arachnopulmonata evolution. Following this event, theabdominal-Agene pair not only exhibits functional divergence but also jointly facilitates the emergence of spinnerets. Furthermore, we integrated single-cell transcriptomic analyses and functional validation to confirm that thedachshund-1gene also regulates spinneret development. The network of duplicated gene pairs may form a cornerstone in the origin and evolution of key morphological traits, revealing that the long-term effects of ancient WGDs on innovation and diversification also occurred in arthropods."

However, it is not fully understood how cortical circuitry changes during adolescence. Here, we performed a comprehensive super-resolution mapping of dendritic spines in layer 5 extratelencepharic-projecting (L5 ET) neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex in mice. In adults, the dendritic spines are highly enriched in the middle compartment of the apical dendrites (spine density “hotspot”), where dendritic calcium spikes are generated. In early development, dendritic spines are evenly distributed. During adolescence, however, the spine density increases specifically in the middle compartment of the apical dendrites in an experience-dependent manner, while other dendritic compartments show a slight reduction. Furthermore, spine accumulation at the hotspot was specifically impaired in mouse models of schizophrenia, demonstrating a link between adolescent spine formation and neuropsychiatric disorders. Our finding suggests that the dendritic compartment-specific spine formation during adolescence shapes nonlinear dendritic integration in L5 ET neurons and supports the maturation of cognitive functions."

As a critical step, the rearrangement of short-range ordered aluminosilicate networks enriched with five-membered rings, coupled with geometric matching to the cylindrical micelles of the bolaform organic structure-directing agent, synergistically drives the development and closure of curvature-induced interfaces, ultimately leading to the formation of single-walled zeolitic nanotubes. The proposed mechanism provides a distinctive understanding into structure-directing behaviors for ordered porous materials.

Activation is achieved through the interaction of ToxR or TcpP with the α–C-terminal repeat domain of RNAP where a single residue of the activator, a phenylalanine, appears to be the most critical contact, as confirmed by mutagenesis. No interactions of the transcription factors were observed with other subunits of the RNAP, i.e., the σ subunit as it occurs in the structurally related PhoB family of two-component transcription factors.

Here, we identify that specific cysteine residues in the FYVE domain of PsAF5 sense cellular redox states to form and resolve disulfide bonds in a redox-dependent manner. Under reducing conditions, PsAF5 undergoes redox-dependent phase separation to form cytoplasmic condensates that are functionally decoupled from mitophagy execution. Under oxidative conditions, PsAF5 exhibits increased cytosolic solubility and enhanced interaction with PsATG8, thereby promoting mitophagy.

Using mixed-MW HA and PL to model this difference between healthy and OA synovial composition, we found interfacial lamellar structures form under healthy-like conditions, while hybrid vesicles predominate in OA-like conditions. At physiologically relevant shear rates, lamellar assemblies maintain ultralow friction, whereas vesicles are removed, causing a tenfold friction increase. These findings provide mechanistic insight into how HA-PL structural organization controls lubrication.

The Hippo pathway effectors YAP and TAZ impede this process, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate how YAP/TAZ regulate transcription of the adipocyte lineage specification factor PPARγ and its target genes at the chromatin level. TAZ represses PPARγ-bound target enhancers as evidenced by a markedly reduced histone H3 acetylated at lysine-27 occupancy, resulting in the transcriptional repression of adipogenic genes, includingPparg2. Single-nucleus genomic analyses of mouse adipose tissue further revealed that YAP/TAZ activation drives extensive epigenetic modulation. Notably, the repressive effect of TAZ on adipogenic enhancers requires TEAD-dependent transcriptional activity, but not a direct interaction with PPARγ through the WW domain as previously reported. Last, we identified Vestigial-like 3 (Vgll3) as a transcriptional target of TAZ critical for repressing adipogenic enhancers. These findings reveal that the YAP/TAZ-VGLL3 axis regulates adipocyte fate by repressing the PPARγ program at its target enhancers."

Elaborating molecule-level self-assembly via supramolecular engineering could generate performance materials that exhibit high strength at mild temperatures. However, the entropy penalty of assembled materials, meanwhile, compromises robustness at elevated temperatures. Herein, we report that simply replacing two carbons with disulfide bonds in poly(urea)s enables unprecedented structural reconfigurability without trading off material robustness. Introducing disulfide bonds maintains the ordered urea-based H-bond assembly in bulk polymers while simultaneously suppressing secondary crystallization of these H-bonded arrays and offering secondary H-bonding sites by forming S─S·H─N interactions. This two-atom structural change revitalizes semicrystalline homopoly(urea) materials by allowing chain mobility and reconfiguration below melting temperatures to enable thermoplastic-like (re)processability and thermoset-like robustness, including more than 2-gigapascal storage modulus, a broad creep-resistant temperature range (up to 150°C), ceramic-like hardness, and resistance to common solvents.

Conventional methods, relying on circularly polarized light, face weak chiroptical signals and potential photodamage. Despite extensive efforts to improve sensitivity under low-photon exposure, classical chiral probes remain fundamentally bound by the shot noise limit due to quantum fluctuations. To beat these limitations, we demonstrate quantum-elevated chiral discrimination using continuous-variable polarization-entangled states as moderate–photon flux, high-sensitivity, quantum noise–squeezed chiral probes. We achieve a 5-decibel improvement beyond the shot noise limit in distinguishingl- andd-amino acids in liquid phase.

Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis, a prototype of these autoimmune synaptic disorders, is unexpectedly common. Unfortunately, how the native repertoire of anti-NMDAR autoantibodies recognizes NMDARs and the precise locations of antigenic epitopes remain poorly understood. Here, we used an active immunization model that closely mimics the human disease to immunize adult mice with intact GluN1/GluN2A receptors, resulting in fulminant autoimmune encephalitis. Serum was collected at 6 weeks postimmunization for single-particle cryo–electron microscopy of GluN1/GluN2A receptors complexed with purified polyclonal anti-NMDAR autoantibody fragments. Native autoantibodies recognized two distinct binding sites on the GluN1 amino-terminal domain, which we confirmed using monoclonal antibodies bound to native NMDARs purified from mouse brain.

Traditional polymer-hydroxyapatite composites, typically limited up to 40 wt % hydroxyapatite, offer only modest mechanical improvements. Efforts to enhance strength by using stiffer polymers have largely failed, as increased polymer stiffness does not translate to improved composite mechanics. In contrast, natural bone’s load-bearing capability arises from the synergy between citrate, soft collagen, and ultrathin hydroxyapatite nanocrystals (~3 nanometers). Here, we show that elastic poly(octamethylene citrate) enables up to 60 wt % hydroxyapatite incorporation, mimicking the bone’s mineral content.

The central A16/G9/J5 heterotrimer forms the fusion core, stabilized by conserved PXXCW and Delta motifs, and anchors two A28/H2 adaptor dimers linked to peripheral G3/L5/A21/O3 scaffolds.

An additional component, F9, binds peripherally to J5, A21, and H2 through Delta-like motifs, reinforcing the prefusion architecture.

Dawson,"A new, high-resolution global reef island database (GRID) with implications for coastal vulnerability","Low-lying coral reef islands support millions of people throughout the world's oceans but face increasing threats from rising sea levels, storms and coastal change. This study created the first global map of more than thirty-four thousand reef islands using publicly accessible global spatial and environmental data. The results reveal where islands are most vulnerable and where they remain more resilient, helping communities and governments plan for future climate impacts. 
 Low-lying reef islands (LRIs) are among the most climate-vulnerable landforms on Earth, yet no globally consistent and spatially comprehensive inventory of these islands has previously existed. This is especially important to underpin assessments of future risk and resilience. To address the absence of a unified global dataset, this study develops the first Global Reef Island Database (GRID), a detailed spatial product that identifies the global distribution of LRIs and collates their key geomorphological, environmental and exposure characteristics. Using the UNEP-WCMC Global Island Database (GID2.1), global coral reef distribution layers and the AW3D30 digital elevation model, all landmasses < 30 km² located within 1 km of coral reef and below a conservative mean elevation threshold of 16 m were identified. A total of 34,404 LRIs were mapped accounting for nearly 11,000 km2 of land area and over 60,000 km of shoreline. The vast majority (77 %) are very small (< 0.1 km2) highlighting their geomorphological sensitivity. GRID demonstrates strong agreement with observed island counts (R2 = 0.939; ICC = 0.984) and outperforms commonly used shoreline datasets in identifying small islands while preserving accurate geospatial alignment. LRIs are concentrated in Asia and Oceania, with Indonesia (14 %), Japan (12 %) and French Polynesia (10 %) containing the largest numbers. For each island, eight intrinsic variables (including land area, elevation, shape, population and isolation) and ten extrinsic variables (including wave and tidal climate, bathymetry, tropical storm exposure and projected sea-level rise) were compiled to build a globally standardised dataset suited for vulnerability analysis. The GRID demonstrates clear spatial clustering in external forcing variables: wave exposure is highest across mid-ocean atolls, tropical storm density peaks in the northwest Pacific and Caribbean, and projected sea-level rise rates are greatest around the northern Philippines, Japan and Central America. Finally, this study develops an island vulnerability index using the GRID. Approximately 16 % of LRIs are classified as very highly vulnerable, particularly throughout the northwest Pacific and northern South China Sea. National-scale assessments reveal that countries such as China, Japan and the Northern Mariana Islands are at highest risk. It is anticipated that thus far the most comprehensive yet unified database can support a variety of reef island research including climate adaptation planning, conservation and hazard mitigation efforts and coastal erosion studies. The final dataset has been made publicly available at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.986811 (Dawson 2025)."

Using high-resolution environmental data, the scheme defines parameterized flow units, enabling water and energy flux simulations. Compared against a benchmark simulation, the multiscale scheme demonstrates strong agreement in spatial mean, standard deviation, and temporal variability, showcasing its potential for large-scale hydrological simulation. 
 Groundwater is critical in the hydrological cycle, impacting water supply, agriculture, and climate regulation. However, current Land Surface Models (LSMs) often struggle to accurately represent the multiple spatial scales of subsurface flow primarily due to the complexity of incorporating sufficient and yet efficiently surface heterogeneity, which significantly influences subsurface dynamics. Accurately modeling this heterogeneity requires substantial computational resources, often making it challenging to achieve in practice. This study introduces a multiscale approach to address this limitation. The approach leverages the hierarchical clustering scheme of the HydroBlocks model to define hydrologically similar areas that the model uses to capture local, intermediate, and regional flow dynamics within regional units, which interact laterally based on hydraulic gradients and soil properties. The proposed method is compared against a benchmark simulation with 1.4 million modeling units – 34 times the number of tiles in the multiscale experiment. The results show consistency in spatial distribution and a Pearson coefficient of correlation above 0.80 for the temporal variability of hydrological variables such as latent and sensible heat flux, surface runoff, and effective saturation at the root zone, demonstrating its ability to represent subsurface flow patterns adequately. The scheme, however, struggles to adequately represent volumetric water content at the bottom of the soil column, as evidenced by lower correlation coefficients, where the misrepresentation of elevation heterogeneity may play a larger role. This multiscale approach offers a computationally efficient way to incorporate detailed subsurface processes into large-scale hydrological simulations, improving our understanding of water cycle dynamics and supporting informed water resource management."

The ISIMIP (The Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project) groundwater sector combines multiple global groundwater models to capture a range of possible outcomes and reduce uncertainty. Initial comparisons reveal significant differences between models in key metrics like water table depth and recharge rates, highlighting the need for structured model intercomparisons. 
 Groundwater serves as a crucial freshwater resource for people and ecosystems, playing a vital role in adapting to climate change. Yet, its availability and dynamics are affected by climate variations, changes in land use, and abstraction. Despite its importance, our understanding of how global change will influence groundwater in the future remains limited. Multi-model ensembles are powerful tools for impact assessments; compared to single-model studies, they provide a more comprehensive understanding of uncertainties and enhance the robustness of projections by capturing a range of possible outcomes. However, to date, no ensemble of groundwater models has been available to assess the impacts of global change. Here, we present the new Groundwater sector within ISIMIP, which combines multiple global, continental, and regional-scale groundwater models. We describe the rationale for the sector, the sectoral output variables that underpinned the modeling protocol, and showcase current model differences and possible future analysis. Currently, eight models are participating in this sector, ranging from gradient-based groundwater models to specialized karst recharge models, each producing up to 19 out of 23 modeling protocol-defined output variables. To showcase the benefits of a joint sector, we utilize available model outputs of the participating models to show the substantial differences in estimating water table depth (global arithmetic mean 6–127 m) and groundwater recharge (global arithmetic mean 78–228 mm yr−1), which is consistent with recent studies on the uncertainty of groundwater models, but with distinct spatial patterns. We further outline synergies with 13 of the 17 existing ISIMIP sectors and specifically discuss those with the global water and water quality sectors. Finally, this paper outlines a vision for ensemble-based groundwater studies that can contribute to a better understanding of the impacts of climate change, land use change, environmental change, and socio-economic change on the world's largest accessible freshwater store – groundwater."

We present a regional coupled ocean-atmosphere model setup for Europe, tailored to provide consistent climate change information for the North and Baltic Seas. The simulation effectively captures the mean climate, variability, and extremes such as storm surges and marine heatwaves. Using this setup, we will contribute climate projections to EURO-CORDEX. 
 Evaluation results from the reanalysis-driven (ERA5/ORAS5) simulation for the years 1979–2021 with a regional coupled ocean–atmosphere model (ROAM) are presented. The coupled setup portrayed here is one of the first regional climate modeling systems to couple the ICON atmosphere model in climate limited-area mode (CLM) with the ocean model NEMO for the North and Baltic Sea (NBS), using a flux-based OASIS3-MCT coupling approach. Along with the simulation using the coupled model configuration ROAM-NBS, the simulations with the uncoupled components (ICON-CLM and NEMO-NBS, respectively) are analyzed and compared with various observational datasets. ROAM-NBS complements atmosphere-only climate projections with the same atmospheric model and setup, which will all be published in accordance with EURO-CORDEX specifications. Climate projections by ROAM-NBS will enrich the data available to support the German Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change (DAS), especially for our target region, which are the German national waters.In general, the mean model climate is well represented by all setups. The sea surface temperature (SST) bias is, on average, about ±0.5 K. Differences in fluxes and precipitation over the ocean between the coupled and uncoupled simulations are largely related to SST differences. However, the mean influence on the land areas is negligible. The evaluations of ocean variables indicate a strong agreement between ROAM-NBS and NEMO-NBS. Compared to observations, both simulations overestimate sea ice concentration and extent. Mean temperature and salinity profiles in the Baltic Sea are generally reproduced by both simulations, with biases in the deeper layers. Major inflow events are captured but underestimated. Sea surface height and storm surge highly coincide with observational data, with NEMO-NBS slightly outperforming ROAM-NBS in terms of correlation. The marine heat wave (MHW) evaluation against observations in the North and Baltic Sea demonstrates that the simulations capture the inter-annual variability of MHW characteristics.Overall, the coupled simulation demonstrates adequate performance for both the atmosphere and the ocean, and the setup will be used to produce coupled regional climate projections for Europe. However, bias correction for the deeper Baltic layers remains necessary for further applications, and future work will focus on refining the setup for this region."

We present a number of challenges associated with concentrated viscous deformation and demonstrate strategies to overcome them. The strategies include automatic selection of appropriate time steps to react to rapid changes in model behavior, automatic rescaling to avoid rounding errors, and three methods to prevent model instability. This way, we are able to accurately capture very fast viscous deformation. 
 Strain localization is among the most challenging mechanical phenomena for computational Earth sciences. Accurately capturing it is difficult because strain localization initiates spontaneously, is self-accelerating, and its characteristic length and time scales are typically significantly smaller than the spatial and temporal resolutions of the model. This results in an undesirable dependence of the model behavior on numerical parameters and comes at a large computational cost. Strain localization is most commonly associated with brittle failure, but processes such as thermal runaway can also result in rapid ductile localization.  Here, we present a numerical model to investigate thermal runaway, and propose strategies to overcome the challenges associated with resolving rapid localization: (i) adaptive time stepping; (ii) adaptive rescaling; (iii) viscosity regularization; and (iv) gradient regularization. We demonstrate the effect of these strategies in one- and two-dimensional models. We rely on the accelerated pseudo-transient method to solve the governing equations and use graphics processing units to accelerate two-dimensional computations.  Our adaptive time stepping strategy allows us to accurately capture spontaneous and rapid stress release during thermal runaway while reducing time steps by more than ten orders of magnitude. Adaptive rescaling further reduces rounding errors and the number of required iterations by two orders of magnitude. Viscosity regularization and gradient regularization enable us to mitigate resolution dependencies but may differently impact the physical response of the model. Viscosity regularization results in lower slip velocities, whereas gradient regularization results in lower temperatures and broader shear zones."

Conventional recycling techniques typically produce low-value materials, failing to recover the inherent chemical potential. This study presents an upcycling strategy that converts copper from hazardous waste etchant directly into a highly active (Pb,Mn)-doped Cu2O electrocatalyst. This catalyst exhibits exceptional activity for C–N coupling between nitrate pollutant and biomass-derived acetone to produce acetoxime, a valuable chemical, with 97.94% selectivity. Advanced spectroscopic techniques and density functional theory calculations reveal that such high activity originates from the synergistic effect of Pb/Mn-doping and oxygen vacancies in the catalyst, which facilitates the formation of the *NH2OH reaction intermediate via an •H-mediated hydrogenation process. Techno-economic analysis confirms a substantial profit of over $1500 per ton of acetoxime produced. The general applicability of this methodology is demonstrated by its successful extension to 31 distinct industrial waste sources.

Proteome-wide association analysis identified 209 proteins significantly associated with ozone exposure across three exposure windows, including 74 proteins for short-term, 52 for intermediate-term, and 125 for long-term. Moreover, comparative analyses of proteins associated with three exposures revealed that longer ozone exposure magnifies proteomic effects. The ozone-related proteins were significantly enriched in biological pathways related to coagulation, vesicle trafficking, and nucleotide metabolism and have previously been linked to a variety of diseases, such as cardiovascular, respiratory, immune, and metabolic diseases. Collectively, our findings offer a proteome-wide perspective on the biological mechanisms underlying ozone toxicity, supported by evidence from a Chinese cohort."

As a result, nontire uses such as footwear, gloves, seals, and construction materials remain poorly quantified, leaving a critical gap in understanding their growing contributions to resource demand, stock accumulation, and waste generation. Here, we develop a 45 year dynamic material flow analysis (1978 to 2022) of rubber in China that covers 12 virgin rubber types, 7 product categories, 8 application sectors, and 7 end-of-life pathways. The model also accounts for fillers, chemical additives, and microrubber particle releases during use. Results show by 2022, nontire products reached 22.5 Mt·yr–1 (67% of total consumption), driving rapid growth in special use synthetic rubbers (SSR) and thermoplastic elastomers (TPE). In-use rubber stocks in nontransportation sectors accumulated to 156.2 Mt (89% of the national total), indicating substantial future waste streams. Yet, only 27% of recycled rubber came from nontire products, reflecting persistent barriers in collection, sorting, and processing. These results demonstrate the growing significance of nontire uses and underscore the need for upstream material innovation, clearer classification and statistics, and downstream sector-specific waste management to close rubber loops and reduce environmental pressures."

Herein, machine learning (ML) was employed to design catalysts with SO2 resistance. A multidimensional data set containing 242 data points was constructed, including elemental descriptors, catalyst structures, reaction conditions, and SO2 poisoning conditions. Regression models such as XGBoost (XGB) were trained to predict NOx conversions and SO2 resistance over different catalysts. It was found that the electronegativity descriptor (EN.) was the critical factor influencing NOx conversions in the presence of SO2, with approximately a monotonic positive correlation trend with NOx conversions within the range of 0.7–0.8. Based on these findings, quaternary CeMoFe/Ti catalysts were further synthesized via an inverse design. It was observed that this catalyst could still maintain 60% NOx conversion in the presence of SO2 after  6 h at 250 °C, wherein the SO2 resistance was significantly improved compared to ternary CeMo/Ti (∼40%) and binary Ce/Ti (∼4%) catalysts. In addition, the ML revealed the core roles of EN. in the design of SO2 resistance catalysts, breaking through the limitations of traditional ternary catalyst systems.

In this study, we evaluate a family of Fe(III) complexes and their corresponding molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) as efficient, green catalysts for the oxidative degradation of representative dyes: methyl orange, methylene blue (MB), and malachite green (MG). In solution studies revealed that the nature of the ligand influences the relative contributions of radical-mediated and high-valent Fe(V)═O oxidation pathways, enabling tunable reactivity. The most active complexes were used as templates to generate water-compatible MIPs that combine adsorption with Fenton-like degradation. The best performing MIPs were those containing the bis(2-pyridylmethyl)amine complex (Fe-BMPA@MIP), prepared either without pH adjustment (ca. pH 3) or at pH 6. Both achieved 65–98% dye decolorization in 3 h while minimizing iron leaching and converted MB and MG into lower molecular weight products with reduced cytotoxicity. A test in MB-spiked paper-mill effluent further confirmed near-complete decolorization by Fe-BMPA@MIP under realistic conditions.

Whether phytoplankton can directly produce RDOC has remained untested. Here, we show that two ecologically contrasting diatoms, Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Chaetoceros sp. DS1, intrinsically release RDOC that persists against microbial degradation. Between 21 and 36% of direct diatom-released DOC is biorefractory (operationally defined as DOC resistant to microbial degradation over 90 days), molecularly enriched in sulfur-containing compounds, and distinct from microbially reprocessed RDOC. Comparative analyses against a global ocean DOC molecular data set reveal that diatom-released RDOC signatures are ubiquitous throughout the water column, from surface to abyssal depths, accounting for a substantial fraction of oceanic DOC. We roughly estimate that direct diatom RDOC production can contribute 0.2–2.2 Pg C yr–1 in global oceans, representing an important and previously underappreciated contribution to oceanic carbon storage. These findings confirm phytoplankton as direct and globally significant contributors to recalcitrant carbon storage, expanding the framework of ocean carbon sequestration."

Quantitative dose–response relationships obtained from NAMs are often dichotomized into categorical outcomes (toxic/nontoxic), introducing uncertainty and potential misclassification in hazard characterization because the applicability domain of NAMs is currently constrained to the medium-hydrophobicity segment of the chemical universe. Until physicochemical limitations to the testability of (super)hydrophobic chemicals are overcome and hydrophilic and charged chemicals are tested at higher doses than  is present practice, “no response” should not be equated with an absence of toxicity. Toxicity is not categorical─it is the dose that makes the poison. Data gaps for difficult-to-test chemicals can be filled with baseline toxicity predictions. Baseline toxicity is the minimum toxicity, but it is often a robust predictor. Persistence constitutes a hazard criterion in its own right. Combining persistence with toxicity into a “persistent toxicity” metric may provide a more integrative indicator of the hazard potential. Persistent toxicity indicators measured with NAMs could play a pivotal role in comparative hazard assessment for substitution chemicals and the development of safe and sustainable by design (SSbD) chemicals."

We compiled four data sets encompassing cytotoxicity in CHO and HepG2 cells, developmental toxicity in zebrafish embryos, and genotoxicity in CHO cells, covering 227 DBPs with standardized endpoints (LC50, EC50). By unifying these data sets and incorporating endpoint-specific parameters (cell type, exposure duration), our model achieved robust predictive performance (R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 0.44), outperforming single-endpoint models (R2 = 0.41–0.73). To expand applicability, we implemented semisupervised learning with a hybrid acquisition function balancing structural similarity and prediction uncertainty, increasing coverage of structurally similar compounds by 18%. Predictions on untested DBPs revealed that several unregulated classes, particularly iodinated acetonitrile, halogenated diones, and halobenzoquinones, exhibit 2–10× higher toxicity than regulated trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids. Notably, haloacetonitriles dominate cytotoxicity and genotoxicity rankings, whereas halobenzoquinones show elevated developmental toxicity. This integrated framework, strengthened by external validation, provides a robust tool to prioritize toxic DBPs, guiding monitoring strategies and informing regulatory standards for safer drinking water."

Mediation analysis suggested that a panel of metabolites, including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), fumaric acid, and sphingolipids, accounted for a substantial proportion of the association between noise exposure and tinnitus severity (indirect effect = 92%, p < 0.001). Lipidomic profiling indicated early sphingolipid perturbations, followed by patterns consistent with T helper 1 (Th1)–skewed immune activation and lower circulating GABA, outlining a putative “Exposure–Metabolism–Immunity” cascade. A CatBoost predictive model trained on these features stratified tinnitus severity with 84.8% accuracy and a mean absolute error of 0.174.

We conducted a longitudinal study to investigate the dynamic changes in pharyngeal and gut microbiota before, during, and after acclimatization to the Mount Qomolangma region (high-altitude, 4300–5200 m above sea level, m.a.s.l.). Twenty healthy participants underwent four health visits: at baseline level (Beijing, 50 m.a.s.l.), upon arrival at the high altitude, after a week of acclimatization, and upon return to the baseline level. Throat swabs and fecal samples were collected for 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to assess microbial composition and diversity. Linear mixed-effects models were employed to estimate the altitude-associated variations in pharyngeal and gut microbes compared to the baseline. Pharyngeal microbial diversity showed statistically significant alterations after 1 week at high altitude, with the Shannon index decreasing by 12.0% (95% CI: −21.8 to −2.9%) and the Simpson index increasing by 2.6% (1.3 to 4.0%). In contrast, gut microbial diversity decreased upon initial high-altitude exposure but tended to revert to baseline after 1 week of acclimatization. Beta diversity analyses revealed significant differences in pharyngeal microbiota across visits, while gut microbiota differences were less pronounced. Using the linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) method, we identified 11 pharyngeal and four gut microbes that were differentially abundant across visits, which could shape the host’s resilience to high-altitude challenges. Our study reveals that high-altitude exposure disrupts pharyngeal and gut microbial diversity over time and modulates the abundance of some opportunistic pathogens. These shifts may mediate host responses to hypoxic environments, underscoring the microbiomes’ role in physiological acclimatization."

 The high prevalence of diabetes mellitus-induced erectile dysfunction (DMED) in males and the limited efficacy of existing therapies necessitate deeper mechanistic insights. We identify pathological lactate accumulation in the corpus cavernosum as a major driver of DMED in male mice, promoting structural degeneration and smooth muscle cell loss. Mechanistically, transcriptional repression and functional impairment of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (Fbp1), a rate-limiting gluconeogenic enzyme, underlie this lactate accumulation. Epigenetic profiling revealed suppression of Fbp1 transcription associated with histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation. Palmitoylation at the FBP1 Cys282 residue, catalyzed by zinc finger DHHC-type containing 13, further disrupted its gluconeogenic function, exacerbating lactate accumulation. To rescue these defects, we engineered lipid nanoparticles loaded with the Fbp1-C282S mutant mRNA, restoring FBP1 expression, blocking pathological palmitoylation, and ultimately improving erectile function in diabetic male mice. Here, our study in male mice identifies cavernosal lactate accumulation as a central pathological factor, elucidates its molecular regulation, and provide a targeted therapeutic strategy for DMED.

Here the authors reveal distinct roles of TPP1 and POT1 in telomerase recruitment and telomere protection using siingle-cell telomerase activity assay. 
 Telomeres are proposed to alternate between “closed” states, in which chromosome ends are protected from DNA damage signaling and inaccessible to telomerase, and “open” states, where they become accessible for telomerase mediated elongation but less protected. Whether these states reflect distinct molecular mechanisms or mutually exclusive structural conformations remains unclear. Here, we develop a single-cell assay to monitor telomerase activity in mouse embryonic stem cells. Using this approach, we demonstrate that the shelterin component TPP1 is essential for telomerase recruitment via its interaction with TIN2, independently of POT1. In contrast, POT1 is dispensable for telomerase function but required for telomere end protection, acting independently of TPP1. These findings challenge the classical open-closed telomere model and reveal that telomerase recruitment and end protection are mediated by genetically and molecularly separable mechanisms. Telomeres need to open from a close state which protects the chromosome ends to allow extension by telomerase.

 Biomolecular condensates are essential for cellular organization, yet their formation dynamics and molecular content exchange properties remain poorly understood. Here we show that flow cytometry provides a high-throughput, solution-based platform for analyzing condensate behavior at the single-droplet level. Using self-interacting NPM1 condensates as a model, we demonstrate that this approach quantifies phase behavior across protein and salt conditions, measures the partitioning of diverse macromolecules—including antibodies, lipids, small-molecule drugs, and RNA—and detects molecular colocalization with high statistical precision. Importantly, we establish a high-throughput assay to track real-time molecular exchange between preformed condensates and newly added, orthogonally tagged protein. These measurements reveal that condensate aging significantly reduces molecular dynamisms, likely due to altered biophysical properties with time. Compared to conventional imaging techniques that require surface immobilization or complex instrumentation, our method enables rapid, quantitative characterization of condensate dynamics and molecular content, providing a scalable framework for probing condensate function.

Operando spectroscopy and theoretical calculations indicate that Ag attracts *NO2 intermediate as well as promotes the reconstruction of CdO into low coordinated CdCO3 that facilitate the activation of CO2, thus benefits *CO/*NO2 adsorption and coupling at low overpotential as well as suppresses the generation of CO and NH3 by-products. Traditional urea production is energy-intensive and emits large amounts of CO2. Here, the authors report an Ag/CdO catalyst with tandem dual sites that electrosynthesizes urea efficiently from nitrate and CO2 by steering reaction pathways and suppressing by-products."

Here, the authors show that in fruit flies, a hormone released from the productive organs increases and sustains sexual drive through a feedback loop with the brain. 
 The interplay between the nervous and reproductive systems, encapsulated by the brain-gonad axis, is pivotal for reproduction. However, it remains largely unclear how hormones released from reproductive system actively regulate male sexual behaviors and mating strategies. Here we find that sexual priming induces an elevated sexual drive in both male mice and Drosophila, triggered by the surge of circulating steroid hormones 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) in flies and testosterone in mice, respectively. In Drosophila, 20E is released from the male reproductive system upon sexual priming, which is controlled by a descending brain-gonad pathway composed of P1 neurons, Dsk neurons, and Crz/CrzR neurons. In return, 20E activates P1 neurons to elevate and sustain male flies’ mating drive. The enhanced mating drive not only fosters consequent mating success but also makes full use of the reproductive materials prepared during the pre-ejaculatory emission stage, e.g., seminal proteins which would otherwise be potentially harmful to males’ gonads. Collectively, our study offers insights into how hormones regulate males’ reproductive strategies. Reproduction is influenced by the brain-gonad axis, but how hormones actively control male behavior is unclear. Here, the authors show that in fruit flies, a hormone released from the productive organs increases and sustains sexual drive through a feedback loop with the brain."

Here, the authors show that, in embryonic stem cells, the pluripotency factor OCT4 promotes early activation of normally late-firing replication origins by increasing local chromatin accessibility. 
 DNA replication initiates at specific genomic regions known as initiation zones (IZs), which follow a defined spatiotemporal program that is partially dependent on cell type. Here, we examine the replication-initiation patterns of pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), which are characterized by a very short G1 phase and rapid entry into S phase. Using EdU-seq combined with cell-cycle synchronization and Repli-seq, we identify IZs that activate during S phase in mESCs and classify them as early, mid, or late according to the replication-timing (RT) domain to which they map. Remarkably, we find that some IZs mapping to mid or late RT domains activate within 1–2 hours of entry into S phase. Chromatin and nascent-transcriptome profiling reveal that these IZs associate with regions of open chromatin structure that are bound by the pluripotency factor OCT4. Transient OCT4 depletion reduces both chromatin accessibility and replication-initiation efficiency at these sites. These results provide an example of a pioneer factor, OCT4, facilitating DNA replication initiation by promoting local chromatin accessibility. DNA replication follows a precise temporal schedule that varies across cell types. Here, the authors show that, in embryonic stem cells, the pluripotency factor OCT4 promotes early activation of normally late-firing replication origins by increasing local chromatin accessibility."

Here, authors present mechanistically guided residual learners that integrate mechanistic knowledge and machine learning to enable continuous, reliable battery state tracking over the entire lifespan. 
 Battery monitoring requires high accuracy and robustness throughout the entire lifespan to ensure safe and optimal operations. Here we introduce mechanistic leading residual learners to enhance the monitoring of battery charge and health states, as well as guide safety warnings, targeting large-scale applications. Leveraging prior knowledge from real-time filtering as primary guidance, complemented by mechanistic and statistical features, our approach significantly improves accuracy and robustness. We propose and validate two general residual learning pipelines, namely the correction model and compensation model, across various scenarios, encompassing different battery types, loading profiles, aging conditions, and environmental conditions, using three aging datasets under dynamic cycling. Our method achieves a relative root mean square error reduction of over 50% from the results observed in prior estimations. The extrapolation capability under unseen conditions, along with interpretability, enhances both accuracy and trustworthiness. The models remain effective even with reduced training data and sampling frequency, maintaining the potential for practical electric vehicle applications. Application demonstrations confirm the efficacy in providing continuous monitoring across lifespan without the need for offline testing and model calibration during operation.

Incorporating the latest works on ocean science and economics, researchers show that accounting for the potential damage would almost double the social cost of carbon estimation. 
 Oceans provide essential benefits to people and the economy, underpinned by the extent and condition of marine ecosystems and infrastructure—or ‘blue’ capital. However, the impacts of climate change on blue capital have been largely overlooked in influential indicators such as the social cost of carbon (SCC). Here we integrate the latest ocean science and economics into a climate-economy model, capturing climate change impacts on corals, mangroves, seaports, fisheries and mariculture to estimate their welfare repercussions at a global scale. Conceptually, this ocean-based SCC (blue SCC) represents a component of the total SCC currently omitted in standard estimates. We estimate the 2020 blue SCC to be US$48 per tCO2 (US$38–70, 25th–75th percentile) with baseline discounting, representing an almost doubling of the SCC estimate from the same model without considering ocean-related impacts. The blue SCC increases to US$168 for a discount rate of 2%. Oceans provide essential ecosystem services to human society, yet the climate impacts on blue capital have long been ignored. Incorporating the latest works on ocean science and economics, researchers show that accounting for the potential damage would almost double the social cost of carbon estimation."

Donat,Data-driven seasonal climate predictions via variational inference and transformers,"Data-driven seasonal climate predictions via variational inference and transformers 
 Most operational climate services providers base their seasonal predictions on initialised general circulation models (GCMs) or empirical statistical techniques. GCMs are widely used but require substantial computational resources, limiting their capacity. In contrast, statistical methods often lack robustness due to the short historical records available. Recent works propose machine learning methods trained on climate model output, leveraging larger sample sizes. Yet, many of these studies focus on prediction tasks that may be restricted in spatial or temporal extent, thereby creating a gap with existing operational predictions. Others fail to disentangle the sources of skill in the context of climate change, where strong trends provide spurious estimates. This study combines variational inference with transformers to predict global and regional seasonal anomalies of temperature and rainfall. The model is trained on output from CMIP6 and tested using ERA5 reanalysis data. Temperature predictions demonstrate skill beyond the climatology and climate-change trend and even outperform the numerical state-of-the-art system SEAS5 in some ocean and land areas. Precipitation forecasts show more limited skill, with fewer regions outperforming climatology and fewer surpassing SEAS5. Furthermore, the consistency found in both teleconnections and skill spatial patterns against SEAS5 suggests that both systems build on similar sources of predictability."

 Under global climate change, precipitation variability and extreme events pose significant challenges to regional ecological security and water resource management. This study proposes the Dynamic Line Scanning Method (DLSM) to quantitatively assess the migration of China's 800 mm precipitation isohyet during 1961–2022. Using long-term precipitation data, we systematically examined its spatial and temporal variation, explored links with drought–flood regimes and extreme precipitation, and identified the main drivers. Results indicate that the isohyet experienced a two-phase shift: an initial southward retreat followed by accelerated northward movement after 2001, with the latter trend markedly intensifying. These shifts have directly influenced regional drought–flood patterns and altered the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events. Analysis further reveals that the East Asian Summer Monsoon Index (EASMI) is the dominant factor driving the isohyet's movement. Overall, this study provides novel methodological insights and robust empirical evidence regarding the dynamics of precipitation isohyets in China in the context of climate change. The findings enhance understanding of hydroclimatic variability and offer a scientific foundation for developing region-specific adaptation and water management strategies."

We found that obesity induced Nod-like receptor pyrin domain–containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome hyperactivation and excessive interleukin (IL)–1β production in macrophages by disrupting SAM and HD domain–containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), a deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) hydrolase crucial for nucleotide balance. This caused aberrant accumulation of dNTPs, which can be transported into mitochondria, and initiated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) neosynthesis, which increased the presence of oxidized mtDNA and triggered NLRP3 hyperactivation. Deletion of SAMHD1 promoted NLRP3 hyperactivation in cells isolated from zebrafish, mice, and humans. SAMHD1-deficient mice showed elevated circulating IL-1β, insulin resistance, and metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis. Blocking dNTP mitochondrial transport prevented NLRP3 hyperactivation in macrophages from obese patients and SAMHD1-deficient mice. Our study revealed that obesity by inhibiting SAMHD1 rewired macrophage nucleotide metabolism, thereby triggering NLRP3 inflammasome hyperactivation to drive disease progression."

However, the cells that express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I–related protein 1 (MR1) and present microbial vitamin B–derived antigens (VitBAg) to MAIT cells remain unknown. We found that MR1 expression varied across tissues and cell types. Macrophages from the lung and peritoneal cavity expressed the highest levels of MR1 and were the most efficient at capturing and presenting VitBAg to MAIT cells. Expression of MR1 in macrophages was regulated transcriptionally and induced by the tissue environment and microbiota. Depletion of MR1 in macrophages, dendritic cells, and monocytes changed the composition of the microbiota and impaired MAIT cell responses against bacterial infection. We concluded that macrophages are key for MR1 antigen presentation and MAIT cell immunity."

Moreover, HS-MAPbBr3films with 100.0% PLQY eliminate self-absorption losses and achieve an EQY of 91.4%, approaching the theoretical maximum.

Field investigations showed that fish populations of lake skygazer (Culter dabryi) with chronic low-dose chlorpyrifos loads had shortened telomeres and truncated age structures. Laboratory experiments confirmed that chronic low-dose chlorpyrifos exposure induced telomere degradation and reduced survival in a dose- and physiological age–dependent manner, whereas acute high-dose exposure did not. Together, these studies provide evidence that chronic low-level chlorpyrifos exposure reduces life span and population viability in a wild fish by accelerating physiological aging. Given the pervasive presence of low pesticide concentrations in the environment and the conserved mechanisms of aging across vertebrates, these findings raise concerns that even low doses of pesticides may pose long-term risks to longevity."

Here, we investigated the role of coastline geometry and paleogeographic boundary conditions in shaping extinction risk for shallow-marine taxa over the past 540 million years. We show that interactions between the geographic distributions of taxa and the geometric configurations of continental margins consistently predict relative extinction risk: Taxa with potential dispersal pathways that are long relative to the range of latitude traversed—such as those that occur along east-west–oriented coastlines, islands, or inland seaways—consistently exhibit higher extinction risk than taxa with potential dispersal pathways that provide more direct latitude-traversing paths. This dispersal distance selectivity is amplified during mass extinction events and hyperthermal intervals, suggesting that geographic constraints become more important during periods of rapid climate change. Our results provide another mechanism that potentially contributes to the generally elevated extinction rates during the Paleozoic, an interval characterized by complex inland seas and a preponderance of east-west coastlines. These insights underscore the importance of considering paleogeographic context when interpreting past extinction patterns and provide empirical support for assumptions that underlie extinction risk assessments of extant species."

The co-occurrence of these flood drivers is generally assumed to exacerbate the resulting flood impacts, a result referred to as compound flooding. However, few observational or modeling studies have investigated the circumstances under which this occurs. Here, we study the impacts of these combined flood drivers and evaluate the implicit hypothesis of official flood maps, which is that rainfall has a negligible impact on the flood depth and flooded area due to a 100 year coastal flood. A coastal system model, configured to capture coastal and pluvial flood drivers, is used. We evaluate the flooding for different urban landform types, including coastal landfill (human-made land), convergent areas (topographic depressions) and other urban terrain, within a model domain covering the Jamaica Bay watershed of New York City. A scenario-based strategy is adopted with a 100 year coastal flood as a control simulation, to which we add a set of realistic scenarios of rainfall data from historical tropical cyclones. We also apply a joint probability analysis framework with historical data to evaluate the probability of these compound coastal-pluvial scenarios. Results reveal cases where the pluvial driver compounds the coastal flood through expansion of the flood zone, with a 17% chance of rainfall increasing the flood area by 6%–38%, and a 5% chance of an increase of 61%–73%. It is rare that floods are significantly deepened but when deepening occurs, it is more common for the convergent zone than for the coastal landfill. These findings quantitatively assess the potential of the pluvial driver to exacerbate flooding, which may influence emergency management strategies such as evacuation plans, shelter arrangements, and related preparedness measures."

To evaluate their actual impact, this paper analyzes trade regulations on high-deforestation commodities under three scenarios: two based on EU measures and one exploring a globally coordinated implementation of import regulations on countries with high deforestation risk (HDR). We use a policy assessment framework based on MAGNET, a global general equilibrium model, to analyze the impact on trade, production and land use change. Our results indicate that EU-only measures can substantially reduce HDR imports into the EU, but the global impact remains limited given the EU’s modest share of world demand for products from countries with HDR. By contrast, a globally coordinated regulation targeting HDR countries would expand forest land in these countries and substantially reduce their production and trade, while shifting these activities to other parts of the world."

At the same time, advocates of impact-based accounting argue for global REC markets, purposefully abandoning deliverability in favor of enabling cost-effective displacement of fossil power generation. At this point, the extent to which claims by individual e-fuel producers diverge from actual emissions under different potential regulations remains unclear. This study uses a hypothetical e-methanol case to investigate (1) how accounting requirements of different policy regimes affect the accuracy of inventory emissions, and (2) how these reported values compare with emissions estimated under an impact-based accounting perspective. Our results show that hourly energy matching is needed for accurate inventory accounting. When production is not aligned in time and place with renewable generation, reported emissions increase substantially. If RECs are non-additional, emissions can be 14–28 times higher than stated for hourly energy matching under inventory accounting, with carbon intensities exceeding those of the fossil reference fuel, stressing the critical role of additionality. Out of six scenarios, only hourly energy matching results in methanol that can be considered renewable according to EU regulation (i.e. below 28.2 gCO2e/MJ). Impact-based accounting shows potential for larger reductions, up to almost three times the inventory emissions when based on RECs from regions with high marginal emission factors. However, these reductions do not influence the company’s inventory and should be treated as complementary to it. Thus, to ensure accurate inventory claims, deliverability and additionality are crucial. Although based on a single e-fuel producer, the findings can apply broadly to other electricity consumers."

 A compilation of in situ temperature and salinity profiles south of 45° S is assembled, drawing from multiple data centers and sensor sources. This database is then used to create a new Southern Ocean climatology, adopting an interpolation scheme that takes into account ocean depth and mean ocean dynamics, influenced by methods developed for the Southern Ocean Atlas. This interpolation scheme is designed to consider along flow spatial coherency and the distinct dynamic regimes between Antarctic shelf seas and the Southern Ocean. Initial exploration of the profile compilation investigates the type of variability timescales one could reasonably start to analyze in different sectors around Antarctica. A comparison between the climatology product and the World Ocean Atlas climatology, the most used product to date, indicates that the OCEAN ICE climatology provides significant improvements in Antarctic shelf seas, including a more detailed representation of the unique water masses they host.

This study aimed to elucidate the interaction between HBQs and DNA, which may represent a critical initial molecular event in the adverse outcome pathway toward carcinogenesis. By combining high- and low-resolution mass spectrometry (MS), we developed a highly selective and sensitive analytical strategy integrating pentose neutral loss and information-dependent acquisition to characterize trace-level HBQ-DNA adducts in complex biological matrices. Deoxyguanosine (dG) was identified as the primary target of HBQs, and in vitro reaction revealed 16 mono-, di-, and trihalogenated 1:1 and 2:1 (mol:mol) adducts, including HBQ-dG, HHQ-dG, HPH-dG, and HBQ-HPH-dG (HHQ and HPH denoted halohydroquinone and halophenol, respectively). The stepwise formation involved HBQ-HHQ interconversion, cyclization of OH or halogen in HBQ with N1 and N2 in dG, and ether bond formation between HBQ and HPH. Four adducts were identified in reaction with calf thymus DNA, and in particular, 1-Cl-3-OH-PH-6,5-N1,N2-dG was identified in human urothelial cells SV-HUC-1.

We evaluated the molecule-to-population responses of the zooplankton Brachionus asplanchnoidis to leachate from retired 18650 cells across single-generation exposure, postexposure recovery, and multigenerational propagation and tested whether monosodium glutamate (MSG) accelerates recovery. Rotifers were exposed to 5% (volume/volume, v/v) leachate and assessed for morphological, feeding, life-history, population, metabolomic, biochemical, and gene-expression end points. Chemical profiling confirmed elevated Li, Fe, Al, Co, Ni, and Mn above seawater background. Leachate suppressed growth and feeding within and across generations, and poststress recovery was asynchronous, with feeding rebounding faster than body size and life-history traits. In multigenerational assays, the exposure lineage collapsed by F4, whereas recovery lineages showed progressive improvement, approaching control levels by ∼F6 in the transgenerational lineage and by ∼F4 with MSG supplementation. Metabolomics revealed 189 differential metabolites and distinct exposure–recovery signatures centered on amino acid and energy metabolism. Gene expression supported metallothionein-mediated detoxification under the measured metal burden. By integrating short- and long-term perspectives, this study demonstrates multilevel toxicity, incomplete and phased recovery, and the potential of targeted nutritional support to enhance resilience and poststress performance, informing mixture-aware environmental risk assessment of LIB leachate."

Moving beyond conventional metal–CO2 interaction strategies, we demonstrate a powerful alternative pathway through atomic-level engineering of zeolite oxygen electronic states. Incorporating Ce into the mordenite (MOR) framework generates electron-rich lattice oxygens and spatially polarized Oδ−–Ceδ+–Oδ− domains within the channels. These unique electronic features endow the resulting Ce-MOR with exceptional CO2 uptake, even at high Si/Al ratios (∼8). Spectroscopic analyses and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that strong Ce 4f–O 2p orbital coupling redistributes electron density, creating robust trapping sites. The electron-rich Oδ− atoms serve as primary binding centers, synergizing with adjacent Ceδ+ to enable dual CO2 adsorption pathways: Cδ+(CO2)···Oδ− (framework) and Oδ−(CO2)···Ceδ+. Furthermore, by assembling Ce-MOR crystals into a binder-free monolith, we achieve enhanced mass transport and mechanical stability, translating the intrinsic adsorption advantages of Ce-MOR into superior dynamic CO2 capture performance under realistic flow conditions. This work offers a novel perspective on designing practical, high-efficiency physisorbents by tailoring electron-rich anionic centers and integrating them into scalable monolithic architectures."

Acidic conditions maintained by nitrification can enhance digestion efficiency, but at short hydraulic retention time (HRT), nitrifiers are washed out. Here, we utilized a biofilm-based solution to retain nitrifiers and produce in situ free nitrous acid (HNO2) to expedite WAS stabilization and reduce pH. Two laboratory-scale sludge digesters were operated for over one year to evaluate this approach. This process reduced pathogen levels to well below the Class A biosolids standard within an extraordinarily short HRT of 1.75 days. Furthermore, it achieved a high volatile solids (VS) reduction rate of 0.87 ± 0.13 kg/m3/d. Model-based analysis indicated the biofilm-based digester achieved both a higher hydrolysis rate (k) (0.58 ± 0.07 d–1 vs 0.51 ± 0.13 d–1) and a greater extent of VS degradability (fd) (31 ± 2% vs 21 ± 2%) compared to the suspended sludge digester. Microbial community analysis revealed that biofilms enriched ammonia oxidizers and acid-tolerant heterotrophs, underpinning enhanced HNO2 production and sludge degradation.

We assessed associations between water interruptions and various outcomes. Among 237 households in Malawi, we conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire and tested drinking water for generic and cefotaxime-resistant Escherichia coli (CREC). Water interruptions in the past month were reported by 32.5% of households; interruptions were unpredictable and more common in piped supplies. Households with interruptions were 3−5 times more likely to be water-insecure, skip laundry and handwashing after handling animal feces (p-values < 0.05). Most water samples came from storage, and 65.7% harbored E. coli and 8.4% harbored CREC; households with vs without interruptions had similar fecal contamination. Children <5 years experiencing interruptions had increased caregiver-defined diarrhea (prevalence ratio [PR] = 1.85, 1.02−3.37) and ARI with fever (PR = 1.98, 1.09−3.57). Rare (1−2/month) interruptions were associated with diarrhea and antibiotic use; frequent (≥3/month) or long (above-median duration) interruptions with ARI. Frequent or short interruptions were associated with stress. Our findings highlight respiratory risks from water interruptions and suggest that interruption frequency and duration may influence enteric vs respiratory pathogen transmission through distinct mechanisms.

To examine this association, a total of 12,130 children aged 3 to 5.5 years were included from 226 kindergartens in Shanghai, China. Neurodevelopment was assessed using the Chinese version of the Ages & Stages Questionnaires-Third Edition, and individual residential noise exposure (LAeq, 40 min) was estimated using a land-use regression model. Higher noise exposure was associated with lower performance in communication, motor, and problem-solving domains. Specifically, each interquartile range [4 dB(A)] increase in noise exposure was significantly associated with a decrease in gross motor scores (0.25, 95% CI, 0.04–0.47) and an increase in the suspected developmental delay (SDD) odds (OR = 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01–1.15) and domain-specific delays, particularly in communication (OR = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01–1.27) and gross motor (OR = 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03–1.19).

However, whether and how probiotics interact with PFBS to maintain the host’s endocrine equilibrium are unknown. Herein, juvenile zebrafish (Danio rerio) were chronically exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of PFBS during the critical window of gonadal differentiation and maturation (from 21 days postfertilization (dpf) until 150 dpf), with or without dietary supplementation of probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus. At 35 dpf, probiotics robustly acted to alleviate PFBS body burden and regulate the toxic fingerprints of PFBS on the sex ratio, estrogen hormones, sex differentiating genes, and estrobolome dynamics. In mature adults, PFBS induced antiestrogenic effects in females, thus forming a male-biased population, accompanied by oogenesis blockade, reduced fecundity, and offspring developmental defects. However, these adverse effects were efficiently counteracted by probiotic supplementation, which was attributed to the holistic activation of the reproductive axis and marked increase of estrogen concentrations. In the gut microenvironment, probiotics mitigated the PFBS-induced disturbance of estrogen-metabolizing bacteria, β-glucuronidase enzyme activity, and critical metabolites along the pentose and glucuronate interconversion pathway, thus directing estrogen gut-liver recycling. Overall, our findings highlight the far-reaching implications of probiotics beyond the gut to mitigate endocrine disrupting effects, suggesting a health intervention strategy based on gut estrobolome remediation."

However, the highly diverse molecular composition of wastewater, arising from various emission sources, presents a major challenge to deciphering the underlying biochemical reactions. Herein, nontargeted analysis and paired mass distance (PMD) analysis were conducted in paired influent–effluent samples from 11 wastewater treatment plants to elucidate contaminant diversity and transformation reactions across different treatment processes. In total, 418 structural subclasses of contaminants were classified, among which amino acids, peptides, and analogues (AAPAs) were the most common. Although the total number of features, subclasses, and overall abundance decreased in effluent samples, chemical diversity did not show a consistent reduction. This finding was primarily due to the removal of contaminants such as AAPAs and the persistence of aromatic compounds such as benzenoids. Transformation reactions were highly conserved across biological processes, with methylation and demethylation occurring the most frequently. High-frequency PMDs were strongly associated with carbon-related transformations, which substantially altered the polarity of transformation products. Furthermore, transformation reactions were characterized by small mass shifts and intrastructural reactions, indicating that most contaminants did not undergo extensive structural transformations. This study provides insight into common patterns of contaminant removal across wastewater treatment processes, benefiting transformation product prediction and wastewater treatment process optimization."

Lithium titanate (LTO) is structurally robust and chemically selective yet remains electrochemically inactive under aqueous conditions. In contrast, manganese-based spinels exhibit strong redox activity but suffer from structural degradation. Here, we report a site-selective doping strategy that integrates the strengths of both material classes by incorporating Mn into the spinel framework of LTO. Crystallographic, spectroscopic, and electrochemical analyses reveal that Mn substitution of specific lattice sites modulates both Li+ transport pathways and redox-active centers, enabling enhanced intercalation kinetics and electronic conductivity without compromising the structural integrity of the crystal lattice.

Guest,The Potential of Thermomechanical and Thermochemical Processes to Enable Sustainable Household Sanitation,"Biological processes underpin centralized wastewater treatment but are difficult to deploy at a small scale. Thermomechanical and thermochemical approaches could enable household-level sanitation, yet their economic and environmental potential remains unclear. We assessed two prototype household reinvented toilets (HRTs), with either pasteurization mechanical dewatering (PMD) and supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) treatment processes, using integrated process simulation, techno-economic analysis, and life cycle assessment under uncertainty. The total annualized expenditures (including capital and operating) are 1.41–1.87 (5th to 95th percentiles) and 1.85–2.45 USD·cap–1·day–1 for PMD and SCWO, respectively, placing both at the high end of global centralized treatment prices. The life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions span 321–452 and 362–520 kg CO2-eq·cap–1·year–1 for PMD and SCWO, respectively, with the grid electricity contributing 87–90% in both HRTs. Poor solid–liquid separation disproportionately increases costs and GHG emissions for SCWO relative to PMD. In the short term, optimizing a few levers─number of users, flush water volume, and the detailed design of the SCWO unit─can significantly reduce cost and emissions. In the long term, operating at maximum efficiency reduces both cost and emissions by approximately 70%. Deployment in locations with low wage, low-carbon electricity, low price levels, and large household sizes offers the greatest potential, positioning HRTs as viable advanced decentralized sanitation options in specialized settings."

However, inherent challenges exist in capturing the in situ metabolic activity of phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) due to intrinsic cultivation biases and the disconnect between bulk metagenomic profiles and the functions of viable cells. Furthermore, a lack of research into the coupling  the phenotypic activity and adaptive genetic strategies of PSB in heterogeneous sedimentary environments  has led to limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying endogenous phosphorus release. Here,  using single-cell Raman spectroscopy coupled with deuterium oxide labeling (Raman-D2O), distinct in situ phosphorus-solubilizing activities of PSB inhabiting eutrophic, mesotrophic, and oligotrophic sediments were quantified. Inorganic PSB dominated in all sediment types but exhibited the highest activity in nutrient-rich eutrophic sites. Their activities correlated strongly with phosphorus speciation and release fluxes at the sediment–water interface of their habits. In contrast, organic PSB prevailed in oligotrophic sediments. Raman-activated cell sorting conbined with metagenomic sequencing uncovered that low-abundance taxa (e.g., Bacillus and Acinetobacter ) acted as disproportionate drivers of phosphorus mobilization. PSB from eutrophic sediments were enriched in genes encoding phosphatases and organic acid hydrolysis pathways, whereas their oligotrophic counterparts  favored genes related to high-affinity transporters and polyphosphate storage. These findings elucidate how nutrient regimes shape PSB metabolic traits, advancing mechanistic insights into microbial phosphorus dynamics in aquatic ecosystems and providing a theoretical basis for optimizing lake management strategies to mitigate endogenous pollutant-driven eutrophication risks."

Here, we adapt and validate the solution-friction analytical approximation (SF-AA) as a simple, closed-form, and physically grounded model for low-salt-rejection membranes across a wide salinity range. Using three low-salt-rejection membranes, including a highly “leaky” membrane prepared by controlled chlorination, we conducted experiments with NaCl solutions of up to 3.64 M to measure water flux, salt rejection, and salinity-dependent salt permeability. With only three intrinsic membrane parameters, the SF-AA accurately captures the dependence of salt transport on both feed concentration and permeate flux, substantially outperforming the conventional model. These results establish the SF-AA as a robust and generalizable model for LSRRO and other membrane processes with leaky membranes and high salinity."

We evaluated prenatal exposure to plastic-related chemicals and their associations with pregnancy outcomes using suspect screening analysis in 200 pregnant participants recruited between 13 and 27 weeks of gestation. We detected 441 chemicals in maternal serum samples (9 identified at confidence level 1 and 432 tentatively identified at level 2), using liquid chromatography–quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF/MS) with an in-house database of 5267 plastic-related chemicals. We compiled the in-house database with predicted spectra and RTs for 4272 chemicals without available spectra, improving the reliability of suspect screening. Three level 1 chemicals─1,3-diphenylguanidine, undecanedioic acid, and 1-octyl-2-pyrrolidone─and 230 level 2 chemicals have not been widely reported, with fewer than 10 publications in the existing literature. Among level 1 chemicals, an interquartile range increase in acetyl tributyl citrate, progesterone, diisobutyl phthalate, 8-hydroxyquinoline, and PFOS was associated with higher odds of preterm birth. PFOS and undecanedioic acid were associated with increased odds of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in logistic regression models adjusted for maternal age and race/ethnicity. We observed associations between four level 2 chemicals and GDM, and eight were associated with gestational hypertension. Exposure levels varied significantly by education, race/ethnicity, and nativity, with higher PFOS observed in participants with higher educational attainment and in non-Hispanic White groups. Our findings highlight novel chemical exposures and their associations with pregnancy complications, raising concerns about gaps in the monitoring of plastic-related chemicals and their potential impacts on maternal health."

Groundwater chemistry can contribute to lead leaching from water supply pipes due to factors such as pH and mineral content that influence corrosion. Lead exposure disproportionately affects children from low‐income neighborhoods. We evaluated the association of county‐level groundwater chemicals with the percentage of children with blood lead levels >5 μg/dL (BLL5%) in 1,104 US counties served by public water utilities using groundwater. Out of the 4,844 BLL5% observations, 3,525 had values of “NA” for BLL5%. We used weighted least squares regression to evaluate the associations, adjusting for covariates such as county‐level median household income, educational attainment, and poverty rates. Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) was used to assess the joint effects of all chemicals on BLL5%. Sensitivity analyses tested the robustness of our results by imputing missing BLL5% values. A one mg/L increase in arsenic, copper, dissolved oxygen, and selenium was associated with increases in BLL5% of 0.0512% (95% CI: 0.0002%, 0.1023%), 0.0358% (95% CI: 0.0208%, 0.0508%), 0.0956% (95% CI: 0.0225%, 0.1687%), and 0.3038% (95% CI: 0.1747%, 0.4420%), respectively.

It blends flexibility with rigidity, offers high sensitivity and wide range, withstands extreme heat and cold, with promise for integration in spacesuits. 
 Striking a balance between sensitivity and detection range while ensuring stability under extreme temperatures remains a formidable challenge in the design of flexible pressure sensors. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the multi-gradient architectures of nature and propose a bottom-up self-assembly strategy. By leveraging a meticulously orchestrated multi-step approach that encompasses electrospinning, sequential freezing, and thermal imidization, we successfully fabricate a polyimide nanofiber/carbon nanotube dual-gradient aerogel with a dynamic stiffness transition from flexible to rigid states. Experimental results highlight notable properties of the dual-gradient aerogel, which exhibits an ultralow density (0.023 g cm−3), efficient thermal insulation (28 mW m−1 K−1), and reliable compressibility and fatigue resistance. Moreover, it establishes a favorable equilibrium between sensitivity (156 MPa−1) and an extensive detection range (223 kPa). Notably, the combination of thermal resilience (−196 °C to 533.30 °C) and mechanical stability enables performance that is comparable to, or in some aspects surpasses, that of conventional flexible sensing materials. This dual-gradient aerogel provides both effective thermal insulation and high-precision physiological monitoring under extreme conditions, offering integrated thermal protection and real-time astronaut health assessment in spacesuits.

 Glasses linked by molecular building blocks are emerging materials promising for combining the processability of glasses and designability of reticular frameworks. Achieving modular chemical space construction is key to promoting structural diversity for these glasses, which requires systematically understanding their structures and properties. Herein, we combine rheological, thermal, compositional and total scattering techniques to study glasses and liquids based on titanium, zirconium and boron nodes, multi-dentate alcohol linkers and monodentate alcohol modulators and elucidate their structure-property relationships. With decreasing modulator, the node-linker-modulator series show increased connectivity characterized by increased viscosity and diminished heat capacity jump at glass transition, eventually giving glassy coordinative networks. By systematically tuning their compositions, we show the glass transition temperatures of these materials are affected by the interplay between non-covalent interactions and covalent network formation. The modular designability in alkoxide-based glasses is exploited for synthesizing fluorescent molecular network-forming glasses with high quantum yield, which can be integrated into electroluminescent devices. The current development represents an important expansion of reticular chemistry into the regime of glassy materials.

 Coupling of ribosomal translation with cotranslational protein folding is essential for cellular homeostasis. In eukaryotes, Hsp70 and its J-domain cochaperone, the heterodimeric ribosome-associated complex (RAC), are central to this process; however, mechanistic insights into the coordination of Hsp70 function with translation remain limited.

Together with detailed biochemical and mutational analyses, these structures enable us to delineate the intricate RAC-dependent cycle, which positions the substrate binding domain of Ssb-ATP close to the tunnel exit to receive nascent chains. This arrangement allows Ssb to undergo substantial conformational changes upon ATP hydrolysis without steric clashes with the ribosome, while the substrate binding domain of Ssb, now anchored by the tightly bound nascent chain, remains close to the tunnel exit.

Here, the authors show that DNA end configurations, particularly short microhomologies, dictate synaptic complex formation and can bypass XLF to promote close end joining. 
 Synapsis, the physical bridging of two broken DNA ends, is a critical step in non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ), the primary pathway for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in vertebrates. While NHEJ synapsis has been well characterized using blunt-ended DNA, how diverse DNA end configurations influence synaptic complex formation remains much less clear. Here, using single-molecule FRET, we show that end configurations play a decisive role in synapsis pathway choice, with end pairing compensating for XLF in facilitating synaptic complex transitions. Notably, 3-nucleotide (nt) microhomology at DNA ends significantly enhances close synaptic (CS) complex formation mediated by Ku70-Ku80 (Ku) and XRCC4-Ligase IV (X4L4), even in the absence of XLF. Although XLF is nonessential for synapsis with 3-nt microhomology, it further promotes CS formation when present. The FRET analysis reveals that the single-stranded and double-stranded junctions of the DNA ends are in close contact within the primary CS complex, while the overhangs flip out of the duplex, potentially stabilizing the complex. These findings underscore the pivotal role of DNA end configurations in regulating synapsis and their broader implications for NHEJ repair efficiency and fidelity. DNA double-strand breaks are primarily repaired by non-homologous end joining, which requires synapsis of broken DNA ends.

Here, the authors report that two mutations in the viral polymerase helped the virus to quickly adapt to cattle. Mutations increased the polymerase activity and made the virus better at replicating in human cells. 
 In 2024, an unprecedented outbreak of H5N1 high pathogenicity avian influenza was detected in dairy cattle in the USA resulting in spillbacks into poultry, wild birds and other mammals including humans. Here, we present molecular and virological evidence that the cattle B3.13 genotype H5N1 viruses rapidly accumulated adaptations in polymerase genes that enabled better replication in bovine cells and tissues, as well as cells of other mammals including humans. We find evidence of several mammalian adaptations in cattle including PB2 M631L, which is found in all cattle sequences, and PA K497R, which is found in the majority. Structurally, PB2 M631L maps to the polymerase-ANP32 interface, an essential host factor for viral genome replication. We show that this mutation adapts the polymerase to better interact with bovine ANP32 proteins, particularly ANP32A, and thereby enhances virus replication in bovine mammary systems and primary human airway cultures. We show that ongoing evolution in the PB2 gene, including E627K and a convergently arising D740N substitution, further increase polymerase activity and virus replication in a range of mammalian cells. Thus, circulation of H5N1 in dairy cattle allows virus adaption improving replicative ability in cattle and poses a continued risk of zoonotic spillover.

 The hole-electron resonance in two-dimensional WTe2 dynamically screens the built-in electric field, disrupting the scattering equilibrium constraints of conventional electron transport. Here, we propose utilizing the hole-electron resonance to achieve Coulomb force-unconstrained spin angular momentum transfer across the WTe2/Fe3GaTe2 interface, offering a novel platform for exploring unconventional spin transport phenomena. A clear signature of this mechanism is the observation of an unusual anisotropic magnetoresistance of 289%, which far exceeds conventional spin Hall magnetoresistance and cannot be explained by standard spin absorption or scattering models. Its angular profile deviates from the simple cosine-squared form but realigns after accounting for magnetization and field orientation, reflecting the interplay between hole-electron resonance and magnetization dynamics. Furthermore, chiral transverse transport with distinct symmetry transitions emerges within the hole-active temperature regime, originating from interfacial symmetry breaking and the inhomogeneous spin-orbital coupling. These findings highlight the essential roles of both electrons and holes in spin transport.

Here, authors show that higher temperatures activate numerous noncanonical PAMs, enabling a versatile one-pot platform that improves sensitivity, specificity, and rapid on-site pathogen detection. 
 The canonical PAM site TTTV (where V = A, G, or C) is widely used in the design of CRISPR-Cas12a systems for both genome editing and diagnostic applications. Although several non-canonical protospacer-adjacent motifs (PAM) have been identified, they generally exhibit weak Cas12a cleavage activity. In this study, we find that increasing the reaction temperature to 45 °C or higher allows the identification of numerous non-canonical PAMs with trans-cleavage activity comparable to that of canonical PAMs, while displaying only weak cis-cleavage activity. Moreover, we observe that combining these non-canonical PAMs with elevated temperatures significantly enhances the Cas12a system’s ability to discriminate highly similar sequences. Based on these findings, we develop a non-canonical PAM-mediated, poikilothermal, one-pot CRISPR-Cas12a detection platform (POP-CRISPR), which demonstrates substantial improvements in sensitivity, specificity, speed, and target adaptability for nucleic acid detection compared to existing methods. These advantages are validated through the reliable detection of clinical samples, including those of Human papillomavirus (HPV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP), and its drug-resistant strains. Additionally, we show that POP-CRISPR enables rapid, on-site pathogen detection within 20 min, using a fast sample processing protocol and a miniaturized detection device.

Using in vivo calcium imaging, we found that vGlut2BF neurons initially poorly encoded odor identity. However, their response to conditioned odors increased following associative learning, and their population activity more distinctly encoded paired stimuli, reflecting emergent value representation. Furthermore, pairing stimulation or inhibition of vGlut2BF neurons with specific odors altered odor preferences, suggesting that appropriately timed vGlut2BF neuronal activity is sufficient to influence valence assignment. Our findings reveal that vGlut2BF neurons transform sensory input into motivationally significant stimuli, positioning the BF as a key hub for linking sensory processing with motivational states and experience-driven plasticity. Neural mechanisms underlying motivation-driven behaviors are not fully understood. Here authors show that non-cholinergic neurons in rodent basal forebrain link sensory stimuli with motivational states and experience-driven plasticity."

A study now reveals deep inequality in household material footprints, especially for non-renewable resources, and suggests that curbing overconsumption among the wealthy is key to sustainability. 
 Growing global material consumption has pushed the Earth beyond safe planetary boundaries, yet little is known about how this burden is distributed across individuals. This study quantifies the inequality in household material footprints (MFs) using detailed global expenditure data from 168 countries, linked with a multiregional input–output approach. Results reveal stark inequalities: the top 10% consumers contribute 36% of global total household MFs, while the bottom 50% of consumers account for merely 18%. Inequality is especially pronounced in non-renewable resources such as metals and fossil fuels. Furthermore, elasticity analysis reveals a recoupling of resource use with high consumption, challenging the notion of absolute decoupling. These findings suggest that current sustainability policies about resource focusing on national efficiency gains may fall short without addressing the material-intensive lifestyles of the affluent. Targeting overconsumption at the top could reduce ecological overshoot and create space for sustainable development and material sufficiency for the global majority.

 Ocean acidification caused by climate change drives a spectrum of ecological impacts on the marine environment, while also posing a lurking threat to the traces of human history lying on seabeds. We present a quantitative assessment of the climate change risk to underwater cultural heritage, focusing on the vulnerability of historical stone materials to shifting ocean pH levels. We monitored the amount and rate of stone surface material loss and textural alteration triggered by natural processes of mineral dissolution and biodeterioration in submarine settings, combining field and laboratory experimentations with climate models. Stone deterioration has been minimal in pre-industrial and present times; however, escalating anthropogenic emissions might lead to an exponential surge in vulnerability, with irreversible decay processes accelerating in the next decades and centuries, constrained by material properties and shifting biofouling dynamics. Ocean acidification will dramatically challenge the protection of underwater cultural heritage, demanding urgent preservation and adaptation policies.

 The inland basins of western China are home to the world’s earliest definition of yardangs, which are streamlined, wind-sculpted landforms. The Qaidam Basin in northwestern China hosts one of the largest yardang fields on Earth, which has been regarded as the most Mars-analogue. However, basin-scale research on the timing and forcing mechanism of yardang formation in the Qaidam Basin remains lacking. In this study, we used electron spin resonance and optically stimulated luminescence dating to determine the tectonic-scale (106-year) spatiotemporal evolution of yardangs in the basin. Our results indicate that yardang development in the Qaidam Basin commenced around 0.8 million years ago, starting in the northwest and gradually expanding southeast around 0.5−0.3 million years ago. This stepwise expansion of yardangs correlated well with the remarkable growth of Northern Hemisphere ice-sheet, which intensified the Siberian High and enhanced cold, dry prevailing winds in the region.

 Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) have experienced a steep population decline globally, extirpated from 91% of their historical range, including Saudi Arabia. Information about cheetahs’ historic range remains scarce throughout much of its former habitat. A serendipitous discovery of seven naturally mummified cheetahs in several caves along with skeletal remains of 54 cheetahs, and their putative prey, in Saudi Arabia provided a valuable opportunity to elucidate the evolutionary history of cheetahs in their former range. We applied paleochronological dating to establish temporal context, genomic sequencing to infer subspecies present during different time periods, and radiographic analysis to determine age classes. The mummified cheetahs showed 14C calibrated ages dated 4223 ± 40 years BP to 127 ± 40 years BP. Full genome sequences of the mummified cheetahs showed that only the youngest individual clustered with A. j. venaticus while the older samples clustered with the West-African cheetah (A. j. hecki). We conclude that rewilding of cheetahs in Arabia can be sourced from the closest subspecies of the discovered cheetahs. Our results highlight the important role caves may play as repositories of ancient biodiversity informing, in the absence of benchmarks rewilding efforts.

The current anode modulation strategies such as tailored solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and lithiophilic host architectures can hardly simultaneously resolve all above issues, especially at high-capacity Li deposition. Here, we design a Li-rich, hollow ionic-electronic conductor (HIEC) interlayer, which integrates metallic Li encapsulation and interfacial protection, thus guiding highly reversible thick Li deposition (5 milliampere-hours per square centimeter). In addition, the built-in electron-deficient domains in the HIEC facilitate the formation of the hierarchical SEI and further mitigate active Li corrosion. These synergistic effects of the interlayer enable stable cycling in batteries under both anode-less and anode-free configurations, attaining >99% coulombic efficiency under industrial-level cathode loading and lean electrolyte conditions. This study highlights the significance of interlayers in integrating the SEI and host functions and provides a viable and scalable solution for energy-dense batteries."

We explored this question in the frame of X-chromosome inactivation, a process under strong selective constraint, governed by theXISTlncRNA and its cis-regulators. Using functional approaches on closely related primate species, we show thatXISTregulation has uniquely diverged over a short evolutionary timescale. In human and marmoset embryonic stem cells (ESCs), theJPXlncRNA gene is a major regulator ofXISTexpression. In contrast,JPXhas a minor effect onXISTin macaque ESCs, where it acts together with a macaque-specific enhancer. This occurs within a reshuffled 3D organization of theXISTneighborhood triggered by the insertion of a HERVK transposon in the macaque lineage. Retrospective sequence comparisons revealed that manyXISTregulators are not evolutionarily constrained, supporting the hypothesis that neutrally evolving noncoding elements harbor adaptive potential. These results illuminate how evolutionary recent elements are integrated into preexisting regulatory landscapes."

Functional prioritization and experimental validation highlighted the synonymous variant rs3935873 within the 16p11.2 GWAS locus strongly associated with an unannotated isoformDOC2A∆Val217-Pro218. rs3935873 was significantly associated with hippocampal volume, and hippocampal overexpression ofDOC2A∆Val217-Pro218in mice recapitulated schizophrenia-relevant behavioral deficits, phenotypes absent inDOC2AFull-Length-overexpressing mice. Overexpression of both isoforms altered excitatory synaptic transmission, structural modeling revealed divergent tertiary configurations between DOC2A∆Val217-Pro218and DOC2AFull-Length, and interactome profiling highlighted that DOC2A∆Val217-Pro218unique interactors are enriched in the myosin II complex and ankyrin binding, suggesting the acquisition of previously unknown structural and regulatory functions by DOC2A∆Val217-Pro218.

Traditionally, GABAergic input was considered as the gatekeeper; thus, receptors closest to the soma were ideally placed to veto excitation. However, recently modeling has advanced several counterintuitive hypotheses. Since laser uncaging can be directed at will to any position, we used photostimulation to show that inhibition near the sealed end of dendrites distal to excitation is more effective than inhibition near the soma in modulating excitation. Further, dendritic inhibition was found to be branch specific. Last, we demonstrate that inhibitory input from multiple thin basal dendrites can centripetally elevate to effectively tune distant excitation at the soma. These findings provide direct experimental evidence supporting theoretical predictions based on dendritic cable properties, revealing the critical role of dendritic geometry in shaping the interaction between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission."

We then rely on official country-level data to quantify the historical contribution of these components.

Here, we present a cell surface engineering strategy that reprograms the antifibrotic function of MSCs by constructing a pseudofibrotic extracellular matrix (ECM) on their surface. Through in situ self-assembly of peptide-modified hyaluronic acid, we generate a nanofiber-based matrix that mimics the dense, disordered architecture of fibrotic ECM. This matrix activates the Piezo1/PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, inducing up-regulation of Mmp13—a key collagen-degrading matrix metalloproteinase—in engineered MSCs. In a rat model of myocardial infarction–associated fibrosis, engineered MSCs exhibit robust antifibrotic activity compared to unmodified MSCs. These findings establish a bioinspired strategy for MSC reprogramming and offer a path toward more effective cell-based therapies for fibrotic disease."

However, the role of crotonate in cancer progression is unknown. Here, we present a crotonate–crotonyl–coenzyme A (CoA)–enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) crotonylation cascade blocking breast cancer growth and metastasis. We demonstrated that crotonate promotes EZH2 degradation via crotonyl-CoA–mediated crotonylation at Lys348in EZH2 (EZH2-K348cr). EZH2-K348cr leads to reduced genome-wide H3K27me3 (trimethylation of lysine-27 on histone-3) occupancy. Crotonate metabolizes to crotonyl-CoA by ACSS2 (acyl-CoA synthetase 2), and then, acyltransferase p300 catalyzes crotonyl-CoA and generates EZH2-K348cr. Crotonylated EZH2 triggers EZH2 ubiquitination and degradation. Administration of crotonate markedly inhibits breast cancer cell growth and metastasis via a crotonate-crotonyl-CoA-EZH2-K348cr cascade. In comparison, crotonate showed better blocking effect than EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat in suppressing breast cancer metastasis. The combination of crotonate and anti-PD-L1 (programmed cell death ligand 1) antibody enhances responses of breast cancer cells to immunotherapy. Together, our findings indicate that crotonate is a promising anticancer drug candidate that suppresses breast cancer growth and metastasis by specifically inducing EZH2 degradation."

Herein, an “inherited noninvasive intracellular recording” methodology was proposed, which was based on the fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) with microelectrode array (MEA)–electroporation system (AI-MEA-EP) to enable prolonged monitoring of intracellular APs in cardiomyocytes. It used MEA-electroporation (MEA-EP) for minimally invasive collection of intracellular signals transiently (~1 minute), as well as noninvasive recording of extracellular signals in long term. The recorded extracellular APs were converted into corresponding intracellular APs by a convolutional neural network–long short-term memory–based AI model enhanced by model self-calibration. The intracellular APs detected by the AI-MEA-EP exhibited high consistency with those physically obtained through MEA-EP. It was demonstrated to monitor cardiac intracellular AP under drug treatments and glucose challenging during >5 consecutive days. This method offers a unique solution to achieve prolonged recording of intracellular signals for advancing cardiac research."

Existing universal quantum algorithms typically rely on ideal and efficient query models (e.g., time evolution operator or block encoding of the Hamiltonian), which, however, become suboptimal for actual implementation at the quantum circuit level. Here, we present a full-stack design of quantum algorithms for estimating the eigenenergy and eigenstate properties, which can achieve high precision and good scaling with system size. The gate complexity per circuit for estimating generic Hamiltonians’ eigenstate properties isεO˜(logε−1), which has a logarithmic dependence on the inverse precision ε. For lattice Hamiltonians, the circuit depth of our design achieves near-optimal system-size scaling, even with local qubit connectivity. Our full-stack algorithm has low overhead in circuit compilation, which thus results in a small actual gate count (cnotand non-Clifford gates) for lattice and molecular problems compared to advanced eigenstate algorithms. The algorithm is implemented on IBM quantum devices using up to 2000 two-qubit gates and 20,000 single-qubit gates and achieves high-precision eigenenergy estimation for Heisenberg-type Hamiltonians, demonstrating its noise robustness."

Using just one to two slides, it enables both regional detection of biomarkers for diagnostic subtyping (≤16) and construction of multiplex tumor microenvironment (TME) maps. Joint analysis of multiregion diagnostic biomarkers in the TME map indicates that tumor cell subpopulations defined by specific diagnostic biomarkers can actively shape their in situ microenvironmental niche.

Utilizing reactive transport modeling, we demonstrate that CO2 leakage can markedly decrease the pH and thus elevate As concentrations downstream of the leakage point, primarily due to As desorption from adsorbents under acidified conditions. Results indicate that the extent of pH decrease and As enrichment is significantly attenuated in aquifers abundant in adsorption sites. Furthermore, we demonstrate that arsenic mobilization is redox-dependent, as the reduction of As(V) to As(III) under favorable conditions leads to arsenic scavenging, driven by the superior adsorption affinity of As(III) on aquifer minerals. Our findings highlight the critical importance of thoroughly characterizing both adsorption site density and redox potential to accurately assess the risks of CO2 leakage-induced arsenic contamination in groundwater systems. The identified geochemical controls provide a valuable reference for predictive modeling of As enrichment in carbon sequestration projects."

Conventionally, extracellular catalysis is primarily attributed to biotic enzymes. However, the contribution of abiotic processes to extracellular catalysis remains largely unquantified in terrestrial ecosystems, leading to inaccuracy in our understanding of soil carbon degradation potentials and responses to global changes. Here using a large-scale investigation across diverse ecosystems, assisted with validation experiments and laboratory simulations with commonly occurring soil minerals, we demonstrate that abiotic catalysis, primarily driven by iron- and manganese-containing minerals, contributes on average 43% (7–99%) and 54% (15–92%) of total oxidative and hydrolytic activities in soils, respectively. Moreover, unlike enzyme-driven catalysis that varies with environmental changes, abiotic catalysis maintains a constant activity under varying temperature, pH, microbial activity, and moisture conditions. Based on the large-scale soil survey results, we further reveal that abiotic catalysis plays particularly important roles in biologically unfavorable environments such as deep soils and wetlands where reactive minerals accumulate. Overall, our findings refine the current enzyme-centric paradigm and reveal the previously underappreciated role of abiotic catalysis in regulating soil carbon decomposition and climate feedbacks across terrestrial ecosystems."

Early onset liver cancer, diagnosed before the age of 50, is becoming prevalent, suggesting the potential influence of emerging environmental exposures. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants that have been linked to liver toxicity in humans and shown to cause hepatotoxic effects in animals, but their role in liver cancer remains unclear. This systematic review synthesizes evidence from animal and epidemiological studies to evaluate associations between PFAS exposure and liver cancer risk. PubMed and Embase were searched through November 2025 for studies on PFAS and liver cancer. Data were independently extracted by two reviewers, and quality was assessed using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines. Twenty-three studies (seven animal, 16 human) met inclusion criteria. Most studies focused on legacy PFAS, primarily perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). Animal studies demonstrated increased liver tumor incidence with high-dose PFAS exposure. Human epidemiological findings were mixed: three studies reported positive associations between PFAS and liver cancer, while others showed null associations.While animal studies strongly suggest hepatocarcinogenic effects of PFAS, epidemiological evidence remains inconsistent. Large, prospective studies with robust exposure assessment are needed to clarify these associations and inform public health policy."

A first version of the SciRAPepi tool was created, and an expert testing round was conducted to assess its scientific soundness and user-friendliness. Thirty-seven epidemiologists and risk assessors took part in the testing using the tool to evaluate four epidemiological studies representing the main epidemiological study designs. The majority of experts considered the criteria appropriate, and overall evaluations indicated good consistency across most criteria. Based on the testing results, the tool was further developed and refined. Together with the SciRAPepi tool, guidance and instructions on its use were developed, along with a reporting checklist to support researchers in reporting their studies.

However, nanoenabled agriculture must balance the proposed benefits with potential risks associated with material incorporation into soil matrices. This work establishes a full-process risk assessment profile for MoS2 encompassing precursor particles, exfoliated nanosheets, and dissolved ionic species using the soil invertebrate Eisenia fetida under exposure-recovery cycles. The results showed that although precursor MoS2 exposure at 5–50 mg Mo/kg for 7 days significantly activated (p < 0.001) earthworm lumbrokinase (9.4%), antimicrobial peptide (10.2–14.0%), and hemolysin (11.9%) levels compared to the control, the biota exhibited transient immune memory and persistence upon another 7 days of recovery. Once exfoliated to nanosheet form at a consistent 5–50 mg Mo/kg dose range, more pronounced ion release (3.8–6.4%) and prolonged in vivo accumulation (43.9–55.4% excluded) of MoS2 nanosheets mediated persistent immune-related gene initiation. Importantly, the filamentous extension of external DNA between immune cells and deterministic clustering of endosymbiotic microbial communities were shown to collaboratively establish the in vivo homeostasis after MoS2 nanosheet exposure. These findings mechanistically demonstrate the persistent stress on soil invertebrate immune systems under MoS2 nanosheet exposure and highlight the need to link nanoenabled agriculture to soil eco-sustainability."

For centuries, this process has been regarded as merely a process of charge redistribution without involving any redox reactions. By using NO3– reduction as a model reaction, this study demonstrated for the first time that water flow drives abiotic denitrification associated with streaming potential generation. The nitrate (NO3–) reduction rate reached 10.6 μmol·L–1·d–1, which is comparable to that of FeS-driven chemical NO3– reduction (75.0–380 μmol·L–1·d–1) and significantly higher than that of photochemistry-driven NO3– reduction (0.1–1 μmol·L–1·d–1). Through monitoring of nitrogenous products and 15NO3– isotopic experiments, we showed that NO3– was selectively reduced to nitrogen (99%) via nitrite and nitrous oxide, confirming a denitrification process. Electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR) spectroscopy using DMPO as the probe detected the generation of hydrogen radicals (H•), which served as the reducing force for NO3– reduction. Using TEMPO as the electron probe, linear electron production was observed with an electron efficiency of 6.3% for NO3– denitrification. Moreover, H218O isotope experiments demonstrated that water oxidation is the ultimate electron source for NO3– reduction, indicating a chemical-free NO3– reduction process. An electric field strength of approximately 106 V/cm was detected using surface-enhanced Raman scattering, providing evidence of a strong interfacial electric field (IEF)-induced electron transfer process during water flow. This work reveals ubiquitous but long-overlooked redox reactions associated with streaming potentials. Water-flow-driven denitrification also highlights a newly identified abiotic NO3– elimination pathway, suggesting potent chemical-free NO3– remediation strategies."

Here we reveal the critical yet overlooked roles of the adsorbent/adsorbate interfacial dynamics and nanoconfinement effects in governing HMC removal. Using UiO-66(Zr), a zirconium-based metal–organic framework (MOF), we demonstrate that interfacial proton transfer induces rapid acidification, decomplexing Cu(II)–carboxyl species into free copper ions and ligands. Nanoconfinement within UiO-66(Zr) octahedral cavities promotes ligand deprotonation and selective adsorption, while further released copper ions are precipitated via alkali treatment. This synergy achieves over 99.95% Cu removal, surpassing standalone methods. Fixed-bed column experiments validated its practicality, producing 1828 bed volumes of compliant water (<0.3 mg Cu/L) and enabling Cu recovery, outperforming individual components by 6–208-fold. Density functional theory calculations confirm stronger MOF interactions with deprotonated ligands than complexes, driven by electrostatic and Lewis acid–base interactions.

Convergence was limited: Only 16% of MP categories were shared (notably black fibrous PET), and high-density MPs consistently accumulated in sediments in both ecosystems. However, divergence was pronounced. Seagrass meadows acted as selective filters that facilitated sedimentation of larger MPs, leaving smaller fractions to dominate transport to reefs, where they accumulated on coral surfaces and tissues. Notably, biological selectivity altered this pattern internally: while small MPs were prevalent, coral tissues disproportionately accumulated large (1–2 mm), high-density transparent fibers, likely triggered by physical entanglement and prey-mimicking optical cues. Seagrass leaves intercepted high-density MPs on surfaces, whereas corals were highly susceptible to internal accumulation within tissues and skeletons. Furthermore, coral skeletons served as long-term archives sequestering diverse, predominantly high-density MPs, while seagrass leaves acted as short-term dynamic traps with significantly higher surface abundance. Specifically, surface accumulation was morphologically driven, whereas internal incorporation in corals was biologically regulated and decoupled from surface loads. Mechanistically, these patterns suggest that intrinsic biological modulation is the primary driver of MP heterogeneity between ecosystems. These findings highlight the need for habitat-specific risk assessments."

We use 549 P‐wave receiver function events at station AV.WACK and 223 at AV.WAZA to image the crustal structure beneath Mt. Wrangell in southcentral Alaska. We identify a prominent low‐velocity layer in the lower crust, approximately 4–9 km thick and 40 km wide, and a narrower low‐velocity layer at shallower depths. These observations suggest a large lower‐crustal magma chamber containing 9%–33% melt and a localized shallow reservoir with ∼10% melt, supporting the existence of a long‐lived, multi‐layered magmatic system.

How future change in coral reefs may affect coastal flooding, however, has been less attended than other factors contributing to increasing risks such as sea‐level rise and more intense storms. Here, the increased flooding hazard faced by Florida's coastal communities from the projected future degradation of its adjacent coral reefs is evaluated through oceanographic, coastal engineering, habitat, geospatial, and socioeconomic modeling. Risk‐based valuation approaches were followed to map flood zones at 10‐m2 resolution along 430 km of Florida's reef‐lined coast for the current and projected future coral reef conditions. The projected degradation of Florida's coral reefs can increase annual flooding to more than 8.77 km2 of land and 4,980 km of roads, affecting more than 7,315 people, $412.5 million in damages to 1,400 buildings, and economic disruption of $438.1 million annually (2024 US dollars). The degradation of Florida's coral reefs would increase the annual risk to people and structures by more than 42% and 47%, respectively, but is spatially variable due to the heterogeneous alongshore nature and distribution of the reefs and communities: the increased risk exceeds $1 million/km annually to more than 17% of the coastline but also disproportionately would affect vulnerable populations. These results help identify areas where coral reef protection could help reduce the projected increased storm flooding risk to Florida's coastal communities."

Here, the authors demonstrate a membrane-free CO2 hydrogenation electrolyzer that stabilizes pH and enables efficient and stable formic acid production. 
 Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) in acidic electrolytes minimizes CO2 loss and carbonate formation issues, allowing for high CO2 utilization efficiency and showing good potential for practical CO2 upgrading applications. However, in the membrane-based electrolyzer, the proton transfer efficiency across the membrane from the anolyte to the catholyte is crucial for the stability of the catholyte pH in acidic ECR, especially at high current density and during long-term electrolysis. Here, we investigate the effects of proton transfer efficiency and salt precipitation in different acidic ECR electrolyzer and propose a membrane-free CO2 hydrogenation electrolyzer, which couple CO2 reduction and hydrogen oxidation. This electrolyzer design effectively maintains a stable electrolyte pH during long-term electrolysis, and simultaneously achieves high Faradaic efficiency for HCOOH production, high single-pass carbon utilization efficiency, and a lower cell voltage. At a current density of 100 mA cm−2, the system requires only 1.7 V to achieve a 90% HCOOH Faradaic efficiency and demonstrates stable operation for 208 hours.

Here, authors present Af-CUT&amp;Tag, a chromatin profiling strategy based on CRISPR-integrated peptide tags which enables sensitive bulk and single-cell mapping of transcriptional regulators. 
 Conventional chromatin profiling techniques are often limited by antibody availability and performance. Here, we introduce Af-CUT&Tag, a target antibody-free method that overcomes these limitations by using CRISPR-integrated peptide tags (HiBiT/ALFA-tag) recognized by engineered binders (LgBiT/NbALFA) fused to a Tn5 transposase. Af-CUT&Tag eliminates dependence on traditional target antibodies, achieving robust specificity and sensitivity with as few as 500 cells. It provides high-quality chromatin profiles, with improved signal-to-noise ratios and library quality compared with conventional antibody-based counterparts, while also enabling single-cell resolution (scAf-CUT&Tag). Applying Af-CUT&Tag to Hippo effectors (YAP1/TAZ) during liver regeneration reveals dynamic chromatin remodeling, including YAP1/TAZ-mediated control of lipid metabolism (e.g., Lpin1, Fasn) and heme clearance (Hpx, Trf). We further identify miR-122 as a critical regulator of these processes, impacting liver regeneration.

 Base editors (BEs) enable precise base substitutions, but their size exceeds the packaging capacity of adeno-associated virus (AAV), impeding in vivo applications. Here we design a split BE system that recruits deaminases to Cas9 nickase via coiled-coil heterodimers, resulting in various coiled-coil heterodimers-mediated base editors (CC-BEs), including cytidine base editor (CC-CBE), adenine base editor (CC-ABE), and their derivatives. We reveal that CC-BEs maintain and even improve the editing efficiency of the original unsplit BEs across various cell types and editing scopes, achieving maximum enhancements of 9.6-fold in human immortalized cells and 12.4-fold in primary somatic cells for CC-CBE. Using CC-ABE, we validate in vivo editing efficiency and successfully achieve A-to-G conversion in the Pcsk9 and Dmd genes via dual-AAV vectors in mice. Altogether, we develop a simple and universal strategy to address the challenges posed by the large size of BEs without compromising editing efficiency for base substitutions in vivo.

 Diet plays a crucial role in health, with low-carbohydrate diets often proposed to exert metabolic benefits. We aim to investigate metabolomic adaptations in 164 adults with overweight or obesity who were randomly assigned to high- (n = 54), moderate- (n = 53), or low-carbohydrate (n = 57) diets during a 20-week weight-loss maintenance phase of the Framingham State Food Study [(FS)2], a controlled, parallel feeding trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02068885). We measure fasting plasma metabolites by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using samples from 147 participants who completed the study (n = 45, 48, and 54 in the high-, moderate-, and low-carbohydrate diet groups, respectively). Significant associations (False Discovery Rate<0.05) are identified between carbohydrate-to-fat ratio (CFR) and diet-induced changes in 148 of 479 metabolites at 20 weeks, with nearly all showing consistent trends at 10 and 20 weeks. Phosphatidylcholines plasmanyls/plasmalogens, phosphatidylethanolamines plasmanyls/plasmalogens, and sphingomyelins generally decrease with higher CFR, whereas lysophosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylethanolamines, and triglycerides generally increase. Our findings are largely reproducible in an independent feeding trial involving diets with similar CFR (Popular Diets Study, ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00315354). Eleven triglyceride species (≤3 double bonds), linked to type 2 diabetes risk, increase with higher CFR. Our findings demonstrate metabolomic changes caused by varying CFR dietary patterns, offering potential insights into mechanisms that could guide targeted dietary intervention strategies.

 Smc5/6 is an essential genome maintenance complex that interacts with double-stranded (ds) DNA, single-stranded (ss) DNA, and ss-dsDNA junctions. DNA association underlies Smc5/6’s functions in managing intermediates generated during genome replication and repair. However, the mechanisms of this activity are not fully understood. Here, we report a single-molecule study examining Smc5/6 association with a dsDNA substrate containing a ssDNA gap with defined 3’ and 5’ junctions. We found that Smc5/6 associates with both 3’ and 5’ junctions but prefers the 3’ junction in the presence of the ssDNA-binding complex RPA. Further, Smc5/6’s junction association frequency and dwell time are regulated by two non-SMC subcomplexes and DNA binding residues of Smc6. Moreover, Smc5/6 prefers binding to junction sites free of the sliding clamp PCNA over those occupied with it. These results suggest that Smc5/6 utilizes its multiple structural modules to associate with junction sites in coordination with other genome maintenance factors. Smc5/6 association with DNA junctions can support genomic functions.

 The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is a dominant mode of variability in the Northern Hemisphere with strong impacts on temperature, precipitation, and storminess. The predictive skill of the NAO on annual to decadal scales is therefore an important topic, which is often studied using (initialized) climate models. The temporal structure of a time series is closely related to its predictability, and on inter-annual time scales the observed NAO is frequently described to have power at 2–10 years and sometimes with a distinct peak around 8 years. However, the observational record is brief, and such estimates have high uncertainty. Here, we present a thorough study to address the following questions: (1) Is the winter mean NAO distinguishable from white noise? (2) Does the temporal structure of the NAO differ between observations and historical experiments with contemporary climate models (CMIP6)? To this end, we use a range of statistical tools in both the temporal and spectral domains: Power-spectra, wavelet-spectra, autoregressive models, and various well-known time series test statistics. Overall, for both the observed and modelled NAO we find little evidence to reject the null-hypothesis of white noise. For observations, the peak in the power spectrum near 8 years is, taken alone, significant in the period after 1950 but not before. However, considering the complete spectrum, significant peaks will often occur at some frequencies, even for white noise. The large CMIP6 multi-model ensemble is statistically very similar to an ensemble of similar size of white noise. These results suggest limited decadal predictability of the NAO."

 Southeast Asia faces rapid growth in energy demand and continues to depend heavily on coal-based generation, creating an urgent need for renewable alternatives that can be deployed at scale. Biomass residues from agriculture represent an abundant but underutilized resource in the region. This study develops a machine learning–based spatial economic framework to quantify biomass energy potential from paddy, oil palm, cassava, and sugarcane residues across eight Southeast Asian countries and assess the feasibility of these residues for hybrid power generation. Crop yields were estimated using Random Forest regression with high-resolution (5 m) remote sensing predictors, achieving model performance achieving a maximum R2 of 0.628. Biomass residues were converted into electricity potential using crop-specific residue-to-product ratios and availability coefficients. The results show that Indonesia and Malaysia possess the highest agricultural residue potential from paddy and oil palm, while sugarcane residues exceed 20,000 MW across the region, with notable concentrations in Laos. Techno-economic modeling indicates that the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) ranges from 0.04 to 0.11 USD/kWh, with payback times of 20–130 months, demonstrating cost competitiveness with coal, especially when the monetized cost of CO2 emissions are included. Spatial hybrid integration analysis reveals that paddy-rich corridors near existing coal plants have the strongest potential for biomass co-firing and hybridization. The proposed framework provides a scalable methodology for regional biomass planning and offers practical insights for policymakers in accelerating renewable energy transition and reducing fossil fuel dependence in Southeast Asia."

 Maps are fundamental media for people to comprehend the spatial and temporal dimensions of a place. Currently, the majority of maps are generated through volunteered efforts, which significantly extends the critical and participatory aspects of geospatial information and provide diverse perspectives and scopes in terms of the geospatial characteristics of a place. However, most of these crowdsourced volunteered maps are often limited in spatial resolution due to file size, editing errors, printing limitations, and image quality issues, among others. This challenge poses a demand for deep learning-enhanced super-resolution reconstruction that can effectively convert low-resolution maps into high-resolution ones. Our previous research has revealed that map reconstruction presents unique requirements for preserving global content and local details involving map annotations and elements, which differ from the objectives of general image reconstruction. In this paper, we integrate MapSR—a CNN-based single map super-resolution reconstruction method we previously developed—into a GAN framework comprising a generator module, a discriminator module, and a local discriminant learning module. This integrated framework enables reconstructing both global map content and individual map elements. To testify the performance of CartoSR, we design three sets of experiments involving comparison with state-of-the-art methods for map super-resolution reconstruction, assessment of GANs’ effectiveness in map reconstruction, and analysis of CartoSR’s scalability. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed CartoSR achieves state-of-the-art performance in single map super-resolution reconstruction. We hope it can serve as a routine for future research in this area."

Here, we demonstrate that Late Quaternary lake‐water unloading is a primary driver of fault slip and rift asymmetry in southern Tibet. Since the last interglacial (∼116 ka), significant water‐level drops of large lakes have induced crustal rebound and Coulomb stress changes. At Nam Co Lake, a ∼130 m drop produced ∼0.1 MPa of stress change, preferentially reactivating the adjacent fault and contributing ∼15 m of vertical displacement ∼23% of the total near Damxung. Likewise, the southern lakes (Yamzho Yumco and Puma Yumco) caused ∼70 m of vertical displacement on the adjacent fault. We establish that climatically‐controlled lake unloading can directly shape continental rifting by selectively enhancing fault slip on the lake‐bounding side of the rift, thereby amplifying its structural asymmetry. This highlights a significant, quantifiable role of surface processes in actively shaping tectonic deformation."

These processes rely on mud settling velocity, which is set by the grain size, mineralogy, and flocculation state of mud. Here we determined these factors using a suspended sediment data compilation from lowland rivers and new measurements from the Wax Lake Delta. Results show that rivers transport mostly silt‐sized grains (∼77% by mass). Although flocculation is classically associated with clay minerals, surprisingly most silt is flocculated (∼88%). Clay minerals dominate the clay size class (<2 μm) as expected, but this size is only a small percentage of the load (2.4%). Clay minerals are sparse among flocculated sediment (∼17%), implying that physical trapping of grains and binding by organic matter instead drive mud flocculation. Flocculated silt dominates river sediment load (∼62%), indicating a new paradigm for river sediment transport."

The open-access ReCHAR database supports research on forest history, early industries, and human–environment interactions. 
 This study presents the first national-scale spatial inventory of relict charcoal hearths (RCHs) in Poland, based on high-resolution LiDAR data and digital terrain analysis. Using a combination of manual interpretation, GIS-based feature extraction, and K-prototypes clustering, we identified and classified 634 815 RCHs across forested regions of the country. Each feature was georeferenced and categorized by size, morphological characteristics, slope position, and environmental context, including current and potential vegetation and soil types. Spatial analyses revealed significant regional differences in hearth density, with the highest concentrations found in western and south-central Poland, particularly in the Lower Silesian, Stobrawa, and Świętokrzyskie forests. Cluster analysis distinguished three major types of RCHs, differing in their environmental settings and spatial organization: (1) lowland pine-dominated clusters on gentle terrain, (2) isolated features on steep slopes in mixed forests, and (3) high-density hearth groups in elevated areas. Although large portions of the country appear devoid of RCHs, we argue that this reflects limitations in preservation and detection – due to long-term agricultural activity in lowlands and erosion in mountainous areas – rather than an actual absence of charcoal production. The resulting ReCHAR database offers a unique, open-access tool for interdisciplinary research on forest history, human–environment interactions, and early industrial landscapes. Its modular design supports further expansion, including links to historical settlements and industries reliant on charcoal, such as metallurgy, glassmaking, and tar or potash production.

 Photosynthesis-irradiance and photosynthesis-depth experiments are two standard ways of experimentally quantifying primary production. These measurements have historically formed the backbone for the formulation of mathematical models of primary production and to this day remain an invaluable resource for model development and refinement. From such experiments information on photosynthesis parameters can be extracted, which allows for the quantification of the photosynthesis light dependence, essential in the calculation of primary production. To this day, this is the only avenue for photosynthesis parameters estimation, making such data invaluable for primary production modelling. In the literature, there have been several efforts to form global datasets of photosynthesis parameters, collected at various sites across the world oceans and seas. Here, we use a publicly available global dataset of in situ primary production profiles and construct a new database of photosynthesis parameters. We use an inverse modelling approach that is described in great details, along with the data requirements. For a forward model, we employ a fully solvable analytical model of the production profile, and we use the inverse model to compare it with the measured production profile, while constraining it with measured daily watercolumn production. Using this approach, we successfully recovered 4160 photosynthesis-irradiance parameters from the global oceans, which enabled a model versus data comparison for watercolumn production. The spatio-temporal distribution of the new dataset is presented and compared to existing datasets. Finally, the new photosynthesis parameters dataset is provided publicly, along with metadata needed for the implementation in primary production models."

Jalowska,Examining spin-up behaviour within WRF dynamical downscaling applications,"“Spin-up” is time needed for a model’s result to become effectively free of influence from initial conditions, and it is usually excluded from analysis. Here, spin-up is examined by comparing one decadal simulation to another initialized 20 years prior, in order to determine when their solutions converge. Differences lessen over the first fall and winter, but re-emerge over the following spring and summer, suggesting that at least 1 annual cycle is needed to spin up regional climate simulations. 
 Spin-up is the period after initialization when a model transitions away from its dependence on initial conditions toward a dynamic equilibrium between driving boundary conditions and its own internal dynamics. Regional climate models (RCMs) are often used to simulate conditions over several decades to inform local adaptation and resilience activities. The spin-up period represents added cost to already resource-intensive simulations, and it is often infeasible to use a spin-up period that produces complete model equilibrium. Therefore, a pragmatic compromise is desired to minimize the effects of spin-up. Here, two overlapping dynamically downscaled simulations (31 year and 11 year integrations) using the Weather Research and Forecasting model over the contiguous US (CONUS) are used to explore convergence associated with model spin-up. The shorter simulation is initialized 20 years after initialization of the longer (reference) run, and the runs are analysed over the period covered by both simulations, giving the reference simulation a 20 year period to attain spin-up prior to comparison. After initialization, the shorter run features cooler surface and near-surface temperatures and greater soil moisture compared to the reference simulation. Differences between the runs decrease in magnitude over the first 3 months as autumn transitions to winter; however, these differences re-emerge and reach a secondary peak during the proceeding spring and summer. During this warm season, evaporation and accompanying evaporative cooling increase and temperature differences between the simulations re-emerge. These results support using at least one year of spin-up time in RCM applications to account for the seasonality of spin-up behaviour. Results from some regions of the CONUS indicate that spin-up durations of 1–4 years are needed to exclude spurious behavior in top-layer soil moisture, which exhibits prolonged spin-up compared with other near-surface variables examined here."

However, the compositional complexity of organic waste introduces poorly understood inhibitory effects on the AD process, leading to reduced methane yields and process instability. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), potent oxidants produced under microbial stress, can damage cellular components and disrupt methanogenesis; yet, their roles in AD remain largely unexplored. This review highlights, for the first time, a comprehensive perspective on the formation pathways and fate of key ROS oxidants within anaerobic systems and the need for accurate ROS detection methods. Importantly, we propose a novel insight that ROS may facilitate the degradation of emerging organic pollutants in digestate, offering increased safety before land application for soil remediation. Furthermore, the review provides a pioneering discussion on the link between ROS and CH4/CO2 emissions, including mechanistic insights and long-term environmental implications. Our findings suggest that the potential greenhouse gas flux from digestate due to ROS-related processes warrants serious attention.

However, their assembly mechanisms and ecological implications remain poorly understood. Here, we sampled microplastics and adjacent soils at 27 urban wetland sites in Changsha, China, to sequence bacterial communities and assess their assembly processes and environmental drivers. Plastispheres selectively recruit soil bacteria, with bacterial richness representing only 51.6–69.3% of that in adjacent soils despite positive correlations with source communities. Improved nutrient availability and favorable hydrothermal conditions within plastispheres reduce dispersal limitation while enhancing homogenizing selection. Network analysis indicates stronger positive correlations and greater structural robustness, reflecting niche consolidation in these confined microhabitats. Moreover, KEGG-based functional predictions reveal intensified redox-driven metabolism, where degradation of recalcitrant organics (e.g., xenobiotics, lipids and phosphonates) is inferred to supply electrons for nitrate/nitrite reduction─a coupling amplified under nitrate-enriched, well-aerated conditions. These findings collectively establish plastispheres as self-contained “micro-enclaves”, where local environmental and edaphic factors reshape microbial community and functions. They deepen our understanding of plastisphere-mediated biogeochemical processes and pollution mechanisms, thereby providing a scientific basis for conserving and managing wetland ecosystem health."

MOSAIC is built upon the Llama-3.1-8B-instruct architecture7, training 2,498 specialized chemical experts within Voronoi-clustered spaces. This approach delivers reproducible and executable experimental protocols with confidence metrics for complex syntheses. With an overall 71% success rate, experimental validation demonstrates the realizations of over 35 novel compounds, spanning pharmaceuticals, materials, agrochemicals, and cosmetics. Notably, MOSAIC also enables the discovery of new reaction methodologies that are absent from the expert’s training, a cornerstone for advancing chemical synthesis. This scalable paradigm of partitioning vast domains into searchable expert regions enables a generalizable strategy for AI-assisted discovery wherever accelerating information growth outpaces efficient knowledge access and application."

Gut macrophages clear α-synuclein via C1q–complement pathways; loss of this response worsens neuropathology and improves gut function, implicating neuroimmune crosstalk. 
 Deposition of misfolded α-synuclein (αsyn) in the enteric nervous system (ENS) is found in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. It is hypothesized that ENS synucleinopathy contributes to both the pathogenesis and non-motor morbidity in Parkinson’s Disease (PD), but the cellular and molecular mechanisms that shape enteric histopathology and dysfunction are poorly understood. Here, we employ a fibrillar injection model of enteric synucleinopathy in male mice and demonstrate that ENS-resident macrophages, which play a critical role in maintaining ENS homeostasis, initially respond to enteric neuronal αsyn pathology by upregulating machinery for complement-mediated engulfment. Pharmacologic depletion of ENS-macrophages or genetic deletion of C1q enhanced enteric neuropathology. Conversely, C1q deletion ameliorated gut dysfunction, indicating that complement partially mediates αsyn-induced gut dysfunction. However, this C1q-dependent clearance mechanism diminished over time and its failure temporally correlated with the further increase in ENS pathology. These findings highlight the importance of enteric neuron-macrophage interactions in removing toxic protein aggregates that putatively shape the gastrointestinal manifestations of PD.

 Remembering everyday events involves noticing what different experiences share and preserving the details that set them apart, yet the neural processes supporting this balance remain unclear. Here, we record EEG while participants view naturalistic movie scenes that introduce episodic events with overlapping elements. Using time-resolved representational similarity analysis, we find that these events evoke both similarities and dissimilarities in neural patterns as new information unfolds. Similarities predict successful inference of information across separate episodes, consistent with integrative encoding. Dissimilarities, by contrast, predict accurate memory for individual events, indicating the formation of distinct event-specific traces. Together, these findings indicate that the brain encodes both integrated and separated neural representations to flexibly support different mnemonic goals and to balance relational inference with detailed recollection. People often need to remember unique details while also finding connections across experiences.

 Colorectal cancer responds poorly to immune checkpoint blockade in most patients with microsatellite-stable (MSS) tumors, highlighting the need for alternative targets. B7H3 (CD276) is an immune checkpoint protein that is frequently overexpressed in tumors, but how it is maintained at high protein levels is unclear. Here we show that palmitic acid (PA) promotes B7H3 palmitoylation by the palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC24 at cysteine 496. This modification prevents B7H3 from binding to sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1, also called p62), limiting autophagic degradation and stabilizing B7H3, which suppresses CD8+ T cell antitumor activity. Disrupting this pathway by mutating cysteine 496, or by deleting Zdhhc24 in a colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) mouse model, enhances CD8+ T cell responses. We also develop a cell-penetrant peptide that blocks the ZDHHC24–B7H3 interaction, boosts antitumor immunity, and synergizes with blockade of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). These findings identify B7H3 palmitoylation as a targetable metabolic–immune node for colorectal cancer immunotherapy.

 Product reuse advances circular economy by reducing material demand. However, environmental assessments often assume reused products fully replace new ones, or they overlook market changes and shortened lifespans driven by resale and repurchase opportunities. This study presents an empirically based analysis of the second-hand smartphone market and its cumulative effects on manufacturing demand and carbon emissions. Integrating consumer survey data and product lifetime estimates in a stock-and-flow model, we find that in the United States, each second-hand transaction currently extends smartphone use time by 40%, displaces 0.40 new devices, and that circular consumption results in a 34% lower annual carbon footprint. With 25% of consumers purchasing used phones, production demand and carbon emissions are lowered by 15% and 14%, respectively. Yet, shortened use times offset nearly half the potential gains. If reuse became the norm, manufacturing demand could decline by one-third, revealing both the promise and the limits of reuse.

 Coral tissue depth reflects organismal health and is influenced by environmental stressors. Reconstructing its past variability on inter- and intra-annual timescales, however, is not yet possible. Here we reconstructed seasonal tissue depth by measuring spatial offsets between growth cycles in corallite porosity and theca geochemistry (Lithium/Magnesium and Barium/Calcium ratios) of a single Siderastrea siderea core collected in Barbados. We show spatial offsets and thus tissue depth vary systematically over multiyear timescales, with decreasing values associated with thermal stress that impact extension rate and calcification in subsequent growth cycles. Large environmental disturbances such as the 2021 volcanic eruption of La Soufrière (St. Vincent) also impact tissue depth, in this case likely due to the release of bioactive metals upon ash deposition. This study investigates the robustness of the offset signal within a single colony and with further validation across multiple colonies could help reconstruct regional to global environmental and ecological stressors.

A typology for moving beyond the public–private binary in conservation and development,"Desert lakes worldwide are being lost to human water diversions and land use change, creating ‘sacrifice zones’ that benefit distant interests. In the American West, scholarly interest has focused on water diversions by both public and private interests as the primary driver of desert lake decline, underscoring how assumptions that public interests support conservation while private interests support development can be misleading. Land use and its underlying motives are also important as they modify surrounding desert basins and impact local social conditions in ways that also defy such assumptions, but are less examined in this context. How can we move beyond the binary of public and private interests to identify distinct patterns of sacrifice zone formation through land use? Here, we propose a typology that goes beyond the public–private binary to systematically measure landowner motives according to a landowner’s publicness, economic objective, and degree of absenteeism, identifying support-, speculation- and sacrifice-motivated landowners. We test three variants of this typology across eight desert basins with differing conservation trajectories. Our results show that (1) the motives related to mixed-use public parcels strongly shape basin-level summaries of motive in terms of area, underscoring their management importance for overall basin land use; (2) although sacrifice- and speculation-motivated private landowners are few, they hold consolidated estates; and (3) their land use activities likely have disproportionate social and ecological impacts. Case summaries of the dynamics for three representative basins further demonstrate the additional insights that could be generated by applying our typology longitudinally and pairing it with qualitative insights. This typology provides a systematic tool for characterizing landowner motives in sacrifice zones. Future research should focus on longitudinal applications and identifying appropriate indicators of social and ecological conditions."

Although numerous studies have quantified deforestation embodied in traded products, much less is known about the underlying economic and institutional factors that explain why some countries export or import more of it than others. This study addresses these questions by examining the determinants of embodied deforestation in international trade flows. Drawing on Factor Endowment Theory, we test whether income levels, land availability, and institutional quality influence the distribution of embodied forest loss between exporting and importing countries. Using a gravity model estimated through Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood, we assess how GDP, distance, trade composition, and governance shape embodied deforestation patterns in agricultural and livestock commodities. Results highlight a prominent role of GDP per capita as a driver of deforestation: a 1% increase in per capita GDP is associated, on average, with a 0.28% decrease in deforestation embodied in exports, but with a 0.88% increase in embodied deforestation imports, reflecting an outsourcing of land-use pressures. While developing countries embody comparatively more deforestation in their exports, higher-income importing countries increasingly shift the environmental burden of their consumption to other regions through imports. Domestic consumption factors, such as higher per capita meat demand, are also positively associated with embodied deforestation inflows: a 1 kg increase in yearly meat consumption per capita is linked to a 1.8% rise in embodied deforestation inflows. Overall, the findings highlight the structural asymmetries of global trade and underscore the responsibility of affluent nations in driving deforestation beyond their borders. They also suggest that both production- and consumption-side policies are needed to mitigate embodied deforestation in high-impact commodity sectors."

A systematic review,"Livestock underpin livelihoods and food security in Africa, using marginal lands to produce high-quality protein for the household or as a source of income. For mixed farmers, livestock provide draught power, manure for fields, and buffer variations in crop productivity. Livestock also hold cultural significance. However, African livestock farmers are especially vulnerable to climate hazards, and attempt to reduce impacts in different ways, with varied outcomes. A synthesis of the state of knowledge of livestock farmers’ responses to climate variability and change would assist policymakers and practitioners to make informed decisions, and guide researchers towards gaps that need to be filled. To that end, we systematically reviewed articles published between 2014 and 2022—the period between the end of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment and the end of the Sixth, recording study metadata, farmers’ responses, and their drivers, outcomes, barriers and enablers. We included 186 articles from 32 countries (most frequently Kenya or Ethiopia), from which 1089 responses were coded for analysis. Responses by small-scale farmers of cattle, sheep and goats, typically as part of mixed crop-livestock systems, were most common (n = 816), with few documented responses of commercial farmers (121). Most responses pertained to changing herd management (437), followed by feed or pasture management (294). Drought was the most common climate driver of responses (567), while the most commonly mentioned barriers included financial constraints (116), a lack of knowledge or information (98), and government support (67). While there is a sizable body of literature on climate impacts and adaptation of livestock farmers, notable gaps included any work in Central and Northern Africa, and responses of commercial farming systems. In general, future research should focus on these gaps and on improving the depth of information collected, such as on barriers and enablers of adaptation, to better inform future interventions."

However, the key drivers and causal mechanisms remain unclear, hindering the design of biochar strategies for carbon sequestration. This study integrated machine learning (ML) and partial least-squares path modeling (PLS–PM) to establish an interpretable causal framework. Using a global data set, a high-precision random forest model quantified the primary drivers. Soil properties dominated the predictions (60.27%), with phosphorus (P) (optimal level: <0.7 g/kg) and pH emerging as the most critical factors. Nonlinear thresholds showed that the Cd role shifted from positive to insignificant beyond 5.8 mg/kg. PLS–PM quantified the causal pathways: (i) physicochemical interactions (e.g., P competitive adsorption reduced SOC by β = −0.62, p < 0.001); (ii) climate-mediated cascades; and (iii) biochar aging feedback. Validation of the model using independent data sets beyond the training scope demonstrated a reasonable relative ΔSOC prediction error range (±6%–20%). SOC accumulation increased with higher pH, Cd content, and biochar dosage. Site-specific design should prioritize (i) inherent soil properties (pH and P), (ii) Cd gradients, and (iii) tailored biochar parameters. The framework enhances biochar design to optimize SOC sequestration and synergistic Cd management."

By adsorbing hazardous compounds, such as organic pollutants, MPs can alter the transport and fate of these pollutants. To address this, we developed a multimodal Siamese neural network named microplastic-pollutant adsorption prediction (MPAP), trained on 1101 adsorption records covering 403 compounds and six MP types. Unlike previous models that rely on single-feature representations, MPAP leverages a multimodal architecture that integrates molecular fingerprints and graph embeddings to capture chemical structures, along with microplastic morphological features such as the MP type and particle size, as well as water chemistry parameters, enabling a more comprehensive characterization of sorption behavior. The model outperforms baseline models with R2 = 0.869 on the validation set and 0.863 on the test set. Experimental validation using batch adsorption experiments with six previously untested pollutants, quantified via liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry or microwave plasma torch ionization–mass spectrometry in different environments, confirmed a strong predictive performance. To support broad application, we provide an open-access web platform (http://mpap.envwind.site:8004/) for rapid, high-throughput prediction across diverse MP–pollutant–water environment scenarios."

Moreover, the accumulation of electrolytic manganese residue (EMR) hinders the growth of the manganese industry and poses a serious environmental threat. However, electrolytic manganese residue contains valuable metal elements, including Fe and Mn, which can be utilized in preparation of low-temperature denitration catalysts. In this work, a series of samples were prepared using electrolytic manganese residue as a raw material via leaching oxalic acid solutions of varying concentrations and precipitation with ammonia. And the EMR-OA-0.10 (leached by 0.10 mol/L oxalic acid solution) demonstrated excellent NH3–SCR activity and good SO2 resistance, exceeding 90% NOx conversion during 100 to 250 °C. The characterization results revealed that EMR-OA-0.10 had more Mn–O–Fe active structures, which were found to possess superior NH3 and NO adsorption properties, more surface active oxygen species, and higher Mn4+ contents, which promoted the adsorption and activation of reaction species. Density functional theory calculations and in situ DRIFTS experiments revealed that the NH3 species adsorbed at Fe sites within Mn–O–Fe active structures exhibited a stronger reactivity.

Equitable management offers a path to water security, according to a machine learning forecasting model applied to future development scenarios. 
 The global water-scarcity crisis is fundamentally driven by inequality, yet most forecasts overlook equity as a causal factor, leading to misdiagnosed problems and ineffective solutions. Here we develop a machine-learning-based global water-use forecasting model to project future water use and scarcity under distinct Shared Socioeconomic Pathways representing alternative development trajectories. Drawing on decades of historical data on human adaptation and resource use, the model predicts that by 2050, 6.5 billion people—equivalent to 65.5% of the global population—will face severe water scarcity under a high-challenge fragmentation scenario. By 2100, this figure is projected to rise to 8.0 billion, or 63% of the global population, far exceeding most previous estimates. Our analysis shows that a high inequality pathway directly amplifies water-scarcity risk. Critically, a technology-driven pathway improves aggregate water-use efficiency but concurrently deepens social and spatial inequalities. These findings underscore the need to move beyond purely technological fixes towards integrated, equitable water management, demonstrating that greater justice is inseparable from greater water security. By 2100, 62% of the global population could face severe water scarcity, with inequality amplifying risk. Equitable management offers a path to water security, according to a machine learning forecasting model applied to future development scenarios."

 Extreme coastal flooding often arises when large-scale climate patterns and local ocean–atmosphere variability combine to magnify water levels beyond what communities can withstand. Understanding and anticipating these interactions is essential for protecting vulnerable coastlines. Here we aim to determine how two major modes of climate variability—the El Niño/Southern Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation—individually and jointly influence extreme coastal water levels worldwide. Using global observational and reanalysis datasets spanning 1958–2023, we analyse their separate effects and diagnose potential nonlinear interactions through statistical and process-based methods. We show that specific, seasonally aligned phases of these two climate modes interact nonlinearly, producing coastal water levels far higher than expected from either mode alone. These combinations enhance storm activity and wave conditions from the eastern seaboard of North America to western Europe and the Mediterranean. We further show that incorporating these nonlinear interactions into a conceptual climate model enables skilful seasonal predictions of coastal flooding hazards several months in advance, demonstrating the feasibility of reliable early-warning systems for coastal risk reduction.

 Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have demonstrated predictive validity across a range of cohorts and diseases, but quantifying their clinical utility remains a challenge. As PRS can be derived from a single biological sample and remains stable throughout life, we explore the potential of PRS to optimize existing screening programs. Via an integrated modelling approach, we quantify the potential clinical benefits arising from a knowledge of PRS across seven diseases with existing screening programs (abdominal aortic aneurysm, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, coronary artery disease, hypertension, prostate cancer, and type 2 diabetes). We identify individuals at high genetic risk (PRS OR>2) and very high genetic risk (PRS OR>3) and estimate the optimal screening ages for these genetically high-risk individuals, based on the equivalent risk to population-level risk at recommended screening ages. We then leverage published data on differential mortality and other outcomes, with and without screening-based interventions, to assess the potential benefits of tailoring screening age based on genetic risk. Very high risk individuals reach the risk level associated with usual starting screening age on average 10.8 years earlier, high risk individuals 8.9 years earlier and reduced risk individuals (OR<0.5) 16.8 years later. During this time, case enrichment (the ratio of the percentage of cases in the high PRS risk group and in the total population) in the high risk group is between 1.7 and 3.0, depending on the disease. Across all seven diseases, appropriate interventions following PRS-guided screening could reduce premature deaths in high-risk individuals by 23.3%. Knowledge of genetic risk, measured using PRS, has the potential to deliver substantial public health benefits when aggregated across conditions, and could reduce premature mortality by tailoring existing screening programs. Via an integrative modelling approach that combines population and clinical trial data, the authors find that polygenic risk score-based screening would reduce premature mortality across seven commonly screened conditions."

 Electrochemical hydrogenation of quinoxaline presents a promising alternative to traditional methods, yet is suffering from low current density and Faradaic efficiency due to the hampered hydrogenation process. Herein, we develop a cocatalytic system of Ru single atoms doped Co3O4 nanosheet (RuSA/ns-Co3O4) to optimize the interfacial H2O behavior by tuning the Ru single atoms concentration for accelerating the electrochemical hydrogenation of quinoxaline, which enables remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 82% toward 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxaline at high current density of 200 mA cm-2. Detailed experimental and theoretical studies reveal that Ru single atoms trigger interfacial charge redistribution, inducing an asymmetric local electric field that reconstructs interfacial H2O molecules into an H-down configuration. This reorientation remodels the hydrogen-bonded water network, shortens the distance between hydrogen atoms and the Co3O4 surface, regulates K•H2O availability, and enhances H2O dissociation to supply H*. Consequently, the membrane electrode assembly electrolyser exhibits a long-term stability of >100 h at 200 mA cm-2. Our findings highlight the prospect of interfacial water microenvironment for electrochemical hydrogenation of unsaturated N-heterocyclic compounds, with promising applications for the electrosynthesis of other valuable chemicals.

 Thousands of short open reading frames (sORFs) are translated outside of annotated coding sequences. Recent studies have pioneered searching for sORF-encoded microproteins in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics and peptidomics datasets. Here, we assessed literature-reported MS-based identifications of unannotated human proteins. We find that studies vary by three orders of magnitude in the number of unannotated proteins they report. Of nearly 10,000 reported sORF-encoded peptides, 96% were unique to a single study, and 12% mapped to annotated proteins or proteoforms. Manual curation of a benchmark dataset of 406 manually evaluated spectra from 204 sORF-encoded proteins revealed large variation in peptide-spectrum match (PSM) quality between studies, with immunopeptidomics studies generally reporting higher quality PSMs than conventional enzymatic digests of whole cell lysates. We estimate that 65% of predicted sORF-encoded protein detections in immunopeptidomics studies were supported by high-quality PSMs versus 7.8% in non-immunopeptidomics datasets. Our work stresses the need for standardized protocols and analysis workflows to guide future advancements in microprotein detection by MS towards uncovering how many human microproteins exist. Several recent publications have attempted to detect novel unannotated microproteins using mass spectrometry proteomics.

Here, the authors reveal how TEM-1 β-lactamase acquires cefotaxime resistance through reshaping of dynamic conformational ensembles and localized stability networks, offering insight into the molecular framework of the activity-stability tradeoff. 
 Our ability to understand protein evolution hinges on understanding how evolutionary landscapes are shaped at the fundamental protein level. Using TEM-1 β-lactamase we show that molecular traits related to the statistical ensemble nature of protein structure contribute to broader substrate specificity, active site-scaffold communication, and the selection of stabilizing substitutions. During the evolution of cefotaxime resistance, the initial mutation reorganizes the active site, introducing a new function conformation. Secondary substitutions improve catalytic efficiency by redistributing the ensemble and restoring a significant population of the original conformation, rather than by stabilizing the new conformation. Stability defects associated with initial mutations are not evenly disseminated but are clustered at specific distal scaffold elements. The capacity of mutants to independently modulate the populations of individual active site walls and scaffold regions through narrow residue networks, produces conformational epistasis and a combinatorial set of cefotaximase states, which enables local compensation of scaffold defects. Enzymes adapt by sampling new conformations while balancing destabilizing effects of mutations.

This treatment also enhanced bisphosphonate outcomes, strengthening the skeleton to counter adverse effects of cancer therapy on musculoskeletal tissue. 
 Aromatase inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of hormone-sensitive breast cancer, but their suppression of estrogen production accelerates bone loss, increases fracture risk, and negatively impacts muscle and fat metabolism. Here, we demonstrate that daily low intensity vibration, serving as a non-drug mimetic for exercise, protects musculoskeletal health in skeletally immature, female mice under complete estrogen deprivation. Subsequent improvements in vertebral bone density are paralleled by greater and leaner skeletal muscle mass and function alongside reduced fat accretion and circulating metabolites. In mature, estrogen deprived mice, vibration enhances weekly bisphosphonate treatment, improving bone density, cortical thickness, and mechanical resistance to fracture. These findings support the proposed hypothesis that low intensity vibration reduces musculoskeletal frailty in estrogen deprived mice, with stronger effects observed in younger cohorts, while in skeletally mature mice combination therapy with anti-resorptive treatment is necessary to suppress cancer-treatment induced musculoskeletal degradation. In young, estrogen-deprived female mice, the authors show that daily low-intensity vibration protected bone, muscle and fat metabolism.

Researchers found that endothelin-3 triggers electrical oscillations via T-type calcium channels, enabling these cells to contract like ‘mini muscles’ and colonize organs. 
 Enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs) colonize the gut during embryogenesis and migration defects give rise to Hirschsprung disease (HD). Mutations in GDNF/RET and EDN3/EDNRB are known to be causal in HD. Here, we show that migrating ENCCs in mice exhibit endogenous EDN3/EDNRB-gated calcium activity, mediated by chloride channels, T-type Ca2+ channels and inositol trisphosphate-sensitive intracellular-store release. We find that inhibiting Ca2+ activity results in ENCC migration defects, while exciting it promotes migration by increasing ENCC contractility and traction force to the extracellular matrix. Our study demonstrates that embryonic endothelin-mediated neural crest migration and adult endothelin-mediated vasoconstriction is one and the same phenomenon, taking place in different cell types. Our results suggest a functional link between rare mutations of CACNA1H (the gene encoding CaV3.2) and HD, and pave the way for understanding neurocristopathies in terms of neural crest cell bioelectric activity deficits.

The authors show that the metal can be regenerated electrochemically, supporting a reusable and sustainable cycle for hydrogen. 
 Hydrogen is a clean energy carrier with significant promises for a sustainable future, yet many established production routes operate under undesirable conditions or constraints, motivating the search for alternative production pathways. Here, our approach uses photothermal oxidation of liquid gallium to generate hydrogen from both freshwater and seawater. The exposure to light thermally heats up liquid gallium droplets to a temperature suitable for fast gallium-water interaction, producing gallium oxyhydroxide and hydrogen. The light exposure also boosts the reaction by breaking the oxide layer on the surface of liquid gallium immersed in water, allowing continuous interactions between the water molecules and the surface of liquid gallium droplets. The gallium oxyhydroxide that is produced can be electrochemically reduced, allowing metal regeneration, thereby enabling circular hydrogen production. In this work, we show that photothermal activation of liquid gallium provides a rapid and circular route for generating hydrogen from diverse water sources. Photothermal reactions between liquid gallium and water or seawater enable hydrogen production under light exposure.

 One of the most intriguing attributes of Earth’s magnetic field is that it reverses polarity. Previous palaeomagnetic records mainly from the last ~17 million years indicate that the reversal process typically occurs over ten thousand or fewer years. Here we present an exceptionally resolved deep sea sedimentary palaeomagnetic record that captures two polarity transitions that occurred ~40 million years ago. These transitions occur over 18 and 70 thousand years and are much longer than the typical 10 kyr duration for younger reversals. Longer-duration transitions like these are calculated in numerical geodynamo models, suggesting that variable reversal durations are an intrinsic property of the geodynamo. This variability predicts that polarity transition durations can be much longer than 10 kyr. Occasional prolonged intervals of transitional, and weaker, geomagnetic fields would have exposed Earth’s Eocene environments to greater high-energy radiation from the sun for longer intervals of time, with potential impacts on biota.

 The oxidative enrichment and isotopic fractionation of cerium (Ce) in contact with vernadite (δ-MnO2) serve as a proxy for past redox conditions in both terrestrial and marine environments. However, the molecular processes that govern the scavenging of Ce from the dissolved 3+ to the insoluble 4+ oxidation states remain obscure. Adsorption experiments on synthetic δ-MnO2 suggest that aqueous Ce(III) precipitates as ceric hydroxide (Ce(OH)4), an unknown mineral. Here, the atomic-scale structure of Ce in natural vernadite from ferromanganese crusts collected across the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans was examined using advanced high-energy-resolution extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. The findings provide direct evidence for the uptake of Ce as mononuclear Ce(IV) complexes at the layer-edge sites (DES complex) and Mn(IV) vacancy sites of vernadite. Density functional theory-based Gibbs free-energy calculations indicate that hydrolysis of the DES complex promotes the oxidation of Ce(III) to Ce(IV). Quantum mechanical calculations predict that the equilibrium 136Ce/140Ce isotope fractionation factor between Ce(III) dissolved in seawater and the Ce(IV) complexes can reach 1.2-1.3 ‰ at 25 °C, indicating that the 136Ce/140Ce ratio has high potential as a new paleoredox proxy. Seawater cerium (III) forms mononuclear complexes in vernadite from global ferromanganese crusts and is oxidized to cerium (IV) during hydrolysis, as shown by atomic-scale analysis and quantum calculations. This leads to strong Ce isotope fractionation."

Despite their pervasive presence in indoor air, household dust, and the human body, these fibrous MNPs have received considerably less attention than polystyrene-based particles, resulting in a critical gap in our understanding of their potential health impacts. This review examines the growing evidence that textile-derived MNPs can translocate across biological barriers following inhalation or ingestion, reaching the brain via both direct olfactory pathways and systemic circulation through the blood–brain barrier. Experimental studies increasingly implicate MNPs in oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and protein aggregation, processes central to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. We also explore the therapeutic potential of natural bioactive compounds, including polyphenols and omega-3 fatty acids, in mitigating MNP-induced neurotoxicity. By consolidating current findings, this review highlights the urgency of advancing mechanistic studies, exposure assessment, and regulatory oversight to address the emerging threat of textile-derived MNPs to neurological health."

Here, we investigated the spatial variability and fluxes of two major aromatic DOM components, dissolved black carbon (DBC) and dissolved lignin phenols (DLP), in groundwater from a subtropical intertidal mangrove. Results showed significantly higher DBC and DLP concentrations in shallow groundwater than in deeper layers. The monomer ratios of DBC and DLP revealed distinct transformation patterns: more condensed DBC accumulated at depth, while DLP showed higher degradation in the recharge zone compared with the discharge zone. Hydrological factors such as hydroperiod and infiltration capacity dominated over geochemical factors (e.g., pH, dissolved oxygen, and salinity) in shaping DBC and DLP characteristics. Area-normalized fluxes of DBC (2.38 mg m–2 d–1, equivalent to 869.7 kg km–2 yr–1) and DLP (0.13 mg m–2 d–1, equivalent to 46.0 kg km–2 yr–1) via mangrove SGD significantly exceeded those from major global river systems, identifying intertidal mangroves as previously underappreciated sources of aromatic DOM to coastal waters. These findings expand our understanding of mangrove carbon cycling and highlight the need to incorporate SGD-derived aromatic DOM into the refinement of global carbon budgets."

This study demonstrates that integrating anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) into VBS significantly enhances the nitrogen removal performance and capacity. Over 25 weeks of operation, the anammox-integrated VBS (A-VBS) achieved substantially higher nitrogen removal efficiency (63.7 ± 1.8%) compared to the conventional VBS (C-VBS) (18.9 ± 3.0%) at a fixed hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3 days. Enhanced performance persisted under shortened HRTs (48 and 24 h), indicating the hydraulic resilience of the anammox process. Microbial community analysis confirmed the establishment of the anammox-associated genus Candidatus Brocadia in A-VBS (1.2–2.2% relative abundance, along with a 4-fold increase in anammox 16S rRNA gene abundance), undetectable in C-VBS. 15N tracer assays showed that anammox contributed approximately 46.2% of N2 production in A-VBS. Quantitative modeling revealed co-occurrence and synergistic interactions among nitrification (amoA, nxrA), anammox (anammox 16S rRNA), and denitrification (narG, nirK, nirS, qnorB, nosZ) pathways in driving total nitrogen removal. These findings suggest the potential of anammox-integrated VBS as an effective, sustainable solution for enhanced nitrogen management in urban water systems."

Here, we characterize the environmental and economic impacts of industrial organic loading reductions on centralized WRRFs via process modeling, life cycle assessment (LCA), and techno-economic analysis (TEA) under uncertainty. We demonstrate sustainability benefits of upstream organic carbon valorization will be amplified at WRRFs designed for BOD removal and nitrification but undermined at biological nutrient removal (BNR) or enhanced nutrient removal (ENR) WRRFs. Through uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, we find that operational cost changes at WRRFs following industrial load reduction are driven by unit electricity cost, solids disposal cost, and blower efficiency─along with external carbon addition in nutrient removal systems─while changes in GHG emissions are primarily driven by grid carbon intensity and fugitive methane emissions. A national spatial linkage of 4500 F&B facilities to their nearest WRRFs highlights regional clusters where industrial pretreatment could most improve WRRF sustainability."

Herein, we developed an automated approach integrating stable isotopic labeling with reactivity-directed principles. Normal and deuterated glutathione (GSH) probes were used to generate paired isotopic signatures enabling precise localization of reactive DBPs. Customized bioinformatics tools were employed to efficiently extract paired GSH–DBP adducts. The workflow allowed rapid automated processing of large data sets within minutes while maintaining high coverage and accuracy. When applied to chlorinated and chloraminated water samples, 255 adducts were screened from >50 000 raw features, leading to annotation of 202 DBPs, including 193 newly reported. GSH reaction mechanism analysis attributed 65 chlorinated and 132 unsaturated DBPs to nucleophilic substitution and addition, respectively. Notably, 5 sulfur-containing DBPs enabled thiol oxidation, indicating a new GSH reaction pathway. Among annotated DBPs, chlorination favored unsaturated carbonyls, while chloramination generated more nitrile/nitro group DBPs. Toxicity predictions verified that annotated DBPs exhibited toxicities comparable to or greater than those of regulated DBPs. Prevalent toxic DBPs exhibited a high molecular weight or structural characters, such as benzene rings, carbonyls, and Cl/N functionalization. This approach significantly accelerated toxic DBP discovery, and the findings provided new insights into toxicity drivers in disinfected waters."

To study this sustainability paradox, we evaluated associations between per capita GHG emissions and mortality across 76 major countries from 1990 to 2019 and projected future trends. GHG emissions and mortality data were from the Global Carbon Project and Global Burden of Disease 2021, respectively. We identified an N-shaped nonlinear association with inflection points at five and 15 tons per capita. Mortality initially decreased with rising emissions when below five tons per capita with reductions in communicable diseases, then increased by 15 tons per capita with increments in noncommunicable diseases, and eventually slightly declined beyond 15 tons. Health inequality worsened, with the concentration index falling from −0.812 (1990) to −0.882 (2019), indicating longer life expectancies in low emitters. Males and older adults faced a higher climate-related mortality risk, including cardiovascular death and extreme temperature-related injuries. Projections under a low-emission scenario indicated greater mortality reductions for low- and middle-income countries from 2025 to 2040, whereas high-income countries were expected to meet complex trade-offs. Our findings highlight the urgent need for context-specific decarbonization and climate justice policies to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals."

This study developed and parametrized a dynamic energy budget theory-based toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TKTD) model to assess the mortality of immature whitefly stages and the impacts of spidoxamat exposure on fecundity and fertility in adults. The TKTD model was integrated into an individual-based model (IBM) to predict population dynamics and efficacy under field conditions, validated with field trial data from different locations in India, Pakistan, and Brazil. The integrated model identified optimal application strategies across varying pest pressure and temperature regimes. The IBM simulation results indicate that a second application can substantially enhance population control, particularly when timed between 7 and 14 days postinitial treatment, depending on ambient temperature and population structure. This timing is influenced by the efficacy half-life and the developmental duration of immature stages, emphasizing the importance of precise application strategies in managing B. tabaci populations effectively. The findings underscore the importance of integrating empirical data with modeling for a mechanistic understanding of effects and the development of effective pest management strategies in the face of evolving agricultural challenges."

In plants, BPA is easily conjugated to form conjugates such as glycosyl BPA, and humans can be exposed to such conjugates when ingesting BPA-contaminated plant foods. This study considered the potential of deconjugation of glycosyl BPA in a simulated human gastrointestinal tract system and evaluated the subsequent changes in biological activity using the Caco-2 colon cell model. Glycosyl BPA was found in both soil and lettuce with concentrations ranging from not detected (ND) to 82.51 ng/g dry weight in edible plant tissues, and the level of glycosyl BPA was correlated significantly with that of BPA. Gastrointestinal digestion triggered progressive deglycosylation of glycosyl BPA with the deconjugation rate significantly higher in the intestinal phase (41.7–47.8%) than the gastric phase (13.4–23.3%). Deglycosylation of glycosyl BPA was associated with decreased Caco-2 cell activity and increased markers of oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in the cell. The re-released BPA may be key to the increased toxic effects. These findings highlight the underestimated health risks posed by plant-derived conjugated xenobiotics through transformation reactivation in the human digestive system."

Here, we report the application and validation of the first automatic microplastic pretreatment unit, Shimadzu’s MAP-100, designed to standardize this critical step. The unit was evaluated using river water spiked with aged standard microplastics for controlled testing and field-collected seawater for real-sample validation. After automatic pretreatment, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectral integrity was preserved, enabling reliable polymer identification and recovery rate determination. Detection of soluble organic matter demonstrated effective organic matter removal. Mineral particles were completely eliminated, with zero residual mineral detection. The MAP-100 achieved a higher recovery of aged microplastics (95.6 ± 2.5%) than manual pretreatment (92.7 ± 3.0%), with the greatest improvement observed for small (≤1 mm) and high-density particles. In seawater samples, overall performance remained robust; however, foam microplastics showed reduced recovery due to the overflow tube’s narrow diameter and sharp curvature, indicating a need for structural refinement. Despite this limitation, the closed-loop automatic workflow substantially reduces labor and processing time while improving reproducibility and operational safety for standardized microplastic monitoring."

However, current analytical strategies cause information loss when using aggregated features and are unable to establish comprehensive associations between single-cell metallomic data and health outcomes. We developed an analytical framework with more accurate characterization of multimetal distribution features, enabling the integration of single-cell metallomic data into health-related studies. We used quantiles to comprehensively extract the features of multimetals in spermatozoa population. Then, machine learning and factor analysis further consolidated key features into interpretable indices of multimetal co-occurrence characteristics. This framework addressed the conservation of the pseudobulk method and bias of the single-cell method, due to a more detailed characterization and appropriate integration of multimetal features at single-cell resolution. We showcase a negative association between multiple metals and sperm motility in the Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) model with a 10% increase in the collective features of 34 metals corresponding to a 3.3% reduction in sperm motility. Notably, the contribution of the multifaceted effects of lead and platinum suggests that dynamic changes in metal distribution may hold biological significance comparable to their total content. Finally, the generalizability of this analytical framework was validated with an additional single-cell metallomic data set. This method facilitates the application of single-cell metallomic measurement techniques in health effect studies, providing deeper insights for understanding the collective biological roles of metals in multicell organisms."

Understanding the drivers of plastic ingestion is the key to developing a risk assessment. Although plastic availability, plastic–prey resemblance, degree of food selectivity, and the nutritional state of organisms have been identified as the four main drivers of plastic ingestion, we are still building an evidence base to support these drivers. To strengthen our knowledge of the drivers of plastic ingestion, we used two approaches: a systematic literature review and controlled experiments. Both approaches corroborated these factors as drivers of plastic ingestion, but despite these advances, studies are still needed that address holistic questions applicable to broader scenarios rather than focusing solely on taxon-specific traits or plastic characteristics in isolation from their ecological context. Additionally, a new driver has emerged─the social environment─which adds further complexity to how group formation may affect plastic ingestion across species."

In this paper we consider a simplified version of a LDAR program and demonstrate how to simulate the underlying system in an efficient manner, resulting in estimators of the quantities of interest that have a smaller variance than is possible using contemporary techniques. The proposed method relies on two ideas: the first is to leverage the underlying stochastic models to perform an event-driven simulation rather than a daily one; and the second is to use low-discrepancy sampling rather than plain random sampling to generate samples of potential scenarios for the underlying system, which results in a more systematic and balanced exploration of the scenario space. We show that in the context of a sensitivity analysis example, the proposed approach reduces the error of the estimates by factors of about 3 to 4 for the same computation time. This increased precision can provide conclusive statistical evidence that an LDAR program significantly reduces emissions compared to another, while the naive method’s error is often too large to draw any conclusion."

Fault cores formed by slow faulting exhibit much higher porosity and permeability compared to the surrounding damage zone and wall rocks, unlike those formed through brittle faulting. Since slow slip events associated with high pore fluid pressures are common in active tectonic regions, we propose that slow slip events can serve as a mechanism to maintain the permeable pathways beneath the seismogenic zone, facilitating the movement of mantle‐derived fluids from deep reservoirs toward the surface."

 The Afar depression in northeastern Ethiopia contains a rich palaeontological and archaeological record, which documents 6 million years of human evolution. Abundant faunal evidence links evolutionary patterns with palaeoenvironmental change as a principal underlying force1. Many of the earlier hominin taxa recognized today are found in the Afar, but Paranthropus has been conspicuously absent from the region. Here we report on the discovery, in the Mille-Logya research area, of a partial mandible that we attribute to Paranthropus, dated to between 2.5 and 2.9 million years ago and found in a well-understood chronological and faunal context. The find is among the oldest fossils attributable to Paranthropus and indicates that this genus, from its earliest known appearance, had a greater geographic distribution than previously documented2. Often seen as a dietary specialist feeding on tough food, the range of diverse habitats with which eastern African Paranthropus can now be associated shows that this suggested adaptive niche did not restrict its ability to disperse as widely as species of Australopithecus and early Homo. The discovery of Paranthropus in the Afar emphasizes how little is known about hominin evolution in eastern Africa during the crucial period between 3 and 2.5 million years ago, when this genus and the Homo lineage presumably emerged. With its attribution to Paranthropus, a 2.6-million-year-old partial mandible expands the range of the genus into the Afar region of Ethiopia and adds to our understanding of hominin evolution in eastern Africa."

 The ability to construct entirely new synthetic DNA sequences de novo is essential to engineering and studying biology. However, the ability to produce long complex synthetic DNA sequences and libraries currently lags behind the ability to sequence and edit DNA1,2. All existing DNA-assembly technologies rely on DNA sequence information found within the final construct to direct assembly between DNA molecules3–11. As a result of this paradigm, these sequences cannot be extensively optimized specifically for assembly without affecting the final sequence. To fundamentally address this challenge, here we show the development of a new DNA assembly technique named Sidewinder that separates the information that guides assembly from the final assembled sequence using DNA three-way junctions. We demonstrate the transformative nature of the Sidewinder technique with highly robust and accurate construction of a 40-piece multifragment assembly, complex DNA sequences of both high GC content and high repeats, parallel assembly of multiple distinct genes in the same reaction and a combinatorial library with a large number of diversified positions across the entire length of the gene for high coverage of a library of 442,368 variants. This technology enables high-fidelity DNA assembly with a misconnection rate at the three-way junction of approximately 1 in 1,000,000.

 Refrigeration is indispensable to modern society1, yet the dominant vapour-compression systems rely on environmentally harmful fluorocarbon refrigerants with high global warming potential2–4. Solid-state caloric refrigeration offers a low-carbon alternative5–7, but its practical deployment has been hindered by limited cooling capacity and the inefficient indirect heat transfer that requires secondary fluids. Here we report an extreme barocaloric effect in NH4SCN aqueous solutions enabled by pressure-tuned dissolution and precipitation. This mechanism delivers an exceptionally large cooling capacity and markedly enhanced cooling efficiency. We obtain an in situ temperature drop of 26.8 K in the solution at room temperature, surpassing all known caloric materials. A Carnot-like cycle is designed to deliver 67 J g−1 cooling capacity per cycle with a second-law efficiency of 77%, benefiting from the extremely large temperature drops and direct heat transfer due to the self-circulating aqueous solution. Beyond the phase-transition scenario, this dissolution-based approach that combines the merits of current leading technologies emerges as a promising sustainable refrigeration solution.

 Physiological and pathological processes such as inflammation and cancer emerge from interactions between cells over time1. However, methods to follow cell populations over time within the native context of a human tissue are lacking because a biopsy offers only a single snapshot. Here we present one-shot tissue dynamics reconstruction (OSDR), an approach to estimate a dynamical model of cell populations based on a single tissue sample. OSDR uses spatial proteomics to learn how the composition of cellular neighbourhoods influences division rate, providing a dynamical model of cell population change over time. We apply OSDR to human breast cancer data2–4, and reconstruct two fixed points of fibroblasts and macrophage interactions5,6. These fixed points correspond to hot and cold fibrosis7, in agreement with co-culture experiments that measured these dynamics directly8. We then use OSDR to discover a pulse-generating excitable circuit of T and B cells in the tumour microenvironment, suggesting temporal flares of anticancer immune responses. Finally, we study longitudinal biopsies from a triple-negative breast cancer clinical trial3, in which OSDR predicts the collapse of the tumour cell population in responders but not in non-responders, based on early-treatment biopsies. OSDR can be applied to a wide range of spatial proteomics assays to enable analysis of tissue dynamics based on patient biopsies.

 The recent discovery of altermagnetism was in part motivated by the research of compensated magnets towards highly scalable spintronic technologies. Simultaneously, altermagnetism shares the anisotropic higher-partial-wave nature of ordering with unconventional superfluid phases, which have been at the forefront of research for the past several decades. These examples illustrate the interest in altermagnetism from a broad range of science and technology perspectives. Here we review the symmetry, microscopy and spectroscopy signatures of altermagnetism. We describe the spontaneously broken and retained symmetries that delineate altermagnetism as a distinct phase of matter with d-, g- or i-wave compensated collinear spin ordering. In materials ranging from weakly interacting metals to strongly correlated insulators, the microscopic crystal-structure realizations of the altermagnetic symmetries feature a characteristic ferroic order of anisotropic higher-partial-wave components of atomic-scale spin densities. These symmetry and microscopy signatures of altermagnetism are directly reflected in spin-dependent electronic spectra and responses. We review salient band-structure features originating from the altermagnetic ordering, and from its interplay with spin–orbit coupling and topological phenomena. Throughout, we compare altermagnetism with traditional ferromagnetism and Néel antiferromagnetism, and with magnetic phases with symmetry-protected compensated non-collinear spin orders. We accompany the theoretical discussions with references to relevant experiments.

 The mammalian cerebral cortex comprises a complex neuronal network that maintains a precise balance between excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. Accumulating evidence indicates that specific interneuron subtypes form stereotyped microcircuits with distinct pyramidal neuron classes1–3. Here we show that pyramidal neurons have an active role in this process by promoting the survival and terminal differentiation of their associated interneuron subtypes. In the wild-type cortex, interneuron subtype abundance mirrors the prevalence of their pyramidal neuron partners. In Fezf2 mutants, which lack L5b pyramidal neurons and are expanded in L6 intratelencephalic neurons, corresponding subtype-specific shifts occur through two distinct mechanisms: somatostatin interneurons adjust their programmed cell death, whereas parvalbumin interneurons switch their subtype identity. Silencing neuronal activity or blocking vesicular release in L5b pyramidal neurons revealed that their communication with interneurons does not require voltage-gated synaptic activity but engages both tetanus toxin-sensitive and tetanus toxin-insensitive pathways. Moreover, a targeted bioinformatic screen for ligand–receptor pairs displaying subtype-specific expression and reduced expression of pyramidal neuron-derived ligand in Fezf2 mutants identified candidate secreted factors and adhesion molecules. These findings reveal distinct, pyramidal neuron-driven mechanisms for sculpting interneuron diversity and integrating them into local cortical circuits.

 The Indonesian archipelago is host to some of the earliest known rock art in the world1–5. Previously, secure Pleistocene dates were reported for figurative cave art and stencils of human hands in two areas in Indonesia—the Maros-Pangkep karsts in the southwestern peninsula of the island of Sulawesi1,3–5 and the Sangkulirang-Mangkalihat region of eastern Kalimantan, Borneo2. Here we describe a series of early dated rock art motifs from the southeastern portion of Sulawesi. Among this assemblage of Pleistocene (and possibly more recent) motifs, laser-ablation U-series (LA-U-series) dating of calcite overlying a hand stencil from Liang Metanduno on Muna Island yielded a U-series date of 71.6 ± 3.8 thousand years ago (ka), providing a minimum-age constraint of 67.8 ka for the underlying motif. The Muna minimum (67.8 ± 3.8 ka) exceeds the published minimum for rock art in Maros-Pangkep by 16.6 thousand years (kyr) (ref. 5) and is 1.1 kyr greater than the published minimum for a hand stencil from Spain attributed to Neanderthals6, which until now represented the oldest demonstrated minimum-age constraint for cave art worldwide. Moreover, the presence of this extremely old art in Sulawesi suggests that the initial peopling of Sahul about 65 ka7 involved maritime journeys between Borneo and Papua, a region that remains poorly explored from an archaeological perspective. A hand stencil painted on a cave wall on a small island off the coast of Sulawesi more than 67,800 years ago suggests a very early occupation of Wallacea."

 Sub-Neptunes and super-Earths, the most abundant types of planet in the galaxy, are unlike anything in the Solar System, with radii between those of Earth and Neptune1,2. Fundamental questions remain regarding their structure and origin. Although super-Earths have a rocky composition3, sub-Neptunes form a distinct population at larger radii and are thought to consist of a rocky core overlain by a hydrogen-rich envelope4,5. At the extreme conditions of the core–envelope interface (exceeding several gigapascals and several thousand kelvin4,6), reaction between core and envelope seems possible, but the nature and extent of these reactions are unknown. Here we use first-principles molecular dynamics driven by density functional theory to show that silicate and hydrogen are completely miscible over a wide range of plausible core–envelope pressure–temperature conditions. We find the origin of miscibility in extensive chemical reaction between hydrogen and silicate, producing silane, SiO and water species, which may be observable with ongoing or future missions. Core–envelope miscibility profoundly affects the evolution of sub-Neptunes and super-Earths, by dissolving a large fraction of the hydrogen of the planet in the core and driving exchange of hydrogen between core and envelope as the planet evolves. First-principles molecular dynamics driven by density functional theory is used to show that silicate and hydrogen are completely miscible over a wide range of plausible core–envelope pressure–temperature conditions."

 Vertebrate vision is mainly accommodated by a pair of lateral image-forming camera-type eyes and is supplemented in non-mammalian vertebrates by a dorsal pineal complex (pineal and parapineal organs) functioning as photoreceptive and/or endocrine organs1. The pineal complex shares a common genetic and embryological basis with the lateral eyes, both derived from evaginations during the development of diencephalon2. Despite being widely heralded as the ‘third eye’ in crown vertebrates3, the nature of the pineal complex and its presumed visual capability in early vertebrates2 remain unknown. Here we describe two pigmented features situated between the lateral eyes in two species of myllokunmingids, the earliest known fossil vertebrates (approximately 518 million years ago), and interpret these as pineal/parapineal organs. In both myllokunmingid species, the pineal complex contains abundant melanin-containing melanosomes identical to those in the retinal pigment epithelium in the lateral eyes, together with a distinctive, regularly ovoid structure interpreted as a lens. Our results indicate that the lateral eyes and pineal complex in myllokunmingids probably functioned as camera-type eyes capable of image formation. Thus, we propose that the four camera-type eyes represent an ancestral vertebrate character, corroborating hypotheses about the deep homology between the eyes and pineal complex. Early vertebrates, particularly myllokunmingids, possessed four camera-type eyes (a pair of lateral eyes and pineal and parapineal organs), which indicates that these structures functioned in image formation, in support of the hypothesis that the four camera-type eyes represent an ancestral vertebrate trait."

 Cereblon (CRBN) is the target of thalidomide derivatives1 that achieve therapeutic efficacy against some haematologic neoplasias2–4 by recruiting neosubstrates for degradation5–7. Despite the intense investigation of orthosteric thalidomide derivatives, little is known about alternate binding sites on CRBN. Here we report an evolutionarily conserved cryptic allosteric binding site on CRBN. Small-molecule SB-405483 binds the allosteric site to cooperatively enhance the binding of orthosteric ligands and alter their neosubstrate degradation profiles. A survey of over 100 orthosteric ligands and their degradation targets reveals trends in the classes of compounds and neosubstrates in which degradation outcomes are enhanced or inhibited by SB-405483. Structural investigations provide a mechanistic basis for the effects of the allosteric ligand by shifting the conformational distribution of CRBNopen to a novel CRBNint and increasing the CRBNclosed state. The discovery of a cryptic allosteric binding site on CRBN that alters the functional effects of orthosteric ligands opens new directions with broad implications for improving the selectivity and efficacy of CRBN therapeutics. An allosteric site on the E3 ligase adapter cereblon can be targeted to modulate the efficacy of cereblon in targeted protein degradation applications."

 Behaviours are adaptive traits evolving through natural selection. Crucially, the genetic, molecular and neural modifications that shape behavioural innovations are poorly understood1. Here, we identify specialized adaptations linked to the evolution of invertebrate aggression2. Using the predatory nematode Pristionchus pacificus, we developed a machine learning model from behavioural tracking data and identified robust behavioural states associated with aggressive episodes. Strikingly, predatory aggression coincides with a rewiring of key circuits across nematode evolution. We find modifications to the noradrenergic pathway, with octopamine promoting aggressive predatory bouts whereas tyramine antagonistically induces passive states. Modulation occurs through the octopamine receptors Ppa-ser-3 and Ppa-ser-6, and tyramine receptor Ppa-lgc-55. These localize to sensory neurons whose inhibition diminishes aggressive events. Crucially, this octopaminergic innovation emerged within this predatory lineage, consistent with an ancient divergence in function. Thus, evolutionary adaptations in noradrenergic circuits facilitated the emergence of aggressive behavioural states associated with complex predatory traits. Noradrenergic circuits support and balance aggressive behavioural states in predatory nematodes, distinguish predatory from non-predatory nematode species and are associated with the evolution of complex behavioural traits."

 Earth’s early mantle probably existed as a deep, vigorously convecting magma ocean, and its solidification is considered central to the long-term chemical and dynamical evolution of the planet. Yet a notable uncertainty is the grain size of bridgmanite—the dominant lower-mantle phase—whose nucleation behaviour at extreme pressure has remained experimentally inaccessible. Here we show, using a combination of cutting-edge techniques, including large-scale molecular dynamics simulations consisting of up to 1 million atoms driven by machine learning potentials (MLPs), seeding and enhanced sampling, that crystal–melt interfacial energies of MgSiO3 bridgmanite increase substantially with pressure, surpassing those of silicate–liquid systems at ambient pressure by a factor of up to ten (refs. 1–3). In a deep basal magma ocean (BMO), this amplified interfacial energy, combined with the potential sluggish cooling, may permit the formation of unusually large bridgmanite crystals, up to centimetre-to-metre-scale sizes. Such potentially large crystals could drive efficient fractional crystallization and cause substantial chemical differentiation and mantle compaction. If operative, this mechanism would provide a new physical pathway linking lower-mantle material properties to early Earth stratification and it motivates future geodynamic models that explicitly incorporate supercooling, compositional convection and elemental partitioning. Our findings thus offer a plausible hypothesis connecting microscopic nucleation processes with macroscopic planetary structure, refining present views of how the Earth’s interior acquired its initial compositional architecture. Large-scale molecular dynamics simulations show that the crystal–melt interfacial energies of MgSiO3 bridgmanite increase substantially with pressure, potentially forming unusually large bridgmanite crystals and suggesting a new physical mechanism driving magma ocean segregation."

 Neurodegenerative diseases affect 1 in 12 people globally and remain incurable. Central to their pathogenesis is a loss of neuronal protein maintenance and the accumulation of protein aggregates with ageing1,2. Here we engineered bioorthogonal tools3 that enabled us to tag the nascent neuronal proteome and study its turnover with ageing, its propensity to aggregate and its interaction with microglia. We show that neuronal protein half-life approximately doubles on average between 4-month-old and 24-month-old mice, with the stability of individual proteins differing among brain regions. Furthermore, we describe the aged neuronal ‘aggregome’, which encompasses 1,726 proteins, nearly half of which show reduced degradation with age. The aggregome includes well-known proteins linked to diseases and numerous proteins previously not associated with neurodegeneration. Notably, we demonstrate that neuronal proteins accumulate in aged microglia, with 54% also displaying reduced degradation and/or aggregation with age. Among these proteins, synaptic proteins are highly enriched, which suggests that there is a cascade of events that emerge from impaired synaptic protein turnover and aggregation to the disposal of these proteins, possibly through microglial engulfment of synapses. These findings reveal the substantial loss of neuronal proteome maintenance with ageing, which could be causal for age-related synapse loss and cognitive decline. Newly developed mouse models that enable cell-specific analyses of proteostasis dynamics across the lifespan of the mice reveal key aspects of neuronal proteostasis with ageing."

 Neural tissues are exceptionally sensitive to oxygen deprivation and rely on a dense network of blood vessels to support their extraordinarily high metabolic demands for oxygen, nutrients and clearance of waste products1–4. In birds, one of the metabolically most demanding neural tissue—the retina—lacks internal blood vessels5,6. This raises the question of how such a metabolically demanding neural tissue can function without blood perfusion. Here we show that, while the photoreceptor outer segments in the outer retina have access to oxygen, the inner bird retina operates under chronic anoxia, supported by anaerobic glycolysis in the retinal neurons. We provide evidence that the pecten oculi—a uniquely vascularized structure in the vitreous humour of birds, the function of which has been debated for centuries5–9—supplies the anoxic inner retina with glucose and removes lactic acid. We suggest that the pecten’s metabolic support of the bird retina’s anoxia tolerance enabled first the evolution of a thick cell-dense, avascular retina, which secondarily served as an exaptation enabling retinal function during high-altitude migrations. While the photoreceptor outer segments in the bird outer retina have access to oxygen, the inner retina operates under chronic anoxia, supported by anaerobic glycolysis in the retinal neurons."

Recent studies have suggested that plasticity in solid tumours is concentrated in a minority subset of cancer cells4–6, yet functional studies examining this high-plasticity cell state (HPCS) in situ are lacking. Here we develop mouse models enabling the detection, longitudinal lineage tracing and ablation of the HPCS in autochthonous lung tumours in vivo. Lineage tracing reveals that the HPCS cells possess a high capacity for cell state transitions, giving rise to both early neoplastic (differentiated) and progressed lung cancer cell states in situ. Longitudinal lineage tracing using secreted luciferases reveals that HPCS-derived cells have a high capacity for growth compared with bulk cancer cells or another cancer cell state with features of differentiated lung epithelium. Ablation of HPCS cells in early neoplasias abrogates benign-to-malignant transition, whereas ablation in established tumours by suicide gene or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells robustly reduces tumour burden. We further demonstrate that the HPCS gives rise to therapy-resistant cell states, whereas HPCS ablation suppresses resistance to chemotherapy and oncoprotein-targeted therapy. Notably, an HPCS-like state is ubiquitous in regenerating epithelia and in carcinomas of multiple other tissues, revealing a convergence of plasticity programs. Our work establishes the HPCS as a critical hub enabling reciprocal transitions between cancer cell states. Targeting the HPCS in lung cancer and in other carcinomas may suppress cancer progression and eradicate treatment resistance. The high-plasticity cell state (HPCS) is a critical hub that enables reciprocal transitions between cancer cell states, and targeting the HPCS may suppress cancer progression and eradicate treatment resistance."

 At every scale they occupy, magnetic fields affect various phenomena, including star formation, cosmic-ray transport, charged-particle acceleration, space weather, transport in planetary atmospheres and laboratory plasmas. These fields are often generated and sustained by turbulent flows in a process called the dynamo. In 1955, E. N. Parker parameterized the effects of small-scale turbulence to propose a mean-field dynamo theory1. The widely used theory reproduces observed large-scale fields but suffers from difficulty in tuning parameters as they are not justified from first principles: studies of turbulent flows show tangled magnetic fields, which are folded and fragmented into small-scale structures owing to shear-flow straining2,3. Here, considering a shear flow that is unstable and driven, we develop analytic theory and perform three-dimensional, advanced computer simulations of turbulence with up to 4,096 × 4,096 × 8,192 grid points, showing ab initio generation of quasi-periodic, large-scale magnetic fields. The generation occurs via the mean-vorticity effect—an additional mean-field dynamo process postulated4 in 1990. Crucial to this dynamo is the prior generation of large-scale three-dimensional jets, robustly produced as topologically protected and exact nonlinear solutions of the magnetohydrodynamic equations. The jet-driven dynamo applies to shear-driven laboratory and astrophysical systems. These include binary neutron star mergers5,6, where the reported dynamo probably operates on microsecond timescales to produce in milliseconds some of the strongest magnetic fields in the Universe7, providing signals for multi-messenger astronomy8.

 The leading cause of human pregnancy loss is aneuploidy, often tracing to errors in chromosome segregation during female meiosis1,2. Although abnormal crossover recombination is known to confer risk for aneuploidy3,4, limited data have hindered understanding of the potential shared genetic basis of these key molecular phenotypes. To address this gap, we performed retrospective analysis of pre-implantation genetic testing data from 139,416 in vitro fertilized embryos from 22,850 sets of biological parents. By tracing transmission of haplotypes, we identified 3,809,412 crossovers, as well as 92,485 aneuploid chromosomes. Counts of crossovers were lower in aneuploid versus euploid embryos, consistent with their role in chromosome pairing and segregation. Our analyses further revealed that a common haplotype spanning the meiotic cohesin SMC1B is associated significantly with both crossover count and maternal meiotic aneuploidy, with evidence supporting a non-coding cis-regulatory mechanism. Transcriptome- and phenome-wide association tests also implicated variation in the synaptonemal complex component C14orf39 and crossover-regulating ubiquitin ligases CCNB1IP1 and RNF212 in meiotic aneuploidy risk. More broadly, variants associated with aneuploidy often showed secondary associations with recombination, and several also exhibited associations with reproductive ageing traits. Our findings highlight the dual role of recombination in generating genetic diversity, while ensuring meiotic fidelity.

Pollen,Dissecting gene regulatory networks governing human cortical cell fate,"Systematic screening of transcription factors reveals conserved mechanisms governing cortical radial glia lineage progression across primates and provides a framework for functional dissection of gene regulatory networks in human cortical neurogenesis. 
 Human cortical neurogenesis involves conserved and specialized developmental processes during a restricted window of prenatal development. Radial glia (RG) neural stem cells shape cortical cell diversity by giving rise to excitatory neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, as well as olfactory bulb interneurons (INs) and a recently characterized population of cortical INs1,2. Complex genetic programs orchestrated by transcription factor (TF) circuits govern the balance between self-renewal and differentiation, and between different cell fates3–8. Despite progress in measuring gene regulatory network activity during human cortical development9–12, functional studies are required to evaluate the roles of TFs and effector genes in human RG lineage progression. Here we establish a human primary culture system that allows sensitive discrimination of cell fate dynamics and apply single-cell CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screening13,14 to examine the transcriptional and cell fate consequences of 44 TFs active during cortical neurogenesis. We identified several TFs with new roles in cortical neurogenesis, including ZNF219—previously uncharacterized—that represses neural differentiation and NR2E1 and ARX that have opposing roles in regulating RG lineage plasticity and progression across developmental stages. We also detected convergent effector genes downstream of multiple TFs enriched in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders and observed conserved mechanisms of RG lineage plasticity across primates. We further uncovered a post-mitotic role for ARX in safeguarding IN subtype specification through repressing LMO1. Our study provides a framework for dissecting regulatory networks driving cell fate consequences during human neurogenesis. Systematic screening of transcription factors reveals conserved mechanisms governing cortical radial glia lineage progression across primates and provides a framework for functional dissection of gene regulatory networks in human cortical neurogenesis."

 Sensing technologies that exploit quantum phenomena for measurement are finding increasing applications across materials, physical and biological sciences1–7. Until recently, biological candidates for quantum sensors were limited to in vitro systems, had poor sensitivity and were prone to light-induced degradation. These limitations impeded practical biotechnological applications, and high-throughput study that would facilitate their engineering and optimization. We recently developed a class of magneto-sensitive fluorescent proteins including MagLOV, which overcomes many of these challenges8. Here we show that through directed evolution, it is possible to engineer these proteins to alter the properties of their response to magnetic fields and radio frequencies. We find that MagLOV exhibits optically detected magnetic resonance in living bacterial cells at room temperature, at sufficiently high signal-to-noise for single-cell detection. These effects are explained through the radical-pair mechanism, which involves the protein backbone and a bound flavin cofactor. Using optically detected magnetic resonance and fluorescence magnetic-field effects, we explore a range of applications, including spatial localization of fluorescence signals using gradient fields (that is, magnetic resonance imaging using a genetically encoded probe), sensing of the molecular microenvironment, multiplexing of bio-imaging and lock-in detection, mitigating typical biological imaging challenges such as light scattering and autofluorescence. Taken together, our results represent a suite of sensing modalities for engineered biological systems, based on and designed around understanding the quantum-mechanical properties of magneto-sensitive fluorescent proteins.

 Membrane transport proteins translocate diverse cargos, ranging from small sugars to entire proteins, across cellular membranes1–3. A few structurally distinct protein families have been described that account for most of the known membrane transport processes4–6. However, many membrane proteins with predicted transporter functions remain uncharacterized. Here we determined the structure of Escherichia coli LetAB, a phospholipid transporter involved in outer membrane integrity, and found that LetA adopts a distinct architecture that is structurally and evolutionarily unrelated to known transporter families. LetA localizes to the inner membrane, where it is poised to load lipids into its binding partner, LetB, a mammalian cell entry (MCE) protein that forms an approximately 225 Å long tunnel for lipid transport across the cell envelope. Unexpectedly, the LetA transmembrane domains adopt a fold that is evolutionarily related to the eukaryotic tetraspanin family of membrane proteins, including transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) and claudins. Through a combination of deep mutational scanning, molecular dynamics simulations, AlphaFold-predicted alternative states and functional studies, we present a model for how the LetA-like family of membrane transporters facilitates the transport of lipids across the bacterial cell envelope.

 The quantum superposition principle is a fundamental concept of physics1 and the basis of numerous quantum technologies2,3. Yet, it is still often regarded counterintuitive because we do not observe its key features on the macroscopic scales of our daily lives. It is, therefore, interesting to ask how quantum properties persist or change as we increase the size and complexity of objects4. A model test for this question can be realized by matter-wave interferometry, in which the motion of individual massive particles becomes delocalized and needs to be described by a wave function that spans regions far larger than the particle itself5. Over the years, this has been explored with a series of objects of increasing mass and complexity6–9 and a growing community aims at pushing this to ever larger limits. Here we present an experimental platform that extends matter-wave interference to large metal clusters, a qualitatively new material class for quantum experiments. We specifically demonstrate quantum interference of sodium nanoparticles, which can each contain more than 7,000 atoms at masses greater than 170,000 Da. They propagate in a Schrödinger cat state with a macroscopicity10 of μ = 15.5, surpassing previous experiments5,9,11 by an order of magnitude.

 The Last Glacial Maximum (19–23 thousand years ago) was characterized by low greenhouse gas concentrations and continental ice sheets that covered large parts of North America and Europe1. Glacial climate was therefore very different, with colder global mean temperatures and an increased Equator-to-pole temperature gradient, probably resulting in stronger westerlies2. However, the state of the deep North Atlantic Ocean under these glacial climate forcings remains uncertain3–6, particularly owing to the rarity of deep-ocean temperature and salinity constraints. Here we show that the temperature of the glacial deep (>1.5 km) Northwest Atlantic was approximately 0–2 °C (only 1.8 ± 0.5 °C (2 s.e.) colder than today), and, after accounting for the whole-ocean change, seawater δ18O was 0.3 ± 0.1‰ (2 s.e.) higher and can be traced back to the surface subtropics via the subpolar Northeast Atlantic and Nordic Seas. Together, our hydrographic data reveal the thermal and isotopic structure of the deep Northwest Atlantic and suggest sustained production of relatively warm and probably salty North Atlantic Deep Water during the Last Glacial Maximum. Furthermore, our results provide updated constraints for benchmarking Earth system models used to project future climate change. During the Last Glacial Maximum, the deep Northwest Atlantic was only about 2 °C colder than today, suggesting sustained production of relatively warm North Atlantic Deep Water during the Last Glacial Maximum."

 The early infant microbiome is largely primed by microbial transmission from the mother between birth and the first few weeks of life1–3, but how interpersonal transmission further shapes the developing microbiome in the first year remains unexplored. Here we report a metagenomic survey to model microbiome transmission in the nursery setting among babies attending the first year, their educators and their families (n = 134 individuals). We performed dense longitudinal microbiome sampling (n = 1,013 faecal samples) during the first year of nursery and tracked microbial strain transmission within and between nursery groups across 3 different facilities. We detected extensive baby-to-baby microbiome transmission within nursery groups even after only 1 month of nursery attendance, with nursery-acquired strains accounting for a proportion of the infant gut microbiome comparable to that from family by the end of the first term. Baby-to-baby transmission continued to grow over the nursery year, in an increasingly intricate transmission network with single strains spreading in some classes, and with multiple baby-acquisition and species-transmissibility patterns. Having siblings was associated with higher microbiome diversity and reduced strain acquisition from nursery peers, while antibiotic treatment was the condition that most accounted for the increased influx of strains. This study shows that microbiome transmission between babies is extensive during the first year of nursery, and points to social interactions in infancy as crucial drivers of infant microbiome development.

 Fibre electronic devices are transforming traditional fibres and garments into new-generation wearables that can actively interact with human bodies and the environment to shape future life1–5. Fibre electronic devices have achieved almost all of the desired functions, such as powering6,7, sensing8,9 and display10,11 functions. However, viable information-processing fibres, which lie at the heart of building intelligent interactive fibre systems similar to any electronic product, remain the missing piece of the puzzle12–15. Here we fill this gap by creating a fibre integrated circuit (FIC) with unprecedented microdevice density and multimodal processing capacity. The integration density reaches 100,000 transistors per centimetre, which effectively satisfies the requirements for interactive fibre systems. The FICs can not only process digital and analogue signals similar to typical commercial arithmetic chips but also achieve high-recognition-accuracy neural computing similar to that of the state-of-the-art in-memory image processors. The FICs are stable under harsh service conditions that bulky and planar counterparts have difficulty withstanding, such as repeated bending and abrasion for 10,000 cycles, stretching to 30%, twisting at an angle of 180° cm−1 and even crushing by a container truck weighing 15.6 tons. The realization of FICs enables closed-loop systems in a single fibre, without the need for any external rigid and bulky information processors. We demonstrate that this fully flexible fibre system paves the way for the interaction pattern desired in many cutting-edge applications, for example, brain–computer interfaces, smart textiles and virtual-reality wearables. This work presents new insights that can promote the development of fibre devices towards intelligent systems.

 The movement of dendritic cells and T cells within secondary lymphoid organs is critical for the development of adaptive immune responses1,2. Central to this process is the fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC) network, which forms a highly organized conduit system that facilitates the movement of and interactions between dendritic cells and T cells3–6. Previous studies have partly characterized how FRCs support these interactions7,8. However, the molecular mechanisms that operate under physiological conditions remain unknown. Here we show that the viral protein m11, encoded by the herpesvirus murine cytomegalovirus (CMV), inhibits antiviral immunity by targeting the FRC network and interfering with a critical function of cellular CD44. We found that m11 binds to CD44 and established that m11 perturbs the molecular interactions of CD44 with its natural ligand, hyaluronic acid. The interaction of m11 with CD44 impairs the trafficking of dendritic cells within the spleen, thereby impeding efficient priming of naive T cells and the initiation of antiviral CD8 T cell responses. The targeting of CD44 by CMV reveals CD44 as a molecule that is essential to the functioning of the FRC network and uncovers a previously unrecognized stroma-based mechanism that is critical for the generation of effective T cell responses. CD44 expressed by fibroblastic reticular cells in secondary lymphoid organs regulates trafficking of dendritic cells, and thus has an essential role in the priming of T cells and the adaptive immune response."

 Schizophrenia and related psychoses occur in all human populations, with the highest rates of diagnosis among Black individuals and those of mainly African ancestry1. Decades of research have established a highly heritable and polygenic basis for schizophrenia, which is mostly shared across populations2–4. However, a recruitment bias towards European cohorts5 has led to discoveries that are poorly generalizable to African populations. This exclusion of the world’s most genetically diverse populations narrows our understanding of disease biology and risks exacerbating health disparities. Here we show that electronic health records linked with genomic data from the Million Veteran Program (MVP)6—a national research programme that looks at the effects of genes, lifestyle, military experiences and exposures on the health and wellness of veterans—enable a comprehensive assessment of schizophrenia genetics in populations of African ancestry in the USA. We identify ancestry-independent associations in African populations and expand the catalogue of implicated regions by more than 100 loci. Through statistical fine-mapping and integrative transcriptomic analyses, we refine disease-associated signals to consensus genes with convergent neurobiological functions. These findings provide a much-needed view of schizophrenia’s genetic architecture in populations of African ancestry, and offer biological insights that both extend previous work and broaden its global relevance.

 The vertebrate central nervous system is protected by the blood–brain barrier and meningeal membranes, which ensure immune privilege1. In the mammalian brain, microglia and barrier-associated or border-associated macrophages (BAMs) provide immune surveillance and scavenge wastes2, yet how evolution shaped immune-cell diversity and function is not understood. In zebrafish, a vascular-derived mural lymphatic endothelial cell (muLEC) lineage fulfils scavenger cell functions at central nervous system borders3–5. Here we identify the transcription factor odd-skipped related 2 (osr2) as a specific marker and regulator of muLEC differentiation and maintenance. osr2 controls the transition of muLECs from interconnected endothelial cells to individual scavenger cells in part by means of control of cadherin-6. muLECs are more transcriptionally similar to BAMs than to other mammalian meningeal cells and share several functions in tissue homeostasis. However, BAMs are absent from zebrafish and muLECs from mice and humans. Analysis of osr2, lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) and BAM markers in diverse vertebrate species reveals muLECs as an ancient lineage and BAMs a recent mammalian specialization. muLECs and BAMs share functional analogies but are not homologous, providing an example of convergent evolution. This highlights the physiological importance of meningeal scavenger cells and the developmental plasticity of LECs in generating specialized cell types throughout evolution.

 Tissue-resident macrophages (RTMs) form during embryogenesis, self-renew locally, and regulate tissue homeostasis by clearing dead cells and debris1–6. During tissue damage, however, bone-marrow-derived monocytes enter tissues and differentiate into RTMs, repairing the tissue and replenishing macrophages in the niche1. The universal cell-intrinsic mechanisms that control the monocyte-to-RTM transition and the maintenance of mature RTMs across tissues remain elusive3. Here we show that deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS), an enzyme that mediates spermidine-dependent hypusine modification of translation factor eIF5A5,7, is required for RTM differentiation and maintenance. Mice with myeloid cell lack of DHPS (Dhps-ΔM mice) had a global defect in RTMs across tissues, resulting in persistent but ultimately futile monocyte influx. Transcriptional analyses of DHPS-deficient macrophages indicated a block in their ability to differentiate into mature RTMs, whereas proteomics revealed defects in cell adhesion and signalling pathways. Sequencing of ribosome-engaged transcripts identified a subset of mRNAs involved in cell adhesion and signalling that rely on DHPS for efficient translation. Imaging of DHPS-deficient macrophages in tissues showed differences in morphology and tissue interactions, which were correlated with their failed RTM differentiation. DHPS-deficient macrophages were also defective in critical homeostatic RTM functions including efferocytosis and tissue maintenance. Together, our results demonstrate a cell-intrinsic, tissue-agnostic pathway that drives differentiation of monocyte-derived macrophages into RTMs. In mice, DHPS supports the maturation, maintenance and function of tissue-resident macrophages via the polyamine–hypusine axis, with implications for macrophage-targeting therapies."

 The psychedelic psilocybin may have lasting therapeutic effects for patients with chronic pain syndromes. Some preclinical data suggest these putative benefits derive from direct analgesic effects; however, this possibility has not been comprehensively tested in preclinical models. Here, we evaluated the analgesic properties of a single exposure to psilocybin at acute and chronic time points in Complete Freund’s Adjuvant-induced inflammatory pain, spared nerve injury model of neuropathic pain, and acid-induced muscle pain. Across these models, we tested a range of doses (0.3, 2, and 10 mg/kg i.p.) in male and female mice using multiple behavioral assays evaluating sensory aspects (von Frey, cold plate, Hargreaves, thermal place preference, and muscle withdrawal threshold) and functional aspects of pain (marble burying). We further tested the effects of psilocybin on the affective dimension of pain in a surgical model of acute pain (mouse grimace scale). Except for cold sensitivity, we found no effect of psilocybin across pain models, behavioral assays, drug doses, or sex. The apparent reduction in cold sensitivity may be explained by profound hypothermia induced by psilocybin rather than true analgesia.

Here, the authors synthesise a family of hybrid metal halide glasses, and show that the molecular shape and polarity determine rotational disorder, enabling diverse glass-forming abilities. 
 The critical progression of structural disorder, which governs the bulk glass-forming ability (GFA), can be elucidated as an ergodicity-breaking process. Understanding the atomic characteristics involved is imperative for establishing advanced glass design principles. However, conventional glasses present significant challenges due to their inherently complex and ambiguous disorder motifs, such as intricate and random atomic clusters or ring distributions. In this work, we synthesize a family of zero-dimensional hybrid metal halides with tunable short- to medium-range structural arrangements to form glasses with diverse GFAs. Through altering molecular shape and surface electrostatic potential of organic cations, their rotational order is able to be broken in a controlled manner. This leads to distinct phase space partitions of molecular movements, allowing for tunable GFAs. Our findings provide a fundamental design approach for synthesizing property-oriented glasses by controlling molecular rotational order, which can be applicable to a wide range of molecular glasses and amorphous solids. Revealing the structural features governing ergodicity breaking is critical to understanding glass formation.

Here the authors proposing a molecular cocrystal strategy that introduces directional non-covalent interactions into molecular systems to weaken the original interactions triggering the spontaneous deformation. 
 Organic molecular crystals with controllable bending angles are crucial interconnectors in integrated optoelectronic chips, which can precisely guide optical signals along a predetermined path to achieve effective optical path steering. Nevertheless, current methods of tailoring molecular crystals with desired bent geometric features yet without fractured bending interface has not yet been fully realized. Here, we addresses this issue by proposing a universal “molecular cocrystal” strategy that introduces directional charge-transfer non-covalent interactions into molecular systems to weaken the original interactions, thereby triggering the spontaneous deformation transition from crystal slippage to bending. Significantly, a diverse range of self-assembled bent crystals with accurate angles ranging from 61.8° to 85.0° have been synthesized without destroying the structural integrity of the crystals. The proposed strategy is also applied to construct hierarchical bent microstructures with 2 to 6 bends. These as-prepared bent crystals exhibit excitation position-dependent anisotropic optical behaviors, which are applied into the photonics switch with adjustable on/off ratio. This methodology offers a versatile pathway to purposely design bent crystals with tailored angles, thereby laying a structural foundation for the on-chip organic optoelectronics.

Here, authors show spatiotemporal gene-expression maps across neuronal types revealing ligand receptor interactions that support migration and circuit formation. 
 The cerebral cortex comprises diverse excitatory and inhibitory neuron subtypes, each with distinct laminar positions and connectivity patterns. Yet, the molecular logic underlying their precise wiring remains poorly understood. To identify ligand–receptor (LR) interactions involved in cortical circuit assembly, we tracked gene expression dynamics in mice across major neuronal populations at 17 developmental stages using single-cell transcriptomics. This generated a comprehensive atlas of LR-mediated communication between excitatory and inhibitory neuron subtypes, capturing known and novel interactions. Notably, we identified NEOGENIN-1 as the principal receptor for CBLN4 during the perinatal period, mediating synapse formation between somatostatin-expressing interneurons and glutamatergic neurons. We also identified members of the cadherin superfamily as candidate regulators of perisomatic inhibition from parvalbumin-expressing basket cells onto deep and superficial excitatory neurons, exerting opposing effects on synapse formation. These findings suggest a context-dependent role for cadherins in synaptic specificity and underscore the power of single-cell transcriptomics for decoding the molecular mechanisms of cortical wiring. Ligand–receptor signaling between neuronal subtypes during cortical development remain largely unknown.

 T cells contribute to immune protection and pathogenesis in tuberculosis, but measurements of polyclonal responses have failed to resolve correlates of outcome. We report the temporal evaluation of the human in vivo clonal repertoire of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-reactive T cell responses, by T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing at the site of the tuberculin skin test, as a model for a standardised antigenic challenge. Initial non-selective recruitment of T cells is followed by enrichment of Mtb-reactive clones arising from oligoclonal T cell proliferation. We introduce a modular computational pipeline, Metaclonotypist, to sensitively cluster distinct TCRs with shared epitope specificity, which we apply here to establish a catalogue of public Mtb-reactive HLA-restricted T cell metaclones. Although most in vivo Mtb-reactive T cells are private, 10 metaclones were sufficient to identify Mtb-T cell reactivity across our study population (N≥128), indicating striking population level immunodominance of specific TCR-peptide interactions that may inform patient stratification and vaccine development.

 Ultra-long-acting (ULA) antiretroviral parenteral formulations, with low injection volumes, high resistance barriers, and short pharmacokinetic (PK) tails, can transform HIV-1 therapeutics. Here, we converted bictegravir (BIC), a potent daily oral antiretroviral drug, into monomeric and homodimeric ester prodrugs. The homodimeric prodrug nanosuspension, NMXBIC, shows sustained plasma BIC levels > 16 times the protein-adjusted 95% inhibitory concentration (PA-IC95) for six months after a single injection in Sprague Dawley rats. The results paralleled a short PK tail with the potential for late dose forgiveness. The monomeric prodrug nanosuspension, NM2BIC, shows lower year-long plasma BIC concentrations above PA-IC95 after a single injection. After repeated injections, NMXBIC and NM2BIC are well tolerated in New Zealand White rabbits. NMXBIC’s physicochemical properties and high BIC loading/unit mass of the prodrug contribute to its unique ULA PK profile. These results support its development as a ULA formulation for HIV-1 treatment and prevention.

Using the end of UK sugar rationing as a natural experiment, this study shows that lower sugar intake early in life is linked to lower risk of heart failure and later disease onset. 
 Elevated sugar intake has been linked to poor cardiovascular health, but the effects of early-life sugar restriction on the lifelong risk of heart failure remain unclear. Using the end of sugar rationing in the United Kingdom in 1953 as a natural experiment, we classify participants in the UK Biobank by birth timing to define early-life exposure to sugar rationing. Here we show that individuals exposed to early-life sugar rationing exhibit an approximately 14% lower risk of heart failure and develop the condition about 2.6 years later than those unexposed. Longer exposure is associated with stronger effects, and population-level estimates suggest that around 4–5% of heart failure cases may be attributable to the absence of early-life sugar restriction. Genetic susceptibility does not modify these associations but acts additively. These findings underscore the long-term importance of early-life sugar exposure for heart failure, and further studies are warranted.

However, it often overlooks the broader role that migration plays within the context of climate impacts, adaptation and the connection with mitigation. This Perspective highlights four key research gaps: (1) the effectiveness of migration as an adaptation strategy, (2) how migration interacts with in situ adaptation efforts, (3) migration’s impacts on origin and destination communities and (4) feedback between climate mitigation policies and migration. To address these gaps, we propose solutions grounded in strengthening conceptual frameworks, expanded and harmonized data, and advancing methodological innovation. Together, these efforts can inform policy-making to better protect vulnerable populations, allocate resources more effectively and strengthen resilience and justice. Current climate migration literature focuses on quantifying the link between climate drivers and migration, yet overlooks its broader and more complex interactions with mitigation, adaptation and climate impacts. This Perspective highlights key gaps and offers concrete solutions."

McBride;Lichun Tang;Zifeng Yu;Klaus Fraedrich,Do rapidly and non-rapidly intensifying tropical cyclones represent two different dynamical regimes,"Do rapidly and non-rapidly intensifying tropical cyclones represent two different dynamical regimes 
 Rapid intensification (RI) of tropical cyclones (TCs) poses a major challenge in intensity forecasting and is a key contributor to the observed bimodal distribution of cyclone peak intensities. However, it remains unclear whether RI represents a distinct dynamical process. Here, we use lag plot (phase space) analysis from nonlinear dynamical systems theory to examine the underlying dynamics of RI and non-RI cyclones. Case studies of Typhoon Yagi (RI) and Typhoon Bebinca (non-RI) that made landfall in southern China in September 2024, combined with statistical analyses of a global cyclone dataset (1990–2021), reveal systematic differences in phase trajectories and correlations between lifetime maximum intensity (LMI) and intensification time. Our findings suggest that RI is not merely an amplification of normal intensification but represents a distinct dynamical regime, characterised by a transient intensification process, rather than the approximately steady intensity growth of the non-RI cyclones. A simple trend-persistence model is used as a dynamical diagnostic to examine error growth in the two regimes."

 Magma reservoir organization is hidden from view but important to systematic understanding of active volcanoes and intrusive igneous rocks. Seismic anisotropy in active silicic reservoirs suggests horizontally elongated melt sheets or sills, but it remains unclear if shallow silicic reservoirs in low strain rate settings without recent recharge maintain similar organization. Here we present new 3-D seismic tomography of the upper crustal reservoir beneath the tectonically quiescent Valles Caldera using dense nodal arrays. Results reveal >15% radial anisotropy consistent with up to 17-24% melt in horizontally elongated volumes interspersed with melt-poor layers, despite net crystallization since about 0.5 Ma and little contemporary strain. Structural similarity of Valles Caldera to more dynamic modern systems indicates that intrinsic reservoir processes like iterative magma injection, crystal settling, and melt compaction organize long-lived horizontally-layered structure, largely independent of tectonic setting and recharge rate.

 The Moon is depleted in moderately volatile elements compared with Earth, likely due to high-temperature processes during its formation. How this depletion evolved and the role of later surface processes remain unclear. Here we report high-precision zinc isotope measurements of basalt fragments and soils collected by the Chang’e-5 (CE-5) mission from a ~ 2-billion-year-old volcanic region. The basalts have zinc isotope values similar to those of Apollo mare basalts, consistent with global volatile loss during the Moon-forming impact. In contrast, soils show lighter zinc isotope signatures than Apollo soils and no variation with depth, suggesting little effect from space weathering. Instead, the data indicate that low-temperature volcanic outgassing deposited isotopically light zinc on the surface. These results show that young lunar soils can retain evidence of late-stage volcanic degassing, distinct from the intense volatile loss that shaped the early Moon. Zinc isotope data from Chang’e-5 lunar basalt samples records early impact driven volatile depletion, whereas soil samples primarily record late-stage volcanic degassing, with only limited space-weathering modification."

 Obliquely rifted continental margins are common, yet oblique spreading ridge segments are surprisingly rare. Oblique oceanisation, as seen in the southeast Indian Ocean, the Central Gulf of Aden, and the Equatorial Atlantic, invariably evolved into orthogonal ridge segments connected by transform faults. It remains unclear why the orthogonal ridge-transform configuration is preferred, and how it develops under sustained oblique divergence. Using 3D thermomechanical numeric models, we show that slow/ultraslow oblique spreading inherited from oblique rifting is a dynamic process. It enhances asymmetric oceanic plate growth with alternating directions and spontaneously self-organizes into orthogonal ridge segments connected with transform faults. The offset and spacing of the oceanic transform faults are controlled by the obliquity angle and the spreading rate. The step-wise orthogonal ridge-transform pattern is favored because it minimizes the total length of stronger ridge segments relative to weaker transforms, thereby reducing the mechanical work required for plate separation. Oblique spreading at slow to ultraslow rates fosters asymmetric growth of the ocean floor and leads to spontaneous formation of orthogonal ridge segments and new transform faults, according to thermomechanical simulations."

Oncogenic EGFR mutants are ligand-independent and more stable, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We hypothesized that EGFR mutants selectively leverage cellular stabilizers to evade degradation. Genome-wide RNA interference screens identified genes (encoding for stabilizers) responsible for mutant EGFR stability, with P2Y2 receptor (P2Y2) emerging as a bona fide stabilizer. Mechanistically, high extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels transactivate EGFR mutants via P2Y2 activation, previously shown to signal through Src kinase–dependent EGFR phosphorylation. Our study reveals that ATP-driven P2Y2 activation stabilizes EGFR mutants by forming a P2Y2-integrin β1-EGFR complex enriched in endosomes. Targeting this axis destabilizes EGFR mutants and offers a strategy against drug resistance. Elevated P2Y2 and integrin β1 expression in patients with NSCLC implies clinical relevance. Our results provide previously unidentified insight that EGFR mutants enhance extracellular ATP levels to activate P2Y2-integrin for enhanced stability of EGFR mutants to drive the oncogenic program."

Olson,Slowing planetary rotation influences ocean nutrient cycling and oxygenation,"Marine habitability for complex life on Earth and Earth-like planets requires bioavailable nutrients and dissolved oxygen. The cycling of nutrients and oxygen is controlled by physical ocean circulation. However, our understanding of how circulation has varied through time and space is incomplete for Earth and unconstrained for Earth-like exoplanets. Earth’s rotation has slowed over time, affecting ocean circulation by modifying the Coriolis effect. We use a three-dimensional Earth system model to explore how slowing planetary rotation influences ocean circulation and biogeochemistry. We show that slower rotation enhances wind-driven upwelling and global circulation. Nutrient recycling is consequently more efficient, increasing photosynthetic productivity. Additionally, enhanced ocean oxygenation improves habitability for aerobic life under a well-oxygenated atmosphere. However, under a poorly oxygenated atmosphere, slowing rotation increases oxygen fluxes from the ocean to the atmosphere. Therefore, Earth’s rotational history may have been a long-term background control on surface oxygenation and the evolution of animals."

An additional challenge of real-world vision is that it is dynamic, causing the appearance of objects (e.g., their size and orientation) to change as we move. Notably, however, these changes are predictable from the three-dimensional structure of the surrounding scene. In two functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, we find that the visual cortex dynamically updates object representations using this predictive contextual information. First, visual cortical representations of objects were enhanced when they rotated congruently (versus incongruently) with the surrounding scene. Second, the inferred orientation of the object could be decoded from visual cortex activity even when the object was fully occluded. These findings indicate that predictive processes in the visual cortex follow the geometric structure of the environment, providing a mechanism to support object perception in dynamic natural vision."

To overcome this limitation, we propose a piezoelectric surface acoustic wave (SAW) memristor that integrates an Ag/SiO2/Au memristor with an acoustoelectric phase shifter. Operating at shorter wavelengths than EM waves, it offers a compact footprint and encodes tunable neural network parameters via nonvolatile programmability and the acoustoelectric effect. A proof-of-concept SAW memristor neural network was experimentally demonstrated on a vector classification task, achieving 91.7% accuracy on par with software while reducing footprint by 105times versus EM systems and energy consumption by 37 times versus digital systems.

Two cell-based modalities can target pHLA-expressing tumors: T cell receptors (TCRs) or TCR-mimetic (TCRm) antibodies reformatted as chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). Using HLA-A2/MAGEA4230–239as a model pHLA, we discerned the relative potency of TCR-T and CAR-T cells, informing how to best deploy these for clinical benefit. Although TCR-T cells were more sensitive at detecting low-density pHLA, TCR-T cells exerted only transient in vivo antitumor efficacy followed by tumor relapse due to deficient TCR-T cell proliferation and persistence that was associated with a more differentiated and dysfunctional phenotype. By contrast, CAR-T cells with encoded costimulatory signaling fully regressed tumors. Insufficient TCR-T cell durability was overcome by coengaging 41BB or IL-2 signaling pathways, thereby enhancing tumor control in vivo. These data establish differential activities of human TCR-T and CAR-T cells targeting the same pHLA and inform the development of optimal targeting strategies to induce durable clinical responses."

Whether this protection extends into early adulthood remains uncertain. We conducted genome-wide association studies on body mass index (BMI) in nulliparous women from menarche to <40 years across five cohorts, with additional analyses in three subintervals of this life stage. Results were meta-analyzed, and two-sample univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization was applied within a lifecourse framework to assess the effect of BMI on breast cancer risk. Between menarche and <40 years, we observed heterogeneity in genetic effects. Genome-wide correlations further suggest that BMI during this early adult period may be partly influenced by distinct genetic factors compared with adiposity at other life stages. Higher genetically proxied BMI between menarche and 40 years reduced breast cancer risk. This protective effect attenuated after adjusting for prepubertal adiposity. These findings refine our understanding of adiposity’s role in breast cancer and highlight earlier life stages as critical windows for risk modulation."

We previously showed a hallmark of CAF-like EwS cells is their hybrid transcriptional state wherein the driver fusion oncogene, EWS::FLI1, maintains activation of proliferative programs but loses capacity to repress mesenchymal genes. Here, we studied primary patient tumors and cell line models to identify molecular drivers of this hybrid state. Our data reveal that hybrid EwS cells are induced and maintained by a transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ) signaling positive feedback loop. Hybrid cells derepressTGFBR2and up-regulate expression and secretion of TGFβ2 to sustain pathway activation and ECM deposition. Although TGFβ ligands can potently induce growth arrest in cells of epithelial origin, we show that TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 promote cell invasion of EwS cells without affecting proliferation. Thus, stroma-derived and tumor-derived TGFβ ligands induce and maintain hybrid EwS cells to promote pro-metastatic cell phenotypes."

Despite advances in measurement methods, long-term (>1 day) acquisition techniques remain limited, hindering continuous monitoring. Current long-term techniques rely on invasive electrodes, as noninvasive electrodes fall short in operational duration and conformability. Here, a capacitively coupled electrode with an adaptable coupling layer is developed for noninvasive, month-long electrophysiological monitoring on diverse plants. The adaptable coupling layer is formed by in situ sol-gel transition, followed by dehydration of thermoresponsive hydrogel on plants, achieving high conformability to complex surfaces and stable electrical coupling. For 1 month on trichome-covered plant surfaces, the electrode maintains a high signal-to-noise ratio comparable to a gold-standard noninvasive electrode, which typically lasts a few hours. Long-term monitoring reveals drought-specific signal features that correlate with plant water status.

It fosters the circulation of goods and information and enables kinship ties across different scales, including long-distance contacts. While such behaviors are known since at least the Upper Palaeolithic, evidence for geographically extensive social networks remains scarce. This evidence is limited to indirect inferences based on shared cultural traits, “art” styles, and symbolic items, while lithic raw material movements are mostly local and regional, with few cases exceeding 300 kilometers. We provide geochemical evidence for the largest confirmed distance between the source and discard location of a knapped lithic object in Palaeolithic Europe. Solutrean artifacts discarded at Peña Capón, Central Iberia, were sourced in Southwest France, 600 to 700 kilometers away. This demonstrates social networks of unprecedented geographic scale maintained during ∼1400 years during the Last Glacial Maximum. It also suggests that stone tools were exchanged as symbolic items to solidify social contacts and sustain far-reaching networks as risk-buffering mechanisms among widely dispersed hunter-gatherers."

We use ocean redox, iron isotope (δ56Fe), and phosphorus phase partitioning records from shelf and deep-ocean settings to evaluate the drivers behind this major reshaping of the pelagic marine ecosystem. A marked decrease in mesopelagic graptolites coincided with a stepwise negative δ56Fe shift on the shelf, driven by partial seawater Fe drawdown resulting from episodic intensification of mid-depth euxinia. Subsequently, a positive δ56Fe shift in both deep-ocean and shelf sediments reflects extensive seawater Fe removal during the development of more widespread euxinia. This led to enhanced sedimentary phosphorus recycling from sediments, which ultimately fueled the radiation of epipelagic graptolites. Thus, wide-scale changes in Fe cycling, linking the global oceanic redox state to phosphorus cycling, were ultimately responsible for the initial demise and subsequent radiation of select graptolite species."

Two common approaches are kinetic modeling and constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA). COBRA models analyze steady-state fluxes using linear constraints but lack kinetic detail. Kinetic models offer mechanistic descriptions via differential equations but require (often unknown) kinetic parameters and enzyme concentrations. To bridge this gap, we introduce COBRA-k, a framework integrating nonlinear kinetic rate laws into COBRA models to consistently constrain metabolic fluxes, enzyme abundances, and metabolite concentrations. COBRA-k enables flexible exploration of metabolic steady states with optimization techniques, even with incomplete parametrization. COBRA-k models require solving computationally demanding mixed-integer nonlinear programs. We therefore developed a dedicated iterative algorithm, implemented in an open-source Python package. We applied COBRA-k to a large-scaleEscherichia colimodel, demonstrating its effectiveness and revealing holistic metabolic insights. For example, it accurately predicts and explains the phenomenon of high intracellular glutamate concentration. COBRA-k combines the flexibility of COBRA with kinetic precision, offering a powerful tool for predictive metabolic modeling and engineering."

Despite its importance, the landscape and consequences of transcription stress remain underexplored. Here, we used maps of DSBs identified through sBLISS (in-suspension break labeling in situ and sequencing) with transcription stress markers to delineate the transcription stress landscape in cancer. We found that transcription stress sites are shaped by the superenhancer regulatory landscape. Notably, γH2AX is enriched at transcription stress sites; however, not all DSB-enriched genes show similar γH2AX marking. Instead, genes with DSBs tied to transcription stress are distinctly marked. Genes with high DSBs marked by γH2AX exhibited substantially higher DSB turnover and repair than those with low γH2AX, and are associated with vulnerability to mutagenesis. These findings underscore superenhancer activity as a determinant of the transcription stress landscape in cancer, posing a threat to the genomic stability of oncogenes."

We report that fossils ofPrototaxites taitifrom the 407-million-year-old Rhynie chert were chemically distinct from contemporaneous Fungi and structurally distinct from all known Fungi. This finding casts doubt upon the fungal affinity ofPrototaxites, instead suggesting that this enigmatic organism is best assigned to an entirely extinct eukaryotic lineage."

The earliest known soft hammers, dating to ~480,000 years ago, come from Boxgrove (UK), where modified antlers and large mammal bones were used alongside flint hard hammers. These tools facilitated complex knapping techniques, such as platform preparation and tranchet flake removal, contributing to the production of finely worked ovate handaxes typical of the Boxgrove Acheulean industry. This study presents a cortical bone fragment from an elephant, deliberately shaped into a percussor for resharpening flint tools. It represents the earliest known use of elephant bone in Europe and the first documented case of its use as a knapping hammer. Reconstructing its life history offers further insights into Middle Pleistocene hominin technological adaptations, resourcefulness, and survival strategies that enabled humans to endure harsh northern environments."

We show that multiparticle holonomies can even exist in systems devoid of any single-particle holonomies. We present a comprehensive framework for multiparticle quantum holonomies and experimentally realize various two-particle holonomies in integrated photonics.

However, the contribution of inflammatory forms of cell death in lung carcinogenesis and their effects on the composition of the tumor-immune microenvironment remain unclear. Our multi-omics analyses of samples from patients with primary lung adenocarcinoma revealed that necrosome signaling is repressed because of reduced expression of receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3). Distinct methylation signatures, both in theRIPK3promoter and nonpromoter regions, correlated with lower transcription levels ofRIPK3. This resulted in limited expression of inflammatory genes, advanced histologic features, reduced immune cell invasion, and decreased patient survival. Mechanistically, we confirmed the tumor-suppressive role of necrosome signaling through the genetic deletion ofRipk3in two independent, clinically relevant mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma. Functionally, RIPK3 shaped a diverse immune environment by promoting the invasion of innate and adaptive immune cells in patient samples and experimental mice. Thus, RIPK3-mediated inflammatory signaling enhances a diverse immune microenvironment and hinders progression in lung adenocarcinoma."

The granuloma’s necrotic core, where bacteria reside extracellularly in humans, is difficult to assess in many experimentally tractable models. Here, using necrotic mycobacterial granulomas in adult zebrafish, we develop dual RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) across different host genotypes to identify the transcriptional alterations that enable bacteria to survive within this key microenvironment. Using pharmacological and genetic interventions, we find that neutrophils within mature, necrotic granulomas promote bacterial growth, in part through up-regulation of the bacterialdevRregulon. We identify conserved suites of bacterial transcriptional programs induced only in the context of this unique necrotic extracellular niche, including bacterial modules related to K+transport andrpfgenes. Analysis ofMycobacterium tuberculosisstrains across diverse lineages and human populations suggests that granuloma-specific transcriptional modules are targets for bacterial genetic adaptation in the context of human infection."

A comprehensive supplement and 157 figures documents the results and assumptions. 
 3D geological models are an essential source of information for research as well as for the safe and efficient use of the underground. They provide not only a visualization of the subsurface structures but also serve as geometry input for geophysical and numerical models, e.g., gravimetric, mechanical or thermal models. The set-up of a geological model for a numerical simulation is often a time-consuming task. During the last two decades, several 3D geological models have been created for specific regions in Germany. Up to now only one attempt has been made to combine several of them to a Germany-wide model. However, there are many new models that have not been integrated into this model. Therefore, we present a new Germany-wide 3D geological model combining information of 27 individual models. The model has a resolution of 1×1 km2 and is vertically and horizontally subdivided into 146 units. Where possible, the model is extended to neighboring countries, e.g., the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Switzerland and Austria. In order to combine all models with their different sizes, resolutions and stratigraphic subdivisions, we used a point set approach, which has a number of advantages with regards to its flexibility and usability. To demonstrate the usability, the set-up of a finite-element model is shown as a possible application. The model is published as Ahlers (2026) and is available under https://doi.org/10.48328/tudatalib-1791."

The system is user-interactive in real time. It has been implemented for South Romania and is applicable and extendable for Europe. 
 Climate change significantly threatens crop yields levels and stability. The complex interplay of factors at the local scale makes assessing these impacts difficult, requiring coupled climate-phenology models, which integrate climate data and crop information. Identifying suitable local management practices and crop varieties under future conditions becomes essential for developing effective adaptation strategies.This study presents the implementation and application of an integrated climate-phenology adaptation support modelling system. This is based on regional CORDEX climate models and the CERES Maize model from the DSSAT platform. Novel modules for optimal management and genotype identification under climate change have been developed in the system, employing a hybrid approach that combines deterministic modelling with machine learning (ML) techniques and genetic algorithms. This system was run as a regional pilot over Southern Romania, operating in real-time in interaction with users, performing agro-climate projections (combination of fertilization, sowing date, genotype) and providing best crop management simulated under climate change projections. Multi-model ensemble simulations were conducted for two radiative forcing scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 and twelve management scenarios, yielding novel results for the region. Results indicate a projected decrease in maize yields for the current genotype across all tested scenarios, primarily attributed to a shortened grain-filling period and reduced fertilization efficiency under warmer conditions. The analysis warns about a projected narrowing of the agro-management options for maintaining a high yield level. However, we find an added value from the impact of genotype selection in mitigating climate change impacts, even in extreme years. Genotype optimisation across six crossed cultivar dependent parameters revealed that while maximum yields decline, specific genotype windows exhibit increased intermediate yields under future climates compared to current conditions. Sensitivity analysis identified the thermal time requirements during juvenile and maturity stages as the most critical factors influencing genotype performance under warmer climates.This research demonstrates the added value of combining deterministic and data-driven modelling approaches within a coupled climate-crop system for developing effective adaptation strategies, including optimised fertilization pathways that contribute to climate change mitigation."

However, this feedback is highly uncertain because most Earth system models (ESM) do not represent permafrost carbon. We have improved the Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace ESM by including permafrost physical, carbon and nitrogen processes to better represent Arctic ecosystems. The model more accurately represents past and present permafrost physics and biogeochemistry, paving the way for future projections. 
 Permafrost soils have the potential to release large amounts of soil carbon to the atmosphere under climate change. However, in the Sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), only two Earth System Models (ESM) represented permafrost carbon, both sharing the same land surface model. This makes future permafrost carbon dynamics  highly uncertain and underscores the urgent need to include permafrost carbon in ESMs to enable more reliable future projections of climate change and remaining carbon budget estimates. Here, we present IPSL-Perm-LandN, an improved version of the Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL) ESM (used for CMIP6) aiming at better representing high-latitude land ecosystems. The main developments are the inclusion of an explicit nitrogen cycle and of key permafrost physical and biogeochemical processes. The latent heat associated with soil water freeze/thaw is taken into account in the energy budget, as well as soil thermal insulation by soil organic matter and a surface organic layer (e.g. litter or moss). Soil organic carbon and nitrogen are vertically resolved with depth-dependent decomposition dynamics, a key feature for representing the effect of gradual permafrost thaw on soil biogeochemistry. Cryoturbation is represented as a diffusion process that buries organic matter in the deeper soil layers. Compared to the previous version of the model used for CMIP6, we show that the extent of the permafrost region has improved significantly and that the simulated active layer thickness in the Arctic is in better agreement with observations. Permafrost soil carbon stocks have increased 20-fold to reach 1006 PgC in the top 3 m of soil, which is consistent with observation-based estimates. We simulate that the permafrost region has been a net carbon sink over the past 150 years (+0.32 ± 0.04 PgC yr−1 on average between 2005 and 2014), primarily due to carbon uptake from boreal forests. This is comparable with recent pan-Arctic carbon balance estimates, when accounting for unrepresented processes in our model (fire and riverine carbon losses). Overall, the inclusion of permafrost processes has improved the response of the model to anthropogenic perturbations in high latitudes over the past century, marking a step forward in the representation of Arctic ecosystems."

The mechanisms supporting long-term functional stability remain unclear. As a key OHRB, Dehalococcoides faces similar constraints, including declining abundance and loss or divergence of functional genes in bioaugmentation. Here we demonstrate that strain-level microdiversity within Dehalococcoides supports the resilience of community-scale dehalogenation. In AEDhc, a reconstructed consortium derived from eight Dehalococcoides-containing enrichment cultures, sequencing of a Dehalococcoides-specific marker gene revealed 30 distinct Dehalococcoides phylotypes coexisting within the community. Despite fluctuations in phylotype abundance over successive transfers, AEDhc consistently debrominated tetra- and pentabrominated diphenyl ethers (0.39 ± 0.06 - 0.45 ± 0.05 μM Br–/d), producing no detectable accumulation of intermediates. Proteomics analyses revealed that among 71 putative reductive dehalogenase (RDase) genes identified in metagenomic analysis, expression was consistently dominated by PcbA1-like and TceA-like RDases across transfers. These findings demonstrated that Dehalococcoides phylotypes can coexist and fluctuate dynamically even under constant cultivation conditions, with genetic variation serving as a reservoir of metabolic potential. Such microdiversity enhances functional stability and ecological resilience, highlighting the need to consider strain-level heterogeneity in bioremediation strategies."

The aquaculture industry uses medicinal (e.g., emamectin benzoate (EMB)) and non-medicinal (e.g., thermolicers) methods to control sea lice. Non-medicinal methods can harm fish, while medicinal treatments can accumulate on the seafloor and impact the environment. Nevertheless, research on EMB’s effects on non-target fauna in Norway remains limited. This study is the first to integrate field and modeling analysis of EMB and benthic ecology in Norway, aiming to (i) map EMB distribution around farms, (ii) assess impacts on benthic communities, and (iii) compare EMB’s effects on crustaceans to other stressors. Results show EMB had the strongest effect on benthic abundance and species richness, compared to other stressors (e.g., organic matter). EMB concentrations at 0.2 ng/g, near the SEPA EQS of 0.272 ng/g, reduced species diversity and disrupted community structure, with crustaceans being most sensitive. EMB was found to be widespread, persistent, and to accumulate in sediments long after use. Dispersion modeling suggest harmful concentrations could extend 1 km from farms. These findings highlight the need for improved monitoring, regulation, and sustainable lice management to protect biodiversity in aquaculture intensive areas."

While nutrient enrichment generally is a primary driver, insufficient insight into biotic-hydrological stressor interactions may result in an overreliance on nutrient reduction as the sole intervention. Focusing on China’s subtropical eutrophic Lake Dianchi, we applied an innovative coupled hydrodynamic-ecological model to identify key drivers of ecosystem degradation. This approach uniquely involved simulating multiple restoration strategies across eight degradation scenarios, 28 climate change scenarios, and over 100 regulatory scenarios, offering a comprehensive analysis of potential solutions. Our results identify the synergistic effects of grass carp introduction and elevated water levels as key drivers of the observed clear-to-turbid regime shift in the 1970s. Subsequently, fluctuations in nutrient loading became dominant drivers of eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms. We further show that restoring a clear-water state with submerged macrophytes would optimally require a multidimensional strategy: 63% nutrient loading reduction (76% under simulated climate change conditions), 1.5 m water level lowering, and ∼80% benthivorous fish removal over three consecutive summers. Our study demonstrates that combining biotic, hydrological, and nutrient management outperforms single-factor manipulations, underscoring the importance of resilience-building through integrated, multidimensional interventions."

This work produces pCFs by integrating gas-specific climate parameters with future emission scenarios from the Integrated Assessment Models (IAM). Prospective Global Warming Potential (pGWP20, pGWP100) and Global Temperature change Potential (pGTP50, pGTP100) are computed for emission years until 2050. Relative to present-day CFs, methane pGWP100 varies from −8% to +23%, and nitrous oxide varies from −17% to +7%. CH4 pGTP100 shifts from −24% to +22%, while N2O pGTP100 shifts from −27% to +8%. For non-CO2-dominated activities such as rice production, climate impacts increase by 8% in terms of pGWP100. With pGTP100, impacts of ammonium nitrate decrease by 9%. When pCFs are combined with prospective background inventories, impacts are substantially lower in sectors such as steel (−44%), road transport (−58%), and cement (−31%) under pGTP100.

In water and soils, iron minerals are often associated with natural organic matter (NOM), which can substantially influence surface redox reactions. Yet inconsistencies remain in understanding the impacts of NOM association on ROS production from iron mineral surfaces due to limited insight into surface interfacial electron transfer processes. Here, we show that NOM association significantly modulates both the kinetics and the path of electron transfer on pyrite surfaces. Steric hindrance at O2 adsorption sites decreased the electron transfer rate by 22.7–38.6%, from 4.4 × 10–4 to 2.7–3.4 × 10–4 s–1. Concomitantly, O2 reduction shifted from a four-electron path producing H2O to a two-electron path favoring H2O2 formation, increasing H2O2 selectivity from 29.6% on pristine pyrite to 49.2–67.1% on NOM-associated pyrite. These changes collectively enhanced ROS production, with H2O2 and •OH yields increasing by 1.5–1.9-fold and 1.8–2.3-fold, respectively. Elevated ROS levels increased organic pollutant degradation rates by 1.6–2.7-fold.

At 100 μg/L, PFOS was distributed throughout all tissues except for the brain, where only the pineal gland showed significant accumulation. The pineal gland, a neuroendocrine organ regulating the circadian rhythm, is not protected by the blood–brain barrier. Together, these findings indicate that PFOS did not readily cross the blood–brain barrier.

To overcome the proton transfer limitations inherent in conventional thermal regeneration, which relies on elevated temperatures, this study proposes a novel homogeneous catalytic system utilizing proton shuttles. By replacement of heterogeneous solid acid catalysts with small organic molecules (e.g., ethanol), this system enables efficient proton transfer while circumventing solid–liquid interfacial diffusion resistance. The dynamic proton exchange capability of these shuttles, operating BH/B– cycling, accelerates the deprotonation of RNHCOO– species and significantly reduces the reaction energy barrier. Experimental results demonstrate that ethanol, because its pKa value balances proton donation and acceptance capabilities, reduces regeneration energy consumption by 35%, with isotope-labeled mass spectrometry confirming the proton transfer pathway. This homogeneous catalytic mechanism, through molecular-level optimization of proton transfer dynamics, provides a new pathway for developing efficient and stable CO2 desorption processes, potentially accelerating the economic advancement of carbon capture technologies toward achieving carbon neutrality goals."

We aimed to determine the amount of NDMA contained in various types of rubber gloves and its behavior. It was found that rubber gloves contained NDMA exceeding 2 mg/kg, which volatilizes into the air during storage, causing air contamination and easily dissolving in water when used. Thus, the exposure risks of NDMA contained in rubber products may be underestimated. A temperature-dependent leaching experiment demonstrated that NDMA leaches more rapidly from gloves at higher temperatures. Furthermore, exposure to ambient air decreased NDMA content over time, indicating loss by volatilization. These findings suggest that NDMA levels in gloves may be highest at the time of manufacture and can fluctuate depending on storage conditions, thus highlighting the potential for underestimated health risks.

However, its expanding application in diverse fields has raised concerns about inadvertent environmental release, which might lead to potential ecological and health risks. Herein, mice were continuously exposed at doses of 0.1 mg/kg/day (possible acceptable daily intake dose, ADI) and 1 mg/kg/day (possible occupational exposure dose) to BPNSs for 28 days. Using hyperspectral imaging and Evans blue fluorescence chromogenic assay, we confirmed that partial BPNSs penetrated the blood–testis barrier (BTB) and distributed throughout the spermatogenic microenvironment of testes. Mice exposed to BPNSs exhibited significant reproductive toxicity, evidenced by abnormal sperm parameters, disordered spermatogenic cell layers, sloughed germ cells, and disrupted sex hormone levels. Further, BPNSs promoted the steroid synthesis pathway and inhibited testosterone aromatization, leading to testicular endocrine homeostasis disorders.

As a disproportionate laboratory, an array of nearly 3,000 high‐resolution temperature sensors had been installed for three years on the flat 2,500‐m deep bottom of the Mediterranean Sea. The time series from the half‐cubic hectometer mooring‐array allows for the creation of unique movies of deep‐sea water motions. Although temperature differences are typically 0.001°C, variable convection‐turbulence is observed as expected from geothermal heating through the flat seafloor. During about 40% of the time, an additional turbulence, 3 times stronger in magnitude, is observed from slantwise advected warmer waters to pass in turbulent clouds. Besides turbulent clouds and seafloor heating, movies also reveal weakly turbulent interfacial‐wave breakdown that commonly occurs in the open ocean far away from boundaries."

However, the influence of a pre‐existing TC (PTC) has not been fully clarified in realistic simulations. This study conducted 42 numerical experiments (NPTC) for 1981–2022, in which a PTC was removed by horizontal smoothing from the initial conditions 120 hr before the genesis of a subsequent TC (STC). Compared to control simulations with the PTC (WPTC), the number of STC formations was slightly larger (WPTC: 31, NPTC: 33). The intensities of common STCs are very similar. STCs were typically located to the south or southwest of a subtropical high. The experiments showed wave‐like anomaly patterns in the vorticity field southeast of PTCs and in the geopotential height field northeast of the PTCs. Vertical wind shear (VWS), enhanced by PTC outflows, created an unfavorable environment for STC formation and intensification. Reanalysis data supported strong VWS and a similar wave‐like pattern. A positive sea surface temperature anomaly over the central equatorial Pacific induced westerly wind anomalies in the southeastern WNP. The spatial collocation of PTCs and STCs was frequently observed when the active eastern convection is expected by the indices of Madden–Julian Oscillation, Boreal Summer Intraseasonal Oscillation, and El Niño–Southern Oscillation. These conditions promote TC genesis farther east, suggesting that such collocation does not imply PTC‐induced formation. Thus, impact of PTCs appears less significant than previously assumed."

Here, authors construct a homotypic membrane-powered biomimetic interface for subtype-specific analysis of breast cancer extracellular vesicles. 
 The cancer cell membrane, rich in tumor-associated antigens, effectively replicates the characteristics of cancer cells by presenting specific protein profiles. Leveraging the inherent binding capability of the cancer cell membrane, here we show a homotypic membrane-powered biomimetic interface for subtype-specific analysis of breast cancer extracellular vesicles (EVs). Specifically, the breast cancer cell membrane is employed to coat a gold substrate, thereby forming the biomimetic interface capable of selectively binding breast cancer EVs with similar subtype features. Subsequently, silver nanoparticles-tethered antibodies are adopted as electroactive immunoprobes to label these EVs, generating distinct electrochemical signals for quantitative analysis. Research findings demonstrate high selectivity and sensitivity of the interface for analyzing target EVs. Based on this, an electrochemical microfluidic device is developed and validated for its effectiveness in identifying subtype features of breast cancer patients. Therefore, our work provides a simple yet efficient platform for precise cancer diagnosis and personalized treatment.

 The skin exhibits extraordinary plasticity, enabling it to adapt to mechanical changes in the environment. While transient deformations are accommodated without lasting structural effects, sustained mechanical stress induces durable tissue changes. To investigate if these responses are mediated by shifts in epidermal stem cell fate, we employed two-photon intravital imaging to visualize epidermal cells in live skin subjected to acute mechanical forces. Mechanical force triggered the formation of intracellular “stress” vesicles within epidermal stem cells that filled with extracellular fluid and progressively enlarged, deforming the nucleus. Lineage tracing analyses revealed that the extent of nuclear deformation can predict cell fate outcomes. Moreover, mechanical stress caused sustained elevation of intracellular calcium in basal epidermal stem cells, and conditional deletion of the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 disrupted calcium dynamics and increased stress vesicle formation. Using human skin xenografts, we demonstrated that stress vesicles are conserved in mammalian skin. Together, these findings identify stress vesicles as key mediators linking mechanical stress, calcium signaling, and epidermal stem cell fate. Using two-photon intravital imaging, the authors show that mechanical stress in skin triggers fluid-filled “stress vesicles” in epidermal cells, altering Piezo1-dependent calcium signals to drive stem cell differentiation and protect tissue integrity."

 The trihexagonal tiling system exhibits strong electron-electron interactions, positioning it as a key condensed matter platform for studying geometrically frustrated lattices made up of corner-sharing triangles. Its phase-transition-driven lattice modulations enable Fermi surface reconstruction, while emergent van Hove singularities near the Fermi level and correlated band anomalies present critical challenges in understanding electronic interaction mechanisms. By combining temperature-dependent spectroscopy, angle-resolved photoemission, and density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate a 61-fold enhancement in terahertz direct detection mode, ultra-low noise (1.38 × 10⁻²⁵ A²/Hz) below phase transition temperature, and broadband operation up to 100 GHz in beat-note heterodyne mode. These results are directly correlated with the Fermi surface reconstruction induced by phase transitions.

 The mechanisms of airway allergen sensing and type 2 immune response initiation remain poorly understood. Using a mouse house dust mite (HDM)-induced allergic airway model, we identify a population of lung macrophages located close to alveolar capillaries that express Ly6G and the nuclear receptor Nr4a1/Nur77. These atypical Ly6G+Nur77+ macrophages preferentially capture airway-delivered allergens and play an important role in initiating HDM-driven T helper type 2 (Th2) responses. They sense the major HDM allergen, the cysteine protease Der p 1, via protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2), and their activation and accumulation require both PAR2 and Nr4a1/Nur77. These Ly6G+Nur77+ macrophages regulate the migration of conventional migratory dendritic cells (mDCs) to draining mediastinal lymph nodes (mLNs) through cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) production, which enhances mDC migration toward CCL21 for T cell priming. Inhibiting CysLT biosynthesis reduces mDC migration and dampens Th2 allergic responses, highlighting possible therapeutic avenues in type 2 immunity.

 α-Oxy carbonyl compounds, characterized by their distinct electronic and topological properties, represent highly versatile building blocks and modifiers for functional molecules. Despite their potential, the synthetic challenges associated with these compounds have limited their exploration in chemical biology and drug discovery. In this study, we address this limitation by introducing a general Cu-catalyzed three-component carbonyl 1,2-transposition reaction, which proceeds via a PV-oxirene intermediate. Our method employs IIII/PV-hybrid ylides as carbene precursors to generate α-PV-Cu-carbenes, which subsequently facilitate the formation of PV-oxirene species. This intermediate undergoes regioselective ring-opening by carboxylate anions, followed by acylation of a third nucleophile, enabling the modular assembly of α-oxy carbonyl compounds. This strategy provides efficient access to α-oxy esters, amides, and thioesters, exhibiting broad tolerance to various functional groups. Furthermore, these compounds exhibit remarkable chemical versatility, as demonstrated in the synthesis of depsipeptides and late-stage drug modification, underscoring their applicability across diverse research areas. Our findings not only significantly expand the structural diversity of accessible α-oxy carbonyls but also introduce a versatile and biocompatible synthetic linkage for chemical synthesis. α-Oxy carbonyl compounds represent versatile building blocks and modifiers for functional molecules, but the synthetic challenges have limited their exploration in chemical biology and drug discovery.

 Macrophage (Mφ) phenotypic transformation is crucial in determining spinal cord injury (SCI) outcomes. However, the suborganelle crosstalk mechanisms—particularly between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria—that mediate Mφ subgroup conversion during SCI remain underexplored. We aim to integrate niche intervention strategies and omics sequencing to investigate the effects of the metabolic crosstalk between ER stress (ERS) and mitochondria. Subsequently, we develop a dual-targeted camouflaged nanorobot (BP@D/N) that can reach the SCI site via systemic circulation and selectively interact with Mφ. We observe that Ero1α-mediated Ca2+ shuttling is an important mechanism for locking the inflammatory phenotype of Mφ. Blocking the Ero1α/MAMs/mtCa2+ axis suppresses mtDNA release and downregulates the cGAS-STING-NFκB signaling cascade, thus promoting M2 polarization and neural repair. Our study clarifies the regulatory mechanism of Mφ transformation-associated suborganelle crosstalk and offers a paradigm for reconstructing the dynamic balance of immune–neural interactions in the SCI microenvironment for effective repair. It offers a scientifically grounded and translational approach to overcoming the clinical challenge of irreversible SCI.

 Palaeoceanographic records spanning the Oligocene provide insights into Antarctic ice-sheet dynamics in a world warmer-than-today, allowing us to improve future climate projections linked to global warming. Here, we present a high-resolution multi-proxy record from ODP Site 689 (Maud Rise, Southern Ocean), to investigate the short-term Antarctic ice-sheet variability during the late Oligocene. Our oxygen isotope composition of sea water record reflects large, obliquity-paced ice volume fluctuations from 26.2 to 25.2 Ma. These fluctuations would have resulted in changes in the types of rocks eroded as the Antarctic ice-sheet advanced/retreated. Indeed, the radiogenic isotopic compositions of neodymium and lead co-vary with the oxygen isotopes for most of the record and identify changes in sediment provenance and weathering rates linked to advances and retreats of the Antarctic ice-sheet. At the same time, the stable incongruent lead isotope signal observed confirms the presence of a major East Antarctic ice-sheet during the late Oligocene.

 There is no satisfactory model explaining the incompatible element-enriched chemical characteristics observed in few ~3000 Ma-old, low-titanium lunar basalts. Using in situ Pb-Pb systematics by Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry, we determined crystallisation ages and initial Pb isotope ratios of the meteorites North West Africa (NWA) 4734, LaPaz Icefield (LAP) 02224, LAP 02205, Northeast Africa 003 and newly found meteorite NWA 14178. We show that these samples form a unique chemical and age group, distinct from any other chemical group known from the Moon. Pb isotope ratios suggest these basalts originated from an enriched source distinct from the KREEP mantle component identified in rocks from the Procellarum Terrane. Three-stage model-based Monte Carlo simulations suggest a mantle source formed from a depleted mantle at 4260 Ma – that is, after the solidification of the Lunar Magma Ocean. This mantle source may have acquired its chemical characteristics as a result of deep crust-breaking impact.

 Accurate stem-level volume estimation at large scale is highly desired in temperate natural forests due to their economic and ecological significance. Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) systems (e.g., handheld or backpack) offer the ability to efficiently capture high-density point clouds over large areas, creating opportunities for automated, large-scale individual stem volume estimation. However, effective algorithms that can automatically and accurately analyze the dense and complex MLS point clouds of temperate natural forests are lacking. To address this issue, we propose a novel three-stage method to automatically detect, segment, and reconstruct individual stems, enabling direct volume estimations from MLS point clouds of temperate natural forests. First, a deep learning model is employed to separate understory vegetation from overstory trees, reducing point cloud complexity. Next, we introduce a Bidirectional Section Growing (BSG) method for individual stem detection and segmentation, specifically for the segmentation of merchantable logs and multi-stem scenarios, using a novel Least Squares with Similarity Optimization (LeSSO) algorithm. Finally, the Sector Median Points (SMP) method is developed to reconstruct stem shapes for precise volume estimation. Our method is evaluated on four datasets collected in temperate natural forests across the U.S. and Europe. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving 89.2% Intersection over Union (IoU) for understory removal, 99.4% F-score for stem detection, 91.5% IoU for stem segmentation, and reconstruction accuracy with a Point-to-Mesh distance of 0.0004 m2 and a Chamfer distance of 0.05 m. Moreover, we record 42 stem locations in the field for one of the U.S. datasets and conduct destructive measurements of section-wise diameters for each of them to serve as independent reference data to evaluate stem detection and volume estimation. Our method is able to detect all 42 trees from the point cloud, and reconstructed stem models yield the most accurate section-wise diameter estimates with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 2.27 cm and R2 of 0.96, and best volume estimation with RMSE of 0.18 m3 and R2 of 0.97. Our method paves the way for automated and accurate estimation of merchantable stem volume from MLS point clouds collected in complex temperate natural forests."

However, the complexity of these hybrid systems challenges understanding of the mechanisms that determine properties such as mobility. We investigated interlayer exciton diffusion in tungsten diselenide–tungsten disulfide heterobilayers at ultralow exciton density and low temperatures to examine how charges affect exciton mobility. Near the electronic Mott insulator phase, we observed a giant thousand-fold enhancement of exciton diffusion relative to charge neutrality. We attribute this to mobile valence holes, which experienced a suppressed moiré potential due to charge order and recombined nonmonogamously with conduction electrons. Our results show exciton diffusion as a probe of correlated electron states and Bose-Fermi interplay."

We found that ligation of αIIbβ3 by von Willebrand factor or fibrin under flow triggered its accumulation in plasma membrane extensions or “platelet-derived integrin- and tetraspanin-enriched tethers” (PITTs). PITTs remained anchored to leukocytes or endothelial cells, whereas the partially αIIbβ3-deficient platelet body detached. Although still responsive to stimuli, αIIbβ3-deficient platelets did not support thrombus formation. PITTs promoted leukocyte activation and vascular inflammation in mouse models of infection and endotoxemia, and αIIbβ3 blockade reduced immune-mediated tissue damage. In patients with sepsis, COVID-19, or severe infections, PITT formation and platelet αIIbβ3 loss correlated with disease severity and adverse outcomes. We propose that PITTs are proinflammatory structures that amplify immune responses while contributing to platelet dysfunction in thrombo-inflammatory disease."

Here, we performed genetic interrogation and in vivo analysis of OPCs in the mouse brain to determine their differentiation dynamics. Our results show that OPCs attempt to differentiate throughout the adult central nervous system with spatial and temporal regularity. The differentiation rate was not influenced by myelin demand or oligodendrocyte loss and declined with age and in response to acute inflammation. The results suggest that OPC differentiation is governed primarily by constitutive processes and might be negatively influenced by aging and inflammation."

We observed that human embryos arresting at the eight-cell ZGA stage exhibited specific down-regulation of endogenous retrovirus MLT2A1. Depleting MLT2A1 resulted in a failure in embryo development and a reduction in ZGA gene expression. Mechanistically, MLT2A1s synthesized chimeric transcripts with downstream coding and noncoding sequences, predominantly with heterologous retro–transposable elements. These diverse fusion sequences expanded the genome-targeting spectrum of MLT2A1 RNAs. Nevertheless, the shared MLT2A1 sequences partnered with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (HNRNPU) to recruit RNA polymerase II, promoting global transcription of ZGA genes and autoamplification of the MLT2A1 subfamily. Thus, MLT2A1 chimeric RNAs formed an interlocking network that acts synergistically to boost human ZGA and early embryogenesis."

Seawater Os–Sr isotopic trends indicate transitions in continental weathering patterns during the Late Cretaceous [~90 million years ago (Ma)] and Paleogene (~35 Ma) ascribed to intensified weathering of interior Gondwana during the opening of the Atlantic Ocean and the uplift and glaciation of the Himalaya, respectively.

One class of cyclic molecules that has been increasingly sought after is semisaturated cyclic scaffolds, whose specific blend of Csp2- and Csp3-hybridized components confers distinct properties to these species. However, existing methods to construct these scaffolds are limited, often relying on arene saturation or annulations that require lengthy de novo syntheses. Herein, we describe a unified and highly modular couple-close strategy for the synthesis of semisaturated scaffolds. This approach installs bifunctional linkers onto aromatic rings through a range of bond-forming reactions, and subsequent cyclization furnishes semisaturated bicyclic adducts. Key to this approach is a mechanistically distinct cobalt-catalyzed dehydrogenative radical cyclization that proceeds efficiently even on electronically unbiased arenes, enabling a broad substrate scope under mild reaction conditions."

These data include key Vulnerable Marine Ecosystem species and provide a baseline to improve monitoring, support future research, and reduce disturbance to sensitive habitats. 
 Climate change and biodiversity loss are rapidly transforming Arctic marine ecosystems. Benthic ecosystems on Arctic shelves are important for biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Biomass in form of ash-free dry mass (AFDM) is often used as a proxy of ecosystem health but can be labour intensive and costly to obtain. This study addresses a key data gap by providing robust weight and body size to weight conversion factors for Arctic and boreal benthic fauna. We collected samples of common macro- and mega-benthic organisms in SE Greenland (59–67° N and 27–41° W) and calculated conversion factors for wet mass (WM) to dry mass (DM) (40 families) and to AFDM (39 families) and DM to AFDM (42 families) (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17714017) (Behrisch and Zwerschke, 2025). To improve sampling output from non-destructive image-based sampling we also calculated conversion factors between body size (length, diameter) and weight for a subset of families (Behrisch and Zwerschke, 2025). Our dataset includes several Vulnerable Marine Ecosystem (VME) indicator taxa for the Arctic region. The conversion factors for Atlantic-Arctic benthos presented here can serve as the foundation for a growing database, helping to unify datasets collected using different methodologies."

Widespread urbanization has made untreated urban runoff a major pathway for environmental contamination that can pose a significant threat to aquatic ecosystems. While existing literature reviews have focused on the sources and composition of urban runoff or the toxicity of the single contaminants, a comprehensive understanding of the ecotoxicological effects of whole complex mixtures of urban runoff contaminants is lacking, particularly regarding their short- and long-term impacts across different trophic levels. This review uniquely synthesizes the effects of urban runoff mixtures, examining both organism- and molecular-level responses in aquatic species. In addition, we developed the UrbanRunoffRisk R package to automate and improve risk assessments of urban runoff mixtures. The tool integrates predicted environmental concentration (PEC) with EC50/LC50 values for key aquatic species, ensuring reliable and reproducible calculations. Our analysis reveals that most existing studies focus on organismal and physiological responses to acute exposures, with limited attention paid to molecular mechanisms or identification of the toxicants driving observed effects. By combining organismal and molecular insights with a mixture of toxicity assessment and model-based risk evaluation, this review provides a novel synthesis of urban runoff ecotoxicology. Future research should also explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of urban runoff mixtures and the development of practical and diverse risk assessment models. Such advancements are critical for understanding and mitigating the ecological impacts of chemical mixtures in urban runoff."

Yet, current risk assessments rely mainly on linear extrapolations from laboratory toxicity tests and rarely capture multifaceted biodiversity, particularly genetic diversity, at the watershed scale. We integrated high-throughput mass spectrometry and environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding to assess cumulative chemical stressor impacts on multitrophic communities (protozoa, algae, fungi, invertebrate metazoan, and fish) across streams, rivers, and lakes of the 40,000 km2 Tai Lake Basin, eastern China. A total of 132 chemicals were detected, and cumulative ecological risk thresholds were exceeded at >70% of sites, indicating basin-wide chemical stress. Spatial heterogeneity in chemical composition and ecological risk were strongly associated with land-use intensity, particularly agricultural and urban development. eDNA metabarcoding revealed that community composition and sequence diversity mirrored chemical stressor distribution across sites. Sites with higher chemical stressors exhibited reduced sequence diversity and increased community similarity, while taxonomic diversity remained stable. Structural equation modeling showed that chemical effects on beta diversity were mediated through reduced sequence diversity, with no significant direct effects. These findings underscore the need to incorporate sequence-based biodiversity metrics into ecological risk frameworks and develop biodiversity-informed thresholds for freshwater ecosystems."

Despite its recognized value for crop nutrition, current inefficient manure application contributes ∼10% to global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Addressing this challenge, we investigated semiliquid manure slurry, which in some regions provides up to half of the N supplied to crops. Using meta-analysis and machine learning methodology, we predicted agricultural and environmental impacts of slurry use in different climate scenarios based on 1952 paired observations in global field experiments. Current suboptimal uses of slurry generate 7% (0.1 Tg N) higher nitrous oxide emissions than synthetic fertilizers. Under future warming scenarios and without optimization, these emissions are projected to increase by an additional 3–5% (∼0.2 Tg N) and total noncarbon dioxide (CO2) GHG emissions by 30% (600 Tg CO2 equivalents year–1). Current evidence identifies the combination of subsurface slurry application and nitrification inhibitors as an effective optimization strategy. This strategy may reduce non-CO2 GHG emissions by 30%, equivalent to an 8% reduction in the total agricultural GHG emissions. We estimated that this optimization, combined with a favorable slurry N-to-total N ratio, has the technological potential to increase global cereal production by up to 20% and restore organic carbon stocks in topsoil by 5% (3400 Tg carbon). Thus, optimizing slurry use should be a priority, as it contributes to climate change mitigation, food security, and soil fertility."

Simpson;Qiao-Guo Tan;Minwei Xie,Mechanistic Acute-to-Chronic Extrapolation through Sediment Toxicokinetic-Toxicodynamic Modeling,"Ecological risk assessment often requires extrapolation from short-term laboratory-derived effects data to predict long-term ecological impacts of pollution exposure. This study developed a mechanistic toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TKTD) modeling framework to derive acute-to-chronic ratios (ACRs) for the benthic clam Ruditapes philippinarum exposed to sediment-associated Cu. To facilitate model development in the sediment context, we derived physiological parameters (ke, CIT, kk) using aqueous toxicity tests and used diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) measurements to represent Cu bioavailability in sediments. The sediment TKTD model accurately predicted Cu accumulation in clam tissues and adequately predicted toxicity, with a 10% deviation from observed effects. Using model-predicted 7-day LC50 and no-effect concentration, an ACR of 17 was determined for Cu-induced clam mortality. The framework was then applied to derive ACRs for other contaminants using literature-derived aqueous TKTD parameters, including cadmium (ACRCd: 11–87) and nanoplastic particles (ACRNPs: 1.9–69). The new approach was also effective for elucidating how environmental variables (e.g., salinity, nanoplastic size) influence ACR values, thus offering insight which may be difficult to achieve by traditional empirical approaches. The study demonstrates the utility of TKTD modeling as a transparent and reproducible mechanistic method for acute-to-chronic extrapolation of toxicity as used for risk assessment applications."

Here, we demonstrate that redox-driven structural transformations unlock a dual pathway for U(VI) reduction. Comparative experiments using pristine mackinawite (FeS), partially oxidized FeS (O-FeS), and sulfur-enriched FeS (S-FeS) revealed that FeS and O-FeS reduce U(VI) primarily through oxidation of structural S(-II), whereas sulfidation-induced structural alterations in S-FeS activate otherwise inert Fe(II) as a coreductant, as evidenced by Fe(III) formation. This dual electron-transfer pathway shows pH dependence. At pH 6.5, U(VI) reduction to U(V)/U(IV) is nearly complete in S-FeS, while the reduction extent decreases to 34% at pH 8.5, due to the formation of a passivated surface layer rich in Fe(III) and sulfur that inhibits further electron transfer. These findings demonstrate that oxidation- and sulfidation-driven variations in FeS stoichiometry and structure regulate uranium reduction and immobilization pathways, with important implications for predicting the fate of redox-sensitive metal contaminants in dynamic subsurface environments."

Among these, perfluorinated and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) have been reported to exert male reproductive toxicity, yet comparative risks across individual PFAS remain unclear. In this study, we employed an innovative systematic review strategy, the Targeted Risk Assessment of Environmental Chemicals (TRAEC) strategy, integrating all available evidence from 25 epidemiological studies, 75 in vivo, and 43 in vitro experiments, alongside independent experiments, to assess the effects of multiple PFAS on semen quality and sex hormone levels. The integrated evidence indicated that PFAS exposure posed a moderate risk level to male reproductive health with a comprehensive risk score of 6.47. Among individual PFAS, exposure to perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS, risk score: 7.43) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA, risk score: 6.38) presented the highest risk of sperm abnormalities, followed by perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDoA, risk score: 6.29), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, risk score: 5.83), and perfluorohexyl sulfonic acid (risk score: 4.87), all of which are at moderate risk levels. And the risk of these PFAS compounds causing reproductive hormone abnormalities was at a low to moderate level, with the risk scores ranging from 3.79 (PFOA) to 6.74 (PFDoA). Additionally, PFAS exposure showed a relatively high risk of adversely affecting sperm progressive motility (risk score range: 5.23–5.62), particularly for PFOS (risk score: 5.57) and PFNA (risk score: 5.62). Risk for other sperm parameters was relatively lower (risk score range: 4.01–5.49). Notably, independent in vivo experiments confirmed that PFNA exposure significantly impaired sperm routine parameters and sperm dynamics across multiple mouse strains (including C57BL/6J, CC002, CC037, and CC057 strains). Our study identified PFOS and PFNA as particularly detrimental to male reproductive health across multiple dimensions, underscoring the urgent need for measures to reduce PFAS exposure and mitigate risks to male fertility."

The anthropogenic rise in atmospheric CO2 reduces calcification rates and enhances calcium carbonate dissolution, which increases ocean alkalinity, counteracts acidification, and stimulates ocean CO2 uptake. However, carbonate dissolution takes place primarily in the deep ocean, so this feedback is slow, maintaining ocean CO2 uptake over millennial timescales. Here, we present evidence that seawater alkalinity on the continental shelf is increasing on annual‐decadal timescales, at a rate that is orders of magnitude faster than the deep ocean feedback. Biogeochemical model analyses suggest this fast feedback results from calcium carbonate dissolution in the shelf seafloor driven by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Extrapolating these results to the global continental shelf suggests that shelf carbonate dissolution has been accelerating since the 1800s and may account for up to 10% of the missing ∼0.3 Pg C yr−1 in ocean model carbon budgets."

The perturbation experiments suggest that the undercurrent decadal variability is controlled by variable coastal sea‐ice freshwater fluxes, these driven by winds mechanically opening and closing coastal polynyas. With the perturbation experiments we also quantify a positive feedback mechanism between the undercurrent and ice‐shelf melting which is responsible for 25% $25\%$ of their decadal variability."

However, it is not clear how seasonal to sub‐seasonal variations in surface melt forcings affect the dynamics of melt recharge into a firn aquifer and the accompanying refreezing processes. Here, we use a hydrological model to probe how different styles of seasonal melting influence the recharge of a firn aquifer and the structural changes of the unsaturated firn column above. We find that a simple subsurface energy balance can provide a good estimation for melt partitioning, however our results suggest that the early dynamics of the melt season dictates the timing of recharge. Further, we show that an increased magnitude of melt in a single season leads to deeper refreezing, and that seasons with intermittent melt events can create ice lenses at depth."

Trends show annual TSMIN is rising at nearly all stations, however, 60% and 29% of sites show winter and spring declines, respectively, despite air temperature increasing at 98.7% and 72% of them. Explanatory analysis links these seasonal contrasts to mean air and soil temperature, and trends of snow‐free days and snowpack depth.

 Conceptual engineering system design faces challenges from traditional methods and emerging AI tools to fully address its inherently complex, dynamic, and creativity-driven demands. iDesignGPT is a framework that integrates large language models with established design methodologies to enable dynamic multi-agent collaboration for problem refinement, information gathering, design space exploration, and evaluation. By incorporating design metrics such as coverage, diversity, and novelty, iDesignGPT provides quantitative insights for early-stage conceptual design. Performance evaluations across six public design challenges show that iDesignGPT achieves competitive novelty and consistently higher originality and modularity than GPT-4o zero-shot, GPT-4o chain-of-thought and Deepseek-r1, based on metrics and expert assessments. Two controlled user studies show positive reception across profiles and, for novice designers, lower mental demand than human-only design and clearer design flow with iDesignGPT. These results establish iDesignGPT as a practical framework for integrating language-model agents with established engineering design methods, enabling metrics-driven support for conceptual design by both expert and novice designers.

 The bacterial accessory genome, comprised of plasmids, phages, and other mobile elements, underpins the adaptability of bacterial populations. Pangenome (core and accessory) analysis of pathogens can reveal epidemiological relatedness missed by using core-genome methods alone. Employing a k-mer-based Jaccard Index approach to compute pangenome relatedness, we explore the population structure and epidemiology of Salmonella enterica serotype Hadar (Hadar), an emerging zoonotic pathogen in the United States (U.S.) linked to both commercial and backyard poultry. A total of 3384 U.S. Hadar genomes collected between 1990 and 2023 are analyzed here. Hadar populations underwent substantial shifts between 2019 and 2020 in the U.S., driven by the expansion of a lineage carrying a previously uncommon prophage-like element. Phylogenetic and pangenomic relatedness, coupled with epidemiological data, suggest this lineage emerged from extant populations circulating in commercial poultry, with subsequent dissemination into backyard poultry environments. We demonstrate the utility of pangenomic approaches for mapping vertical and horizontal diversity and informing complex dynamics of zoonotic bacterial pathogens.

 Spin-crossover complexes are promising candidates for molecular bits owing to their magnetic bistability. However, it’s a formidable challenge to turn densely packed spin-crossover molecules into high-density bits due to cooperative switching dynamics inherent in spin-crossover aggregates. Herein, coordination-field engineering is demonstrated by scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and density functional theory as an efficient strategy to modulate the cooperative dynamics of surface-confined spin-crossover chains. Within these chains, Ni centers exhibit collective spin transitions upon local stimuli. This spin-crossover cooperativity can be disrupted by coordination-field modification via hetero-metal/ligand doping, which converts partial switchable coordination centers into non-switchable nodes. These nodes divide the single-bit-like spin-crossover chain into multiple independently-switchable segments and thereby augment the bit density. One-by-one erasable write-in of these spin-crossover bits is achieved by scanning tunneling microscope tip manipulation. These results highlight how to precisely tweak the cooperative dynamics of the spin-crossover aggregates to advance their potential applications for high-density memory.

 Earthquakes and seismically-induced landslides accelerate carbon export from mountains by eroding hillslope soil carbon. However, a quantitative understanding of their net contribution to carbon cycling remains incomplete. Using the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan Earthquake which generated the largest landslide volume in recent history, we quantify its carbon mass balance accounting for storage, loss, and transport within the ensuing sediment cascade. Thanks to post-event revegetation and extensive intermontane sediment storage, we show that the earthquake boosted Longmenshan carbon mass by ~10%. Given the stability of these deposits and low rates of carbon export, we anticipate this landslide carbon will persist for centuries to millennia before gradually declining. In effect, we demonstrate that earthquakes and landslides function as capacitors, regulating carbon storage and discharge across mountain belts over time. This suggests frequent landslides in seismically-active mountains may lead to a net carbon sequestration, providing a critical and direct link between tectonics and the carbon cycle.

Two-dimensional sheet conductivity arises but is suppressed when twist angles lead to interfacial lattice aperiodicity. 
 Probing novel properties, arising from twisted interfaces, has traditionally relied on the stacking of exfoliated two-dimensional materials and the spontaneous formation of van der Waals bonds. So far, investigations involving intimate covalent or ionic bonds have not been a focus. Yet, we show here that an established technique, involving thermocompressional wafer bonding, works well for creating twisted non-van der Waals interfaces. We have successfully bonded z-cut lithium niobate single crystals to create ferroelectric oxide interfaces with strong polar discontinuities and have mapped the associated emergent interfacial conductivity. In some instances, a dramatic change in microstructure occurs, involving local dipolar switching. A twist-induced collapse in the capability of the system to effec8tively screen interfacial bound charge is implied. Importantly, this only occurs around specific moiré twist angles with sparse coincident lattices and associated short-range aperiodicity. In quasicrystals, aperiodicity is known to induce pseudo-bandgaps and we suspect a similar phenomenon here.

 The natural land carbon sink (SLAND) absorbs roughly 25–30% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, thus playing a critical role in offsetting climate warming. In the Global Carbon Budget (GCB), SLAND is estimated using model simulations that isolate the carbon response of land to environmental changes (i.e. rising atmospheric CO2, nitrogen deposition, and changes in climate). However, these simulations assume fixed pre-industrial land cover, failing to represent today’s human-altered landscapes. This leads to a systematic overestimation of forest area, and thus CO2 sink strength, in regions heavily altered by human activity. We present a new process-based approach to estimate SLAND using Dynamic Global Vegetation Models. Our corrected estimate reduces SLAND by ~20% (0.6 PgC yr-1) over 2015–2024, from 3.00 ± 0.94 to 2.42 ± 0.77 PgC yr-1. We incorporate this new SLAND estimate with emissions from land-use change from bookkeeping models, to estimate a net land sink of 1.19 ± 1.04 PgC yr-1, which aligns closely with atmospheric inversion constraints. This downward revision of SLAND reduces the magnitude of the budget imbalance for 2015–2024, indicating a more consistent partitioning of the global carbon budget."

 The Indo-Pacific Convergence Zone is a key carbon sink via silicate weathering, yet its glacial-interglacial carbon dioxide consumption remains unclear. Here we reconstruct silicate weathering fluxes over the past 700,000 years by combining the global geochemical numerical model GEOCLIM with machine learning algorithms to constrain silicate weathering history in the Indo-Pacific Convergence Zone. Our results show that during glacial periods, weathering fluxes peaked at approximately 1.86 × 1012 moles per year, drawing down about 9.3 ppmv of carbon dioxide. Exposure of continental shelves during low sea levels raised glacial weathering by 33%, but high-frequency positive rainfall anomalies amplified this increase by 54–130% (approximately 9.2–13.7 ppmv carbon dioxide). This underscores how sea-level change and hydrology control tropical shelf weathering. Our study provides critical insights into past climatic transitions, emphasizing the Indo-Pacific Convergence Zone’s role in regulating the global carbon cycle and offering constraints for future climate projections.

 A lack of historical land-use data hinders the appropriate assessment of ecosystem restoration potential. Here we integrate pollen and phytolith analysis, isotopic dating, historical records, and high-resolution satellite imagery to reconstruct five centuries of land-use and vegetation change in the karst landscapes of Southwest China. We show that prior to the 18th century, dense forests dominated the region under minimal human influence. However, the introduction of maize cultivation, rapid population growth, and extensive deforestation triggered a persistent shift toward open landscapes. This transformation is evidenced by a marked rise in pioneer fern spores (~11%) and an increase in herb pollen by 3.7–18.8%. In areas with severe historical human disturbance, ecological recovery remains difficult, and tree numbers have remained nearly unchanged over the past two decades, despite the absence of human intervention. Overlooking these historical land-use legacies in restoration efforts may possibly lead to unrealistic expectations, misguided interventions, and wasted resources.

 Sea level rise, coastal erosion and climate change are major stressors for coastal communities, whose expansion may be also limited by land scarcity and environmental issues. Floating cities may represent an interesting solution, but require further conceptual development, both in terms of technological means and architectural vision. Furthermore, their feasibility and sustainability still need to be explored more in depth. In view of these gaps, here we propose an innovative floating city vision, based on a comprehensive approach, including qualitative and quantitative analyses and ranging between all the above-mentioned topics. The concept is built around three pillars: resilience, sustainability, and urban welfare, corresponding to the three elements of water, nature, and man, respectively. A preliminary quantitative analysis about space, food and energy requirements confirms the feasibility of the floating city and provides a benchmark for future investigation on similar concepts.

 Accurately and timely detecting road pavement damage helps monitor road deterioration extent, thereby guiding maintenance projects and ensuring traffic safety. Nevertheless, due to textural similarity and nested distribution between neighboring pavement damages, as well as the damages with the diversity sizes, irregular shapes, multiple categories, current methods have the limitation in the high-quality detection from road street-level images. To tackle these challenges, this paper develops a novel real-time anchor-free network with a one-stage processing architecture, named RPDNet, for precisely and accurately detecting pavement damages from streel-level road images. First, stacked with a layer-by-layer encoding structure boosted by a deformable fully-attentive module as the backbone extractor, the RPDNet can capture more fine-grained information and generate multiscale strong task-aware semantics, favoring significantly the discrimination noteworthy textural and geometric features. Then, by adopting a multi-level efficient aggregation neck, the RPDNet can promote informative spatial details and integrate the different-level damage encoding features, contributing to the light-weight and optimization of the whole architecture. Afterward, designed with a dual-large kernel module, embedded in a decoupled detection head with anchor-free guidance, the RPDNet can project the ranging dependency of salient and task-oriented pavement damage objects by adaptively aggregating information across large kernels in spatial-domain. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations confirmed that the RPDNet provided a promiseful solution for detecting pavement damages in industrial applications under complex street-level road conditions. Furthermore, comparative analysis with the latest anchor-based and anchor-free alternatives also proved the superiority and generalization of the RPDNet in pavement damage detection tasks. The assessment results displayed that the RPDNet obtained an average mAP@0.5, mAP@0.5:0.95, precision, and recall of 69.16%, 44.86%, 72.59%, and 60.41%, respectively, on two dataset.

 Underground resource extraction redistributes subsurface stress, inducing overburden movement and ground deformation. These geomechanical changes can cause ground fissures, slope failures, and collapses, resulting in resource loss, economic damage, safety risks, and environmental degradation. Therefore, accurate monitoring of surface deformation and understanding of deformation propagation mechanisms are crucial for sustainable resource extraction and geohazard mitigation. To this end, a fusion framework is proposed that integrates a three-dimensional physical model with Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology to monitor surface deformation and investigate deformation propagation. A mining area in China was selected as a case study. Sentinel-1A images were processed using Stacking-InSAR and Small Baseline Subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) techniques to derive surface deformation. InSAR-derived deformation was validated against GNSS measurements, yielding mean absolute errors (MAE) of 35.7 mm for Stacking-InSAR and 6.5 mm for SBAS-InSAR. Although SBAS-InSAR exhibits higher precision in coherent areas, it provides missing/invalid measurements in the central high-intensity deformation zone (cumulative deformation > 300 mm), indicating limited applicability under strong mining-induced disturbances. Concurrently, a large-scale three-dimensional physical model was constructed, and overburden strain and surface deformation were measured using distributed optical fiber sensing (DOFS) and digital close-range industrial photogrammetry (DCRIP). After scaling to the prototype, the physical-model surface deformation agrees well with the Stacking-InSAR measurements (mean relative error 17%–18%), confirming the reliability of the constructed physical model. Moreover, a prediction model was developed using synergistic monitoring data, achieving a root mean square error (RMSE) of 52.2 mm (i.e., 6.35% of the maximum deformation of 822.4 mm) and a standard deviation (STD) of 51.8 mm (6.30%) relative to the Stacking-InSAR results. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively bridges laboratory-scale observations and field-scale satellite measurements, thereby improving the understanding of underground-to-surface deformation propagation under mining-induced disturbances. Furthermore, this integration enables high-precision estimation of mining-induced deformation and supports coupled surface and underground deformation analysis."

 The Hadley circulation (HC) is the dominant meridional circulation in the tropics, and its interannual variability exerts a strong influence on the global climate system. While the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a well-known tropospheric driver, the stratospheric Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) also contributes to tropical variability. However, the mechanisms through which the QBO modulates HC variability remain unclear. Using reanalysis data and CMIP6 model outputs, this study demonstrates that the vertical structure of the QBO plays a crucial role in modulating the interannual variability of the HC during autumn, particularly over the western Pacific. When the QBO vertical structure index (QBOVI) is greater than 0, a secondary circulation forms, characterized by equatorial ascent and midlatitude descent. This circulation is associated with a cold anomaly in the lower stratosphere, which reduces static stability near the tropopause and strengthens the local HC over the western Pacific. Conversely, when the QBOVI is less than 0, the static stability in the upper troposphere is enhanced, leading to a weakening of the HC. The evaluation of six selected high-top CMIP6 models shows that the models fail to capture the observed relationship between the QBO vertical structure and the HC. This limitation may arise from biases in simulating the link between HC intensity and static stability, as well as from difficulties in reproducing the QBO's regulation of the thermal structure near the tropopause. Improving model representations of this modulation could enhance the simulation and prediction of interannual HC variability."

The composition of the plume conduit shows conventional concentric zoning prior to the Hawaiian-Emperor Bend and gradually evolves to a north-south bilateral zoning pattern afterward, corresponding to the subparallel Loa-Kea trends. Further analysis suggests that the plume originates from ridges of large low-velocity province (LLVP) induced by the push of slabs. Upwelling at the intersections of ridges is more energetic than at the middle of the ridge, causing bottom-up splitting of plume conduit in the lower mantle that propagates upward, forming bilateral zoning and eventually two independent plumes. This process suggests that bilateral zoning is transient and more common in the Pacific than Africa due to the circum-Pacific subduction."

Upon tumor-selective activation in metastatic bone niches, this nanotherapy induces STING-driven immune priming and GSDMB-mediated pyroptosis, triggering potent antitumor responses. Crucially, LipoNCs@pGSDMB restore voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) expression in tumor cells, a prognostic biomarker identified through multiomics analysis of clinical specimens, thereby blocking calcium-dependent neurosignaling and disrupting prometastatic tumor-nerve cross-talk. In breast cancer bone metastasis models, this approach achieves 94% tumor suppression, complete pain resolution, and efficient bone restoration.

To dissect its tissue-specific functions, we generated a humanized floxedGpr75mouse model with conditional deletions in the brain and adipose tissue. Mice with brain-specific Gpr75 deletion using Nestin-Cre were resistant to diet-induced obesity, primarily through suppressed food intake and modest increases in energy expenditure. In contrast, adipocyte-specific deletion of Gpr75 had minimal effects on systemic metabolism but modestly enhanced mitochondrial oxygen consumption in brown adipose tissue under cold exposure. Gpr75 expression was up-regulated in key brain regions and down-regulated in white adipose tissue under high-fat diet conditions, supporting a predominant central role in metabolic adaptation. Histological and transcriptomic analyses further revealed depot-specific effects on adipocyte morphology and hepatic lipid accumulation in global knockouts. These findings position GPR75 as a critical regulator of central energy balance and provide a mechanistic framework for developing brain-targeted therapies against obesity."

Although functionally capable of clearing HIV-infected CD4+T cells in a tissue-mimetic environment, they show impaired cytotoxicity and transcriptional signs of exhaustion after infection. Conversely, HIV drives the reprogramming of immature CD16−CD69+NK cells toward a more cytotoxic and migratory effector phenotype.

Here, we demonstrate that RSV orchestrates the temporal and sequential regulation of distinct PCD pathways in human macrophages to optimize replication and dissemination. During early stages of infection, RSV activates the PI3K-Akt pathway to induce cFLIP expression, effectively suppressing TNF-driven extrinsic apoptosis. Simultaneously, viral degradation of ZDHHC9 prevents GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis downstream of NLRP3 activation, thereby sustaining an intracellular environment permissive to viral propagation. In contrast, following the completion of replication, RSV subverts caspase-1 signaling to trigger the intrinsic apoptotic cascade via the Casp-1–BID–APAF1–Casp-9 axis, and subsequently promotes GSDME-mediated secondary pyroptosis. This late-stage PCD reprogramming enables synchronized release of virions and pro-inflammatory cytokines, exacerbating pulmonary pathology. These findings delineate a temporally resolved strategy by which RSV balances early immune evasion with subsequent viral dissemination and immunopathology, and identify discrete stage-specific molecular targets for therapeutic intervention in RSV-induced lung disease."

Using a new reporter line, we achieved high-resolution mapping of this previously undercharacterized vertebrate visual circuit. Genetic disruption of Lrrn CAMs leads to disorganization of the circuit and impairments in brightness and contrast sensitivity, resulting in deficits in visually guided behavior.

However, the increasing severity of fungicide resistance necessitates urgent clarification of its evolutionary mechanisms to optimize disease management and delay resistance development. The DddA-derived cytosine base editors (DdCBEs)–mediated base editing in oomycetes confirmed that thePsCytbS33Lmutation is sufficient to confer ametoctradin resistance inPhytophthora sojae. We clarified that low-resistant and medium-resistant mutants serve as transitional populations during the resistance evolution process, with high-resistant mutants eventually becoming the dominant population. We revealed the dynamic changes in mitochondrial heterogeneity under fungicide selection, proving that the gradual increase of mutated mitochondria drives resistance evolution. There is a trade-off between ametoctradin resistance and fitness. While thePsCytbS33Lmutation confers this resistance, it impairs mitochondrial function and thereby reduces fitness. Up-regulation ofTFAM1, however, can partially offset this fitness cost. Resistance evolution in plant pathogens involves not only standing variation but also de novo mutations, providing unique insights into the “chicken-and-egg” dilemma."

However, the impact of disrupting antiferroptotic pathways in the broader tumor microenvironment (TME), such as in immune cells, is still undefined and may complicate treatments. Here, we show that ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1/Aifm2) is critically required for regulatory T cell (Tregcell) resistance to ferroptosis and their immunosuppressive function within the TME. Compared to other canonical ferroptosis regulators such as GPX4 and NRF2, only FSP1 was induced upon T cell activation. Deletion ofAifm2in all T cells, or Tregcells specifically, enhanced tumor control by selectively disrupting Tregcell immunosuppression within tumors without inciting autoimmune pathology in mice. As opposed to deletion ofGpx4in all T cells, T cell deletion ofAifm2did not impair antigen-specific CD8+T cell responses. These results reveal an opportunity for targeting a regulator of ferroptosis that can not only directly target cancer cells but also simultaneously enhance anticancer immune responses without inciting autoimmunity."

Moreover, iTregs, but not thymic Tregs, derived from these mice fail to suppress colitis in adoptive transfer models, indicating compromised inhibitory capacity. AgedTdrd3-deficient mice also show spontaneous autoinflammation.

Genetically encoded fluorescent indicators, coupled with fluorescence microscopy, have transformed plant biology, but their application remains largely confined to small model organisms and specialized microscopy instrumentation. Here, we present MAcro Plant Projection Imaging (MAPPI), an open-source, low-cost, and modular fluorescence imaging platform for soil-grown plants beyond the model organism or seedling stage. MAPPI enables wide field-of-view, dual-projection imaging of fluorescent reporters, supporting real-time visualization of systemic signals under near-physiological conditions. We validate MAPPI by tracking calcium andl-glutamate dynamics in adultNicotiana benthamianaplants, revealing developmentally regulated long-distance calcium waves triggered by wounding, burning, or submergence, including bidirectional shoot-to-root and root-to-shoot signaling. By democratizing access to whole-plant functional imaging, MAPPI provides a scalable tool for dissecting signal propagation, stress adaptation, and systemic communication in both model and nonmodel species."

Huang,Molecular and structural basis of a subfamily of PrfH rescuing both the damaged and intact ribosomes stalled in translation,"In bacteria, mRNAs degradation and ribotoxin-induced RNA damage are two main events that lead to the stalling of protein translation. The ubiquitous trans-translation system and several alternative rescue factors rescue the stalled ribosomes caused by truncated mRNAs lacking the stop codons. On the other hand, protein release factor homolog (PrfH) is the only known factor to rescue the stalled ribosome damaged by ribotoxins. Here, we show that a subfamily of PrfH, exemplified by PrfH fromCapnocytophaga gingivalis(CgPrfH), rescues both types of stalled ribosomes. Biochemical assays demonstrate thatCgPrfH hydrolyzes the peptides attached to P-site transfer RNAs when in complex with both the damaged and intact ribosomes. Cryo-EM structures revealed thatCgPrfH uses distinct regions to recognize two stalled ribosomes to orient the GGQ motif for peptide hydrolysis. Thus, using a combination of bioinformatic, biochemical, and structural characterization, we have uncovered a family of ribosome rescue factors that have dual activities to resolve two distinct stalled protein translation events in bacteria."

Traditionally, these protocols have been implemented and validated with a single entanglement source, as in the paradigmatic Bell scenario. However, advancing these protocols to support more complex configurations involving multiple entanglement sources is key to building robust architectures and realizing large-scale quantum networks. Here, we show how to certify randomness in an entanglement-teleportation experiment, the building block of a quantum repeater displaying two independent sources of entanglement. Using the scalar extension method, we address the challenge posed by the nonconvexity of the correlation set, providing effective bounds on an eavesdropper’s knowledge of the shared secret bits. Our theoretical model characterizes the certifiable randomness within the network and is validated through the analysis of experimental data from a photonic quantum network."

The nuclear export protein (NEP) is essential for this process and also regulates viral RNA synthesis, implicating a direct interaction with the viral RNA polymerase. Here, we present a 2.5-Å cryogenic electron microscopy structure of NEP bound to the IAV polymerase and demonstrate that NEP alone is sufficient to promote vRNP export, with the viral matrix protein 1 enhancing export efficiency. NEP forms a four-helix bundle that binds at the interface of the PA C-terminal domain and PB1 N terminus of the polymerase. The NEP binding site at this interface overlaps with those for the host ANP32 and the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, indicating that it functions as a regulatory hotspot coordinating transitions of the viral polymerase between RNA synthesis and nuclear export, revealing a critical layer of control in the IAV replication cycle."

For thermoelectric devices, researchers principally focused on chemical reactivity and mechanical properties of material components, whereas precise control of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) remains elusive. Here, we propose an innovative strategy using negative-thermal-expansion (NTE) particles to regulate CTE and resolve interfacial incompatibility. Incorporating predesigned interface reaction–free NTE particles into Bi2Te3-based, Mg3Sb2-based, and PbTe-based materials effectively improves thermoelectric performance, alleviates thermal stress, and enhances interfacial stability across a broad temperature range (300 to 800 kelvin). Notably, the NTE-modified Mg3(Sb,Bi)2/Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3two-pair module achieves a record-high conversion efficiency (η) of 8.4% at ΔT= 350 K with a 71% interfacial thermal stress reduction, maintaining a stable interface and unchanged η throughout 1000-hour (42 days) thermal cycling.

High-throughput experiments and coupled modeling demonstrate precise tuning of viscoelastic and plastic properties, as well as programmable constitutive behaviors and strain distributions. A modular assembly strategy allows scalable 3D construction of reprogrammable composites into free-form, bulk geometries.

Here, a metabolomic screen in naïve glioblastoma cells treated with dexamethasone revealed the accumulation ofN1-methylnicotinamide, a nicotinamideN-methyltransferase (NNMT) product, through glucocorticoid receptor activation. Using stable isotope-assisted metabolomics in patients with glioblastoma, we showed that nicotinamide conversion intoN1-methylnicotinamide exceeds that into NAD+, leading to a ~7-fold accumulation ofN1-methylnicotinamide in tumor compared to surrounding brain tissue. In orthotopic models, NNMT activity was enhanced by dexamethasone selectively in glioblastoma tumors but not in contralateral brain. Leveraging the tumor-specific activity of NNMT, we developed a novel11C-nicotinamide–based positron emission tomography (PET) approach to visualizing glioblastoma tumors. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that the dexamethasone-induced methionine-dependent nicotinamide methylation becomes detrimental for glioblastoma when combined with a methionine-restricted diet. These results show that steroids rewire methionine and nicotinamide metabolism, enabling the development of innovative PET imaging and metabolic therapies for glioblastoma."

These immune systems are easily gained and lost, allowing adaptation to threats. However, the mechanism of mobilization of chromosomally encoded defense genes remains poorly understood. Here, we show that phage- and phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI)–mediated lateral transduction (LT), a highly efficient horizontal gene transfer mechanism, facilitates the transfer of these defense genes between bacteria. Using several bacterial models, we demonstrate that defense systems are often positioned near phage or PICI attachment sites, allowing them to exploit LT for their mobility. In addition, LT diversifies defense genes carried by prophages and PICIs, driving immune system evolution and turnover. These processes provide phage resistance to new bacterial hosts and profoundly affect population genomics. Our findings reveal LT as a crucial mechanism shaping bacterial evolution and influencing the trajectory of pathogenic clones in nature."

CD318 is expressed in myeloid dendritic cells and activated monocytes associated with immunoregulatory functions. Here, selective expression of CD318 on a subset of activated human CD8+T cells, but not CD4+T cells, is shown, defining suppressor function of this cell population. CD318+CD8 T cells exhibited reduced PD-1 and KLRG-1 expression, diminished interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor–α production, and potent suppression of autologous CD4 and CD8 T cell activation in vitro. Notably, CD8 T cells from patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) showed reduced CD318 induction compared with controls. Mechanistically, CD318 inhibited T cell receptor signaling independently of SHP2, while its induction required interleukin-2–dependent mTOR activation. These findings identify CD318 as a marker of human CD8+T cells with implications for immune regulation and autoimmunity."

Methanol is a promising energy carrier and a favorable substrate for biotechnology applications due to its high energy conversion efficiency and easy integration with existing infrastructure. Eubacterium limosum has the native ability to convert methanol into valuable chemicals, including acetate, butyrate, and hexanoate. However, oxidized cosubstrates such as CO2 or formate are generally required due to limitations in energy and redox balance. In this study, we demonstrate a novel approach using extracellular electron transfer (EET) with ferric iron (ferrihydrite) as an electron acceptor to enable methanol fermentation without carbon cosubstrates. This ferrihydrite-assisted methanol fermentation yielded a product spectrum like methanol-formate cofermentation, producing more reduced chemicals such as hexanoate. Physiological evidence indicated that cysteine (Cys-SH), an amino acid containing a thiol group (R-SH) and typically included in anaerobic media, was essential in enabling the indirect EET process between E. limosum and ferrihydrite. Thiol regeneration from cystine (Cys–S–S–Cys) confirmed that E. limosum catalyzed the cysteine/cystine recycling. Proteomic analysis revealed the metabolic pathways of this cysteine-mediated EET process. This EET-driven process advances our understanding of microbial carbon cycling and provides a sustainable biotechnology for chemical production."

However, how long-term soil management practices influence these priming effects, and thus their implications for cropland carbon sequestration, remains unclear. Here, we conducted a 70-day incubation by adding polyethylene micro/nanoplastics at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.1, 0.5, and 1% w/w) to soils that had received biochar or straw amendments for 14 years. Using δ13C source partitioning, we found that micro/nanoplastics induced positive priming in control and low-dose biochar soils, driven by dilution from micro/nanoplastic-leached dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which increased bulk DOC and reduced aromaticity. These changes increased microbial biomass, C- and N-acquiring enzyme activities, intensifying nitrogen mining and SOC mineralization. Conversely, negative priming occurred in high-dose biochar soils and in straw-amended soils at the 0.1% micro/nanoplastic rate, where micro/nanoplastic addition reduced bulk DOC and increased aromaticity, likely via preferential sorption of low-aromatic soil DOC onto micro/nanoplastic surfaces. These changes reduced microbial biomass and enzyme activities while promoting the microbial preferential utilization of micro/nanoplastic-leached carbon, thereby favoring SOC preservation. Overall, this study demonstrates that high-dose biochar hinders micro/nanoplastic-induced positive priming by regulating substrate–microbial interactions, with important implications for cropland carbon retention."

We conducted a multicenter panel study with 24 h real-time personal measurements among generally healthy middle-aged and elderly individuals to investigate potential effects of short-term personal exposures to noise and temperature on ST-segment depression event (STDE) and whether the effects of noise are modified by temperature and vice versa. Generalized linear mixed-effect model and stratified analyses were used. A total of 117 eligible participants completed 256 person-visits. We found increased risks of STDE associated with personal noise exposure and U-shaped exposure–effect relationships between personal temperature exposure and risks of STDE, both occurring over minutes to hours. The nonoptimum temperatures, including low and high temperatures, significantly enhanced the adverse effects of noise on STDE. Significant effect modifications on temperature-related STDE risk by noise were found in both the low and high temperature ranges. Exploratory analyses suggested that decreases in heart rate variability variables, reflecting autonomic imbalance, may explain exposure-related STDE occurrence. Our study identified the independent effects and two-way effect modifications of personal noise and temperature exposures on STDE risk, providing novel insights into the pathways linking these environmental factors to adverse cardiovascular outcomes."

However, there is an insufficient understanding of the effect of oxidant dosage on the reaction pathway, and the tuning of the reaction pathway between mineralization and polymerization has not yet been reported. In this study, we report an Fe-doped MoS2/peroxydisulfate (PDS) system for phenolic compounds (PCs) removal. This system undergoes a high-valent iron pathway and has a faster reaction rate when oxidizing PC with a higher electron donating capability. More importantly, we elucidate that a polymerization reaction exists in the Fe-MoS2/PDS system, and the oxidant dosage significantly affects the reaction pathway. Low oxidant dosage facilitates the polymerization reaction process, and high oxidant dosage normally leads to electron transfer-based degradation. It is also found that 2,6-dimethylphenol (DMP), 4-methoxy-phenol (MOP), p-cresol (MP), methylparaben (MeP), and nitrophenol (NP) have a high degree of polymerization trend among the 11 tested PCs, which stems from their polymer products being more easily adsorbed on the catalyst surface.

PS NPs exhibit route-specific phytotoxicity: while only high-dose root exposure inhibits photosynthesis, foliar exposure causes sustained inhibition. Importantly, soil-based foliar exposure also inhibits photosynthesis without the PS NP translocation to grains. This foliar-specific inhibition correlates directly with PS accumulation in leaves and is mechanistically attributed to its colocalization with chloroplasts (Pearson’s r = 0.592), as confirmed by confocal imaging in high-dose (35.7 μg PS plant–1 d–1) exposed leaf. The colocalization impairs both the light-dependent reactions and carbon fixation during photosynthesis, as evidenced by significant reductions in photosynthetic pigments (54.4–61.0%), Hill reaction activity (49.9–70.2%), ATP production (22.1–24.3%), net photosynthetic rate (84.5–89.0%), Rubisco activity (84.6–87.5%), stomatal conductance (47.9–69.5%), and transpiration rate (47.4–48.9%). Transcriptomic analysis identifies the genetic basis of this inhibition, showing significant downregulation of the core photosynthesis pathway and key genes for photosynthetic-antenna proteins, carbon fixation, and carotenoid/porphyrin metabolism.

Herein, we conducted a comprehensive NHANES analysis to estimate the Hazard Ratio (HR) of earlier menopause associated with PFOA exposure and further investigated the underlying mechanisms through a prenatal mouse model and complementary cell-based assays. Higher serum PFOA levels were significantly associated with earlier age at natural menopause (2nd tertile: HR = 1.220, P = 0.004; third tertile: HR = 1.262, P = 0.002). In mice, prenatal PFOA exposure caused persistent ovarian dysfunction in middle-aged F1 offspring, characterized by ovarian cyst formation, a premature decline in ovulatory capacity, increased follicular atresia, and disrupted estrous cyclicity. PFOA induced granulosa cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, increasing the arrested population from 84.9% to 87.6%, thereby reducing proliferation as a key contributor to ovarian cyst formation. Transcriptomic profiling and qPCR validation demonstrated that PFOA activated PPARγ signaling, with PPARγ and ANGPTL4 upregulated by 1.6-fold and 12.6-fold, respectively. PFOA exposure further induced upregulation of ANGPTL4 as revealed by siRNA-mediated knockdown assays, which mediated reduced granulosa cell proliferation.

Traditional detection methods, albeit important, are limited by single analytical indicators and time-consuming procedures, which lead to distorted detection results for biomarkers with high metabolic rates. Herein, a multiplexed electrochemical sensing array was designed based on nanozyme capsules; this metal-porphyrin-structured covalent–organic framework embedded with enzymes simultaneously detected H2O2, acetylcholine (ACh), and glucose (Glu). The nanozyme capsule not only exhibits peroxidase-like activity for the sensitive detection of H2O2 but also serves as a carrier to encapsulate enzymes within its cavities, forming a cascade catalytic system for the specific recognition of ACh or Glu. This sensor features a broad detection range, low detection limits, and a strong anti-interference capability. More importantly, it can rapidly quantify three easily degradable biomarkers in neuronal lysates within 3 min without pretreatment. With the sensor, we multidimensionally assessed and differentiated the effects of different microplastics (MPs) based on the ability of neurons to produce ACh and H2O2 as well as their glucose uptake capacity. Furthermore, it is found that MPs induce stronger neurotoxic effects under hyperglycemia.

While carboxyl surface modification is known to reduce NP toxicity in some systems, its protective efficacy in intestinal environments remains unclear. This study investigated the comparative effects of pristine PS and PMMA versus their carboxylated derivatives (PS-COOH and PMMA-COOH) on gut dysbiosis in zebrafish larvae. Pathological examination revealed that PS induced the most severe intestinal epithelial damage, which was effectively mitigated by carboxylation. Conversely, PMMA triggered robust gut inflammation, evidenced by significant upregulation of proinflammatory markers IL-1β and NOS2A, effects that persisted despite carboxylation. These differences were correlated with microbiota shifts: PMMA groups significantly enriched opportunistic pathogens (Vibrio and Morganella), while PS-COOH only partially restored microbial balance. Functional analyses identified that carboxylation disrupts key microbial pathways, including amino acid metabolism and NOD-like receptor signaling, which are crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis. The roles of gut microbes were further verified by challenging the microbiota-depleted model with Morganella morganii. Our results demonstrate that polymer composition dictates carboxyl modification efficacy─protective for PS but ineffective for PMMA─highlighting the need for material-specific NP safety assessments."

 Polygenic scores (PGS) quantify genetic contributions to complex traits, yet existing single- and multi-ancestry methods lack multi-dimensional evaluation within a unified framework. Here, we benchmarked 13 state-of-the-art PGS methods across 36 traits in UK Biobank European and African samples. The prediction performance, computational efficiency, the number of variants, and the impact of different linkage disequilibrium (LD) reference sizes were thoroughly assessed for each method. Results of single-ancestry methods demonstrate that LDpred2 has superior performance across a broad spectrum of complex traits in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency; however, other methods remain valuable for specific traits. For multi-ancestry methods, PRS-CSx and X-Wing have comparable performance, whereas LDpred2-multi outperforms both. Notably, we find that increasing the panel size of the LD reference significantly elevates PGS performance for sample sizes below 1,000, and it reaches a plateau when it exceeds 5,000 samples. Furthermore, implementing PGS calculation methods requires considerable technical effort and resource allocation. To support easy use of these PGS methods, we developed a user-friendly online computing platform, PGS-hub, that integrates all evaluated methods and is pre-configured with ancestry-stratified LD panels. This resource enables a scalable and harmonized PGS computation platform for the PGS community.

 Reversal tasks have been regarded as probes of behavioural inhibition and linked to prefrontal and specifically orbitofrontal cortex. The centrality of behavioural inhibition to reversal task performance and the task’s dependence on particular prefrontal sub-regions have, however, been questioned in primates. Using a combination of whole brain recording, transient ultrasonic disruption, two types of reversal task, and a task model emphasizing identification of transitions between latent states, we show that male macaques track latent state transitions in addition to choice values in reversal tasks. Activity reflecting both these features is prominent in dorsomedial frontal cortex, and anterior and dorsomedial thalamus when, and just before, animals select choices. By contrast, hippocampal activity continually tracks the probability of a reversal between latent states. We identify patterns of activity interaction spanning the three nodes of this circuit and demonstrate that disruption of each leads to reversal task impairment albeit in different ways.

 Existing technologies for chlorine (Cl2) synthesis are generally suffered from low productivity or high production cost. Guided by Bernoulli’s principle, here we report an efficient yet cost-effective electrochemical system for Cl2 electrosynthesis, which is composed of anodic chlorine evolution reaction (CER) connected to gas chamber by triple-phase gas diffusion layer. The key is to modulate gas diffusion layer by Bernoulli’s principle, wherein the pressure difference at triple-phase boundary drives oriented Cl2 migration directly into gas chamber, thus preventing the crossover of anodic/cathodic products. By further joining with a pH-tolerant catalyst, a standalone prototype device is built for high-rate Cl2 production, operating at the Faradaic efficiencies of 96.3% ~ 87.6% in the current density range of 0.1 ~ 1.14 A cm−2, having superior Cl2 synthesis performance. Further technical-economic evaluations of our synthetic scheme demonstrate reduced Cl2 production cost, saving 6.75% (1.17 million dollar per year) as comparison to conventional chlor-alkali design. We expect these findings offer broader opportunities to develop industrially production processes for other chemical commodities.

 Papaya is a trioecious species with XX females, XY males, and XYh hermaphrodites. Any combination of Y and Yh chromosomes is lethal. The gene underlying YY lethality is pivotal in the transition from stage 2 to stage 3 in sex chromosome evolution. Here, we identify and functionally validate the YY lethality gene in papaya, CpYYL. Loss of CpYYL function accelerates glycolysis and reduces sucrose accumulation in embryo, causing embryo abortion. CpYYL interacts with CpAKRP and overexpression of both genes partially rescues seed abortion in the heterozygous emb506 and akrp mutants, indicating conserved role in plastid differentiation and embryo development. Viable YYh and YhYh plants are generated through genetic engineering and crossing, although both genotypes show high seedling mortality. Crossing YYh male with XX female papaya shows 1:1 ratio of male to hermaphrodite plants without recombination between MSY and HSY. Identification of CpYYL fills a critical gap in papaya sex chromosome evolution, and provides new resources for genomic and epigenetic studies.

Using structural biology, the authors reveal that sortilin acts as structural sensor of monomeric thyroglobulin, independently of its iodination and hormone content, via binding of a flexible C-terminal peptide. 
 Sortilin is a ubiquitous membrane receptor mediating trafficking of protein cargoes. In the thyroid, sortilin binds thyroglobulin (TG) during its endocytosis, a key process in thyroid homeostasis. Although sortilin has been proposed to recognise highly iodinated TG, the molecular details of this interaction remain unknown. In this work, using an integrative structural biology approach, we reveal that sortilin binds an unstructured TG C-terminal peptide and exhibits a strong preference for the monomeric TG over the commonly known dimeric form. We find that sortilin-TG interaction is independent of the iodination state of TG and instead relies on the conversion to its monomeric state, presumably promoted by extracellular degradation. Furthermore, using AlphaPulldown and sequence analysis, we show that recognition of other reported ligands by sortilin likely relies on similar unstructured peptide motifs, which are not constrained to a single binding orientation within the receptor cavity. Overall, this study reveals the TG-sortilin binding interface and provides insights into the recognition mechanism of other cargoes by sortilin.

 Permafrost degradation causes irreversible damage to Arctic civil infrastructure and threatens the broader pan-Arctic economy. Currently, the lack of community-scale, geomechanics-based mapping of Arctic infrastructure geohazards hinders effective local infrastructure planning. Here, we develop a framework that integrates physics-constrained geotechnical models with a process-based ground thermal model to assess the 21st century changes in thaw settlement and bearing capacity of civil infrastructure foundations at a 30-meter spatial resolution. We find that settlement is accelerating and bearing capacity is decreasing nonlinearly at both regional and local scales. By mid-century, less than 10% of the infrastructure in northern Alaska is projected to be at risk; however, a transition window emerges between the 2060 s and 2080 s. During this transition period, infrastructure risk will increase sharply, and most infrastructures are projected to be at risk. Our results underscore the urgent need for proactive adaptation strategies to protect Arctic infrastructure from permafrost degradation-induced geohazards.

 Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTSs) are critical indicators of permafrost degradation, with significant implications for ecosystems, infrastructure, and carbon cycling. However, their evolutionary processes remain poorly understood due to limited high-resolution observations. Here, centimeter-scale UAV surveys were conducted from 2019 to 2024 to track eight RTSs on the Tibetan Plateau, with site-specific monitoring frequencies ranging from one to six surveys per year. These RTSs displayed tongue-, trumpet-, or funnel-shaped elongated morphologies with an average aspect ratio of 3.0 and were predominantly north-facing. Their areas, volumes, and headwall heights ranged from 1688.4 to 38,991.9 m2, 594.1 to 51,961.1 m3, and 0.9 to 4.6 m, respectively. Most RTSs featured a three-part structure—rear-edge slumping, mid-slope sliding, and front-edge accumulation—each with distinct deformation characteristics. Two evolutionary pathways of RTS expansion, immediate-triggered and threshold-delayed, were identified. RTS activity was observed from June to October, with the most intense activity occurred between September and late October. Annual and monthly expansion averaged 1182.9 m2 yr−1 and 505.7 m2 mo−1, while headwall retreat reached 14.5 m yr−1 and 6.2 m mo−1. Surface elevation exhibited rear-edge subsidence (mean 2.4 m), central uplift (mean 1.4 m), and stable front-edge, with net volume loss mainly due to subsidence (mean 81%). Surface movement decreased from the rear-edge to the front-edge, with maximum values at the rear-edge slumping zone. This study quantified the evolution of small-scale RTSs—including changes in area, headwall retreat, surface movement, elevation, and volume—particularly focusing on monthly dynamics, thereby enhancing understanding and impact assessment of RTS."

 River network selection is essential for generating multiscale river network datasets used in earth observation (EO) applications, such as hydrological analysis and terrain modeling. However, how individual river features influence selection decisions, especially across different drainage patterns, remains unclear. To address this gap, this study introduces an explainable artificial intelligence framework that integrates eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to uncover feature contributions for river network selection across different patterns. First, river strokes were constructed as analytical units and multiple geometric, topological, and hydrological features were extracted. Then, XGBoost-based selection models were trained for the parallel and rectangular drainage networks. Finally, the macro-, meso-, and micro-level SHAP analysis was conducted over the trained selection models. The experimental results reveal that features fall into three categories for the two types of patterns considered here: universal features (represented by upstream cumulative area, Horton code) that dominate selection regardless of pattern; pattern-sensitive features (represented by confluence angle, river proximity distance) whose influence varies with drainage patterns; and low-contribution features with negligible contribution. These findings explain why certain rivers are retained or removed across different drainage patterns, providing explainable insights to support automated, pattern-preserving generation of multiscale river networks."

Our set of simulations with the IPSL‐CM5A2 model reveals that this paleogeographic setting favored proto‐NADW upwelling at low latitudes, confining the AMOC to the Northern Hemisphere. Consequently, the role of southern westerly winds was limited, and the northward heat transport was weaker than in the modern ocean."

The 2025 Sagaing earthquake generated an exceptionally long rupture (∼535 km), offering a rare opportunity to investigate rupture dynamics along continental transform fault. We integrate complementary high‐resolution imaging geodesy, teleseismic and strong‐motion waveforms, back‐projection, and finite‐fault inversion to investigate rupture extent, process, and slip evolution. Our results reveal a marked bilateral asymmetry in both rupture extent and speed: it propagated ∼85 km northward at sub‐shear speeds and ∼450 km southward predominantly at supershear speeds (∼6 km/s), punctuated by short sub‐shear segments. We propose that structural barrier and stress shadows limited the extent, whereas the SF's bimaterial interface and local stress‐drop heterogeneity jointly may potentially drive the asymmetric, intermittent supershear behavior. These findings provide new insight into mechanisms controlling complex rupture on continental strike‐slip faults."

Here, we demonstrate that the formation of frozen ground alters salinity distribution in coastal unconfined aquifers, based on laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. Under steady‐state conditions with subzero ground temperature, frozen ground creates a confined flow path between itself and the saltwater wedge. This configuration accelerates terrestrial groundwater flow and induces a pronounced seaward retreat of the saltwater wedge. Moreover, lower ground surface and groundwater temperatures enhance this effect by promoting frozen ground formation.

In contrast to classical theory, β $\beta $ attains steady‐state (βs ${\beta }_{s}$) asymptotically in the dominant inertial regime, marking the validity of Forchheimer law. This highlights a hydrodynamic gap between Darcy and Forchheimer regimes, which is addressed using a physics‐based Eddy‐Growth Dynamics–Inertial Permeability (EG‐DIP) model. The EG‐DIP model contributes to ongoing discussions on inertial permeability by providing a framework to determine β(Re) $\beta (\text{Re})$, integrate it into Forchheimer law, and suggest a physical basis for estimating βs ${\beta }_{s}$. This supports predictive modeling of flow across regimes and identifies βs ${\beta }_{s}$ as the characteristic medium‐specific property for reliable correlation with porosity, permeability, and grain size. By unifying inertial flow theory through eddy growth dynamics, the EG‐DIP model has direct implications for injection‐induced seismicity, CO2 storage security, and geothermal energy recovery."

 Unstable slopes are highly susceptible to external triggers, representing a critical challenge for disaster risk management. However, few studies have systematically developed approaches for their regional-scale identification, and even fewer have explored their controlling factors in mining-affected regions with strong anthropogenic disturbances. To address this gap, this study investigates the composite factors influencing unstable slopes in the Datong Coalfield, China. Specifically, we used the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique to measure line-of-sight (LOS) surface deformation and subsequently identified unstable slopes as those with significant deformation velocities within a slope-unit framework. To examine the spatiotemporal effects of factors influencing slope instability, we conducted multivariate modeling at both long- and short-term scales. The results reveal that long-term modeling captures broadly consistent contributions of these factors across different periods, whereas short-term modeling highlights distinct seasonal associations with slope instability. Furthermore, cross-wavelet coherence analysis revealed that intermittently unstable slopes exhibit periodic lagged responses to dynamic environmental forcing, underscoring the significant role of environmental forcing in driving deformation of intermittently unstable slopes. Overall, this work provides new insights into the mechanisms of slope instability in mining-affected coalfields and proposes a transferable framework for regional-scale slope monitoring and risk management."

Questions addressing the threats and changes occurring in the pinewood habitat can now be explored across a 50 year time span for the first time. 
 The native pinewoods of Scotland are acknowledged to be an important ecological resource, both for their biodiversity value and as a cultural and amenity resource. Due to the unique nature of the habitat and its limited range, it plays a critical role as an early warning system for broader environmental issues. In the late 1960s and 70s, increased concern was expressed regarding a decline in the status and management of the pinewoods. In response to the concerns, an ecological monitoring survey was initiated by R.G.H. Bunce of the Nature Conservancy in 1971, recording ground flora, tree information, soils and other descriptive attributes. Since that time, interest in the pinewoods has increased further, and there is a general consensus that the habitat is more vulnerable than ever. Thanks to a recent repeat survey between 2018 and 2022, questions addressing the threats and changes occurring in the pinewoods can now be explored in a statistically robust way. These questions include issues surrounding the impacts of deer grazing, regeneration, the balance between native and exotic species, local disturbances, trends in ground flora species occurrences, climate change and recovery from acidification. The new data from the 2018–22 survey are now publicly available via the following DOI: https://doi.org/10.5285/5e268e86-4a4f-4112-bf2d-c3b0179c915c ‘Habitat, vegetation, tree and soil data from Native Pinewoods in Scotland, 2018–2022’."

Results show that model resolution and wave forcing, through both the Stokes-Coriolis force and Stokes drift, play a key role in shaping ocean circulation, seasonal energy budgets, and floating debris trajectories. High-resolution currents and wave forcing, especially during monsoons, increase the anisotropic spread and travel distances of drifting material. 
 The Indian Ocean basin faces significant anthropogenic pressure due to its connection to over 2.2 billion people through river basins. Indian Ocean dynamics are characterized by strong regional and seasonal variability driven by the monsoon system and intense eddy activity. To support future studies on land-sea transfers and marine debris dispersion in this complex ocean, we developed a new circulation modeling configuration using the hydrodynamic model SYMPHONIE. Our configuration introduces a unique telescopic grid covering the entire basin, enabling the study of sub-basin connectivity while resolving meso and submesoscale processes in the coastal region, from the Mozambique Channel to the Bay of Bengal, at a resolution of 1 to 3 km. Additionally, we integrate the recently released high-resolution GloFAS river discharge dataset to force the physical simulations with daily freshwater inputs. Three annual experiments are conducted, exploring the effects of wave forcing and spatial resolution. The reference simulation (IndOc.HR) uses high resolution without wave forcing, IndOc.HR-Sto uses the same resolution but includes wave forcing through both the Stokes-Coriolis force and the Stokes drift, and IndOc.12 is a lower-resolution simulation without wave forcing. Comparisons of temperature, salinity and sea level with in situ and satellite data show the good performance of the simulations and the ability of the high resolution model to accurately capture the spatial and temporal variability of surface dynamics and water masses over the Indian Ocean. We further analyze energy budgets and perform Lagrangian experiments to illustrate the critical role of resolution and waves in shaping the circulation and the resulting marine debris dispersion patterns. The effect of energy levels is particularly significant on trajectory statistics such as average travel distances and preferred spread direction. Notably, Stokes drift has a significant seasonal effect in the Arabian Sea during the southwest monsoon, while current field resolution strongly influences trajectories in the Mozambique Channel. Our results provide a robust modeling framework for studying Indian Ocean dynamics and exploring their effect on marine connectivity and the transport of matter, including pollutants, larvae or organic matter."

Bowman;Hong Zhang,Implementing riverine biogeochemical inputs in ECCO-Darwin: a sensitivity analysis of terrestrial fluxes in a data-assimilative global ocean biogeochemistry model,"Accounting for carbon and nutrients in rivers is essential for resolving carbon dioxide (CO2) exchanges between the ocean and the atmosphere. In this study, we add the effect of present-day rivers to a pioneering global-ocean biogeochemistry model. This study highlights the challenge for global ocean numerical models to cover the complexity of the flow of water and carbon across the Land-to-Ocean Aquatic Continuum. 
 Terrestrial sources of carbon and nutrients drive biogeochemical cycles in coastal regions and in the global ocean. Quantifying their impact on the spatiotemporal variability of the ocean carbon cycle is pivotal to understanding the distinctive characteristics of ocean basins dominated by riverine inflow. ECCO-Darwin is a data-constrained, global-ocean biogeochemistry model that has heretofore lacked lateral inputs of carbon and nutrients. The objective of this study is to add this new capability to ECCO-Darwin and to carry out a suite of sensitivity experiments in order to quantify the impact of these lateral fluxes on coastal- and open-ocean biogeochemistry. In this work, we use an optimized version of the data-assimilative global-ocean biogeochemistry ECCO-Darwin model to perform a sensitivity analysis of the ocean to lateral inputs of carbon and nutrients. We generate riverine inputs by combining daily point-source freshwater discharge from JRA55-do with the Global NEWS 2 watershed model, accounting for lateral inputs from 5171 watersheds worldwide. The addition of riverine inputs drives a small CO2 outgassing (+0.02 Pg C yr−1) due to compensating processes at regional scales. In basins dominated by carbon runoff, such as the Tropical Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, the addition of riverine inputs increases CO2 outgassing (+13 % and +9 %, respectively). In contrast, runoff in nutrient-dominated Southeast Asia leads to increased CO2 uptake (+9 %). This new riverine biogeochemical input capability will enable future ECCO-Darwin solutions to better capture key processes that occur along coastal margins in global oceans."

Anoxic batch microcosm incubations were constructed containing Wyoming MX80 bentonite (a candidate buffer material in geological disposal) and artificial groundwater with or without steel coupons to represent canister materials. Se(VI)(aq) bioreduced and was removed by 7 days when lactate was added as an electron donor, after which sulfate reduction occurred. With H2 gas as the electron donor, Se(VI) bioreduction slowed, with complete removal at 14 days and minimal sulfate reduction thereafter. 16S rRNA gene sequencing highlighted the dominance of Anaerobacillus spp. (44% at 28 days) during Se(VI)-reduction, and in the lactate-amended systems, there was a subsequent enrichment in sulfate-reducing bacteria affiliated with Desulfosporosinus spp. (60% relative abundance at 84 days). Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses identified monoclinic Se(0) as the bioreduction product after 28 days, but by 84 days this evolved to trigonal Se(0) in the absence of steel coupons or was further reduced to FeSe2 with steel present. The reduction of Se(VI)(aq) to poorly soluble Se(0)/FeSe2 mediated by indigenous bentonite microbial communities highlights their potential importance in promoting Se-79 retention during deep geological disposal."

However, the overlooking of surface water flow in the land surface models (LSMs) leads to the defect of flood simulation and prediction. In this study, a quasi‐3D LSM, incorporated with the overland flow, has been driven by downscaled numerical weather prediction (NWP) to establish a high‐resolution flood prediction system. Compared to the Sentinel‐1 imagery, the quasi‐3D LSM reasonably depicts the distributions of deluged regions and surface runoff for an unprecedented flood event over North China in July‐August 2023. The surface lateral flow redistributes soil moisture, resulting in wetter valleys and drier ridgelines. In addition, the results show that the downscaled precipitation prediction is skillful at a lead time of 3.5 days, while the reliable flood prediction can be expected with a lead time of up to 6 days, especially in low‐lying regions. Our work highlights that reliable flood prediction can be achieved through integrating the high‐resolution quasi‐3D LSM and the NWP, which is crucial for disaster prevention and reduction."

 Gene expression is dynamically regulated by gene regulatory networks comprising multiple regulatory components to mediate cellular functions1. An ideal tool for analyzing these processes would track multiple-component dynamics with both spatiotemporal resolution and scalability within the same cells, a capability not yet achieved. Here, we present CytoTape, a genetically encoded, modular protein tape recorder for multiplexed and spatiotemporally scalable recording of gene regulation dynamics continuously for up to three weeks, physiologically compatible, with single-cell, minutes-scale resolution. CytoTape employs a flexible, thread-like, elongating intracellular protein self-assembly engineered via computationally assisted rational design, built on earlier XRI technology2. We demonstrated its utility across multiple mammalian cell types, achieving simultaneous recording of five transcription factor activities and gene transcriptional activities. CytoTape reveals that divergent transcriptional trajectories correlate with transcriptional history and signal integration, and that distinct immediate early genes (IEGs) exhibit complex temporal correlations within single cells. We further extended CytoTape into CytoTape-vivo for scalable, spatiotemporally resolved single-cell recording in the living brain, enabling simultaneous weeks-long recording of doxycycline- and IEG promoter-dependent gene expression histories across up to 14,123 neurons spanning multiple brain regions per mouse. Together, the CytoTape toolkit establishes a versatile platform for scalable and multiplexed analysis of cell physiological processes in vitro and in vivo."

Subsequent microseismicity revealed a cryptic fluid phase facilitated magma intrusion, highlighting that cascading processes are potentially essential for eruption initiations. 
 Spatiotemporal correlations between moderate-to-large earthquakes and volcanic eruptions indicate that earthquake-induced stress changes can trigger eruptions. Triggering is rarely instantaneous, with time-dependent processes inferred to mediate magma ascent to the surface, such as fracture propagation or fluid pressurization. While various processes have been proposed, observational constraints on the specific triggering mechanisms remain limited. Here we integrate an earthquake catalogue, generated by machine-learning and template-matching techniques to enhance microseismicity detections, with geodetic data to show that seismic triggering of the 2018 eruption of Sierra Negra Volcano, Galápagos Islands, was facilitated by a cryptic phase of fluid activity. Following 13 years of near-continuous magmatic inflation, totalling > 6.5 m, stress changes induced by a moment magnitude 5.4 intra-caldera earthquake on 26 June 2018 did not immediately trigger magma release from the pressurized magma reservoir. Instead, long-period earthquake swarms revealed post-seismic fluid activity along reservoir-bounding faults in the northwestern caldera, locally promoting edifice failure and facilitating magma intrusion that initiated 8 hours later. These observations demonstrate that even when a pressurized reservoir experiences significant stress perturbation, cascading processes could potentially be essential to initiate volcanic eruptions.

 Carbon sequestration in shale gas operations represents a crucial pathway to achieve Geological Negative Emissions, which is essential for global 1.5 °C targets. However, the emissions reduction potential and economic viability of this approach in China’s shale gas value chain remain unclear. This study quantifies the potential for transforming China’s shale gas value chain from an emission source to a carbon sink, while revealing spatial heterogeneity in economic feasibility. Results demonstrate that synergistic deployment of CO2-based technologies can achieve Geological Negative Emissions across the value chain, with national carbon sink potential reaching 66 billion tonnes of CO2-equivalents and shale gas production increasing by 4,518 billion cubic meters. Multi-scenario economic assessments reveal that marine shale in the Sichuan Basin exhibits inherent profitability, whereas continental reservoirs require carbon credit integration or optimized production. Current Chinese carbon market prices provide insufficient incentives, implementing region-specific subsidies and enhancing carbon pricing frameworks could unlock this potential, thereby contributing to national carbon neutrality goals and multiple Sustainable Development Goals.

Here, authors develop a smart DNA origami nanodevice that can precisely sense and metabolize high levels of extracellular ATP, thereby fine-tuning purinergic signalling and immune homeostasis. 
 Purinergic signaling dysregulation (e.g., excessive extracellular ATP, exATP) plays a critical role in the pathology of inflammatory disorders, but current efforts in drug development for blocking purinergic receptors are unsatisfactory. Here, inspired by natural metabolite sensing/signaling system, we develop a DNA origami-based ATP-sensing nanodevice (ND) for fine-tuning purinergic signaling and immune homeostasis. This ND composes a tubular DNA origami equipped with ATP sensors and the catalytic subunits (ENPP1-CD73 pairs), which can sense high levels of exATP and then expose the catalytic subunits for metabolizing exATP to adenosine, thereby driving an immune switch from exATP-mediated proinflammatory signals to adenosine-mediated immunosuppressive signals. Further surface displaying of ND on the monocytes (ND@Monos) enables its active inflamed site-targeting to restore immunometabolic hemostasis and reduce inflammation in diverse models in vivo. This study highlights that design of metabolite-sensing NDs is a promising strategy for controlling the homeostasis of cell metabolism and the immune response.

 Perovskite-type tantalum-based oxynitride photocatalysts are promising candidates for water splitting due to their suitable band positions and extended light absorption beyond 600 nm. However, their associated photocatalytic activities and quantum yields remain relatively low. Here, we show that a nano-sized single-crystalline BaxSr1-xTaO2N solid-solution perovskite photocatalyst exhibits state-of-the-art activity in separate oxygen and hydrogen evolution half-reactions. The improved performance is attributed to the nanoscale particle sizes, as well as the reduced defect densities achieved by using a mixed precursor comprising TaS2 and Ta3N5. The half-reaction activities can be modulated by applying a post-synthetic high-temperature treatment. Assessments of charge carrier dynamics, in conjunction with a mechanistic kinetic model, reveal that exponential-tail trap states are formed during this post-treatment. Such trap states, present on the photocatalyst surface, facilitate participation of holes during the oxygen evolution reaction. The development of such solid-solution photocatalysts broadens the range of potential materials for solar-driven hydrogen production. In addition, the present findings are expected to enable the selective tuning of bifunctional photocatalysts for either the hydrogen or oxygen evolution reaction.

 Controlling the low energy spectrum at the nanoscale with an external physical parameter has become an important resource for quantum devices. The emergence of an energy gap is one such key feature, linked to the mitigation of decoherence needed for quantum information processing. Indeed, the detrimental effects of high-energy uncontrolled excitations can only be cured at some specific tuning points in general. Achieving an energy gap is a natural way to extend decoherence countermeasures over a finite region of parameter space. This would be particularly useful in view of the recent efforts to build superconducting topological chains in a top-down approach. In this work, we demonstrate a large energy gap by spatially modulating the local potential of a suspended carbon nanotube, exploiting an analogy with condensed matter systems. This gap is homogeneous on the nanotube and tunable by about two orders of magnitude, bringing the electronic system from an insulating state to a near-metallic state at low temperatures. Energy gaps can be induced by spatial modulation of the electronic potential. Here, the authors demonstrate a large and robust energy gap in a free-standing carbon nanotube utilizing a 15-gate keyboard that spatially modulates the local potential."

 Seismic anisotropy in the Earth’s lower mantle, particularly around subduction zones, is commonly attributed to deformation by dislocation creep, yet much of the lower mantle appears nearly isotropic. This contrast complicates interpretations of mantle rheology. Here we report the temperature dependence of lattice preferred orientation in bridgmanite, the most abundant lower mantle mineral, through high-pressure deformation experiments at 25 gigapascals and 1700–2100 kelvin. Both iron-free and iron-bearing bridgmanite develop lattice preferred orientations across this temperature range, with distinct slip systems occurring below and above 1800 kelvin. Low-temperature fabric produces strong seismic anisotropy, whereas high-temperature fabric yields weak, near-isotropic signatures under horizontal shearing. These results provide a unified explanation for strong seismic anisotropy near subduction zones and globally near-isotropic behavior of the lower mantle. They suggest that dislocation creep could dominate lower mantle deformation while generating diverse seismic signatures, providing important understanding for lower mantle rheology and dynamics. Regional and global seismological observations in the uppermost lower mantle are best explained by the temperature-dependent lattice preferred orientation of bridgmanite, indicating that dislocation creep likely dominates deformation in this area, according to high- pressure and temperature analysis."

However, the expansion of AR raises concerns about the adverse impacts on biodiversity. While local studies have assessed these impacts, global-scale evaluations remain limited. Our study addressed the need for a comprehensive approach to mitigate the risks of AR and enhance its potential as a nature-based solution for both CDR and biodiversity conservation. Here, we introduce a novel approach for assessing AR’s strategic potential using a species distribution framework that considers both favorable and unfavorable effects on species in forest landscapes. We propose a biome-specific spatial prioritization framework to delineate where AR may negatively affect biodiversity. By adopting a habitat suitability index as a biodiversity proxy, our approach increased the compatibility between climate mitigation goals (i.e. carbon storage) and biodiversity conservation. We found that in forest biomes, and particularly in the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome and the tropical and subtropical coniferous forests biome, many areas offer high carbon sequestration per unit area alongside high habitat suitability values. However, even within the same biome, the impact of AR on biodiversity can vary among locations. Among the non-forested biomes, the existing species in temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands are particularly vulnerable to AR if carbon sequestration is prioritized over biodiversity. To mitigate these risks, prioritizing ecosystem restoration can support biodiversity and restore degraded lands to produce ecosystems that are tailored to regional ecological contexts. Our approach highlights how and where AR strategies can be deployed to simultaneously achieve climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation."

Nevertheless, flood resilience in the VMD has improved through engineering and adaptive practices initiated by local governments and farmers. However, the understanding of the internal interactions among flood resilience measures remains limited. Cho Moi district, An Giang province, VMD, has experienced flooding but shown resilience since the implementation of the South Vam Nao project, making it a representative case for flood resilience investigation. This study employs qualitative methods and Bayesian network (BN) analysis to examine the interrelationships among flood resilience measures in Cho Moi district to address the research gap. The results indicate that the project has facilitated coordination between the local governments and citizens, enhancing farmers’ capacity to reduce flood impacts. A BN inference test, assuming that all measures perform at 100% ‘High’ efficiency, illustrates that the current system configuration performs strongly overall. ‘High-dike construction’ is also highlighted as the central measure facilitating the transformation of agricultural practices. Yet, without the presence of high dikes, farmers remain the most critical factor in sustaining resilience, regardless of the adequacy of government-led measures. The study recommends redesigning the height of the high-dike system to mitigate landslide risk and address other environmental problems, such as nutrient-rich alluvium loss and soil compaction, while ensuring adequate flood protection. The study introduces an innovative framework for flood resilience assessment, helping governments understand their water management systems and identify necessary improvements to enhance flood resilience."

Significant attention has been given to a dedicated fund to assist vulnerable countries to recover from climate related L&amp;D. While much of the political discussion focuses on the amount of funding needed and who should pay, less attention is given to risk reduction initiatives eligible for the L&amp;D funding mechanisms. There is also an emerging need to link L&amp;D funding with adaptation (funds) which is not yet being given enough consideration. Against this background, the paper presents different dimensions of L&amp;D for example on severity and compensability, and provides a new perspective that goes beyond the current discourse of economic versus non-economic or direct versus indirect L&amp;D. A global analysis is complemented with a set of L&amp;D related case studies to explore both conventional economic dimensions of L&amp;D, and under-represented dimensions, such as population displacement and human mobility, territory and cultural heritage. These cases highlight how different types of L&amp;D are articulated in climate related initiatives. The cases point towards the need to better connect L&amp;D and adaptation strategies and funding to strengthen climate resilience. The paper informs the ongoing international debate on L&amp;D, highlighting the importance of understanding its different dimensions, the effectiveness of climate-related policies across countries and the need to rethink the concept of L&amp;D as compensation, since this falls short of supporting climate resilience.

While most research to date concentrated on climate impacts on crop yields, the climatic determinants of harvested area (ha) which is an equally important component of production, remain insufficiently explored. Employing a machine learning framework on historical maize production and climate datasets, this study evaluates how both mean climate conditions and weather extremes have influenced maize yield and ha across SSA from 1979 to 2021. Our findings indicate that reported yield reductions are predominantly attributable to heat and drought stress, while contractions in ha are primarily associated with episodes of excessive wetness. Notably, our models account for a greater proportion of variance in ha (R2 up to 0.75) than in yield (R2 ≈ 0.43). This suggests that fluctuations in cultivation area are more readily anticipated from climate signals, potentially reflecting farmers’ proactive adjustments to wet conditions, than the more complex physiological responses of yield to heat stress. The rising frequency of area-related shocks, in contrast to relatively stable trends in yield-shock, signals a shifting landscape of production risks. Collectively, these findings elucidate two principal climate-risk pathways: heat and drought diminishing yields, and wetness extremes constraining cultivated area. These insights underscore the urgent need for agronomic innovation, targeted economic incentives, and infrastructural investment to enhance the resilience of maize-based systems in SSA."

Renewable energy such as photovoltaic (PV) and wind power provides opportunities to mitigate sectoral water use, but quantifying their effects on the water-energy-land nexus remains challenging. Using an engineering-economic optimization model, this study quantifies how, and to what extent, energy transition towards PV and wind mitigates water competition between the energy and land sectors in the Yellow River Basin from 2020 to 2050. Results show that under current conditions, energy water use increases by 32.9 × 108 m3 yr−1 (+34.2%) while irrigation water decreases by 23.3 × 108 m3 yr−1 (−12.7%) compared to the baseline. Transitioning to PV and wind energy, alongside electricity transmission, substantially alleviates the competition. Energy water use decreases by 82.1 × 10⁸ m3 yr−1 (−63.7%) across the basin, and irrigation water is replenished by 21.9 × 108 m3 yr−1 (+54.7%) in Inner Mongolia and 1.6 × 108 m3 yr−1 (+35.9%) in Shandong. Though costly, the transmission line from Inner Mongolia and Shandong is prioritized for reducing the local consumption of renewable energy, ensuring downstream energy supply and restoring irrigation water availability. These findings underscore the critical role of transitioning to renewable energy in resolving sectoral water conflicts, and highlight the importance of electricity transmission in balancing spatial disparities in energy and irrigation demands across the basin."

We apply causal machine learning to evaluate the heterogeneous impact of winter wheat-based rotations on SOC at the field-level across Lithuania. Using a nationwide dataset collected over five years (2018–2022), including crop types, management practices, soil properties, and environmental conditions, we estimate how the effects of winter wheat-based rotation vary across space and climate. Our results indicate that winter wheat generally enhances SOC levels, but its effectiveness is modulated by climate. Cooler regions experience higher SOC gains, whereas warmer regions show diminished or even negative effects. Future climate projections suggest that the potential for winter wheat carbon sequestration may decline under high-emission scenarios. These findings highlight the importance of localized agricultural strategies that account for climate variability to maximize SOC sequestration and ensure long-term soil sustainability."

Our results reveal persistent structural imbalances: biology dominates thematically, beaches and coastlines dominate spatially, and diagnostic efforts far outnumber mitigation or adaptation studies. Crucially, the deep ocean—despite comprising the majority of marine volume and likely acting as a long-term reservoir for microplastics—remains severely underrepresented. Studies that include sampling below 1000 m are rare, and most lack specific geographic metadata. While the growth in microplastics literature is robust, its conceptual and spatial coverage remains narrow.

As previous studies have shown, we find that current new BEVs, with some exceptions for smaller or shorter-range vehicles, have a higher TCO than conventional alternatives. However, we also present the first comparative analysis of the TCO of used vehicles, which make up 70% of all vehicle purchases in the U.S. We find that for used vehicles, BEVs have the lowest TCO among all powertrains. As vehicle TCO varies spatially and with use patterns, we test 5 different vehicle classes, 17 different U.S. cities, and 5 different charging strategies. The finding that BEVs have the lowest total cost for used vehicles is robust across these variables and is largely driven by vehicle depreciation patterns. We conduct a regression analysis based on 260 000 publicly available used vehicle listings, collected from January to December of 2024. We find that BEVs depreciate more rapidly than other powertrains in the first several years of vehicle life but follow similar depreciation patterns afterwards. With a 7 year ownership period, buying a used (3 year-old) midsize SUV vs a new midsize SUV has a TCO savings of approximately $3000 for an ICEV, $1000 for an HEV or PHEV, and $13 000 for a BEV. These results highlight an opportunity for savings via BEV adoption among used vehicle purchasers."

This database will help reveal the mechanisms behind critical events like mass extinctions and major ocean changes, enhancing our understanding of Earth's long-term environmental processes. 
 Stable nitrogen isotope records preserved in marine sediments provide critical insights into Earth's climate history and biospheric evolution. Although numerous studies have documented nitrogen isotope (δ15N) records for various geological systems (Archean to Recent) and paleogeographic settings, the scientific community remains constrained by the absence of a standardized database to systematically investigate their spatiotemporal evolution. Here, we present the database of Deep-time Sediment Nitrogen Isotopes in Marine Systems (DSMS-NI), a comprehensive global compilation of δ15N data and associated geochemical parameters, spanning a vast collection of sediment samples dating from the Recent to the Archean. This database encompasses 70 854 δ15N records derived from 417 publications, systematically organized with 31 metadata fields categories (e.g., chronostratigraphic ages, coordinates, lithology, metamorphic grade, sedimentary facies, references) encompassing 1 999 226 metadata. This repository further incorporates 130 proxy data fields, including 281 215 geochemical data spanning total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and organic carbon isotopes (δ13Corg), major and trace elements and iron species. These integrated parameters enable evaluation of sample fidelity and factors influencing δ15N signatures. The DSMS-NI database will facilitate research for key geological intervals such as the Permian/Triassic boundary and the Cretaceous oceanic anoxic events (OAEs). Researchers can leverage temporal and paleogeographic information, alongside geochemical data, to conduct spatiotemporal analyses, thereby uncovering changes in deep-time marine nitrogen cycles and paleoenvironmental conditions. The database is open-access via the Geobiology portal (https://geobiologydata.cug.edu.cn/, last access: 30 April 2025), allowing users to access data and submit new entries to ensure continuous updates and expansion.

We computed exposure indicators to ΔT > 1.5 °C and ΔT > 2.0 °C. Results help highlight which regions may be most in need of adaptation preparedness. 
 We used available FAO statistics as input metrics to compute simple indicators of exposure of agriculture at regional and global levels to temperature change thresholds, ΔT > 1.5 °C and ΔT > 2.0 °C, relative the 1951–1980 climatology. Since 1995 and with respect to ΔT > 1.5 °C, results show that exposure of rural populations increased globally 14 times (from 64 to 920 million people); exposed agricultural land area grew five-fold (from 350 to 2000 million hectare, Mha). The exposed harvested area of soybean increased globally 90 times (0.5 to 45 Mha); rice 78 times (0.5 to 39 Mha); maize 38 times (2 to 76 Mha) and wheat 5 times (22 to 110 Mha). Finally, exposure of livestock grew six-fold for dairy cows and 20-fold for chicken broilers.

Two systems using a TiO2 nanoflower (TiO2-NF)-modified porous anode coupled with graphite-loaded (GT-ECO) or pristine (PT-ECO) titanium mesh cathodes revealed fundamentally different reaction pathways. GT-ECO achieved complete p-CBA removal at 50 mA─4-fold lower than PT-ECO at 200 mA─through synergistic electrode functions: the TiO2-NF anode enabled H2O2-independent O3 activation, generating surface-localized •OH, while the GT cathode maintained elevated potentials for selective O3 electroreduction without H2 evolution. In situ electrochemical confocal fluorescence microscopy provided the first direct visualization of electric field-dependent surface •OH generation at the TiO2-NF anode, confirming potential-regulated interfacial catalysis as the governing mechanism. Reduced current paradoxically enhances O3 mass transfer of the O3 at the porous anode through interfacial renewal, liquid film thinning, and bubble refinement. This anode-focused approach fundamentally departs from conventional cathode-driven H2O2-mediated strategies, enabling remarkable energy efficiency with operational safety and environmental robustness. These results emphasized the synergistic enhancement between surface catalysis and mass transfer and offered a new theoretical perspective on interfacial regulation in low-current ECO processes."

Results showed that J3 ACS catalyzed the formation of CoA adducts with long-chain fluorinated compounds, including 2H-perfluoro-2-octenoic acid (6:2 FTUCA) and 5:3 fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylate (5:3 FTUCA), providing the first experimental evidence of CoA adduct formation for eight-carbon PFAS. Notably, no enzymatic activity was observed toward saturated analogues (5:3 FTCA and 6:2 FTCA) or PFOA, with kinetic analysis suggesting that unsaturation and chain length are critical determinants of enzyme reactivity. While GST exhibited no activity toward the tested fluorinated substrates, GSH adducts were observed with 5:3 FTUCA and 6:2 FTUCA via spontaneous, nonenzymatic thiol conjugation. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that β-oxidation-like pathways, initiated by CoA conjugation, and GSH-dependent conjugation reactions are both involved in the biotransformation of long-chain polyfluorinated carboxylates."

The absorption and adverse effects of pollutants are markedly influenced by sex. However, insights into sex-specific differences in PCB oral bioavailability remain limited. In this study, PCB oral bioavailability was assessed in adult female and male Balb/c mice. At different exposure doses, the oral bioavailability of PCBs in female mice (14.2–22.8%) was significantly higher than that in male mice (12.3–18.8%). Correspondingly, males excreted a greater proportion of PCBs via feces, with fecal excretion percentages of 9.50–10.4% in males compared to 6.98–8.13% in females. Mechanistic analyses revealed that the higher PCB oral bioavailability in females was associated with greater dietary lipid assimilation efficiency and elevated postprandial serum apoB-48 levels, which are key indicators of chylomicron-mediated transport of lipophilic pollutants. Gut microbiota analysis revealed a more pronounced increase in Desulfovibrio abundance in female mice (from 6.57% to 18.18%) than in males (4.95% to 7.89%). This sex-specific change may be related to the impaired intestinal barrier and thereby enhanced PCB absorption in female mice. Liver transcriptomics revealed that PCB exposure primarily altered lipid metabolism-related genes in female mice, while male mice exhibited stronger responses in xenobiotic metabolism and DNA toxicity pathways. This study advances our understanding of the mechanisms driving sex differences in PCB oral bioavailability and hence the adverse effects, offering key insights for crafting targeted strategies to reduce PCB exposure across diverse subpopulations."

The net carbon benefits of GI and the factors shaping them remain poorly understood due to data and methodological gaps. This study draws on 679 engineering cases from 15 demonstration Sponge Cities in China to conduct multiscale life-cycle carbon accounting of GI. Overall, sponge retrofitting shifted conventional urban surfaces from a net source to a sink. At the infrastructure scale, carbon benefits varied widely across different types of GI, mainly due to differences in construction materials and operational efficiency. At the project scale, all project types achieved net carbon benefits, with variations primarily driven by infrastructure configuration. Regionally, carbon payback periods ranged from 7.5 to 28.6 years, depending on rainfall volume control rates and infrastructure composition, with wetter regions achieving higher net benefits. To maximize cost-effective runoff, pollution, and carbon reduction, NSGA-II favored green roofs and sunken green spaces without considering landscape functions. Ensuring stable carbon benefits under climate change and overdesign storms requires future GI to adopt sustainable and resilient pathways. By integrating life cycle assessment with multiobjective optimization, this study establishes a novel framework for decoupling carbon emissions from infrastructure growth, offering actionable pathways for global carbon-neutral urban design."

At 10 and 100 μM, PFOS enhanced adipogenesis, promoting intracellular oil droplet accumulation and upregulating key markers, including PPARγ, perilipin, fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), CD36, fatty acid synthase (FASN), and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4). It also increased adipokines (adiponectin and resistin). Compared to troglitazone (TGZ), a PPARγ agonist, PFOS induced milder differentiation effects. Cotreatment with PFOS and TGZ diminished TGZ’s pro-adipogenic potency, indicating potential interference. PFOS further influenced N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modifications by altering the expression of m6A writers (METTL3 and VIR) and eraser (FTO), suggesting post-transcriptional regulation of adipogenic genes. Functional evaluations showed that PFOS preserved forskolin-stimulated lipolysis without impairing it. However, it upregulated metabolic markers, including carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1a (CPT1a), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK), and fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21), alongside elevated ATP levels in the 100 μM PFOS-treated group. These molecular changes suggest enhanced energy expenditure or energy stress, despite the cells’ morphological resemblance to white adipocytes. This duality likely arises from PFOS’s modulation of PPARγ signaling and m6A RNA modifications. By elucidating these mechanisms, the study highlights potential metabolic risks associated with PFOS exposure."

However, research on the specific mechanism remains extremely limited. In this study, a multi-methodological framework integrating network toxicology, machine learning, and molecular docking was adopted to explore the potential toxicity and molecular mechanisms of PFAS-induced NAFLD. Key molecular targets were identified by integrating transcriptomic data with toxicological databases such as CTD, ToxCast, and GeneCards. An adverse outcome pathway (AOP) was constructed using integrated PFAS–gene–phenotype evidence, and the interaction network was visualized via Cytoscape. The AOP was further validated through in vitro experiments, QWoE assessment, and clinical sample analysis. We determined that the downregulation of THBS1 serves as the molecular initiating event (MIE) in PFAS-induced NAFLD. This downregulation leads to the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which subsequently triggers lipid metabolic dysregulation and inflammatory responses, ultimately resulting in hepatic steatosis. HFPO-TA causes more pronounced lipid accumulation than PFOA or HFPO-DA at the same concentration, suggesting a higher adipogenic potential. It is particularly worth noting that alternative PFASs may have greater metabolic toxicity than traditional compounds like PFOA. This study clarifies the mechanistic foundation of the AOP of PFAS-induced NAFLD, thus providing support for risk assessment and the identification of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets."

Cord blood samples are frequently employed in epidemiological studies to evaluate the links between contaminant exposure and birth outcomes. However, a significant knowledge gap persists regarding the presence of QACs in cord blood and their potential associations with birth outcomes. In this study, QACs were analyzed in 235 cord blood samples collected in a hospital in Jinan, Shandong Province, from February 2017 to January 2022. QACs were detected in the investigated cord blood samples, with total concentrations reaching up to 47.3 ng/mL. Benzylalkyldimethyl ammonium compounds (BACs) accounted for the largest proportion, with BAC-C12 and BAC-C14 being the most abundant QACs. The multiple linear regression (MLR) and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) models were developed to explore the relationships between QACs exposure and newborn birth outcomes. Results showed that BAC-C10, BAC-C16, and octyl decyldimethyl ammonium-8:10 were positively associated with birth weight and ponderal index (p for trend < 0.05), suggesting an obesogenic hypothesis. Furthermore, these three QAC structures can activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ, the core adipogenesis receptor). The margin of exposure results indicated that the obesogenic risks of QACs were limited under current exposure distributions, but ongoing attention is warranted due to uncertainties and sensitive life stages."

However, the detection of these particles in human tissues, fluids, cell systems, and relevant models remains a major analytical challenge. There is an urgent need for robust, selective, sensitive, and high-throughput methods capable of generating reliable quantitative data. Equally essential is the transparent reporting of methodological limitations and uncertainties, supported by rigorous data collection and standardized practices. These challenges are compounded by the ubiquity of plastic particles, and therefore the risk of sample contamination and their diverse properties (e.g., size, shape, composition), all adding to the complexity of identifying and quantifying them in biological matrices. To address these issues, we propose a framework that integrates orthogonal analytical techniques to enhance the data reliability. Commonly used analytical techniques for the analysis of micro- and nanoplastics are assigned a category based on their specificity when identifying plastic particles. The framework proposes minimum data requirements from orthogonal techniques for the identification of plastic particles at various confidence levels. Clear communication of analytical confidence is vital, and we present a structured approach to support this. We emphasize the importance of scientific integrity, rigorous study design, and transparent reporting in health research. Finally, we call for the universal adoption of harmonized confidence criteria for reporting the presence of plastics in humans, an essential step toward informed decision-making."

Here, the authors demonstrate ultrafast and reversible dynamic Stark modulation of a semiconductor exciton-polariton quantum condensate. 
 Time-dependent spatial modulation of a quantum condensate plays a key role in the investigation of the dynamics of collective coherent systems. Cold-atom condensates were already manipulated into forming solitons, vortices and optical lattices via the dynamic Stark effect. In the solid-state framework, semiconductor microcavity exciton-polaritons present an excellent platform for observing nonequilibrium condensate dynamics. Furthermore, the dynamic manipulation of exciton-polariton condensates offers numerous potential implementations in all-optical logic devices. We report the first observation of the energy modulation of an exciton-polariton condensate via the dynamic Stark effect. A Stark pulse is employed to induce a transient, coherence-preserving blueshift in the energy of the condensate of femtosecond-scale duration. A novel approach is presented for discerning the Stark effect in a condensate from the uncondensed case according to distinctive features in differential reflectance spectra, including spectro-temporal oscillations enabling to detect the buildup of coherence. The ultrafast and non-invasive modulation of the exciton-polariton condensate demonstrated here opens new research avenues of nonequilibrium physics of solid-state condensates as well as opportunities for polariton-based elements in both classical and quantum information technologies.

 The Drosophila proventriculus is a bulb-shaped structure at the juncture of the foregut and the midgut, which plays important roles in ingestion, peritrophic membrane synthesis, and the immune response to oral pathogens. A previous study identified a population of cells in the proventriculus which incorporate bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a marker of DNA synthesis, and proposed that these cycling cells are multipotent stem cells that replace dying cells elsewhere in the tissue. Here, we re-investigate these cycling cells and find that they do not undergo mitosis, do not generate clonal lineages, and do not proliferate in response to tissue damage, and are therefore not stem cells. Instead, we find that these cells continually endocycle throughout the fly’s life, increasing their ploidy and size, while at the same time cells in this tissue are lost into the gut lumen as the fly ages. Functionally, these cells play a critical role in the synthesis of peritrophic membrane components, and we show that when their endocycling is experimentally increased or decreased, there is a concomitant change in ploidy, tissue size, and peritrophic membrane synthesis. Further, we show that inhibition of endocycling makes flies more susceptible to orally infectious bacteria. Altogether, we show that continual endocycling of these cells is critical for maintaining tissue size and function in the face of cell loss due to aging or tissue damage. This study demonstrates that the Drosophila proventriculus, the structure at the anterior of gut that synthesizes the peritrophic membrane, lacks stem cells but undergoes continual endocycling to compensate for cells loss during aging or damage."

Here, the authors report the cryo-EM structure of the mammalian SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD core complex, revealing a dimeric architecture and explaining how disease-linked mutations disrupt protein quality control. 
 The SEL1L-HRD1 complex represents the most conserved branch of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD), a critical quality-control pathway that clears misfolded ER proteins. However, the molecular organization and pathogenic mechanisms of mammalian ERAD have remained elusive. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of the core mammalian ERAD complex, comprising the ER lectin OS9, SEL1L, and the E3 ubiquitin ligase HRD1. The structure, validated by mutagenesis and crosslinking assays, reveals a dimeric assembly of the core complex in which SEL1L and OS9 form a claw-like configuration in the ER lumen that mediates substrate engagement, while HRD1 dimerizes within the membrane that may facilitate substrate translocation. Furthermore, pathogenic SEL1L mutations at the SEL1L-OS9 (Gly585Asp) and SEL1L-HRD1 (Ser658Pro) interfaces disrupt complex formation and impair ERAD activity. A newly identified disease-associated HRD1 variant (Ala91Asp), located in transmembrane helix 3, impairs HRD1 dimerization and substrate processing. These findings provide structural and functional insights for mammalian SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD and elucidate how mutations destabilizing this machinery contribute to human disease.

Here, the authors investigate the origin of the kink and identify the charge transport phenomena that is impacted. 
 Figures of merit are used to translate science to technology. For organic mixed ionic–electronic conductors (OMIECs), the product of mobility and volumetric capacitance, i.e., the µC* product, is the figure of merit used to guide the development of technologies ranging from bioelectronics to neuromorphics. While organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are used extensively to measure the µC* product, if there is a kink in the transistor current, then the µC* product is overestimated. Here, we show that the origin of the kink is a change in the rate with which the ions diffuse into the channel. We also discover that the OECT channel geometry has an unprecedented role on how the ions are distributed within the OMIEC. Finally, we observe that electronic charge carriers are first be injected and drift in the OMIEC, before ions can drift from the electrolyte into the OMIEC. Overall, the diverse charge transport phenomena identified here are essential for understanding the complexities of integrating novel OMIECs into traditional device structures, providing the key information needed to realize their promising application potential.

Here we construct both classical and quantum optical skyrmions and transmit them through experimentally simulated atmospheric turbulence, revealing the embedded topological resilience of their structure. For nonlocal quantum skyrmions, we show that although photon entanglement rapidly degrades, the topological characteristics of the states remain stable. Similarly, while the vectorial structure of local classical skyrmions is strongly distorted by the medium, their topology is preserved across a wide range of turbulence strengths. Our experimental results are supported by rigorous analytical and numerical modelling, validating that the quantum-classical equivalence of the topological behaviour is due to the non-separability of the states and the one-sided nature of the channel. This equivalence enables robust information transport in noisy environments, opening pathways for resilient terrestrial and satellite-to-ground communication. Optical skyrmions can be generated in free space, but topologically protected information transfer requires skyrmions to be stable upon propagation through complex media. Here, authors demonstrate the topological resilience of classical and quantum optical skyrmions transmitted through experimentally simulated atmospheric turbulence."

 Elemental sulfur (S8), an abundant petroleum byproduct, is leveraged as a linchpin monomer in an organobase-catalyzed step-growth addition polymerization with dithiols and diacrylates at ambient temperature. This method enables the scalable synthesis of poly(ester disulfide)s—featuring alternating ester and disulfide linkages—with exceptional atom economy ( > 95% yield), Mn up to 42.0 kDa, and dual functionality: biodegradable ester units and stimuli-responsive disulfides. Mechanistic studies reveal a chemoselective three-component coupling involving S8 ring-opening, disulfide anion formation, and Michael addition, quantitatively generating symmetric and asymmetric disulfides in near-equimolar ratios. Thermal and mechanical characterizations of the poly(ester disulfide)s reveal programmable properties: High thermal stability (Td,5% = 248–281 °C), tunable phase behavior (amorphous Tg = −64 °C to semicrystalline Tm = 142 °C), and reductive degradation. By overcoming traditional limitations of harsh conditions and monomer scope, this strategy establishes S8 as a versatile feedstock for functional polymers, opening avenues for dynamic materials in biomedicine and environmental remediation. The synthesis of high molecular weight poly(disulfide)s typically requires harsh conditions or the complex cyclic disulfide monomers.

The authors assess how land-use change and restoration activities impact zoonotic disease transmission, providing an online tool useful for One Health-oriented restoration planning. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has spotlighted the growing threat of zoonotic diseases, often exacerbated by land-use changes such as deforestation and habitat fragmentation. We conducted a systematic literature review (2000–2024) to assess how different types of land-use change affect zoonotic disease transmission, summarizing key findings and trends in geographic focus on the vectors/hosts/reservoirs and pathogens studied, in addition to identifying research gaps. We also evaluated the potential of restoration interventions to mitigate disease risks. Our analysis shows that land-use changes such as deforestation and urbanization often increase transmission risks, particularly for diseases transmitted by mosquitos and rodents, while some restoration strategies (for example, reforestation and wetland conservation) can reduce these risks. However, effects vary by disease group and region. The literature remains geographically biased, with most studies concentrated in wealthier regions despite higher disease burdens in low-income areas. We propose 50 high-priority locations, primarily in Western Africa and Southeast Asia, for future research. Our findings are available through an open-access online atlas, which includes supporting case studies and policy briefs to inform One Health-oriented restoration planning.

 Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a major One Health issue, driven by a myriad of potential accelerators that include emerging climate and social challenges. There is little doubt about the need for interventions at critical control points to reduce AMR, but addressing AMR within a single realm of One Health (for example, human, animal or environmental) is not sufficient to reduce it.

Authors here estimate global livestock antimicrobial footprints through global supply chains to better understand and manage antimicrobial use. 
 The excessive use of antimicrobials has led to increasing levels of antimicrobial resistance that can spread between livestock, humans and the environment, with important One Health implications. Antimicrobial use in the livestock sector represents 73% of global antimicrobial consumption, yet how such antimicrobial use is embedded within international trade and global production networks remains unclear. Here we quantify global antimicrobial footprints and trace them through global supply chains from 2010 to 2020. Global livestock antimicrobial footprints peaked at 118.6 kilotons (kt) in 2013, then fell to 84.0 kt by 2020. China and the USA contributed nearly 60% of the global antimicrobial footprint. Most use remained in domestically produced goods, yet the trade-embodied share rose from 16% to 20%, signalling growing cross-border spillovers. Developed economies showed higher per capita use via trade, whereas developing economies’ use was concentrated in local production. Brazil surpassed China as the largest exporter of antimicrobials used in livestock production by 2020. Intriguingly, non-food products, particularly the clothing, services and manufacturing sectors, account for half of the trade-embodied antimicrobial footprint. Thus, global spillover of the effects of antimicrobial use extends well beyond the food system thus requiring policymakers to broaden their focus to better address antimicrobial resistance threats. Excessive antimicrobial use can increase the threat of antimicrobial resistance; however, how such use is embedded in global trade is still unclear. Authors here estimate global livestock antimicrobial footprints through global supply chains to better understand and manage antimicrobial use."

We identify important research gaps and discuss untapped opportunities for using a wider spectrum of variables to achieve improved modelling of zoonotic disease risk and, consequently, surveillance.

Here the authors develop a CRISPR biomonitoring tool that can help detect key marine species that are important to public health, the aquaculture sector and marine ecosystems. 
 Ocean ecosystems are undergoing accelerating disruption from human impacts such as climate change. Warming ocean temperatures drive pathogenic outbreaks, increase harmful algal blooms and cause coral stress. These can have serious consequences for marine ecosystems, human health and the aquaculture industry, representing a critical One Health issue. Monitoring key marine species offers valuable insights, but current methods are resource-intensive, low-resolution and unsuitable for frequent deployment. Here we introduce a low-cost, field-deployable CRISPR biosensing platform for detecting marine organismal DNA and RNA. Harnessing the programmability of CRISPR diagnostics for environmental biosurveillance, we demonstrate versatility across three climate-linked indicators: Vibrio spp., Pseudo-nitzschia spp. and heat-stressed corals. Portable 3D-printed processor and incubator devices enable direct processing of filter-captured samples with temperature control. Field readiness is reinforced by lyophilized reagents, lateral flow readouts, dropper-based handling and a two-step multiplexed workflow, delivering results within 1 hour without laboratory instruments. Benchmarking with authentic pathogens and environmental seawater confirmed seawater tolerance and robust detection of 108 colony-forming units per filter of Vibrio pathogens, equivalent to 102 copies per microlitre for 1 litre of filtered sample. This decentralized platform reduces barriers to routine monitoring and can provide early warnings of ecosystem disturbances, while supporting One Health initiatives in the marine space. Human impacts on marine ecosystems are increasing the likelihood of pathogenic outbreaks, harmful algal blooms and coral stress.

 The Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) acts as Earth’s largest tropical heat reservoir; however, the mechanisms that drive orbital-scale sea surface salinity (SSS) variability remain unresolved, as traditional δ¹⁸O-based proxies conflate regional salinity with global ice-volume effects. Here, we present a 450 kyr SSS record from the WPWP using hydrogen isotope composition of alkenones (δDAlk)—a proxy isolating evaporation-precipitation balance—paired with isotope-enabled climate modeling. Our results reveal dominant precessional SSS variability, with maxima during boreal precession minima (Pmin) when intensified meridional insolation gradients strengthen Walker Circulation, enhance evaporation, and sustain La Niña-like conditions. The δDAlk record demonstrates that precession-driven ocean-atmosphere feedbacks govern 78% of SSS variability, and reconcile discrepancies in previous δ¹⁸O-based studies showing the significant influence of obliquity. Integration with climate simulations shows that precession-induced trade winds amplify saline water advection and evaporation, establishing a “salinification triad” that dominates WPWP hydroclimate. These findings redefine the WPWP as a precession-paced engine of tropical hydrology, suggesting that the low-latitude tropical hydrology is highly sensitive to insolation intensity and then regulates ENSO-monsoon interactions. By isolating orbital controls on salinity extremes, this work advances frameworks for projecting hydrological responses to anthropogenic warming, critical for regions reliant on monsoon rainfall, emphasizing the vulnerability of tropical hydrological extremes to orbital forcing."

 The outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 in U.S. dairy cattle poses substantial risks to public health, economic sustainability of farming, and global food systems. Using a Computable General Equilibrium model, we simulate its short- to medium-term impacts on Gross Domestic Product and other macro-economic outcomes for the US and its main trading partners. We simulate impacts under the current situation and realistic and reasonable worst-case scenarios. We estimate domestic economic losses ranging between 0.06% and 0.9% of US GDP, with losses to the dairy sector ranging between 3.4% and 20.6%. Trading partners increase dairy production to compensate for the loss. Current government subsidies are about 1.2% (95% HDI: 1% to 1.4%) of output losses, and likely insufficient to incentivise farmers to step up surveillance and biosecurity for mitigating the possible emergence of H5N1 strains with pandemic potential into human populations.

 While microplastic impacts on aquatic and agricultural systems are well-documented, their impacts on forest ecosystems remain poorly understood. We assessed how microplastic addition affects rhizosphere soil properties and fine-root traits for ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) associations in a mixed temperate forest. In ECM-associated soils, microplastics increased nitrogen availability and nitrate reductase activity but decreased phosphorus and phosphatase activity; AM-associated soils showed the opposite pattern. Morphologically, ECM roots exhibited reduced branching but increased hyphal density and colonization. Conversely, AM roots displayed increased specific root length and tip density but decreased cortical thickness and tissue density. These divergent, mycorrhizal-specific responses suggest that increasing microplastic pollution may fundamentally alter nutrient cycling and species composition dynamics in temperate forests. After microplastic addition, rhizosphere nitrogen increased but phosphorus decreased in ectomycorrhizal trees, while arbuscular mycorrhizal trees showed an opposite trend of lower nitrogen and higher phosphorus in rhizosphere soil, based on a field study in Changbai Mountain Nature Reserve, China."

 Climate change increases risks to the operations and financial reliability of drinking water utilities across the United States (US). Here we develop a comparative climate risk index that includes hazard, vulnerability, and exposure components for 1455 medium and large municipal US drinking water utilities. We find that 67 million customers are serviced by utilities with higher climate risk. Drinking water utilities in the Western US have higher risk due to expected large changes in climate hazards, while utilities in the Northeast and Midwest have higher risk due to existing vulnerabilities and exposure. We use this climate risk index, along with an analysis of municipal bond official statements, to identify utilities in need of climate adaptation and resilience planning. Of the analyzed bonds, 36% were issued by high risk utilities and didn’t mention climate change. This work offers recommendations for multiple decision-makers, including utility customers, bond purchasers, and government agencies. 67 million customers across the US rely on drinking water utilities that face higher climate risk than accounted for, which exposes major gaps in climate adaptation and resilience planning, suggests an assessment of vulnerability, exposure, and hazards across 1,455 municipal utilities."
