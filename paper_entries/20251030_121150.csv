10.5194/acp-25-14071-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注利用CALIPSO卫星上的IIR传感器和激光雷达数据，反演卷云的冰水含量、冰粒子数浓度和有效直径等属性。该方法通过利用两个IIR通道的信息，发展了一种新的全球反演方案，并使用来自多个外场实验的观测数据进行验证。研究结果表明，该反演方案与实际观测结果吻合较好，并可用于研究卷云的演变过程及其对气候的影响。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是卫星观测和大气成分分析（卷云）方面。,"['satellite observations', 'CALIPSO', 'IIR', 'cirrus cloud properties', 'ice water content', 'ice particle number concentration', 'effective size', 'cloud radiative properties', 'atmospheric composition (cirrus clouds)']",David L. Mitchell;Anne Garnier;Sarah Woods,Advances in CALIPSO (IIR) cirrus cloud property retrievals – Part 1: Methods and testing,"Motivated by the need to better understand the physics of cirrus clouds, a satellite retrieval for cirrus cloud ice water content, ice particle number concentration and effective size was developed by exploiting relationships between cirrus cloud measurements made during field campaigns and cloud radiative properties measured by satellite. These retrievals tested favorably when compared against corresponding aircraft measurements and were found to depend on the visual opacity of the cloud. 
 In this study, we describe an improved Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite retrieval which uses the CALIPSO Imaging Infrared Radiometer (IIR) and the CALIPSO lidar for retrievals of ice particle number concentration Ni, effective diameter De and ice water content (IWC). By exploiting two IIR channels, this approach is fundamentally different from another satellite retrieval based on cloud radar and lidar that retrieves all three properties. A global retrieval scheme was developed using in situ observations from several field campaigns. The Ni retrieval is formulated in terms of Ni/APSD ratios, where APSD is the directly measured area concentration of the ice particle size distribution (PSD), along with the absorption optical depth in two IIR channels and the equivalent cloud thickness seen by IIR. It is sensitive to the shape of the PSD, which is accounted for, and uses a more accurate mass-dimension relationship relative to earlier work. The new retrieval is tested against corresponding cloud properties from the field campaigns used to develop this retrieval, as well as a recent cirrus cloud property climatology based on numerous field campaigns from around the world. In all cases, favorable agreement was found. This analysis indicated that Ni varies as a function of τ. By providing near closure to the ice PSD, the natural atmosphere may be used more like a laboratory for studying key processes responsible for the evolution and life cycle of cirrus clouds and their impact on climate."
10.5194/acp-25-14099-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要探讨了卷云中均质和非均质冰核化过程对云物理和辐射特性的影响。它利用CALIPSO卫星上的IIR和CALIOP仪器获取的数据，反演卷云的冰粒子数浓度、有效直径、冰水含量等参数，并分析了不同冰核化方式对卷云辐射效应的贡献。研究结果表明，在热带以外的冬季，受均质冰核化影响的卷云可能占总体卷云辐射效应的一半以上。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是卫星观测和大气成分分析方面。,"['cirrus clouds', 'ice nucleation', 'satellite observations', 'CALIPSO', 'IIR', 'CALIOP', 'cloud radiative effect', 'optical depth', 'ice water content']",David L. Mitchell;Anne Garnier,Advances in CALIPSO (IIR) cirrus cloud property retrievals – Part 2: Global estimates of the fraction of cirrus clouds affected by homogeneous ice nucleation,"Arguably the greatest knowledge gap in cirrus cloud research is the relative roles of homogeneous and heterogeneous ice nucleation in cirrus cloud formation. Since this depends on temperature, latitude, season and topography, a satellite remote sensing method was developed to measure cirrus cloud properties. It was found that cirrus clouds strongly affected by homogeneous ice nucleation may account for over half of the overall cirrus cloud radiative effect during winter outside the tropics. 
 Cirrus clouds can form through two ice nucleation pathways (homo- and heterogeneous ice nucleation; henceforth hom and het, respectively) that result in very different cloud physical and radiative properties. While important to the climate system, they are poorly understood due to lack of knowledge on the relative roles of hom and het. This study differs from earlier relevant studies by estimating the relative radiative contribution of hom-affected cirrus clouds. Here, we employ new global retrievals (described in Part 1: Mitchell et al., 2025; henceforth M2025) of cirrus cloud ice particle number concentration, effective diameter (De), ice water content (IWC), shortwave extinction coefficient (αext), optical depth (τ) and cloud radiative temperature based on Imaging Infrared Radiometer (IIR) and Cloud and Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) co-located observations onboard Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO). Transition from het dominated to hom-affected regimes are identified using αext and De. Over oceans outside the tropics in winter, the zonal fraction of hom-affected cirrus generally ranges between 20 % and 35 %, with comparable contributions from in situ and warm base cirrus. Using τ distributions to establish a proxy for net cloud radiative effect (CRE), the τ-weighted fraction for hom-affected cirrus over oceans outside the tropics during winter was > 50 %, indicating that hom cirrus play an important role in climate. Using these retrievals (including those relating to the cloud geometric thickness), a conceptual model of cirrus cloud characterization is proposed."

We found that values of an important radar variable (KDP) can be related to many different snow particle properties and number concentrations. We were able to constrain which particle sizes contribute to KDP by using computer models of snowflakes and showed which microphysical processes during snow formation can influence KDP. 
 Polarimetric radars provide variables like the specific differential phase (KDP) to detect fingerprints of dendritic growth in the dendritic growth layer (DGL) and secondary ice production, both critical for precipitation formation. A key challenge in interpreting radar observations is the lack of in situ validation of particle properties within the radar measurement volume. While high KDP in snow is usually associated with high particle number concentrations, only few studies attributed KDP to certain hydrometeor types and sizes. To address this, we combined surface in situ observations from the Video In Situ Snowfall Sensor (VISSS) with remote sensing data from a polarimetric W-band radar and an X-band radar, along with modeling approaches. Data were collected during the CORSIPP project, part of the ARM SAIL campaign (winter 2022/2023, Colorado Rocky Mountains). We found that at W-band, KDP > 2 ° km−1 can result from a broad range of particle number concentrations, between 1 and 100 L−1. Blowing snow and increased ice collisional fragmentation in a turbulent layer enhanced observed KDP values. T-matrix simulations indicated that high KDP values were primarily produced by particles smaller than 0.8 mm in the DGL and 1.5 mm near the surface. Discrete dipole approximation simulations based on VISSS data suggested that dendritic aggregates larger than 2.5 mm contributed 10 %–20 % to the measured W-band KDP near the surface. These findings highlight the complexity of interpreting W-band KDP in snowfall and emphasize the need for combined in situ observations and radar forward simulations to better understand snowfall microphysical processes."

Applied in Warsaw, it shows fires from North America contribute over sixty-five percent, surpassing Europe's share, highlighting the importance of intercontinental transport, which may be generalized across Europe. This is an important step in understanding how smoke particles from distant fires impact climate and atmosphere locally. 
 Biomass burning (BB) aerosol significantly affects climate by altering the radiation budget and atmospheric chemistry. Accurate source estimation is vital for climate modeling, yet global observations remain scarce. This study introduces a novel framework for assessing the contribution of transported BB aerosol to smoke-associated aerosol optical depth (BB AOD) at selected locations. The approach integrates satellite fire data (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Active Fire Product) with air parcel trajectory models (HYSPLIT), aerosol transport models (NAAPS), BB emissions (FLAMBE), and plume rise (CAMS GFAS).Tested in Warsaw (Poland, Central Europe) over 2006–2022, the methodology reveals a prominent influence of long-range BB aerosol transport from North America. Analysis indicates that USA (without Alaska) (37.3 %±3.4 %), Canada (25.4 %±6.7 %) and the Alaska (2.6 %±2.1 %) together contribute approximately 65 % of BB AOD during the BB season in the Northern Hemisphere, surpassing nearer European sources. Among European regions, Eastern Europe accounts for 16.6 %±5.3 % of BB AOD, followed by the Iberian Peninsula (10.6 %±1.5 %) and Southern Europe (7.5 %±2.1 %). Incorporating vertical plume dynamics is crucial: a planetary boundary layer plume-top threshold underestimates Canadian contribution while overestimating European sources, whereas removing altitude constraints overestimates Canadian influence. These findings underscore the importance of transatlantic transport, plume-rise processes, and vertical aerosol distribution in regional climatology.The presented framework for assessing BB AOD contributions is universal and can be applied at any location. Future work should incorporate the specific aerosol types emitted during BB events and their aging processes."

The balance between solar and terrestrial radiation is delicate to calculate, and factors such as cloud optical depth, shape, and Sun position are crucial to estimate the effect of those clouds on radiation. Also, often neglected three-dimensional paths of radiation, or 3D effects, may be important to account for at the climatic scale. 
 The radiative effect of cirrus, contrails, and contrail cirrus affects the energy budget of the Earth and climate change. Those clouds, and especially contrails, are heterogeneous and their holes and sides exert three-dimensional radiative effects. This study uses the htrdr Monte Carlo radiative transfer code to investigate the sensitivity of the cloud radiative effect (CRE) to the geometrical dimensions and optical depth of optically thin ice clouds (cloud optical depth <4), with particular emphasis on three-dimensional radiative effects. When the Sun is at zenith, an increase in cloud optical depth causes a linear increase in shortwave (SW) CRE but a saturation of longwave (LW) CRE, causing the net CRE to change sign from positive to negative. The optical depth at which this change in sign occurs depends on the cloud geometry. 3D effects make the one-dimensional SW and LW CREs more positive for the  Sun at zenith, reaching the same order of magnitude as the 1D CRE itself for clouds with high aspect ratios. The angular dependence of ice crystal scattering strongly increases shortwave CRE when solar zenith angle increases. 3D effects change sign from positive at zenith to negative at large zenith angles as the Sun's rays interact more with the cloud sides. Integrating instantaneous CRE and 3D effects over selected days of the year indicates compensation of SW with LW 3D effects for some cloud orientations, but 3D effects remain important in some cases. These results suggest that the 3D structure of cirrus and contrails needs to be considered to finely quantify their CRE and radiative forcing."

Williamson;Karl D. Froyd;Jonathan Dean-Day;Ari Laaksonen,Prior heterogeneous ice nucleation events shape homogeneous freezing during the evolution of synoptic cirrus,"This study uses Large Eddy Simulations (LES) to investigate synoptic cirrus clouds from NASA’s Mid-latitude Airborne Cirrus Properties Experiment (MACPEX) campaign. Results show that prior heterogeneous ice nucleation depletes ice nuclei, creating conditions for subsequent homogeneous freezing. The findings highlight limitations of ice residual analysis in capturing cirrus evolution and provide insights into aerosol-cloud interactions critical to atmospheric and climate processes. 
 In situ observations are currently used to classify synoptic cirrus as formed by homogeneous or heterogeneous ice nucleation based on ice residual analysis. We use UCLALES-SALSA to show the limitations of this method by demonstrating that prior heterogeneous freezing events can shape the thermodynamic conditions for homogeneous freezing to occur more likely in subsequent nucleation events.In a single-cloud case study of synoptic cirrus from NASA’s Midlatitude Airborne Cirrus Properties Experiment (MACPEX), observations suggest homogeneous freezing as the dominant nucleation mechanism, despite the other mission days with synoptic cirrus showing generally heterogeneous freezing characteristics. Model simulations reveal that ice residual analysis cannot capture influence of earlier heterogeneous freezing events, where mineral dust acted as ice-nucleating particles (INPs). These earlier events depleted INPs at cloud-forming altitudes, enabling homogeneous freezing at the time of observations. Cirrus cloud properties were simulated using measured meteorological and aerosol conditions and compared with observed cloud structures. Results show that modeling the impact of prior nucleation events on the vertical distribution of mineral dust and humidity in the model is necessary to reproduce the observed cloud characteristics. Heterogeneous freezing played a role in the removal of active mineral dust from cloud-forming altitudes well before arriving at the measurement location, while having limited role in forming ice crystals shortly before the time of measurements.Simulations also show that small-scale wave activity significantly influenced ice nucleation efficiency and cloud properties. Although large-scale atmospheric dynamics typically dominate synoptic cirrus formation, they alone were insufficient to replicate the observed cloud characteristics."

Kahn,"Siberian wildfire smoke observations from space-based multi-angle imaging: a multi-year regional analysis of smoke particle properties, their evolution, and comparisons with North American boreal fire plumes","With observations from NASA's Multi-Angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) satellite instrument, we can constrain wildfire plume heights, smoke age, and particle size, shape, and light-absorption properties. We study over 3600 wildfire plumes across Siberia by statistically comparing the MISR results to observations of fire strength, land cover type, and meteorology. We then stratify plumes by land cover type and infer the dominant aerosol aging mechanisms among different plume types. 
 The physical and chemical properties of biomass burning (BB) smoke particles vary with fuel type and burning conditions, greatly affecting their impact on climate and air quality. However, the factors affecting smoke particle properties are not well characterized on a global scale, and the factors controlling their evolution during transport are not well constrained. From observations of the Multi-Angle Imaging Spectrometer (MISR) instrument aboard NASA's Terra satellite, smoke aerosol optical depth (AOD) can be retrieved, along with constraints on near-source plume vertical extent, smoke age, and particle size, shape, light-absorption, and absorption spectral dependence. Previous work demonstrated the robust, statistical characterization of BB particles across Canada and Alaska using MISR and other remote sensing data. Here we expand upon this work, studying over 3600 wildfire plumes across Siberia. We leverage the MISR Research Aerosol (RA) algorithm to retrieve smoke particle properties and the MISR Interactive Explorer (MINX) tool to retrieve plume heights and the associated wind vectors. These results are compared statistically to available observations of fire radiative power (FRP), land cover characteristics, and meteorological information. Correlations appear between the retrieved smoke particle properties, smoke age, local ambient conditions, and fuel type, allowing us in many cases to infer the dominant aging mechanisms and the timescales over which they occur. Specifically, we find that plumes located in areas with higher peat content are subject to less oxidation and condensation/hydration compared with other plume types (e.g., forest and grassland), and are predominantly affected by dilution instead."

By correcting for humidity, which causes aerosols to grow and intensify the lidar signal, the method provides more accurate aerosol vertical profiles. Our results show that aerosol profiles can vary significantly over short distances. This technique can help improve understanding of aerosol-cloud interactions. 
 Accurately characterizing the vertical distribution of aerosols and their cloud-forming properties is crucial for understanding aerosol-cloud interactions and their impact on climate. This study presents a novel technique for retrieving vertical profiles of aerosols, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), and ice nucleating particles (INP) by combining micropulse lidar, radiosonde, and ground-based aerosol measurements. Herein, the technique is applied to data collected by our team at Texas A&M University during the Tracking Aerosol Convection Interactions ExpeRiment (TRACER) campaign. Ground-based aerosol size distribution and CCN counter data are used to estimate the value of the aerosol hygroscopicity parameter, κ. The derived κ, together with Mie scattering theory and the relative humidity profile from the radiosonde, is used to estimate aerosol size growth and the associated increase in backscatter at each altitude. We then correct the lidar backscatter to dry conditions to produce the dry aerosol backscatter coefficient profile. The dry aerosol backscatter coefficient profile is linearly scaled to collocated surface measurements of aerosols, CCN, and INP to produce corresponding vertical profiles. Combining lidar backscatter profiles with aerosol and cloud nucleation measurements leads to a more realistic representation of vertical distributions of aerosol properties. The method could be readily applied to lidar measurements in future field campaigns."

 Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), emitted primarily from terrestrial plants, significantly influence atmospheric chemistry and climate change. Conifers are major sources of BVOCs in temperate regions. However, their unique physiology, particularly the storage of terpenes within their tissues, makes accurate measurements of BVOC emissions challenging owing to contact-induced release. We developed a portable dynamic branch enclosure system specifically optimized for BVOC measurement in conifers, which enables measurements of multiple trees in a single day. The system uses filtered ambient air as a purge gas to reduce logistical challenges and features a foldable bag design to minimize excessive BVOC release induced by physical contact. It provides BVOC- and ozone-free air, maintains stable internal temperature and humidity conditions closely approximating those of natural environments, and ensures repeatable measurements of BVOC emissions. Field testing with Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) demonstrated the system's robust field performance, successfully capturing both significant inter-individual variability and the dynamic diurnal patterns of BVOC emissions. The system's ability to reliably resolve these differences under field conditions demonstrates its applicability for advancing our understanding of BVOC dynamics in diverse ecosystems."

 Although edges and defects constitute only a small fraction of crystalline materials, they exert an outsized impact on a material′s properties. Organic–inorganic halide perovskites are promising next-generation semiconductor materials with superior cost effectiveness and interesting optoelectronic properties1–3. However, clear images of their edges have remained challenging to obtain owing to their extreme sensitivity4,5.

A majority methylammonium (MA) and iodine (I) edge termination is observed in methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3), and the damage rate of its edges and internal defects is found to depend on the concentration and type of vacancies present, with a preponderance of I vacancies in particular correlating with higher rates of damage.

 Each year, snakebite envenoming claims thousands of lives and causes severe injury to victims across sub-Saharan Africa, many of whom depend on antivenoms derived from animal plasma as their sole treatment option1. Traditional antivenoms are expensive, can cause adverse immunological reactions, offer limited efficacy against local tissue damage and are often ineffective against all medically relevant snake species2. There is thus an urgent unmet medical need for innovation in snakebite envenoming therapy. However, developing broad-spectrum treatments is highly challenging owing to the vast diversity of venomous snakes and the complex and variable composition of their venoms3. Here we addressed this challenge by immunizing an alpaca and a llama with the venoms of 18 different snakes, including mambas, cobras and a rinkhals, constructing phage display libraries, and identifying high-affinity broadly neutralizing nanobodies. We combined eight of these nanobodies into a defined oligoclonal mixture, resulting in an experimental polyvalent recombinant antivenom that was capable of neutralizing seven toxin families or subfamilies. This antivenom effectively prevented venom-induced lethality in vivo across 17 African elapid snake species and markedly reduced venom-induced dermonecrosis for all tested cytotoxic venoms. The recombinant antivenom performed better than a currently used plasma-derived antivenom and therefore shows considerable promise for comprehensive, continent-wide protection against snakebites by all medically relevant African elapids. A recombinant antivenom composed of eight nanobodies provides broad protection against venom-induced lethality and dermonecrosis in mice challenged with venoms from cobras, mambas and rinkhals snakes."

 Solid-state lithium metal batteries are facing huge challenges under practical working conditions1,2. Even when the ionic conductivity of composite solid-state electrolytes is increased to 1 mS cm−1, it is still difficult to realize long-life cycling of solid-state batteries above a current density of 1 mA cm−2 and an areal capacity of 1 mAh cm−2 (ref. 3). The fundamental cause is the brittle nature of the solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) with sluggish lithium-ion transport and the resulting lithium dendrites and severe side reactions. Here we report a ductile inorganic-rich SEI that retains its structural integrity while allowing easy ion diffusion at high current densities and areal capacities. The ductility of the SEI is ascribed to the Ag2S and AgF components, which are formed by a substitution reaction between Li2S/LiF in the SEI and AgNO3 in the dielectric composite electrolytes. Even at a high current density of 15 mA cm−2 and an areal capacity of 15 mAh cm−2, a symmetrical lithium cell with such an SEI has a long cycle life of over 4,500 hours. Furthermore, the ductile SEI also works over 7,000 hours at −30 °C, even under practical conditions of 5 mA cm−2 and 5 mAh cm−2.

 At more than 200 years, the maximum lifespan of the bowhead whale exceeds that of all other mammals. The bowhead is also the second-largest animal on Earth1, reaching over 80,000 kg. Despite its very large number of cells and long lifespan, the bowhead is not highly cancer-prone, an incongruity termed Peto’s paradox2. Here, to understand the mechanisms that underlie the cancer resistance of the bowhead whale, we examined the number of oncogenic hits required for malignant transformation of whale primary fibroblasts. Unexpectedly, bowhead whale fibroblasts required fewer oncogenic hits to undergo malignant transformation than human fibroblasts. However, bowhead whale cells exhibited enhanced DNA double-strand break repair capacity and fidelity, and lower mutation rates than cells of other mammals. We found the cold-inducible RNA-binding protein CIRBP to be highly expressed in bowhead fibroblasts and tissues. Bowhead whale CIRBP enhanced both non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination repair in human cells, reduced micronuclei formation, promoted DNA end protection, and stimulated end joining in vitro. CIRBP overexpression in Drosophila extended lifespan and improved resistance to irradiation. These findings provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that, rather than relying on additional tumour suppressor genes to prevent oncogenesis3–5, the bowhead whale maintains genome integrity through enhanced DNA repair. This strategy, which does not eliminate damaged cells but faithfully repairs them, may be contributing to the exceptional longevity and low cancer incidence in the bowhead whale. Analysis of the longest-lived mammal, the bowhead whale, reveals an improved ability to repair DNA breaks, mediated by high levels of cold-inducible RNA-binding protein.   "

 We previously identified an embryonic shift in the corticospinal motor neuronal transcriptome after spinal cord injury associated with successful axonal regeneration1. Exploiting this transcriptional regenerative ‘signature’, here we used in silico screens to identify small molecules that generate similar shifts in the transcriptome, and identified thiorphan—a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor—as a lead candidate. In a new adult motor cortex neuronal in vitro screen2, thiorphan increased neurite outgrowth 1.8-fold (P < 0.001). We then infused thiorphan into the central nervous system beginning 2 weeks after severe C5 spinal cord contusions and, when combined with a neural stem cell graft, thiorphan elicited significant improvements in forelimb function (P < 0.005) and corticospinal regeneration (P < 0.05). Extending clinical relevance, thiorphan significantly increased neurite outgrowth in primary cortical neuronal cultures from a 56-year-old human. These findings represent a new path for drug discovery, starting from in silico screens to proof-of-concept in adult human brain cultures. Thiorphan is identified as a new and effective drug treatment for spinal cord injury that can be adopted across nervous system disease states in the development of new therapies for human neurological disorders."

Shim,Building wet planets through high-pressure magma–hydrogen reactions,"Experimental evidence shows that hydrogen–silicate reactions can generate abundant water in sub-Neptunes, suggesting hydrogen-rich planets have the potential to reach water-rich compositions. 
 Close-in transiting sub-Neptunes are abundant in our Galaxy1. Planetary interior models based on their observed radius–mass relationship suggest that sub-Neptunes contain a discernible amount of either hydrogen (dry planets) or water (wet planets) blanketing a core composed of rocks and metal2. Water-rich sub-Neptunes have been believed to form farther from the star and then migrate inwards to their present orbits3. Here we report experimental evidence of reactions between warm, dense hydrogen fluid and silicate melt that release silicon from the magma to form alloys and hydrides at high pressures. We found that oxygen liberated from the silicate melt reacts with hydrogen, producing an appreciable amount of water up to a few tens of weight per cent, which is much greater than previously predicted based on low-pressure ideal gas extrapolation4,5. Consequently, these reactions can generate a spectrum of water contents in hydrogen-rich planets, with the potential to reach water-rich compositions for some sub-Neptunes, implying an evolutionary relationship between hydrogen-rich and water-rich planets. Therefore, detection of a large amount of water in exoplanet atmospheres may not be the optimal evidence for planet migration in the protoplanetary disk, calling into question the assumed link between composition and planet formation location. Experimental evidence shows that hydrogen–silicate reactions can generate abundant water in sub-Neptunes, suggesting hydrogen-rich planets have the potential to reach water-rich compositions."

Moll,Many-body interference in kagome crystals,"Experimental evidence of coherent charge transport in the normal state of the kagome metal CsV3Sb5 is presented, revealing the nature of correlated order in kagome metals and new directions for exploring quantum coherence in correlated electron systems. 
 When electrons in metals act collectively, they enable emergent phenomena and electronic functionalities that transcend the behaviour of individual particles1. Coherent collective charge motion has so far been observed primarily in superconductors, in which it arises with the formation of Cooper pairs2,3. Here we report experimental evidence for coherent charge transport in the normal state of the kagome metal CsV3Sb5, indicative of a distinct collective electronic state. The signature is a set of magnetoresistance oscillations in mesoscopic crystalline pillars under in-plane magnetic fields, with a periodicity determined by the number of magnetic flux quanta h/e threading between adjacent kagome layers—effectively forming an interlayer Aharonov–Bohm interferometer. The cooperative nature of this phenomenon is evidenced by a non-analytic angular dependence characterized by abrupt transitions between discrete oscillation frequencies and its persistence over length scales that exceed the single-particle mean free path. Notably, the oscillation amplitude matches other anomalous electronic responses reported in CsV3Sb5, pointing to an underlying mechanism that establishes intrinsic coherence. These findings shed new light on the debated nature of correlated order in kagome metals and establish CsV3Sb5 as a platform for realizing long-range coherent charge transport in the absence of superconductivity—opening new directions for coherence in correlated electron systems beyond conventional models. Experimental evidence of coherent charge transport in the normal state of the kagome metal CsV3Sb5 is presented, revealing the nature of correlated order in kagome metals and new directions for exploring quantum coherence in correlated electron systems."

 Potato late blight, which is caused by Phytophthora infestans and was responsible for the Irish potato famine, remains a major threat to global food security1. Most late-blight resistance (R) genes encode nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat proteins (NLRs), but many have been overcome by the rapid evolution of P. infestans2. Deploying R genes through hybrid potato breeding3–7 offers a promising solution to manage late blight. Here we construct a section-wide NLRome comprising 39,211 NLR genes from 31 wild and 21 cultivated potato genomes, representing Solanum section Petota, the tuber-bearing clade. This includes newly sequenced genomes of seven wild species with strong resistance to late blight. Phylogenomic analyses reveal asymmetric patterns of evolution that distinguish sensor and helper NLRs. Mining of the NLRome enabled us to clone Rpi-cph1, a homologue of which has previously been identified only in American black nightshade, and Rpi-cjm1, a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing NLR against late blight. We show that non-canonical NLR integrated domains are widespread in the NLRome. Tracing their evolutionary trajectory enabled us to identify Rpi-brk1, an R gene that perceives a P. infestans effector through its heavy-metal-associated (HMA) domain. We find that incorporating the HMA domain into the potato NLR R1 broadens its resistance spectrum, suggesting that a domain ‘plug-in’ strategy could be used to engineer disease resistance. These findings provide a paradigm for R-gene discovery through comparative and evolutionary genomics, and a strategy for R-gene engineering.

 The disappearance of ice shelves, the floating margins of the Antarctic ice sheet that restrain the ice flow into the ocean1–3, would strongly accelerate the Antarctic contribution to sea-level rise4–6. Their viability in a warming world has motivated substantial work that focuses on the influence of the warming atmosphere7–10. Here we revisit the concept of ice-shelf viability in a holistic manner, taking into account mass loss due to both the atmosphere and the ocean to estimate when it becomes almost impossible for the ice shelves to maintain their present-day shape. We show that for a scenario in which global warming remains largely below 2 °C, only 1 out of 64 ice shelves will become likely non-viable by 2300. For a scenario in which global warming reaches nearly 12 °C by 2300, many ice shelves become non-viable once global warming exceeds 4.5 °C, loss that is mainly due to an increase in ocean-induced melt. By 2150 and 2300, 26 and 38 ice shelves, respectively, become likely non-viable. Loss of ice-sheet regions restrained by these 38 ice shelves represent a sea-level rise potential of 10 m. Our estimates are latest bounds for reaching non-viability, and ice-shelf collapse could occur even earlier, in particular owing to the synergy with hydrofracturing.

 Eukaryotic ribosomal small subunit (SSU) assembly requires the SSU processome, a nucleolar precursor containing the RNA chaperone U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA). The underlying molecular mechanisms of SSU processome maturation, remodelling, disassembly and RNA quality control, and the transitions between states remain unknown owing to a paucity of intermediates1–3. Here we report 16 native SSU processome structures alongside genetic data, revealing how two helicases, the Mtr4-exosome and Dhr1, are controlled for accurate and unidirectional ribosome biogenesis. Our data show how irreversible pre-ribosomal RNA degradation by the redundantly tethered RNA exosome couples the transformation of the SSU processome into a pre-40S particle, during which Utp14 can probe evolving surfaces, ultimately positioning and activating Dhr1 to unwind the U3 snoRNA and initiate nucleolar pre-40S release. This study highlights a paradigm for large dynamic RNA–protein complexes in which irreversible RNA degradation drives compositional changes and communicates these changes to govern enzyme activity while maintaining overall quality control.

 Oat grain is a traditional human food that is rich in dietary fibre and contributes to improved human health1,2. Interest in the crop has surged in recent years owing to its use as the basis for plant-based milk analogues3. Oat is an allohexaploid with a large, repeat-rich genome that was shaped by subgenome exchanges over evolutionary timescales4. In contrast to many other cereal species, genomic research in oat is still at an early stage, and surveys of structural genome diversity and gene expression variability are scarce. Here we present annotated chromosome-scale sequence assemblies of 33 wild and domesticated oat lines, along with an atlas of gene expression across 6 tissues of different developmental stages in 23 of these lines. We construct an atlas of gene-expression diversity across subgenomes, accessions and tissues. Gene loss in the hexaploid is accompanied by compensatory upregulation of the remaining homeologues, but this process is constrained by subgenome divergence. Chromosomal rearrangements have substantially affected recent oat breeding. A large pericentric inversion associated with early flowering explains distorted segregation on chromosome 7D and a homeologous sequence exchange between chromosomes 2A and 2C in a semi-dwarf mutant has risen to prominence in Australian elite varieties. The oat pangenome will promote the adoption of genomic approaches to understanding the evolution and adaptation of domesticated oats and will accelerate their improvement.

 Ion-channel activity reflects a combination of open probability and unitary conductance1. Many channels display subconductance states that modulate signalling strength2,3, yet the structural mechanisms governing conductance levels remain incompletely understood. Here we report that conductance levels are controlled by the bending patterns of pore-forming transmembrane helices in the heterotetrameric neuronal channel GluN1a-2B N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Our single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) analyses demonstrate that an endogenous neurosteroid and synthetic positive allosteric modulator (PAM), 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-HC), binds to a juxtamembrane pocket in the GluN2B subunit and stabilizes the fully open-gate conformation, where GluN1a M3 and GluN2B M3′ pore-forming helices are bent to dilate the channel pore. By contrast, EU1622-240 binds to the same GluN2B juxtamembrane pocket and a distinct juxtamembrane pocket in GluN1a to stabilize a sub-open state whereby only the GluN2B M3′ helix is bent. Consistent with the varying extents of gate opening, the single-channel recordings predominantly show full-conductance and subconductance states in the presence of 24S-HC and EU1622-240, respectively. Another class of neurosteroid, pregnenolone sulfate, engages a similar GluN2B pocket, but two molecules bind simultaneously, revealing a diverse neurosteroid recognition pattern. Our study identifies that the juxtamembrane pockets are critical structural hubs for modulating conductance levels in NMDAR.

 Muscular systems1, the fundamental components of mobility in animals, have sparked innovations across technological and medical fields2,3. Yet artificial muscles suffer from dynamic programmability, scalability and responsiveness owing to complex actuation mechanisms and demanding material requirements. Here we introduce a design paradigm for artificial muscles, utilizing more than 10,000 microbubbles with targeted ultrasound activation. These microbubbles are engineered with precise dimensions that correspond to distinct resonance frequencies. When stimulated by a sweeping-frequency ultrasound, microbubble arrays in the artificial muscle undergo selective oscillations and generate distributed point thrusts, enabling the muscle to achieve programmable deformation with remarkable attributes: a high compactness of approximately 3,000 microbubbles per mm2, a low weight of 0.047 mg mm−2, a substantial force intensity of approximately 7.6 μN mm−2 and fast response (sub-100 ms during gripping). Moreover, they offer good scalability (from micrometre to centimetre scale), exceptional compliance and many degrees of freedom. We support our approach with a theoretical model and demonstrate applications spanning flexible organism manipulation, conformable robotic skins for adding mobility to static objects and conformally attaching to ex vivo porcine organs, and biomimetic stingraybots for propulsion within ex vivo biological environments. The customizable artificial muscles could offer both immediate and long-term impact on soft robotics, wearable technologies, haptics and biomedical instrumentation.

 The neural basis of movement preparation has been extensively studied during self-initiated actions, in which motor cortical activity during preparation shows a lawful relationship to the parameters of the subsequent action1,2. However, movements are regularly triggered or corrected on the basis of sensory inputs caused by disturbances to the body. Since such disturbances are often predictable, and since preparing for disturbances would make movements more prescise, we hypothesized that expectations about sensory inputs also influence preparatory activity in motor circuits. Here we show that when humans or monkeys are probabilistically cued about the direction of future mechanical perturbations, they incorporate sensory expectations into their movement preparation and improve their corrective responses. Using high-density neural recordings, we establish that sensory expectations are widespread across the brain, including the motor cortical areas involved in preparing self-initiated actions. The geometry of these preparatory signals in the neural population state is simple, and scales directly with the probability of each perturbation direction. After perturbation onset, a condition-independent signal shifts the neural state leading to rapid responses that initially reflect sensory expectations. Using neural networks coupled to a biomechanical model of the arm3, we show that this neural geometry emerges only when sensory inputs signal that a perturbation has occurred, before resolving the direction of the perturbation. Thus, just as preparatory activity sets the stage for self-initiated movement, it also configures motor circuits to respond efficiently to sensory inputs. Experiments with human volunteers and macaques show that expectations produced by probabilistic cueing of future sensory inputs shape motor circuit dynamics in order to increase the efficiency of movement responses."

 The generation and maintenance of immunity is a dynamic process that is dependent on age1–3. Here, to better understand its progression, we profiled peripheral immunity in more than 300 healthy adults (25 to 90 years of age) using single-cell RNA sequencing, proteomics and flow cytometry, following 96 adults longitudinally across 2 years with seasonal influenza vaccination. The resulting resource generated a single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset of more than 16 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells with 71 immune cell subsets from our Human Immune Health Atlas and enabled us to interrogate how immune cell composition and states shift with age, chronic viral infection and vaccination. From these data, we demonstrate robust, non-linear transcriptional reprogramming in T cell subsets with age that is not driven by systemic inflammation or chronic cytomegalovirus infection. This age-related reprogramming led to a functional T helper 2 (TH2) cell bias in memory T cells that is linked to dysregulated B cell responses against highly boosted antigens in influenza vaccines. Collectively, this study reveals unique features of the immune ageing process that occur prior to advanced age and provides novel targets for age-related immune modulation.

 A key challenge for ecological science is to understand how biodiversity loss is changing ecosystem structure and function at scales that are relevant for policy1. Almost all biodiversity metrics are challenging to disaggregate into animal-mediated ecosystem functions such as pollination, seed and nutrient dispersal, and predation. Here we adopt an ecosystem energetics approach2 as a physically meaningful method of translating animal species composition into a suite of ecosystem functions. Drawing on new datasets that estimate biodiversity intactness and species population densities3–5, we quantify historical changes to energy flows through mammal- and bird-mediated ecosystem functions across sub-Saharan Africa. In total, trophic energy flows have decreased by more than one-third. The pattern of decreasing function varies by historical biome, driven by arboreal birds and primates in forests, terrestrial herbivores in grassy systems, and burrowing mammals in arid systems. Functions performed by megafauna in particular have collapsed outside protected areas. Compared with other biodiversity metrics, an energetics approach highlights the ecological importance of smaller animals and keystone species. The results can help practitioners conserve and restore functionally diverse, energetically intact ecosystems across land uses and biomes. By relating biodiversity intactness to energy and material flows, ecosystem energetics can also advance efforts to integrate animal-driven functions into biosphere and earth system models, helping us to understand possible regional or planetary boundaries6 for biodiversity.

 Infection by yellow fever virus (YFV), the prototype Orthoflavivirus, induces a febrile syndrome in humans that can progress to liver failure, haemorrhage and death1. Despite decades of study, the entry receptors for YFV remain unclear. Here, using a surface protein-targeted CRISPR–Cas9 screen, we identified LRP4, a low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family member, as a candidate entry receptor for YFV. Genetic ablation of LRP4 impaired YFV infection of cells and, reciprocally, complementation or ectopic expression of LRP4 increased infection. Related viruses in the YFV antigenic complex also showed LRP4-dependent infection. LRP4 promoted YFV entry into cells through LDLR type A (LA) domain binding to domain III of the YFV envelope protein. Soluble LRP4–Fc decoy receptors neutralized YFV infection in cell culture and reduced viral burden in vivo. As we observed residual YFV infection in LRP4-deficient cells, we evaluated whether other LDLR family members promote YFV entry. This approach identified LRP1 and VLDLR as additional receptors for YFV infection in cell culture. LRP1–Fc, LRP4–Fc and VLDLR–Fc decoys protected mice from YFV challenge, and LRP1–Fc decoys inhibited YFV infection and liver pathogenesis in mice engrafted with human hepatocytes. A genetic deficiency of LRP1 in primary human hepatocyte cultures also resulted in reduced YFV infection. Our findings establish a role for multiple LDLR family members in YFV entry, infection and pathogenesis, which has implications for receptor use and countermeasure development for multiple emerging orthoflaviviruses. The low-density lipoprotein receptor family members LRP1, LRP4 and VLDLR are entry receptors for yellow fever virus."

 The exact nature of crustal magmatic reservoirs is elusive as they cannot be sampled in situ. The traditional view that magma chambers contain essentially molten material has recently been replaced by the transcrustal magmatic system (TCMS), in which reservoirs are mostly composed of immobile magmatic crystals with a minute fraction of more mobile melt1–3, creating a ‘magmatic mush’3. Eruptions are possible if a significant portion of melt segregates into melt-rich lenses within the mush reservoir1–3. The TCMS concept is, however, a default model essentially justified by the absence of clear geophysical signatures of melt-rich magma chambers1,4, and by the rare and tentative estimates of the melt fraction in the crustal storage zones based on geochemical and textural analysis of eruptive products5,6. Here we image a bright electrical conductor at 23 ± 1 km below sea level beneath Mayotte island that we interpret as a magmatic reservoir, based on laboratory measurements of Mayotte’s melt conductivity. This large magmatic reservoir (more than 200 km3) contains a high melt fraction (22–42%). Such a crystal-to-liquid ratio matches the reconstructed differentiation paths7–9 producing the melts that recently erupted at Mayotte.

 The iron and steel sector is central to national net-zero efforts but remains hard to abate1,2. Existing decarbonization roadmaps fail to guide technology choices for individual plants, given their heterogeneity and economic constraints3–5. Here, by integrating two global plant-level datasets and forecasted technology costs, we develop a model to identify the least-cost technology pathway for each plant worldwide in alignment with national carbon-neutrality targets. In the short term (pre-2030), energy efficiency improvements and scrap reuse are the cheapest decarbonization strategies, reducing cumulative global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 7.8 Gt and 7.2 Gt at average costs of –US$8.5 tCO2−1 and US$0.3 tCO2−1, respectively. In the long term (after 2030), smelt reduction with carbon capture is expected to become technically mature and economically viable, achieving approximately 6.0 Gt of CO2 reductions at costs of US$7–15 tCO2−1 in Chinese plants and US$26–75 tCO2−1 in plants across Japan, Korea and Europe. After 2040, green-hydrogen-based steelmaking is estimated to contribute an additional 0.3 Gt of CO2 abatement in European plants at costs of US$27–44 tCO2−1. This study tailors plant-specific least-cost technology pathways that reconcile stakeholders’ economic interests with climate objectives, enabling actionable decarbonization strategies and supporting global net-zero targets.

Korbel,Origins of chromosome instability unveiled by coupled imaging and genomics,"Coupling live-cell imaging, machine learning and genomic sequencing, the MAGIC platform enables investigation of the cellular context, mutation rates and triggers of spontaneous chromosomal abnormality formation, shedding light on fundamental determinants of chromosomal instability. 
 Somatic chromosome instability results in widespread structural and numerical chromosomal abnormalities (CAs) during cancer evolution1–3. Although CAs have been linked to mitotic errors resulting in the emergence of nuclear atypia4–7, the underlying processes and rates of spontaneous CA formation in human cells are underexplored. Here we introduce machine-learning-assisted genomics and imaging convergence (MAGIC)—an autonomously operated platform that integrates live-cell imaging of micronucleated cells, machine learning on-the-fly and single-cell genomics to systematically investigate CA formation. Applying MAGIC to near-diploid, non-transformed cell lines, we track de novo CAs over successive cell cycles, highlighting the common role of dicentric chromosomes as initiating events. We determine the baseline CA mutation rate, which approximately doubles in TP53-deficient cells, and observe that chromosome losses arise more frequently than gains. The targeted induction of DNA double-strand breaks along chromosome arms triggers distinct CA processes, revealing stable isochromosomes, coordinated segregation and amplification of isoacentric segments in multiples of two, as well as complex CA outcomes, influenced by the chromosomal break location. Our data contrast de novo CA spectra from somatic mutational landscapes after selection occurred. The experimentation enabled by MAGIC advances the dissection of DNA rearrangement processes, shedding light on fundamental determinants of chromosomal instability.

 The electronic passivation of small-form-factor devices requires a fundamental change in electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, transitioning from bulky metal cans to conformal thin films1–4. However, reducing the thickness induces poor shielding performance associated with the skin depth of shielding materials5,6. To overcome the performance limitations of thin-film shields, absorption during multiple internal reflections should be driven7. For absorption during multiple internal reflections, pores have been intentionally introduced into shielding materials such as metals8–12 and two-dimensional (2D) titanium carbides/nitrides (MXenes)13–19. However, these approaches involve insufficient thinness, non-uniformity and/or processing incompatibility. Here we propose embedding non-porous MXene film into metal thin films to achieve unprecedented shielding performance at a thickness of just 1 μm (about 70 decibels; about 80 decibels at 1.9-μm thickness) without the limitations associated with porous structures. This exceptional performance in simple-stacked metal/MXene/metal structures, which deviates from the typical thickness dependency, arises from the formation of electromagnetic wave confinement walls at the interfaces, driven by the conductivity mismatch between the metal and MXene. The confined electromagnetic waves within the MXene ‘well’ are effectively attenuated through polarization loss, primarily driven by dipoles at the metal–MXene interfaces. Our embedded-MXene-in-metal shields provide conformal EMI protection for portable USB (Universal Serial Bus) 3.0 flash drives and flexible Schottky diodes. Our embedded-MXene-in-metal shields may open new avenues in packaging technologies, enabling EMI-free ubiquitous electronics. Embedding non-porous MXene film into metal thin films can achieve unprecedented shielding performance, which can be used to protect electronic components and equipment from electromagnetic noise."

 Efficient conversion of mechanical energy into direct current remains a significant challenge for current energy-harvesting devices. In ionic tribomaterials, the displacement and polarization of mobile ions can dynamically control both the magnitude and direction of generated charges. This process shares similarities with semiconductor-based tribovoltaic systems but differs from conventional dielectric triboelectric devices, where electrical conductivity and charge retention are often in competition. While ionic tribomaterials are receiving increasing attention, their ability to generate direct current directly from mechanical motion has not been fully investigated. Here, we show that incorporating ionic components, such as plasticizers, into a common dielectric polymer (polyvinyl chloride) transforms the output from alternating to direct current. This process is driven by contact electrification combined with electrode polarization, enabling stable direct current generation across contact–separation, sliding, and rotary motions—modes that are typically difficult to unify in a single design. The resulting devices maintain stable output under extended operation and varying environmental conditions, demonstrating a robust and versatile route for mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion. This approach bridges the performance gap between polymer-based triboelectric devices and tribovoltaic systems, offering a broadly applicable strategy for sustainable energy harvesting technologies.

It predicts that the extension of the growing season will not be sufficient to compensate for the future drought-induced summer growth limitation. 
 The radial growth of temperate forests responds to climate change with remarkable variation across space and between species. However, there is limited understanding of how growing season extension and increasing drought stress contribute to long-term growth trends. Here, we calibrate the VS-Lite growth model using 2013 tree-ring chronologies from ten broadleaved and five coniferous genera in Central-Southeast Europe to predict intra-annual wood formation under four SSP climate scenarios through the 21st century. Results show that forecasted summer drought stress will be temporarily offset by an extended growing season, leading to stable or positive trends in tree-ring widths until a tipping point in the 2040s–2050s. During the second half of the 21st century, high-emission scenarios lead to growth acceleration in humid coniferous forests due to growing season extension and enhanced growth rate. In contrast, forecasted extension of the growing season is insufficient to compensate for declining summer growth rates at drier sites, resulting in significant growth reduction for all genera, particularly during dry years. Our results demonstrate that adjusting intra-annual wood formation to seasonal moisture availability may become crucial for tree survival in warmer climates. Furthermore, we highlight that only low-emission scenarios support non-declining stem growth in dry forests with current species composition.

 Densifying triboelectric layers benefits triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) by increasing output, improving spatial utilization, and reducing costs. However, structural densification imposes limitations that hinder further output enhancement. A charge dispatch strategy is developed in our proposed rattle drum inspired TENG, which mitigates charge cancellation via path diversion and alleviates electrostatic shielding through mode transformation, yielding over 6x output versus traditional models. Further structural designs to improve layer contact-separation efficiency, including laser etching and contact push pins, raise the triboelectric surface density to 2.76 cm-1. A comprehensive framework is established, encompassing theoretical modeling, engineering optimization, and extensive experimental validation. Furthermore, the generator can capture weak wave energy when equipped with a magnetic repulsion pendulum, boosting motion amplitude and output by 558% and 1662%, respectively, demonstrating scenario adaptability expansion. Here, we show strategies to further elevate layer density and pathways to enhance TENG output.

 Electrifying heavy-duty trucks is crucial for decarbonizing transportation, but maximizing their potential requires minimizing the carbon footprint of timely deliveries. This complex optimization task involves strategic path, speed, and charging planning, which traditional methods struggle to optimize at scale. We present a stage-expanded graph formulation that reduces complexity and reveals a useful problem structure. Our formulation naturally decomposes the problem into more tractable subproblems, allowing efficient coordination between routing and charging decisions, and maintains a manageable graph size. We exploit these structural insights to design an efficient algorithm with performance guarantees. Simulations using real-world data over the U.S. highway system demonstrate that our method complements the 36% carbon reduction from electrification with an additional 25% decrease, totaling a 61% reduction. Moreover, our carbon-optimized strategy, applicable to various truck types, can achieve comparable carbon reductions 9 years sooner than zero-emission truck adoption alone. This approach accelerates transportation decarbonization, offering a powerful tool in the fight against climate change.

 Isolated atrial amyloidosis (IAA) is a localized cardiac disorder characterized by atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) amyloids deposition in the atria, linked to aging and atrial fibrillation (AF). While monomeric ANP regulates blood pressure, its dimeric form is associated with cardiovascular conditions, including AF. The mechanistic link between ANP aggregation, IAA, and AF remains unclear. Here, we present the first high-resolution structural characterization of ANP fibrils extracted from AF patients, revealing two distinct fibril polymorphs. Both present covalent ANP dimers as building blocks but diverge in their structural architecture: one features antiparallel dimers stabilized by a single disulfide bond, while the other consists of parallel dimers bridged by two interchain disulfide bonds. These fibril morphologies were conserved across patients, suggesting a common aggregation mechanism in IAA. Overall, our findings ascribe to dimeric ANP a critical role in amyloid formation, offering promising directions for earlier detection and treatment of IAA.

 Climate change is increasingly destabilizing hydrological systems in cold regions, driving lake and river drainage reorganization with profound ecological and socio-economic impacts. Here we investigate intensified hydrological changes in the Zonag and Yanhu Lake drainage basins, located in the Hoh Xil region of the Tibetan Plateau, a UNESCO World Natural Heritage site. Using field observations, satellite remote sensing, and climate data, we show that since 2019 these previously endorheic lakes have connected to the headwaters of the Yangtze River, expanding its basin. The region’s extreme precipitation events have heightened lake outburst risks, while the retreating lake shores, which have triggered more frequent sandstorms since 2011, degrading habitats for Tibetan antelope. Climate projections indicate persistent hydrological and ecological instability through 2035.

It incorporates nitrogen oxides, water vapour, contrail-induced cloudiness, upstream emissions from in-flight services, and life cycle emissions from aircraft and airports, offering a complete carbon footprint assessment. Accuracy is improved through detailed modelling of flight distance, fuel consumption, and emissions allocation adjusted for passenger class, luggage, and cargo. Historical adjustment factors refine pre-flight estimates by integrating real-world variations. The tool outputs a full emissions breakdown by source, offering unparalleled granularity and clarity.

 Existing erosion models inadequately address geo-pedological controls governing landscape degradation. This research investigates these relationships across Tamil Nadu, establishing an integrated framework connecting geological conditions to vulnerability outcomes. Through multi-parameter spatial analysis integrating geological, geomorphological, and pedological data from 120 sampling sites, we identified distinct process domains with varying vulnerability patterns. Field validation using standard accuracy metrics (R2 > 0.71 for all soil properties, RMSE within acceptable thresholds) confirmed the reliability of SoilGrids predictions for regional-scale vulnerability assessment. The study reveals how lithological variations from Peninsular Gneiss to Quaternary deposits control pedogenic pathways. Soil properties including texture (sandy loam to clay), coarse fragment content from 27 to 263 cm3/dm3, and bulk density from 0.78 to 1.67 g/cm3 create distinctive hydrological regimes, while chemical properties like pH ranging from 5.1 to 8.8 establish biogeochemical environments with varying resilience characteristics. Soil erosion rates from 3.7 to 29 ton/ha·yr demonstrate pronounced spatial variability, with western highlands experiencing 3 to 4 times higher erosion than eastern plains. Below-ground carbon distribution from 0 to 10.8 kg/m2 emerges as a critical indicator of landscape functional capacity, with high‑carbon domains demonstrating significantly greater resilience to environmental stressors. The integrated spatial framework developed through this research provides a foundation for targeted conservation approaches addressing fundamental landscape processes rather than symptoms, with significant implications for sustainable land management across diverse tropical environments. Future research should enhance multi-parameter integration with socioeconomic variables and strengthen temporal analysis to better understand dynamic soil-landscape relationships."

 Monitoring land cover changes becomes increasingly vital in light of climate change and urban and industrial expansion. Land cover, however, is often expressed in discrete categories, which can oversimplify transitional and heterogeneous areas. Instead, by mapping land cover types as fractions, one can make a more accurate representation of not only the spatial distribution but also the temporal variability, which is crucial for pronounced change detection. However, current methods produce inconsistent time series or oversimplify change dynamics. At the same time, the promising potential of temporal deep learning and dense time series modelling has not been previously explored. Bridging this gap, this study compares novel Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and post-processing LSTM (PostLSTM) models with baseline Random Forest (RF) and Markov Chain models for multi-class land cover fraction regression and post-processing, respectively. Landsat-8 data were used to produce fraction time series at a 100-meter spatial resolution in both annual and, in a novel approach harnessing intra-annual characteristics, dense (16-day) time steps. The models were trained and validated using yearly land cover fraction records collected from globally distributed sample sites. The LSTM models performed better than the RF models when focusing on land cover classes predicted or validated to have a fraction of at least 1%. However, they did not outperform because of poorer handling of the remaining 0% fractions, which are naturally inflated in number since the majority of classes are commonly absent from a given area. Since the RF models produced fluctuating time series, the PostLSTM models achieved the highest yearly Overall Accuracy (OA) (>67%). Compared to the Markov Chain models constrained by their Markov property, the PostLSTM models stabilised time series while preserving actual change. All dense models achieved similar yearly OA to their annual counterparts, but can offer end-users valuable information on intra-annual land cover fraction change. This research showcases the potential of temporal deep learning and provides important new insights into increasing accuracy in annual and dense land cover fraction mapping."

 Lianas play a crucial role in shaping the vertical structural complexity of tropical forests; however, their impact is not well understood. This study evaluates the influence of lianas on the Lorenz-entropy (LE) index, a measure of canopy heterogeneity, in a Neotropical tropical dry forest (TDF) in Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica. Using full-waveform LiDAR data and simulated Global Ecosystem Dynamic Investigation (GEDI) waveforms, we compared liana-infested and non-infested plots across early, intermediate, and late successional stages. Using Mann-Whitney U test with Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction (95 % confidence level) our findings indicate that liana-infested plots exhibit significantly higher Lorenz-entropy index values in intermediate (P< 0.05, P < BH-threshold), and late (P < 3.33×10-2, P < BH-threshold) successional stages, while early-stage in non-infested plots showed significantly higher entropy values (P< 1.67×10-2, P < BH-threshold). Effect size analysis showed a moderate impact in the intermediate stage (Cliff’s δ = 0.35, 95 % CI: 0.07–0.61) and a moderate to large impact in the late stage (Cliff’s δ = 0.41, 95 % CI: 0.11–0.67). In early-stage plots, liana-infested stands had significantly lower LE index values than non-infested plots (Cliff’s δ = –0.50, 95 % CI: –0.78 to –0.19). These results demonstrate that the LE index effectively captures liana-driven increases in vertical canopy stratification and heterogeneity, particularly in more mature forest stages.The integration of airborne LiDAR and GEDI simulations offers an approach for assessing structural complexity at the plot level. These findings highlight the need for further research to understand the long-term ecological consequences of liana abundance, in the context of forest monitoring."

 Cloud cover affects and reacts to climate change, and it obstructs optical observations.

The recently proposed coarse-and-fine thresholding (CAFT) method, designed to minimize cloud interference while optimizing imaging supply, shows potential for establishing such a threshold for studying sub-continental IAPs. Nevertheless, the CAFT’s feasibility and effectiveness in establishing a worldwide threshold have not been evaluated. With the 1984–2023 scene cloud cover of global (excluding Antarctica) Landsat-5/7/8 Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced TM Plus (ETM+), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery (nearly six million), we explored a universal threshold among six continents using CAFT to derive global annual IAPs and then examined their geographic, temporal, and senor-based variations. We concluded that the pre-defined 24% can be a globally applicable threshold and the 40-year benchmarking IAP of global Landsat is estimated to be nearly 45%. ETM+ has higher global average IAPs (>47%) compared to OLI (45%) and TM (43%).

Sustainable change characteristics in different regions are analyzed using the Hurst exponent, and the influence of driving factors on African NPP are quantified through a structural equation model (SEM). The analysis revealed that: (1) The annual variation curve of African NPP demonstrated a fluctuating upward trajectory (p = 0.001) throughout the study period. Wavelet analysis revealed a cyclical pattern with a primary period of about 20 years, characterized by two upward and downward transitions during 1981–2018. (2) Spatial analysis indicates the distribution of NPP across Africa is centered around the equator and gradually decreases towards higher latitudes, in which the NPP of tropical rainforest and its adjacent areas increases significantly, covering 40.2 % of Africa’s area. However, Hurst exponent analysis reveals that NPP in Africa generally exhibits anti-sustainability changes, with 52.8 % of the total area potentially shifting from growth to decline in the future. (3) SEM analysis shows that NPP in Africa is mainly regulated by natural factors, particularly cumulative precipitation and temperature extremes, which exhibit the highest impact coefficient of 0.89. While topographic factors also have a substantial overall effect, their impact is primarily indirect through climate, with minimal direct influence.

Here, the literature has primarily focused on using specific encoder architectures for local regions, lacking a deeper exploration of other components in the MVL methodology. In contrast, we investigate the simultaneous selection of the fusion strategy and encoder architecture, assessing global-scale cropland and crop-type classifications. We use a range of five fusion strategies (Input, Feature, Decision, Ensemble, Hybrid) and five temporal encoders (LSTM, GRU, TempCNN, TAE, L-TAE) as possible configurations in the MVL method. We use the CropHarvest dataset for validation, which provides optical, radar, weather time series, and topographic information as input data. We found that in scenarios with a limited number of labeled samples, a unique configuration is insufficient for all cases. Instead, a specific combination should be meticulously sought, including an encoder and fusion strategy. To streamline this search process, we suggest identifying the optimal encoder architecture tailored for a particular fusion strategy and then determining the most suitable fusion strategy for the classification task. We provide a standardized model schema for the exploration of crop classification through an MVL methodology. jn"

 Water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) is a major carbonaceous component of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), with significant implications for air quality, climate change, and the global carbon cycle. However, limited observational data under regional background condition has hindered a comprehensive understanding of its seasonal variability, sources, and formation pathways, especially in North China. To address this gap, we carried out a year-long observation of WSOC at Beihuangcheng Island, a representative regional background site in North China. The results revealed an annual average WSOC concentration of 2.96 ± 1.99 μg m−3, with marked seasonal variability—higher levels during the cold season and lower levels during the warm season. Strong positive correlations between WSOC and several chemical tracers in PM2.5 (e.g., K+, SO42−) as well as secondary organic carbon (SOC) indicate that WSOC is predominantly of secondary origin, mainly derived from anthropogenic emissions such as coal combustion and biomass burning. Source apportionment using the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model identified secondary aerosol formation as the dominant contributor, accounting for 47.3 % of WSOC annually. This source is characterized by high loads of NO3−, SO42−, and a low organic carbon to elemental carbon (OC/EC) ratio, implicating fossil fuel-related emissions—especially from vehicles and coal combustion—in the secondary formation of WSOC. Biomass burning emerged as the second-largest contributor, responsible for 33.2 % of annual WSOC, with a notable rise to 40.0 % in winter. This seasonal increase highlights the substantial influence of residential heating and agricultural residue burning on WSOC levels during the cold season."

 This study investigated particle number size distributions (PNSD) at a high-elevation, subtropical mountainous site in East Asia using cluster analysis. Measurement was conducted for 3–4 weeks in each season at the Xitou Experimental Forest from winter 2013 to autumn 2014. PNSD was measured with a scanning mobility particle sizer and subsequently grouped into five distinct clusters using K-means clustering. Utilizing trace gases and particulate matter as supporting data, the clusters were classified into five categories: (1) background aerosols, (2) N25 burst events, (3) growth particles, (4) further growth particles associated with high PM2.5 pollution, and (5) aged polluted air, providing insights into sources and evolutionary processes of atmospheric particulates. Elevated N25 bursts in winter and summer coincided with higher H2SO4 proxy levels, suggesting nucleation involving sulfuric acid played a role in new particle formation in these seasons. In addition, the ages of air masses were estimated by using ΔCO/NO2. The results indicated that Clusters 1 (background) and 5 (aged polluted air) represented aged air masses, while Cluster 3 occurring near noontime reflected fresh emissions. Diurnal variations of occurrences and geometric median diameters of clusters showed new particle formation and growth processes presented in the early morning were followed by transport of urban pollution upon the rising of the mixing layer height in noontime. This study highlighted the regional transport and atmospheric processing of pollutants in shaping air quality in East Asia's mountainous environments, and demonstrated the utility of K-mean clustering method for simplifying the high-dimensional aerosol dataset at a high-elevation mountainous site affected by complex anthropogenic sources and topographical settings."

 Accurate surface reflectance is fundamental to quantitative remote sensing. However, persistent dust retention on land surfaces is a major and understudied problem in global dust belt regions. This compromises the accuracy of vegetation monitoring, land cover classification, and other quantitative applications. This study focuses on the Hotan region, located at the southern edge of the Taklamakan Desert. A three-pronged approach was employed, including in situ experiments to measure dust retention amounts, laboratory spectral measurements and simulations to assess the impact of varying dust levels, and a long-term comparative analysis of dust-retained and dust-removed satellite imagery (Landsat and Sentinel-2, 2005 to 2024). Results show that vegetated surfaces retain significantly more dust than non-vegetated surfaces. Specifically, maize and Platanus orientalis retained 23.771 g/m2 and 15.522 g/m2, respectively. Non-vegetated surfaces like photovoltaic (PV) panels and painted metal rooftops retained only 4.608 g/m2 and 3.324 g/m2, respectively. Statistical analysis confirmed that the observed changes in reflectance were highly significant. Laboratory spectral measurements and simulation results indicate that land surface reflectance systematically varies with increasing dust retention levels. In satellite imagery, dust retention universally alters the observed surface reflectance across widely distributed land surface types. For PV panels, maximum mean reflectance changes reached 4.8 % in the red band and 4.9 % in the NIR band. For vegetation, changes were even more pronounced, reaching 4.9 % in the red band and −6.7 % in the NIR band. Our findings demonstrate the pervasive and statistically significant impact of dust retention on observed surface reflectance. This highlights the critical need to account for dust interference to ensure the reliability of remote sensing applications in arid and semi-arid regions."

 This study addresses the limited understanding of the effects of the atmospheric oxidative capacity (Ox) on respiratory mortalities, particularly those resulting from acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs), based on mortality data from 2014 to 2021 in Jiangsu Province, China. Our results demonstrate significant effects of short-term exposures to ambient Ox on total, ARIs and CRDs mortalities. Specifically, we found that exposures to Ox across different exposure windows, ranging from the day of death to seven days prior, were significantly linked to total respiratory mortality, with ORs ranging from 1.004 (95is %CI: 1.001, 1.007) to 1.015 (95 %CI: 1.012, 1.019) per 10ug/m3 exposure increase. A dose-response relationship was observed between ambient Ox levels and total, ARIs, and CRDs mortalities. A 10 μg/m3 increase in Ox exposure was associated with a 1.47 %, 1.47 % and 1.57 % rise in total, acute and chronic respiratory mortalities, respectively.

 New particle formation (NPF) is a fundamental process governing atmospheric aerosol production and, consequently, climate and air quality. Despite the extensive study of acid-base interactions in nucleation, the role of organic nitrogen compounds, particularly urea, remains inadequately explored. Here, we employ quantum chemical calculations and kinetic simulations via the Atmospheric Cluster Dynamics Code (ACDC) to elucidate the mechanisms by which urea modulates nucleation processes. Our investigation reveals that urea, through its dual hydrogen-bonding capability and proton-accepting -C=O group, stabilizes clusters formed with methanesulfonic acid (MSA), sulfuric acid (SA), and nitric acid (NA). In binary systems, MSA-Urea clusters exhibit intermediate stability, higher than those of MSA-NH3 but lower than MSA-MA. Notably, in ternary MSA-MA-Urea systems, urea markedly enhances nucleation rates, particularly under low-temperature conditions. These results indicate that urea can compensate for the low ambient concentrations of more potent bases such as methylamine (MA), thus playing a pivotal role in atmospheric nucleation. Our findings underscore the need to incorporate organic nitrogen chemistry into atmospheric models to improve predictions of aerosol formation and its broader climatic impacts."

 Fine particulate matter with a diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) can penetrate the respiratory system and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), posing a threat to human health. The ability to generate ROS can be represented by the oxidative potential (OP) of PM2.5 in air. Herein, PM2.5 was collected from Kyoto and Suzu, Japan, which are downwind regions in East Asia. Kyoto represents a typical densely populated urban center situated in one of Japan's plains, and Suzu is a remote coastal town. This pairing provides a representative framework for assessing OP-related health risks across different environmental settings in Japan. Composite extraction using water and methanol as solvents was used to extract the chemical components of samples, and the OP values of their water-soluble (OPWs-DTT) and methanol-soluble (OPMs-DTT) fractions were assessed via dithiothreitol (DTT) assay. The daily average of the total DTT consumption rate (OPWs-DTT + OPMs-DTT) was 436.8 ± 249.7 pmol/min/m3 in Kyoto and 141.0 ± 54.0 pmol/min/m3 in Suzu. The OPMs-DTT/OPWs-DTT ratio exceeded 30 % in both locations, indicating that methanol could effectively complement water in estimating the OP of PM2.5. Positive matrix factorization analysis revealed seven pollution sources in Kyoto and six in Suzu. Biomass burning and secondary sulfate with soil were the main OP contributors in both locations. Kyoto (inland) and Suzu (coastal) were both influenced by marine aerosols. Additionally, transboundary pollution from northeast Asia was observed in Suzu. These results highlight significant differences in the OP-relevant PM2.5 sources between locations and the variable, non-negligible contribution of water-insoluble components."

 The New Particle Formation (NPF) mechanism plays a significant role in regulating the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Here, we present results from a campaign mode study during 3 January - 4 February 2023 obtained from simultaneous measurements of particle number concentration within a size range 10–300 nm (N10-300) using the scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) and CCN concentrations (NCCN) using a CCN Counter (CCNc) over an urban location, Dibrugarh, in the Eastern Himalayan Foothills. The mean diurnal variation of NCCN at supersaturations (SS) 0.2 %–1.0 % exhibits similar variation to the total number concentration of aerosols (N10-300) measured by the SMPS. Both exhibit higher concentrations during nighttime and lower during daytime, primarily influenced by atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) dynamics. We have identified four NPF events during the study period. The new particle burst appeared below 25 nm, while the growth process sustained for 12 to 17 h at the growth rate from 4.5 to 7.2 nm h−1. The growth process begins with coagulation, followed by condensation, which becomes the dominant mechanism in the formation of CCN. Further, the enhancement factor of CCN due to NPF (E_NCCN) was estimated to examine the aerosol-CCN interaction.

 Microplastics (MPs) are becoming well-known as widespread airborne pollutants with potential consequences for human respiratory health. In this study, we examined the occurrence, morphology, and polymer type of MPs in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from 30 patients with respiratory issues in a health care setting in southwestern Iran, in relation to airborne MPs collected contemporaneously from the ambient environment. Individual MPs were separated by the use of chemical digestion and density gradient centrifugation; these were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Overall, 129 MPs were identified in BALF, with a corrected mean of 3.2 particles/10 mL in BALF; however, the majority were white or transparent fibers ranging from a diameter of 20–100 μm, and were predominantly polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS). Air samples, collected using a high-volume OMNI sampler, ranged from 2.2 to 6.7 MP/m3, while in ambient air variation included shapes and colors with fragments, films, and spherules. Additionally, a statistically significant and strong positive correlation (ρ = 0.996 (p < 0.001)) was found between the weekly ambient MP concentration and the BALF MP counts, supporting inhalation as a likely route of exposure.

 Rare earth elements (REEs) are commonly used to trace sources and geochemical processes due to their coherent chemical properties and systematic variations. However, with the rapid expansion of their industrial applications, REEs have increasingly become emerging atmospheric pollutants, while their anthropogenic sources and associated health risks remain poorly understood. In this study, a year-long observation (April 2021–March 2022) of total suspended particles (TSP) and size-segregated aerosol was conducted in Nanchang, a major Chinese REE industry city. We found the average annual concentration of total REEs (ΣREE) was in the order of spring > winter > autumn > summer. Most REEs showed low enrichment factors (EFs), suggesting a primarily crustal origin. However, the elevated Ce and Eu EFs, combined with positive Ce and Eu anomalies pattern, indicated anthropogenic influence. A significant positive correlation of Ce and Eu EFs across both TSP and size-segregated samples further suggests a common anthropogenic source. Photoelectric industry emissions were identified as the primary contributors to the observed anomalies, accounting for 39 % ± 18 % of Ce and 24 % ± 11 % of Eu annually. Notably, both Ce and Eu anomalies showed comparable degree across fine and coarse PM, demonstrating the unique particle size distribution characteristics of photoelectric Ce and Eu. While Ce inhalation showed no significant non-carcinogenic health risks in Nanchang, concerns should be raised for workers and residents near photoelectric industry sites due to high Ce exposure levels.

 In the Himalayan region of Nepal, the majority of households are single-cell houses (SCH) where families cook, heat, sleep, and perform daily activities in a single shared space. Firewood and other biomass fuels are commonly used for cooking and heating, especially during cold seasons. This combustion process releases harmful pollutants, such as carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), significantly degrading indoor air quality (IAQ) and posing serious health risks to residents. This study aims to assess indoor air quality and evaluate pollutant exposure and associated health risks among occupants of SCHs.Continuous real-time monitoring of IAQ parameters was conducted for 24 h over five consecutive days in each house under varying ventilation conditions. CO and PM2.5 concentrations were found to be 25.11 ± 14.24 ppm and 793.8 ± 117.36 μg/m3, respectively—exceeding international health guidelines by up to 3.6 times for CO and 32 times for PM2.5.

 Emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from on-road vehicle fleets were investigated through tunnel tests conducted in 2014 and 2019 in Guangzhou, China, to assess the impacts of upgraded vehicle emission standards and changing fleet composition. The emission factors of PM2.5-bound PAHs (four-ring and above) significantly decreased by 76.4 %, from 45.22 to 10.66 μg km−1 veh−1 during this period. Although the diesel fleet share fell by ∼75 % from 13.0 % to 3.3 %, diesel vehicles remained the dominant source of PAHs, exhibiting emission factors 9–50 times higher than gasoline vehicles. Notably, emissions of some 5- and 6-ring PAHs declined much less and even increased, suggesting that non-exhaust emissions, particularly tire wear, have become increasingly significant sources of PAHs. The overall toxicity, expressed in terms of toxic equivalency quotients (TEQBaP), declined by 66.7 %, yet benzo[a]pyrene consistently dominated total toxicity (69–74 %).

 The adverse effects of air pollution on human physical health are well established, but potential links with behavioural and mental health problems are also suggested. However, evidence is limited, with few studies employing spatial life course methods or considering the effects of unmeasured and residual confounding factors. This study addresses the identified gap by using prospective longitudinal data from the Christchurch Health and Development Study to examine associations between cumulative air pollution exposure and subsequent behaviour and mental health outcomes in adulthood. The study sample consists of a birth cohort of 1265 individuals born during 1977 in Christchurch, New Zealand. Individual-level residential address data were linked to air pollution estimates, including annual black smoke levels (micrograms per cubic meter of air or μg/m3) from during pregnancy to age 10 years (1976–1987), and PM10 (21–40 years), PM2.5 (30–40 years), and NO2 (40 years) in adulthood. Behavioural (i.e. nicotine, alcohol, cannabis, and other illicit substance use disorders) and mental health outcomes (i.e. depressive symptoms, anxiety disorders, and suicidal ideation) were prospectively assessed from age 21–40 years. Findings from unadjusted population-averaged GEE logistic regression models indicated only weak associations between cumulative air pollution exposure and some behavioural and mental health outcomes. In fully adjusted models, associations were fully attenuated, other than PM2.5 exposure and nicotine abuse/dependence (OR = 1.074 [1.0156, 1.136]). While further research is needed to confirm our findings, air pollution exposure may be less important than more proximal factors for behaviour and mental health outcomes in adulthood."

 Despite being a leading cause of health issues, air pollution in smaller cities is often overlooked. To address this gap, annual monitoring of Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5), Black Carbon (BC), and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) was conducted at a residential site in a semi-urban area and, for comparison, in an urban area. The sampling site was affected by multiple, co-located sources, including the National Highway (NH-19), traffic intersections, street vendor stalls, and other commercial areas, resulting in high exposure levels. The collected data were analyzed to understand the dynamics, variations, morphology, and chemical composition of particles; these levels were then assessed concerning passive cigarette smoke (PSC) exposure, evaluating potential health impacts. Four health outcomes—cardiovascular mortality (CM), lung cancer (LC), low birth weight (LBW), and decreased lung function (DLF) in school-aged children—were assessed to quantify the burden. The results indicate that even minimal concentrations can significantly affect human health, as a rise of 10 μg/m3 in PM2.5 and NO2, along with 1 μg/m3 in BC, is associated with mean increases and standard errors of 8.1 (3.98), 8.5 (4.48), and 3.03 (1.22) PSC per day across the four health outcomes, respectively. Seasonally, the post-monsoon period showed predominance due to extensive use of biomass and fossil fuels for heating and cooking in semi-urban regions, leading to an elevated prevalence of decreased lung function (DLF), with 18 passive cigarettes identified as the most significant risk factor among the various outcomes. This study emphasizes the need for population-based monitoring to issue public health advisories that protect vulnerable groups, especially in smaller cities such as Tundla, located in Northern India."

 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the important pollutant groups because of their tremendous emissions and distribution in different environmental media. This study presented comprehensive PAH concentrations from olive leaves and ambient air samples collected over one year. The average concentrations of Σ12PAH in olive leaves and ambient air were 565 ± 402 ng/g DW and 22.4 ± 3.4 ng/m3, respectively. During warmer months, both leaf and ambient air samples exhibited reduced PAH concentrations. The leaf exchange is essential for understanding the accumulation of organic pollutants in trees. Some models estimate the exchange of pollutants between the air and leaves to understand their transport paths. In this study, eleven different models with various parameters were incorporated into the data. Although the octanol/air partition coefficient (KOA) was found to be the most influential parameter in the employed models, the physical and chemical parameters of the plant, including moisture, air, and lipid content, were effective in the partition. The leaf/air partition coefficient (KLA) was used to determine the direction of PAH movement. Calculated logKLA values in the models ranged from 5.5 to 14. PAH compounds with log KOA values less than 10 showed a similar trend and were close to each other for all models evaluated in this study. However, PAHs with logKOA>10 yielded scattered results for the applied models. A best-fit model was suggested by using the data obtained in this study.

 Air pollution is one of the major public health issues worldwide. Exposure to air pollution has been linked to various health-related issues, including respiratory and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, although the exact pathophysiological mechanism remains elusive. The main focus of this study was to investigate the association between inflammatory and oxidative stress responses to indoor air pollution exposure. This study investigated the effect of indoor pollutants generated from biomass burning on biomarkers (i.e., Clara cell protein (CC16), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and 8-hydrox-2′-deoxyguanosine [8-OHdG]). One hundred healthy rural women aged 25–65 were recruited to investigate their cardiopulmonary health, blood biomarkers, and pollution status inside their kitchen rooms. Pollutant concentrations were monitored indoors with the time-activity of carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5, PM1), total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs), and formaldehyde (HCHO). Serum samples were analyzed for biomarkers using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) to ensure precise measurements and enhanced sensitivity. Study results revealed higher particulate and gaseous pollutant concentrations in kitchen rooms of biomass users (p < 0.001). In unadjusted analysis, baseline serum levels of CRP (7.96 vs. 1.68 mg/L; p < 0.001), IL-8 (51.26 vs. 9.56 pg/mL; p < 0.001), 8-OHdG (71.74 vs. 26.23 ng/mL; p < 0.001) and LDH (335.1 vs. 227.65 U/L; p < 0.001) were increased in biomass-exposed vs. clean fuel users, respectively, whereas serum levels of CC16 (4846.68 ± 832.37 pg/mL; p < 0.001) were decreased. Study results revealed that particulate matter has strong positive correlations with CRP and IL-8 and a negative association with CC16 among biomass users. These findings suggest that chronic exposure to indoor pollutants may be associated with differences in markers of inflammation, lung epithelial injury, and oxidative DNA damage among tribal women. Further, this study may help explain abnormal cardiovascular and respiratory complications among rural tribal biomass fuel users."

 ObjectiveThis study aimed to assess indoor NO2 and SO2 levels in selected clinical and hospital dental units, identify sources linked to dental activities, and evaluate site and health risks from these gaseous oxides for students, professionals and patients, including immunocompromised.MethodTen different hospitals and clinical dental units were selected for this assessment.Key findingsAnnual average of 14.5 ± 4.6 μg/m3 of NO2 and 8.0 ± 1.7 μg/m3 of SO2 were recorded. A significant difference (<0.05) in NO2 and SO2 levels was found, while non-significant differences (>0.05) were observed between hospital and clinical units. Winter was more polluted due to higher gas levels, while spring was cleaner. Dunn's test showed a significant seasonal trend. Regression analysis revealed a robust (R2 = 0.9) to moderately strong (R2 = 0.6) correlation between the concentration of NO2 and SO2 except during winter (R2 = 0.4). The highest levels of nitrogen oxides were found during anesthesia performance, and higher sulfur oxides were observed during dental implantation and impression performance. Negligible site risk was found except during winter. Indvisual HQ-SO2 and HQ-NO2 did not present significant health risks to dentists except for HQ-NO2 to immunocompromised adult patients. Synergistic ΣHQ posed a significant HQ risk to immunocompromised patients at most dental units, but to adults at a few clinical sites.ConclusionIndoor and outdoor sources of pollutants should be closely monitored and controlled for patient safety and long-term exposure to dentists.

 Understanding the formation and growth of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) from chemical reactions requires detailed knowledge of reaction products and their formation pathways. In this study, we investigated the reaction mechanisms and kinetics of chlorine-initiated trans-2-pentenal (T2P) reactions, including the decomposition of key intermediates and complexes, using the M06-2X/6-311+G(2df,2p) and CBS-QB3 computational methods. Thermodynamic and kinetic parameters were computed at the M06-2X level of theory, enabling the prediction of thermochemical properties for T2P, chlorine atoms, and the reaction products. For selected pathways, rate constants were determined over a temperature range of 300–3000 K at atmospheric pressure using conventional transition-state theory (CTST) and Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus (RRKM) theory. At room temperature, the P2, P3, and P6 adducts emerged as the dominant kinetic products, with calculated rate constants aligning well with experimental data. At room temperature (300 K), the main kinetic products identified were P2 (CH3CH2CH(Cl)CHCHO), P3 (CH3CHCHCHCHO + HCl), and P6 (CH2CH2CHCHCHO + HCl). The calculated rate constants for these products were 2.91 × 10−10, 1.71 × 10−10, and 2.78 × 10−10 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 for P2, P3, and P6, respectively, which agree well with experimental observations. Dynamic modeling showed that these adducts contribute significantly to SOA formation, with particle growth up to 50 μg m−3 within 1 h at 300 K. Additionally, volatility trends of the products were analyzed to understand their atmospheric persistence and contribution to aerosol mass. Finally, leveraging insights from dynamic studies, we examined SOA formation from the relevant adducts, observing growth within 1 h at 300 K. We also discuss SOA formation in the context of volatility and its broader atmospheric implications."

 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a large class of pollutants widely present in the environment and are the earliest discovered and studied carcinogens.The oxidation of PAHs can generate oxygenated PAHs (OPAHs) and nitrated PAHs (NPAHs), which are key precursors for the formation of SOA. However, the formation mechanism of OPAHs and NPAHs are unclear. Fluorene (FLN) is one of the most abundant PAHs discovered, and several studies have been conducted on the reaction of FLN. In this article, we investigated the oxidation mechanism of FLN initiated by OH radicals through high level quantum chemistry and chemical kinetics calculations. The oxidation starts by forming adducts FLN-n-OH (FLNn in short, n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11) which then react with O2 and NO2 in the atmosphere. When the overall reaction rate coefficient of FLNn with O2 are slow, FLNn mainly react with NO2 to form n-nitrofluorene in the atmosphere. Effective reaction rates of FLN1 with O2 in the atmosphere are fast at of ∼1.90 × 104 s−1, suggesting the negligible reaction between FLN1 adduct and NO2. Therefore, the main fate of FLN1 is reaction with O2 followed by subsequent unimolecular isomerization routes, forming OPAHs only. The rate coefficient for reaction of FLN2, FLN4 and FLN10 with O2 are obtained at of 7.44, 26.4 and 1.07 s−1, respectively, suggesting the likely formation of 2-nitrofluorene 4-nitrofluorene and 10-nitrofluorene. In addition, the hydrogen atom abstraction from FLN and the generation of alkoxy groups from FLNn-i-OO resulted in formation of unsaturated compounds, which subsequently reacted with O2 to form a large number of unsaturated oxygen-containing compounds and further transform to highly oxidized products."

 As a part of Michigan's efforts to identify and address per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) contamination statewide, more knowledge of atmospheric PFAS concentrations is needed to better understand their atmospheric transport and impact on other environmental media. This research aimed to measure atmospheric concentrations of PFAS in Michigan's ambient air using low-cost and easy-to-use passive samplers and identify relationships with environmental factors. Passive samplers, consisting of polyurethane foam (PUF) discs and sorbent-filled polyethylene tubes (radiello-XAD samplers), were deployed for a month at 27 sites across Michigan and analyzed for both ionic and volatile, neutral PFAS. Short chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), specifically perfluoropropanoic acid (PFPrA) (d.f. 60 %) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) (d.f. 96 %), and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) (d.f. 63 %) were the most frequently detected compounds, with the ∑3PFAS ranging from non-detect to 15.5 pg/m3 for the PUFs and from non-detect to 248 pg/m3 in the radiello-XAD samplers. 6:2 fluorotelomer alcohol was also frequently detected (d.f. 45 %) and had a positive correlation with both population density (r = 0.52, p < .05) and industrial sites' density (r = 0.48, p < .05). Detection of specific compounds on each type of sampler provided insight into the preferential transport pathway of atmospheric PFAS. For example, PFOS was observed mostly in the gas-phase, predominantly captured by the radiello-XAD samplers, while PFBA was mostly in the particle-phase, predominantly captured by the PUFs.

 To investigate the combustion characteristics of diesel/methanol in the engine cylinder, this study developed a chemical kinetics model for the diesel/methanol (DM) dual-fuel mechanism, comprising 288 reactions and 101 species. The simplified DM mechanism was optimized by adjusting the rate parameters of key reactions, combined with a sensitivity evaluation system for ignition delay time (IDT) and laminar flame speed (LFS). The model's predictions for IDT, LFS, and the concentrations of key species were verified experimentally using a zero-dimensional model. The effects of methanol substitution rate, and altitude on the formation of aldehyde pollutants were systematically analyzed. The results show that the DM mechanism can accurately predict the IDT, LFS, and the formation of key species for a single fuel within the temperature range of 318 K–2000 K, equivalence ratio range of 0.5–2.0, and pressure range of 0.1 MPa–2 MPa. Compared with existing mechanisms, the DM mechanism significantly improves prediction accuracy for these parameters, with R2 values greater than 0.96 and RMSE values below 0.05, demonstrating higher accuracy and consistency. Furthermore, increasing the methanol substitution rate significantly reduces CH2O emissions, while altitude lead to a marked increase in CH2O and CH3CHO emissions.

 This study employs the Greenhouse gas – Air pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) model to analyse air pollution in Bathinda, Delhi, and Kanpur within the Indo-Gangetic Plain of South Asia, contrasting a Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario with a Residential (RES) scenario that advocates for cleaner household energy use. It highlights the issue of ambient PM2.5 levels exceeding India's National Ambient Air Quality Standards, a common challenge in urban areas worldwide. The RES scenario's transition to cleaner fuels, including Liquefied Petroleum Gas, biogas, and renewable sources, forecasts significant emission reductions: a 26.76 % decrease in PM2.5 and a 10.67 % reduction in SO2 emissions. This adjustment leads to a 16.14 % improvement in average PM2.5 exposure, from 90.62 to 75.99 μg/m3, potentially preventing nearly one-third of premature deaths due to air pollution. By quantitatively evaluating residential emission control strategies and their health impacts using the GAINS model, this study offers a replicable framework for clean air planning in highly polluted regions. The Indo-Gangetic Plain case study provides transferable insights into sustainable energy transitions, supporting global air quality strategies.

 Most of Earth's surface energy is from the Sun, and changes in surface solar radiation (SSR) profoundly affect the global climate. However, SSR exhibits serious simulation biases in climate models, severely hindering their projections and renewable energy resource assessments. Our analysis reveals that Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models systematically underestimate amplitudes of annual mean land SSR variations across the Northern Hemisphere (NH), exhibiting standard deviations of merely 0.7–1.2 W/m2 and underestimation rates reaching 20 %–50 % in annual mean SSR over the NH. Moreover, the Multi-Model Ensemble (MME) fail to reproduce the “dimming-brightening” transition seen in observational SSR records in the late 20th century. To resolve this issue, we propose a Hierarchical Emergent Constraint (HEC) framework based on the globally-benchmarked SSR dataset (SSRIH20CR) to systematically quantify model biases over the NH. Globally, the application of the HEC framework substantially reduces the magnitude of projected SSR increases and decreases across multiple emission scenarios. The projected uncertainty range accounts for approximately 85 % of the uncertainty from unconstrained SSR simulations. Regionally, although moderate SSR declines are projected to occur in Central Africa, the North American west coast, Asian Russia, and central China, more severe reductions dominate in South Asia, Europe, and most African regions. The HEC-corrected MME demonstrates a significant reduction in absolute bias relative to unconstrained SSR simulations (up to 0.26 W/m2), effectively constraining the propagation of such biases. Importantly, by applying the HEC, we enhance projection reliability through both a ∼ 15 % reduction in SSR projection uncertainty and a curbed declining trend that mitigates the “hot model” bias. This enhancement in SSR projections provides more reliable inputs for estimating solar energy yield. Consequently, it significantly improves the reliability of photovoltaic infrastructure planning for both site selection and capacity."

 This study presents year-round observations of eleven atmospheric volatile phenolic compounds (VPCs) in Beijing (2023–2024) using high-frequency sampling and an optimized UPLC method. VPCs exhibited clear seasonal variability, with wintertime concentration peaks largely driven by background accumulation, while ΔCF analysis revealed true source- or chemistry-driven enhancements in specific species (e.g., phenol in autumn, 4-chlorophenol in summer). Phenol and cresols dominated ozone formation potential (OFP, 43 %) and OH radical loss rate (LOH, 37 %), respectively, with reactivity strongest in spring, underscoring their central role in photochemistry. Health risk assessment indicated that children faced 2.8 times higher exposure risk than adults, with nitrophenols and chlorophenols as the major contributors. Potential source contribution function (PSCF) analysis identified both local anthropogenic emissions and regional transport from southern Hebei and Shandong as key sources. A springtime case study of high-pollution episodes further showed that stagnant meteorological conditions and strong emissions (traffic exhaust, pesticide volatilization) led to sharp VPC accumulation and enhanced secondary transformations, amplifying ozone and SOA formation. By integrating ΔCF diagnostics, OFP/LOH reactivity, PSCF attribution, and episode-based analysis, this study highlights the underestimated yet critical role of VPCs in urban air pollution and provides actionable evidence for joint O3–PM2.5 control strategies."

 This study investigated the impact of precipitation intensity (PI) on the near-surface wind characteristics during Super Typhoon Lekima (2019), through field measurements using two Doppler Wind Lidars at Zhoushan and Taizhou, China. Four theoretical wind profile models were evaluated in different atmospheric stratifications and PI, and PI- induced variations in turbulence intensity, gust factor, and wind spectrum were quantified. The results show that the strong wind exceeding 20 m/s predominantly occurred at the level of rainstorm and above (PI >12 mm/h), confirming that strong winds coincide with heavy rainfall in typhoon conditions. The Deaves-Harris model achieved best agreement with measured wind profiles under all atmospheric stability conditions (correlation coefficient > 0.97 and RMSE <0.6 m/s). Power law and log law models remained valid to describe the mean wind profile below 250 m for PI <600 mm/h. Wind power exponent (α) and turbulence intensity initially decreased then increased with increasing PI, whereas gust factors exhibited more stable trends. Although turbulence intensity and gust factor were linearly correlated, conventional power law model failed to describe their vertical profiles in heavy rainstorms (PI = 30–90 mm/h). Longitudinal wind spectra showed close agreement with the von Kármán spectrum at low frequencies (<0.1 Hz) across various PI conditions. However, the von Kármán spectrum failed to adequately represent the lateral wind spectrum, particularly in heavy rain (PI = 6–12 mm/h) conditions. This study provides a theoretical basis for optimizing the wind-resistant design of coastal structures under typhoon wind-rain coupled conditions."

 This study presents the development and assessment of a real-time rainfall quality control algorithm tailored for the MESO-scale rain gauge NETwork (MESONET) over Mumbai region in India. The initiative addresses the pressing demand for reliable, high-density Automatic Rain Gauge (ARG) data essential for monitoring urban rainfall patterns in extreme weather-prone regions such as Mumbai. The National Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) deployed a real-time system to assign quality flags to individual rain gauges, ensuring data accuracy and reliability. An operational demonstration of monsoon rainfall monitoring from 2020 to 2025 demonstrated significant coastal-to-inland variations, underscoring the network's efficacy in detecting extreme rainfall events. The study also integrated GPM-IMERG satellite rainfall observations with quality-controlled MESONET data to produce a high-resolution gridded rainfall dataset. This innovative dataset offers enhanced insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of rainfall, providing a robust foundation for analysing extreme rainfall events with greater precision. By improving the quality and interpretation of rainfall data, this work contributes to better-informed decision-making processes and supports the formulation of mitigation strategies for urban centers like Mumbai, which are increasingly vulnerable to severe weather events. Overall, the findings emphasize the critical role of accurate and timely rainfall data in addressing urban challenges posed by extreme weather, enhancing resilience, and fostering sustainable urban planning. The methodological framework leverages established approaches but adapts them to the unique operational challenges of Mumbai's high-density urban rain gauge network. The novelty lies in customizing and implementing these methods for near real-time integration across multi-agency datasets, ensuring spatial and temporal coherence in one of the world's most complex urban rainfall environments. This operational adaptation, coupled with rigorous multi-source validation, offers a transferable model for other megacities facing similar hydrometeorological risks."

 Heatwaves are multidimensional phenomena characterized by interacting attributes such as intensity, duration, frequency, and spatial extent. Most existing composite indices assume complete compensability among indicators, overlooking the imbalance between them and potentially misrepresenting heatwave magnitude. Here, we propose a Comprehensive Heatwave Magnitude Index (CHMI) that integrates Group Utility and Equilibrium Utility to jointly quantify both aggregate impact and indicator equilibrium. The CHMI introduces a reward-penalty mechanism that adjusts for disequilibrium, thereby improving sensitivity to events dominated by a single extreme characteristic. Additionally, on the basis of differences in indicator levels, we classify the heatwave magnitude into low-magnitude and high-magnitude categories, with a more detailed classification for the high-magnitude category. Using datasets from two contrasting climate regions—the arid Xinjiang (dry heatwaves) and the humid middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (wet heatwaves)—CHMI was validated at both grid and regional scales. Results show that high-magnitude heatwaves exhibit greater disequilibrium, and the spatial manifestation of disequilibrium varies systematically between dry and wet regimes: high-intensity events dominate in Xinjiang, whereas long-duration events prevail in the Yangtze region. By explicitly incorporating equilibrium into the quantification framework, CHMI offers a more balanced and comprehensive metric for evaluating heatwave magnitude, improving its applicability for regional analysis and comparative studies."

 A multiradar mosaic is a key solution to the insufficient detection range of a single radar. In the traditional grid-preprocessed mosaicking method (GPM), radar polar coordinate data are interpolated into Cartesian grids to compensate for vertically undersampled regions in radar volume scans. However, such interpolation fails to accurately reconstruct the polarization parameters in these regions. Therefore, this study presentss a polar coordinate direct-mosaicking method (PDM) for the high-density radar network in South China, which directly operates on polar coordinate data and avoids initial interpolation. Based on typical precipitation cases from May to August 2021, three key issues in the PDM are addressed: First, horizontal reflectivity (ZH) biases and differential reflectivity (ZDR) offsets are corrected; second, the number of radars in the mosaicking process is evaluated, with five radars determined to be optimal; and third, the weights of different radar data are optimized by considering vertical and horizontal distances, along with the melting layer position. Compared with the GPM, the PDM yields a more accurate representation of the melting layer, with a smaller mean height error (192 m compared with 470 m) and a more realistic estimation of thickness (661 m compared with 1507 m). It also improves the continuity of polarimetric parameters within convective core regions. The case studies indicate that the PDM enables earlier identification of ZDR columns and more accurate estimation of their heights. These results demonstrate that the PDM improves the accuracy of polarization parameter mosaics and offers potential for future applications in cloud microphysics research."

 The Indian-Burma Trough (IBT) can modulate winter precipitation across East and South Asia on various timescales, yet traditional climatological indices fail to capture its synoptic-scale variability. This study defines an event-based frequency index by objectively identifying the individual IBT events from 1981 to 2019, revealing an average of 18.3 events per winter that originate over the northern Bay of Bengal and propagate eastward along the subtropical westerlies. The interannual variability of IBT frequency is closely linked to a tripole pattern of the tropical Indo-Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA), showing significant positive correlations with the SSTAs in tropical western Indian Ocean and central-eastern Pacific Ocean, and a negative correlation with the equatorial SSTAs east of the Philippines. This SST configuration modulates IBT frequency through dual pathways. (1) Tripole-organized Walker circulation suppresses convection near the Maritime Continent, triggering a northern Indian Ocean anticyclone that enhances westerlies and cyclonic vorticity over the Bay of Bengal for IBT occurrence. (2) SST-induced meridional thermal contrasts between the tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean, particularly the Indian Ocean, and the Tibetan Plateau regulate IBT formation via thermal wind-topography interactions."

 The southwesterly flow (SW) is a synoptic-scale strong wind system that transports warm, moist air toward Taiwan and plays a crucial role in Taiwan's precipitation during the mei-yu season (May 15–June 15). Using ERA5 data (fifth-generation reanalysis from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) and rainfall observations from surface weather stations in Taiwan, this study examines the flow and rainfall characteristics of prolonged SW (PSW) cases and their relationship with extreme precipitation events around southern Taiwan during the 1979–2022 mei-yu seasons. Statistical analysis reveals a strong co-occurrence between PSW and persistent heavy rainfall (PHR), with 75 % of PHR cases occurring during PSW and 60 % of PSW cases featuring PHR. Furthermore, 83 % of R99.9 events (the 99.9th percentile rainfall intensity) are associated with PSW. Composite analysis demonstrates that the formation and maintenance of PSW involve specific synoptic-scale flow patterns: a slight eastward migration of the western North Pacific subtropical high, sustained intensity of the South Asian high, and persistent low-pressure systems over East Asia. These pressure patterns collectively establish sustained southwesterly winds, leading to significant wind speed intensification and moisture accumulation around Taiwan over an extended period (84–126 h). These findings highlight the crucial role of synoptic-scale pressure patterns in maintaining PSW and facilitating PHR occurrence, offering quantitative criteria for forecasting PSW during the mei-yu season."

 Overshooting tops (OTs) are informative indicators of convective storm intensity and are widely utilized in meteorological analyses. This study presents an automated algorithm for OT detection and OT height estimation using convolutional neural networks applied to visible satellite imagery. The models are trained and validated on an extensive OT dataset comprising approximately 10,000 manually detected cases over Europe. The OTs were identified from high-resolution visible (HRV) channel of the SEVIRI instrument on board the MSG geostationary satellite, with the heights determined from the length of their shadows in the imagery. While conventional OT detection methods primarily rely on the identification of cold features in thermal infrared channels, our approach extracts information from visible channels, leveraging the ground truth data on OT shadow length provided by the training dataset. In the morning and afternoon hours, when the shadows are visible, the proposed models detect OTs with a probability of detection reaching 97% and estimate their height with an average error of 0.25 km. The performance is expected to further improve once the model is applied to polar and new generation geostationary satellites with increased spatial resolution."

 The physical mechanisms underlying sea-breeze (SB) conditions in the Palma basin (Mallorca island, western Mediterranean Sea) are analyzed using the Copernicus European Regional Reanalysis (CERRA) model outputs from 2009–2020. In this complex terrain region, SB is strongly influenced by the upslope winds generated at the mountains that close the basin. The comparison of model results with multiple sources of observations (automatic weather stations [AWS], satellite products and radiosondes) shows its ability to reproduce the main SB characteristics.Taking as reference the classification of SB conditions from a previous AWS-based study, a new methodology is now proposed that consists of the application of selecting filters to the CERRA data. The characteristics of the SB events show good agreement with those selected from the AWS. CERRA is able to reproduce the majority of SB patterns: the evolution from land breeze to SB, the cold and moist air advection from the sea during the steady state, the height and intensity of the SB maximum, the importance of the soil moisture and the horizontal and vertical temperature differences. CERRA has difficulties in reproducing SB events which are strongly conditioned by the topography of the basin, due to the insufficient spatial resolution to include the effect of surface heterogeneities, as is the case for upslope winds. However, this method is applicable to other complex terrain regions, and CERRA presents itself as a very useful tool for the study of the physical mechanisms that occur under SB conditions."

 Extreme precipitation events are among the most damaging hydroclimatic hazards, particularly in monsoon-dominated, topographically complex, and data-scarce regions of South Asia. Despite advances in global and regional climate modeling, accurate simulations of such extreme events remain challenging due to the nonlinear interactions between deep convection, orography, and large-scale circulation. This study evaluates the performance of the Regional Climate Model RegCM5, developed by the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), and reproduces two severe monsoon-driven precipitation events: July 2010 and August 2022. High-resolution simulations were conducted using convection-permitting (3 km) non-hydrostatic cores (MOLOCH and MM5) and are compared with coarser hydrostatic (12 km, MM4) simulations employing parameterized convection. Model outputs were validated against ERA5 and ERA5-Land reanalysis, satellite-based GPM precipitation, the Gloh2 ensemble product, and in-situ observations. Results indicate that the 3 km MOLOCH configuration significantly improves the simulation of precipitation intensity, spatial distribution, and temporal variability relative to hydrostatic runs. Notably, RegCM5-MOLOCH effectively captures the 500 hPa geopotential height patterns associated with the extreme event of the 2010 Russian blocking ridge, underscoring its utility in resolving key synoptic drivers.RegCM5-MOLOCH reproduces the large-scale moisture transport while capturing terrain-induced convergence along the Sulaiman mountain ranges of Balochistan. Diagnostics of Moisture Flux Convergence (MFC) and Integrated Vapor Transport (IVT) further reveal strong southwesterly moisture inflow from the Arabian Sea converging over Sindh and Balochistan during August 2022, consistent with the flood-affected areas. Furthermore, Spearman rank correlation analysis reveals robust linkages between simulated precipitation and sea surface temperature-related changes in La Niña and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). This highlights the combined influence of large-scale ocean-atmosphere modes on monsoon extremes. Whilst, overall, convection-permitting simulations reduce biases, some persistent wet biases remain, likely due to the unresolved uncertainties in cloud microphysics, land–atmosphere coupling, and moisture transport. These findings enhance the application of high-resolution regional modeling for enhanced flood risk assessment, improved early warning systems, and more effective climate adaptation strategies in monsoon-affected regions."

 Investigating atmospheric boundary layer height (ABLH) holds significant value for the understanding and numerical simulations of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). Based on the 20 years (2003−2022) of radiosonde data and 10 years (2013−2022) of microwave radiometer observations, this study applied two methods to determine the ABLH and comprehensively investigated the ABLH characteristics over Hong Kong, a densely populated subtropical city strongly influenced by tropical cyclones (TC). The analysis includes the interannual and seasonal variability of ABLH, as well as its relationships with atmospheric stability and wind shear exponent (WSE) under both TC and non-tropical cyclone (NTC) conditions. The results indicate higher ABLH in summer and autumn compared to spring and winter, and higher ABLH under weakly unstable boundary layer conditions. Nevertheless, the interannual variation in the ABLH is insignificant. Notably, the relationships between ABLH, atmospheric stability, and WSE exhibit distinct differences under TC and NTC conditions. It is revealed that on NTC days, the ABLH increases with the WSE under neutral or weakly stable stratification, while this increase is not significant during TC days due to turbulence saturation. The findings of this study are expected to enhance the understanding of ABL dynamics and provide scientific insights for wind energy assessment, urban pollutant dispersion modeling, and thermal comfort evaluation."

Vanlalrochana;T. Narayana Rao;V. Jayachandran;S. Satheeshkumar;C. Sudheesh,"Characteristics of cloud base height distribution over a tropical urban region Hyderabad, India","•The monsoon/winter season exhibited the highest/lowest cloud occurrence frequency •Single-layer clouds dominated across all seasons •The Monsoon season exhibited the highest frequency of multi-layer clouds •Clouds occurrences closely followed the PBL evolution and the 0 °C isotherm level •ERA5-derived CBH overestimated (underestimated) low (high)-level clouds 
 Despite playing a crucial role in regulating Earth's radiative balance and driving the hydrological cycle, clouds remain inadequately characterised by both models and observations due to their substantial spatiotemporal variability. In tropical urban environments, cloud characteristics are further complicated by anthropogenic heat, abundance of aerosols, and local atmospheric dynamics. The present study characterises the clouds over an Urban region, Hyderabad, India, by studying the seasonal and diurnal variability of cloud base height (CBH) using long-term Ceilometer observations (July 2019–March 2025). The monsoon season had the highest cloud occurrence frequency (70.5 %), followed by postmonsoon (28.1 %), premonsoon (12.5 %), and winter (7.8 %). Single-layer clouds dominated (≈ 67.8 %) irrespective of seasons, and the multi-layer clouds were more prevalent during the monsoon. Most clouds occurred below 2 km, with noticeable bimodal distributions during the monsoon and premonsoon seasons. While the primary mode at 1–2 km is closely linked to the planetary boundary layer (PBL) height, the second prominent cloud vertical mode is associated with the 0 °C isotherm level. The diurnal variation of primary cloud mode closely follows the PBL evolution, especially during the monsoon and postmonsoon seasons. The cloud occurrence frequency also shows a strong diurnal cycle with high occurrence of clouds during the daytime in all the seasons, probably associated with daytime heating by insolation. The efficacy of reanalysis datasets in producing accurate cloud characteristics is assessed by comparing ERA5 products with long-term statistics obtained in the present study. It is noted that ERA5-derived CBH overestimates (underestimates) low (high)-level clouds."

 On 21 July 2021, extreme rainfall hit central and northern Henan, China, with Xinxiang recording an hourly rainfall of 149.9 mm and 10-h accumulations exceeding 400 mm (the 7.21 Xinxiang rainstorm). This rainstorm, a critical episode in the “21·7” Henan rainstorm event occurring one day after the high-impact 7.20 Zhengzhou rainstorm, was triggered by the development and merger of two meso-β-scale convective systems (NMCS and SMCS). Using convection-permitting ensemble simulations and targeted data assimilation, this study first examines the roles of key mid-to-lower tropospheric synoptic systems (which influenced the 7.20 Zhengzhou rainstorm) in the subsequent 7.21 Xinxiang rainstorm, then identifies and verifies critical mesoscale factors governing the two MCSs' development and merger. Results indicate that a mid-level low-pressure system (corresponding to a lower-level trough) and a high-pressure ridge extending from the southwestern periphery of the western Pacific subtropical high were critically important synoptic-scale systems influencing both consecutive rainstorm events. For the 7.21 Xinxiang rainstorm, the low primarily governed the total precipitation amount, while the ridge mainly influenced the rainfall spatial pattern in central Henan by modulating the SMCS organization. Furthermore, two mesoscale shear lines are found to drive convection evolution. One, formed by the near-surface southeasterly flow ahead of the trough turning into a northeasterly barrier flow parallel to the terrain, influenced the southern tip of the NMCS. The other, from converging ridge-edge southwesterlies and southeasterlies, drove SMCS development. Radar radial velocity assimilation confirms that refining these pivotal shear lines can enhance convective and quantitative precipitation forecasts."

 Ascent–Drift–Descent Radiosonde System (ADDRS), China's independently developed third-generation radiosonde system, employs navigation satellite (Beidou and GPS) positioning technology to enhance the accuracy and reliability of wind measurements. Meanwhile, by using double sounding balloons nested inside and outside, it can conduct the three-phase observation of ascent–drift–descent, thereby achieving two vertical profiles and one stratospheric trajectory by releasing sounding balloons only once. Based on the data from the ADDRS GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) wind-finding radiosonde (hereafter ADDRS radiosonde) during the ascent and descent phases from field experiments conducted in Inner Mongolia and Guangdong Province, this study compared the observation-minus-analysis (O−A) statistics between the radiosonde data and the fifth generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis (ERA5) dataset. Furthermore, the data were assessed according to the uncertainty specified in the Observing Systems Capability Analysis and Review Tool (OSCAR) requirements, which are derived from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Rolling Review of Requirements (RRR) for upper-air measurements. Meanwhile, the operational L-band radar wind-finding radiosonde (hereafter L-band radiosonde) data at the same stations were taken as a reference. The results show that the wind components at all levels, as well as the temperature during nighttime, can be used directly. By contrast, it is recommended that positive bias corrections be applied to the temperature in the lower stratosphere in the ascent phase during daytime and the relative humidity at upper levels; while negative bias corrections be applied to the temperature at all levels in the descent phase during daytime and the relative humidity across the lower to middle troposphere, prior to distribution on the Global Telecommunication System (GTS) to increase their utility. Except for the relative humidity between 800 and 550 hPa, all other variables from the ADDRS radiosonde data perform better than the threshold values of OSCAR requirements uncertainty, demonstrating their suitability for numerical weather prediction (NWP) application. The wind components at all levels and the temperature below 100 hPa achieve the breakthrough values, indicating potential improvements for NWP performance."

 Accurate representation of nitrous acid (HONO) chemistry is critical for modeling atmospheric oxidation capacity and secondary pollutants like ozone (O3) in China, yet current air quality models systematically underestimate HONO. To address this deficiency in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, we integrated five additional heterogeneous reactions: heterogeneous NO2 reactions on ground/aerosol surfaces, particulate nitrate photolysis, NOx oxidation, and acid displacement reactions. These updates were evaluated against wintertime HONO observations from the Lin'an Regional Atmospheric Background Station (LABS) in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). The revised model reduced HONO underestimation dramatically, improving normalized mean bias from −90.0 % to −34.4 %. The simulation results demonstrated that ground-surface heterogeneous reactions dominated overall HONO production (45.4 %), peaking at night (65.3 %), while daytime formation was primarily driven by acid displacement (53.3 %). The enhanced HONO simulation amplified atmospheric oxidation capacity, increasing hydroxyl (OH) and hydroperoxyl (HO2) radical concentrations by 87.6 % and 172.6 %, respectively. Consequently, O3 peak simulations improved by 6.0–17.0 %, significantly reducing model bias (NMB: −8.9 % to −2.0 %) and better capturing pollution episodes. The model's enhanced representation of HONO formation significantly reduced the discrepancy between simulated and observed data, underscoring the critical importance of comprehending and accurately modeling HONO in the study of secondary pollution."

 The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is a climate-sensitive region with profound implications for the atmospheric water cycle in both Asia and the globe. While global warming has increased precipitation and atmospheric water-holding capacity, energy constraints prevent a proportional relationship between atmospheric water content and global mean precipitation changes. In this study, we utilized multi-source precipitation datasets (ERA5-Land, CPC, CRU, CMAP, GPCP) and atmospheric water flux data (ERA5) to investigate the conversion of atmospheric water to precipitation, a fundamental water cycle process, across the QTP and its surrounding regions from 1979 to 2020 using the Capturability of Atmospheric Water (CAW) index. Our findings reveal a dipole evolution pattern in CAW, with strengthening in the north and weakening in the south. The QTP, a positive mismatch region with limited atmospheric water but efficient precipitation conversion, is highly sensitive to climate change. The evolution of CAW is driven by meteorological factors, with cloud cover and actual evapotranspiration enhancing CAW in the northeastern QTP, while potential evapotranspiration weakens CAW in the southeastern QTP. On a larger scale, CAW evolution is modulated by large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns, where the East Asian summer monsoon enhances CAW in the northeast, while the South Asian summer monsoon weakens CAW in the southeast. Additionally, a qualitative assessment of atmospheric water resource potential, integrating CAW and water vapor transport flux, identifies four distinct development models. These findings provide critical insights for water resource management and climate adaptation strategies in the QTP."
