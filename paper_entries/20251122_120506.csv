A new generation geostationary satellite, Himawari-8/9, and onboard sensor, the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI), enables hyper-temporal vegetation monitoring in this cloud-prone region. However, AHI’s fixed viewing geometry varies spatially, making consistent vegetation monitoring challenging across a wide area at a seasonal scale. This study evaluated four different sun-target-sensor geometry conditions using two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) to achieve near-uniform geometry and enhance the ability to monitor vegetation activities: (i) nadir condition, which used nadir viewing and solar geometry at local solar noon; (ii) local solar noon (LSN) condition, which used pixel-by-pixel fixed viewing and solar geometry at local solar noon; (iii) temporally-constant scattering angle (T-CSA) condition, which used pixel-by-pixel fixed viewing and solar geometry corresponding to the scattering angle which meets the criterion (Gao et al 2024 Remote Sens. Environ.315 114407); and (iv) spatially-constant scattering angle (S-CSA) condition, which used pixel-by-pixel fixed viewing and solar geometry corresponding to a uniform scattering angle of 140°. Among these, the S-CSA condition most effectively mitigated angular artifacts. The derived EVI2 showed higher correlations with tower-based gross primary productivity (GPP), indicating it better captured seasonal variations in vegetation activity. It also demonstrated spatially consistent temporal variations, least affected by AHI’s unique observation geometry. Applying a near-uniform sun-target-sensor geometry based on the S-CSA condition improves monitoring capability in Southeast Asia and enhances our understanding of vegetation dynamics."

Despite discussions of decarbonization potential at the regional level, plant-specific co-benefits and technologically driven pathways remain unclear. Here, we integrate detailed data from 329 individual Chinese coking plants—characterizing their location, capacity, technology, and age—with national carbon neutrality scenarios to develop optimized, multi-criteria retirement pathways. Plants mainly located in Shanxi are first phased out before 2030 in a business-as-usual scenario, while retirements are proportional across provinces in the low coke production scenario. Considerable co-benefits are observed, 53.4%–57.1% of water saving and emission mitigation toward 2060. Trade-offs exist due to ascending coal use if there is higher technical penetration of dry quenching. Our analysis quantifies the distinct contributions of demand reduction (driven by steel industry transformation) and structural efficiency improvements within the coking sector itself. These results provide the first granular, data-driven roadmap for managing China’s critical coking transition, offering crucial insights for maximizing environmental gains during industrial decarbonization globally."

The eastern Himalayan Brahmaputra basin is a critical hotspot of this integrated risk. However, a basin-wide quantification of the individual contributions of these drivers to flood exposure has been lacking. Here, we employ a calibrated coupled hydrological–hydraulic model to provide the first comprehensive assessment. We show that meltwater (snow and glacier melt) contributions to annual maximum floods increase with altitude. At the basin scale, meltwater amplifies population and gross domestic product (GDP) exposure to flooding by 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively. This amplification rises dramatically to 27.9% for population and 33.3% for GDP in high-altitude regions (⩾2000 m). Rainfall-derived discharge constitutes the dominant source of flood exposure, followed by meltwater; GLOFs present the least contribution. Nonetheless, GLOFs increase basin-wide population and GDP exposure by 1.2% and 1.3%, and notably intensify to 31.1% and 33.5% above 2000 m. Our findings deliver critical insights for developing targeted flood management strategies in the Brahmaputra basin."

However, many less-developed countries and regions face economic constraints and often suffer from severe ecosystem degradation, which jointly hinder their ability to meet these commitments. Here, we use the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP), a less-developed region that has experienced ecosystem degradation, as a case study. We use a novel multi-scenario modeling framework to assess the impact of different combinations of natural climate solutions (NCS) and carbon emission reduction policies (CERPs) on carbon neutrality and associated costs. Our findings show that carbon neutrality was achieved on the QTP by 2020, with a surplus of 18.16 MtCO2 yr−1. However, without CERPs, carbon emissions on the QTP are projected to increase fivefold by 2060 compared with 2020 levels. Even with stringent NCS, a shortfall of nearly 375.34 ± 99.05 MtCO2 yr−1 in maintaining carbon neutrality remains in 2060. If CERPs are implemented without NCS, the cost of maintaining carbon neutrality in 2060 is estimated at USD 199.07 ± 25.96 billion during 2020–2060. Notably, integrating NCS with CERPs reduces costs by nearly half (USD 111.51 ± 21.48 billion). Furthermore, the integration of aggressive CERPs and NCS on the QTP could contribute a further additional surplus by 2060 toward national carbon neutrality goals at a pretty low carbon price. Our research highlights that combining NCS with CERPs yields greater climate benefits at significantly lower costs, providing potential pathways for financially constrained regions to enhance climate mitigation, especially when supported by international climate finance and cooperative mechanisms."

We analyzed the fire dynamics and its impact on carbon flux across three fire prone regions in South Asia, Region-1 (southwestern Nepal, Uttarakhand), Region-2 (central India), and Region-3 (northeast India) from 2010 to 2021, with a focus on the significant fire season of February, March, and April (FMA) of 2021. We find high burned areas (5000–10 000 km2), and fire carbon emissions (0.3–4 TgC season–1) across these regions in FMA, 2021, as compared to a climatological mean from 2010–2020. Each of the three regions shows distinct drivers that preceded the fires. In Region-1, snow-induced soil moisture deficits drive fire activity, leading to a subsequent decline in gross primary production . In Region-2, human activities, likely cropland burning, contributed to the forest fire. In Region-3, the scattered distribution of burned areas hints that human activity is the likely cause of the forest fire. During FMA, 2021, fire carbon emission in Region-1 (∼4 TgC) were almost twice of the fossil fuel emissions (∼2.2 TgC), while in Region-2 (∼3.8 TgC), it remained below fossil fuel emissions (∼16 TgC). In both regions, emissions from forests and croplands contributed equally to the total fire carbon emissions. In Region-3, fire carbon emissions exceeded fossil fuel emissions in 2012 (∼4.7 TgC), 2013 (∼6.18 TgC), and 2014 (∼9.75 TgC) but remained lower in 2021 (∼3.37 TgC), with most emissions originating from forests. This analysis highlights the critical role of forest fires in the carbon budget, the ecosystem and the need for better forest carbon management."

Here, we refine the nitrogen cycle representation in a TEM by incorporating free-living and symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) processes along with atmospheric nitrogen deposition effects. Our updated model provides a new assessment of present-day and future global natural ecosystem BNF rates and their spatial distribution. We estimate that present-day (1981–2020) free-living nitrogen fixation (FLNF) contributes to 36 Tg N yr−1, ranging from 33 to 38.5 Tg N yr−1 and SNF is 88 Tg N yr−1 with a range of 80–95 Tg N yr−1, resulting in a total BNF 124 Tg N yr–1, ranging from 112 to 134 Tg N yr−1. Under the SSP5-8.5 warming scenario, our projections indicate that total BNF could increase to 178 Tg N yr−1 by the end of the 21st century. Our model results highlight that the FLNF plays a dominant role in low-temperature environments, and plant functional type emerges as the primary factor for both symbiotic and FLNF pathways, thus precise global vegetation classification is highly necessary for N2 fixation simulation. Our refined model advances global nitrogen cycle modeling and will improve future quantification of both global carbon and nitrogen cycles."

The concept of ‘just transitions,’ which integrates both environmental and social interventions, is essential for advancing climate and poverty reduction objectives. Both climate change impacts and climate action may exacerbate existing inequalities, underscoring the urgency of addressing both environmental and social justice concerns. Equally, developmental aspirations may threaten to aggravate environmentally detrimental patterns. To this end, the paper examines how domestic efforts balance climate and poverty priorities in the governance of the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals. It develops a conceptual framework that links the governance of climate and poverty to justice outcomes within the global political economic context, using the illustrative case of Kenya. Kenya presents a compelling case due to its relevance to the conceptual framework amidst high dependence on climate-sensitive economic sectors; aspirations both to act as a climate leader and reach middle-income status; and its high financial dependence on development partners and transnational capital. By connecting political economy dynamics to justice outcomes, the framework contributes to a deeper understanding of governance efforts that aim to link climate and poverty objectives but do not necessarily deliver a just transition. Through the case of Kenya, the paper illustrates the challenges and opportunities faced by Sub-Saharan African countries in managing the interdependence between climate and poverty reduction objectives, contributing to ongoing debates on just transitions in the global South."

However, the co-evolution dynamics of joint fluvial flood characteristics and their socioeconomic implications under different global warming targets are poorly understood. Here, we combine a deep learning (DL)-constrained hybrid model, a statistical approach and climate models to evaluate future flood occurrence within a bivariate framework (i.e. volume and duration) across 8735 catchments. After evaluating the performance of the DL-constrained hybrid model, we project a doubling of bivariate fluvial flood hazard under 3.0 °C warming. We assess the uncertainty of fluvial flood projections and reveal that the global climate models and coupled factors are the major uncertainty sources. Global warming from 1.5 °C to 3.0 °C tends to amplify flood exposure of gross domestic product, population and agricultural area, by ∼97%, ∼46%, and ∼67% under a medium emission scenario (SSP370), respectively."

However, the long-term variations in GHGs from cropland biomass-burning emissions (CBBEs) remain unclear across the world’s countries. Here, we used satellite observations of CBBE of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), both GHGs, to examine the emission trends from 2003 to 2023 and analyze the causes across 139 agriculture-producing countries. The global CO2 and CH4 emissions from CBBE are decreasing at rates of −8.21 Mt CO2 and −1.55 10−2 Mt CH4 per year, respectively. However, these emissions are increasing significantly (P < 0.05) in eight countries, mainly in South and East Asia. The CBBE was strongly correlated to the human development levels (indicated by the Human Development Index, HDI) of the countries, resulting in overall higher unit area CBBE in low-medium HDI countries and lower unit area CBBE in high-very high HDI countries. In 13 countries, variations in CBBE are associated with changes in the crop residue from productivity. However, there is also a strong variation in CBBE associated with the regulation of agricultural fires, where appropriate agricultural residue management policies have effectively reversed the increasing CBBE trends in some countries."

However, most existing studies have predominantly emphasized direct biophysical effects, namely surface cooling resulting from forest replacement of non-forest cover, while largely overlooking the indirect regulation caused by environmental feedbacks during forest expansion. To address this gap, a dual-pathway analytical framework was proposed to diagnose afforestation-induced changes in land surface temperature (LST). Within this framework, a ‘zero-impact line’ was defined to represent the LST response solely from forest cover conversion, and the indirect effect amplification index (τ) was introduced to quantify the magnitude and direction of indirectly driven LST variation. Results indicated that each 1% increase in forest cover reduced LST by 0.029 °C–0.036 °C through direct effects (DE). In the early stages of forestation, τ reached 187%, 227%, and 242% in Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi, respectively, revealing that indirect feedbacks can equal or exceed DE, thereby amplifying the overall cooling outcome in the subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests of Southwest China."

This study addresses this gap by being the first to apply deep learning-based image segmentation techniques to extract a comprehensive set of land use cover (LUC) information from historical topographic maps at a fine spatial resolution and at a cross-country scale. Specifically, we utilized topographic maps (1:50000) created by the U.S. Army Map Service during the Vietnam War (1963–1973) to create detailed historical LUC maps of Laos and Vietnam. We compared multiple model architectures on the manually labeled training data, with the UNet++ achieving the best performance. The resulting maps, produced at 4 m and 30 m resolutions, include 10 LUC classes and achieved high overall accuracies of 98.8% for Laos and 98.6% for Vietnam on separate test sets. Analysis of the maps revealed forest cover losses of 18.2% in Laos and 25.0% in southern Vietnam (below 17° N) by 1990 and a 36.8% reduction of mangrove forests in Vietnam by 1996. Transitions from forest to shrubland dominated in northern parts of Laos and Vietnam while transitions to cropland were most prevalent in Savannakhet province of Laos and the Southeast region of Vietnam.

In an interconnected global food system, countries rely on both local food production and imports to meet domestic demand. When assessing the impact of drought risk on national food security, however, imported crops are often overlooked. This study incorporates international crop trade information to understand the role of crop imports in the drought risk profile of countries. We focus on conflict-affected countries due to their reliance on food imports, and particular vulnerability to the impacts of drought events and their corresponding cascading effects. We develop a framework to quantify drought risk associated with domestic production and imports of crops (i.e. composite drought risk) by combining gridded drought risk data with crop production and trade for 23 countries. Our findings show that most conflict-affected countries face drought risk primarily through domestic production, as most consumed calories are produced locally. Nevertheless, including crop imports alters the composite drought risk profiles considerably (>10%) in 13 countries, with changes reaching 40%–50% in some cases. Crop imports also carry their own external drought risk, contributing more than 10% of high drought risk in 21 countries and amounting to 80% in some cases. Furthermore, we identify critical trade connections that expose countries to concentrated drought risks from specific trading partners. We demonstrate the need to incorporate both domestic and import-related drought risks in food security assessments, and we suggest potential strategies based on countries’ composite drought risk profiles for drought resilient food security."

The dataset, spanning the years 2000 to 2020, was produced by integrating time-series Landsat imagery and digital elevation model data. The data incorporate SWC measure factors and four terrace types: level terraces, slope terraces, zig terraces, and slope-separated terraces. On average, the SWCTMD achieved OA of 91.7 % and F1 of 83.3 % for terraces, and 89.4 % OA and 78.9 % F1 for different terrace types, underscoring its high accuracy in terrace mapping. Comparative analysis demonstrated the superior robustness of the SWCTMD compared to existing products. This dataset demonstrated that terraces in China are predominantly concentrated in the Loess Plateau, Southwest and Southeast regions. From 2000 to 2020, the total terrace area increased by 41 594.1 km2, with slope terraces exhibiting the largest expansion, while decreases were primarily observed in peri-urban areas. Notably, the modeling results indicated that terraces had reduced soil erosion of cropland by approximately 1390 million tons in 2020. The SWCTMD can be employed to enhance the accuracy of soil erosion simulations and support long-term analysis of soil erosion trends. Furthermore, the dataset provides valuable applications for earth system modelling and contributes to research on land resource management, food security, biodiversity, and water cycle. The SWCTMD is freely available at https://doi.org/10.11888/Terre.tpdc.302400 (Duan, 2025)."

David,Spatially distributed measurements of aerosols and stable isotopes in water vapour and precipitation in coastal Northern Norway during the ISLAS2021 campaign,"During a recent field campaign from 15 to 30 March 2021 at Andenes, Norway, we collected a set of observations that allows to better constrain how clouds and precipitation processes work. Frequent alternations between mid-latitude and arctic weather systems were encountered during the campaign. Our dataset is unique in combining measurements in both vapour and precipitation, aerosols, ice nucleating particles, and was made simultaneously at different elevations at a high latitude location. 
 Precipitation from mixed-phase clouds at high-latitudes is difficult to represent correctly in numerical weather prediction models. Paired water vapour and precipitation isotope measurements provide a constraint on the integrated effect of evaporation and condensation processes, but have rarely been collected in a way that allows to use these for model validation and improvement. Here we present a collection of spatially distributed measurements of water isotopes in the different phases at high time resolution during the ISLAS2021 field campaign over the period 15 to 30 March 2021. The main observational site of this campaign was Andenes, Norway (69.3144°N, 16.1194°E). Isotopic measurements were conducted simultaneously at sea level and a mountain observatory, as well as additional coastal sites at distances of 100 km (Tromsø, Norway) and 1000 km (Bergen, Norway), enabling the assessment of spatial representativeness of vapour isotope measurements. Precipitation samples for water isotope analysis were collected on site at sub-event time resolution, and along a transect across the Lofoten archipelago. These measurements were complemented by a suite of aerosol measurements, including ice-nucleating particles, and additional in-situ and remote sensing observations of meteorological variables. During the two weeks of the ISLAS2021 field campaign, frequent alternations between mid-latitude and arctic weather systems were encountered, providing a range of different cases for more detailed process studies. Our dataset can serve as a test bed for assessing the spatial representativeness and sampling strategies for water isotope measurements on meteorological time scales. Furthermore, we anticipate our data to be useful in various aspects related to cloud microphysics, for example the quantification of riming processes in convective clouds, the role of ice nucleating particles in marine cold-air outbreaks, and on the condensation efficiency of mid-latitude storms."

Hewitt;Laura E. Revell,Description and evaluation of airborne microplastics in the United Kingdom Earth System Model (UKESM1.1) using GLOMAP-mode,"Airborne microplastics are a new air pollutant but are not yet included in most global models. We add them to the UK Earth System Model to show how they move, change, and are removed from air. Smaller microplastics persist for longer and can travel further, even to Antarctica. While their current role in air pollution is small, their presence is expected to grow in future. This work offers a framework to assess future impacts of microplastics on air quality and climate. 
 Airborne microplastics are a recently identified atmospheric aerosol species with potential air quality and climate impacts, yet they are not currently represented in global climate models. Here, we describe the addition of microplastics to the aerosol scheme of the UK Earth System Model (UKESM1.1): the Global Model of Aerosol Processes (GLOMAP). Microplastics are included as both fragments and fibres across a range of aerosol size modes, enabling interaction with existing aerosol processes such as ageing and wet and dry deposition. Simulated microplastics have higher concentrations over land, but can be transported into remote regions including Antarctica despite no assumed emissions from these regions. Lifetimes range between ∼17 d to ∼1 h, with smaller, hydrophilic microplastics having longer lifetimes. Microplastics are present throughout the troposphere, and the smallest particles are simulated to reach the lower stratosphere in small numbers. Dry deposition is the dominant microplastic removal pathway, but greater wet deposition occurs for smaller hydrophilic microplastic, due to interactions with clouds. Although microplastics currently contribute a minor fraction of the total aerosol burden, their concentration is expected to increase in future if plastic production continues to increase, and as existing plastic waste in the environment degrades to form new microplastic. Incorporating microplastics into UKESM1.1 is a key step toward quantifying their current atmospheric impact and offers a framework for simulating future emission scenarios for an assessment of their long term impacts on air quality and climate."

We thus assess various regional model physics configurations in this regard. Finding one optimal configuration is challenging: reliable rainfall rarely coincides with correct radiative heating. Simulations of rainfall however yield more dissensus, suggesting that this variable should be prioritized, for which the best results are obtained with the cumulus convection scheme of Tiedtke. 
 This study evaluates the performance of RegCM5 in simulating air–sea fluxes over Southeast Asia through a set of 36 sensitivity experiments testing different physical scheme combinations. Scheme choices vary across five model aspects: radiative transfer, planetary boundary layer, cumulus convection, parameterized microphysics and cloud fraction. A multi-criteria decision-making framework is applied to rank model configurations based on their ability to reproduce spatiotemporal patterns of sea surface wind, latent and sensible heat fluxes, precipitation, and radiative heat fluxes, using mostly satellite-based reference products. No configuration performs consistently best across all criteria: scores assessing latent and shortwave radiative heat fluxes are generally conflicting, with each other and with the scores for precipitation and sea surface wind which instead tend to agree. The choice of cumulus convection scheme drives the performance in simulating the latter two variables, with Tiedtke outperforming and Kain–Fritsch underperforming. In contrast, the best shortwave radiative heat flux simulations are obtained with MIT cumulus convection, in combination with CCM3 radiative transfer.  Overall, RRTM/UW-PBL/Tiedtke/SUBEX/Xu–Randall – using the same order of model aspects as listed in the beginning – stands out by maintaining relatively high scores across all assessed variables. Nonetheless, a stronger dissensus in precipitation outputs suggests that reliable rainfall patterns may be a higher priority for decision makers, highlighting CCM3/UW-PBL/Tiedtke/NoTo/Xu–Randall and RRTM/Holtslag/Tiedtke/NoTo/Xu–Randall as the best configurations for this variable. Beyond statistics, further analysis reveals key monsoon-related biases: Indian Summer Monsoon rainfall is generally underestimated, Western North Pacific Summer Monsoon features are overestimated and shifted northward, near-equatorial regions exhibit excessive boreal summer rainfall in most Tiedtke experiments, and austral summer monsoonal sea surface wind and precipitation only impact areas directly north of Australia without inducing the rainfall annual maximum observed in that season over equatorial seas. These findings provide a basis for selecting optimal physics in RegCM5 over Southeast Asia and offer guidance for future applications, including air–sea coupled regional climate modeling."

These potentially tsunamigenic seafloor offsets result from coseismic fault slip and deformation beneath or within the accretionary wedge. The mechanics of these shallow rupture phenomena and their dependence on subduction zone properties remain unresolved, partly due to the sparsity of offshore observations of shallow megathrust earthquake deformation. Here, we analyze how offshore structure influences shallow rupture mechanics and slip partitioning using 3D dynamic earthquake simulations of the Cascadia subduction zone (CSZ) megathrust with and without variably dipping seaward‐ or landward‐vergent splay faults in the wedge that sole into the megathrust. Resulting tradeoffs between splay and megathrust slip reveal structural controls on rupture partitioning, with greater splay slip leading to less shallow megathrust slip updip. Gently dipping and seaward‐vergent splays host more slip than those with steeper, landward‐vergent splays. To isolate the underlying mechanisms, we compare models with Andersonian and plunging principal stresses. Results suggest distinct static and dynamic processes control the dip‐ and vergence‐dependence of splay rupture: static (mis)alignment relative to far‐field tectonic loading favors slip on more optimally oriented, shallowly dipping splay faults. In contrast, dynamic stress interactions of an updip‐propagating megathrust rupture front with the free surface and potential branch faults favor forward branching onto seaward‐vergent splays and inhibit backward branching onto landward‐vergent splays. Resulting seafloor displacements suggest splay fault structure may influence coseismic tsunami source processes, highlighting the importance of dynamically viable rupture scenarios in subduction hazard assessments."

This study evaluates global Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) extremeness and climate linkages using GRACE and GRACE‐FO data from 2002 to 2024. By examining upper and lower deciles of TWS anomalies representing wet and dry extremes and assessing spatial dependencies, we identify key patterns, trends, and driving factors through dimensional reduction and probabilistic modeling. Results show global TWS extremes are governed by a 2–3‐year oscillatory cycle linked to El Niño–Southern Oscillation, which synchronizes drought and pluvial conditions across continents. Drought extremes show broader spatial coherence than pluvial events, indicating moisture deficits propagate more uniformly through the land–atmosphere system. A weaker quasi‐decadal cycle (6–10 years) modulates these responses and underlies a shift around 2011–2012. Before 2011, wet extremes intensified, while after 2012, dry extremes became dominant, particularly in interior Asia, western United States, and southern Africa. Neither pluvial nor drought extremes show significant global trends in intensity; however, they remain phase‐locked, with wet events twice as intense as dry ones, reflecting asymmetric hydrologic response to moisture surpluses versus deficits. We probabilistically reconstruct TWS extremeness during satellite data gaps using leading spatio‐temporal patterns. The current record, spanning less than one multidecadal cycle, remains insufficient for robust attribution. Extending satellite gravimetry is essential to refine uncertainty in attributing global pluvial and drought extremes under climate change."

Understanding of past extremes and their meaningfulness for contextualizing future possibilities, especially in the near‐term, is limited by the absence of a global analysis focused on the most extreme humid‐heat‐anomaly events. Here we identify record‐setting humid‐heat days for 216 global regions and assess the likelihood of these records being broken even under present‐day climate forcing. We use several reanalyses as a historical catalogue, and large climate‐model ensembles to represent other statistically plausible events. Unlike the spatial pattern of large temperature anomalies, we find that humid‐heat anomalies are most intense, and most seasonally and interannually concentrated, in the deep tropics and arid subtropics. Many top events have attracted little if any prior attention. The eastern United States is especially susceptible to record‐breaking humid heat due to modest current records (>1% inferred annual exceedance probability) contrasting with numerous simulated large‐anomaly days. Australia and eastern China are also prone to locally exceptional episodes, with >40% of ensemble members simulating events exceeding the ERA5‐based distribution maximum. Model biases for key characteristics, together with the observed record‐setting day affecting its estimated return period by >2.5x in half of regions, underline several valuable aspects of a joint observation/model perspective on humid heat. This approach aids in evaluating the plausibility of as‐yet‐unseen extremes; identifying regions of concern that might otherwise be overlooked and underprepared; and gauging regionally specific correlations between event magnitudes and societal impacts."

The steepness of such slopes is thought to reflect a balance between fault slip and erosion rate. We show that facet dip angles along the Wasatch fault zone (WFZ), USA, positively correlate with fault slip rates, such that relative variations in slip rate can be estimated from facet angle, and that by constraining millennial‐scale facet erosion rates, absolute slip rates can be estimated.

 Ecosystems are not only affected by current climate but are also shaped by antecedent climate through their influences on vegetation growth and environmental conditions. These lagged responses, known as memory effects, can either exacerbate or mitigate the impacts of climate extremes on ecosystem functions. However, the direction, strength and influential duration of memory effects on ecosystem productivity remain poorly understood. Here we implement an interpretable machine-learning framework based on eddy covariance data to model ecosystem gross primary productivity over the period 1995–2020 and further investigate the characteristics of memory effects on positive and negative extremes of ecosystem productivity. Our results show a large contribution from antecedent climate conditions (38.2%) to ecosystem productivity during extremes, with precipitation accounting for 42.2% of the memory effects, followed by temperature (22.1%) and vapour pressure deficit (20.8%). Extreme events conditioned by long-term climatic variations often cause higher productivity losses than short-term extremes, with semi-arid ecosystems exhibiting the largest productivity anomalies and prolonged memory effects. Our results highlight the role of memory effects in regulating carbon flux variations and provide an observation-constrained benchmark for these effects.

 Elastic ceramic aerogels have drawn broad attention for use in aerospace, energy storage, and thermal protection systems, where lightweight structures with thermal stability and mechanical robustness are required. Yet their practical application is often limited by insufficient strength. Achieving both high strength and high elasticity in ceramic nanowire aerogels remains challenging because these properties are typically mutually constrained. Here we design silicon carbide nanowire aerogels reinforced by dual-phase nodes composed of pyrolytic carbon (PyC) and amorphous silica (SiO2) to resolve this conflict. Experimental measurements together with large-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator (LAMMPS) and finite element simulations show that amorphous SiO2 improves load-bearing efficiency by distributing stress uniformly, while PyC relieves local stress concentrations and prevents premature SiO2 fracture, producing a clear synergistic effect. The resulting aerogels exhibit a compressive strength of 10.9 MPa at 80% strain and a resilience of about 90%. This dual-phase strategy provides an effective route to tailor the mechanical response of ceramic aerogels and expand their use in extreme environments such as high temperature, low oxygen, and vacuum conditions, where strength, elasticity, and long-term reliability are required.

 Plant domestication has had profound impacts on the morphology and genetic diversity of crops. Beyond sequence diversity, changes in chromatin structure can play an important role in plant adaptation. However, the interplay between the chromatin landscape and plant domestication remains unclear. Here, we present a high-quality genome assembly and chromatin landscape map of the ancient pseudo-cereal, amaranth. ATAC-sequencing of multiple accessions of three grain amaranth species and two wild relatives, shows that the overall amount of accessible chromatin is highly conserved, but about 2.5% of all chromatin switched states, with a higher fraction of the genome repeatedly opening during domestication processes. These differentially accessible chromatin regions, between the crops and their wild ancestor, are species-specific and significantly associated with selective sweeps - reflecting the repeated independent domestication of amaranth. Our findings reveal the dynamic interplay between domestication and the chromatin landscape, highlighting an additional layer of diversity in crops.

 Plasmon-induced charge generation and separation in metal/semiconductor heterostructures offer a promising platform for hot carrier-based energy conversion applications. A key challenge is understanding ultrafast hot carrier transfer at heterogeneous interfaces, as the details of plasmonic enhanced charge transfer dynamics and accompanying energy relaxation remain unclear. Here, by tracking charge transfer processes across spatial, temporal, and energy domains, we reveal ultrafast, nonthermal electron transfer directly from gold nanoparticles to gallium nitride (GaN) without energy losses from electron-electron scattering. This process facilitates efficient charge separation and produces a nonthermal distribution of transferred electron in GaN—contrasting with substantial energy dissipation typically observed during conventional interfacial charge transport. Furthermore, we demonstrate the pivotal role of light polarization in modulating charge generation and energy distribution, which enables dynamic control of electron relaxation and enhances the possibility of nonthermal electrons surmounting the Schottky barrier for successful injection. These insights pave the way for advancing hot-carrier management and achieving coherent control of non-equilibrium charge behavior across multiple dimensions for solar energy conversion and optoelectronic applications.

 Lithium disilicate glass-ceramics are increasingly utilized in dental applications due to their exceptional optical and aesthetic properties. However, lithium disilicate glass-ceramics possess a mixed crystalline and amorphous structure with variable resistance to external corrosion. Exposure of lithium disilicate glass-ceramics to acidic conditions in the oral cavity leads to pore formation, and the risk of cracking increases with long-term wear.

The TiO2 species play crucial roles in improving acid resistance, and the Al2O3 species, atomically bonded to the TiO2 species in the hybrid layer, promote interfacial interactions. Moreover, the TiO2/Al2O3 hybrid nanolayer shows no cytotoxicity while maintaining the aesthetics of lithium disilicate glass-ceramic restorations, thus offering broad prospects for oral restoration applications.

 Developing next-generation hypersonic vehicles necessitates structural materials capable of withstanding extreme thermal gradients. However, conventional alloys usually sacrifice room-temperature plasticity for breakthroughs in high-temperature strength. Here, we report a (WTaV)90B10 refractory medium-entropy alloy (RMEA) that overcomes this trade-off, showing decent plasticity of ~6% at ambient temperature, high yield strength of 650 MPa at 1873 K and 242 MPa at 2073 K, and excellent thermal stability up to ~0.7 Tm. The RMEA comprises a BCC metallic solid solution and a boride phase. Interfacial segregation of boron atoms generates gradient-ordering phase boundaries (GOPBs), enhancing stress transfer and plastic compatibility. Strong interfacial bonding of GOPBs and the inherent stability of the dual-phase structure further enable remarkable resistance to ultrahigh-temperature softening. At 2073 K, GOPBs evolve into fully coherent interfaces, ensuring exceptional thermal stability at ~0.7 Tm.

 Understanding the health impact of human radiation exposure from tritiated water release is crucial for the management and sustainability of nuclear energy. However, it remains not fully explored owing to the neglect of bioconversion products (organically bound tritium, OBT) along the food chain. Here by evaluating the uptake and chemical transfer of tritium in biota, we show the critical role of algae in rapidly incorporating and transferring tritiated water into OBT, which serves as nutrients for trophic transfer to fish. Notably, the specific retention of OBT in the fish brain, by integrating into biomolecules, potentially disrupts key metabolic reactions. The derived concentration factors and biomagnification factors are instrumental in estimating the internal exposure dose to human individuals, thereby enabling more accurate risk assessments for both planned tritium releases and accidental leakages.

 Riming is one of the key factors influencing the control of phase partitioning and precipitation formation in mixed-phase clouds. The riming growth rate of ice particles is strongly affected by the spatial distributions of liquid and ice particles. However, models often assume particles are homogeneously distributed in a given grid box when modelling riming, and few observational studies have quantified the effect of sub-grid heterogeneous particle distributions on riming. In this study, based on airborne in situ measurements made in isolated mixed-phase cumulus clouds, the impact of heterogeneous particle distribution on riming growth rate (Rrim) is quantified by defining an impact factor Frim, which is calculated using the observed mean Rrim divided by Rrim assuming a homogeneous particle distribution. The results show that Frim varies from ~0 to 2.8, demonstrating that the heterogeneous particle distribution has a strong nonlinear impact on riming. Additionally, it is found that Frim can be parameterized using the homogeneity of liquid-ice mixing and the range of normalized riming rate, which are related to the predictable condensed water content and ice particle concentration, respectively. Moreover, based on simulations driven by observed particle size distributions and assuming a static condition, it is suggested that riming has a significant feedback on Frim. These findings will be beneficial to improve the capability of models in simulating mixed-phased clouds and deepen our understanding of sub-grid scale cloud microphysics."

 Sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies profoundly shape regional precipitation variability, yet their pathways are often obscured by seasonal/monthly mean-state analyses overlooking daily atmospheric dynamics. Focusing on monsoon-affected South China, we show that the rainy-season rainfall interannual variability is primarily driven by shifts in daily circulation regimes rather than rainfall intensity. Objective classification identifies four dominant regimes: two low-pressure system–related types, a pre-onset monsoon regime, and a South China Sea monsoon–dominated regime. Moisture tracking and precipitation decomposition confirm that regime frequency dominates year-to-year rainfall variations. SST anomalies in the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans modulate these frequencies by triggering large-scale atmospheric responses, particularly anomalous cyclones/anticyclones over the western North Pacific. These atmospheric changes alter convection and instability, driving low-pressure activity and monsoon onset. Our findings reveal a regime-mediated mechanism linking remote ocean variability to regional hydroclimate extremes, offering new insights for improving climate prediction and projection under global warming."

 The Southern Ocean Meridional Overturning Circulation (SO MOC) plays a critical role in redistributing heat, carbon and other tracers globally. Despite its importance, substantial inter-model diversity persists in climate model simulations. This study examines mechanisms underlying such diversity using pre-industrial control simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5/6). We find that discrepancies in the upper overturning cell of SO MOC are primarily governed by model-dependent sensitivity to wind stress, rather than differences in wind stress magnitude. Latitudinal position of maximum zonal wind stress, closely linked to the Southern Annular Mode-like mean state, determines sensitivity through both Eulerian and parameterized eddy-induced circulation. For the lower overturning cell, inter-model differences are largely driven by variations in surface buoyancy fluxes—primarily meltwater—and mean ocean stratification, particularly within key Antarctic Bottom Water formation regions.

 To accurately invert the canopy parameters (Total photosynthetic area index, TPAI) of oilseed rape, a microwave characteristic layered measurement experiment was designed, and a multilayer microwave scattering semiempirical model (MLMSSM) was constructed based on the radar response changes induced by the differences in the vertical structure and canopy components at different phenological stages. This model was then applied to the main oilseed rape production areas to conduct regional TPAI inversion. Microwave characteristic layered measurement experiments were performed at six-leaf, flowering, beginning ripening and fully ripening stages of oilseed rape in the laboratory of target microwave properties (LAMP). The MLMSSM was constructed based on the LAMP-measured data, corresponding to different plant structures containing two- and three-layer submodels, and the TPAI inversion model was derived based on the correlation between the MLMSSM parameters and the crop biophysical variables. Finally, regional TPAI inversion and validation were carried out in the main oilseed rape production area (Hengyang), using Sentinel-1 SAR data. Visualization results, MLMSSM parameters and TPAI inversion results based on LAMP data all revealed the occurrence of multiple scattering interactions among distinct oilseed rape structural layers and verified the effectiveness of the measurement scheme and the model.

 Traditional optical satellite geometric positioning methods have certain limitations, including the high costs of calibration field construction, the time required, and significant susceptibility to weather conditions at calibration sites. In the present era of ever-increasing satellite constellation deployments, such conventional methods struggle to meet operational demands. Consequently, self-geolocation technologies are receiving more attention. This paper presents a self-geolocation method that completely eliminates the dependency on ground control points. The method uses images acquired during different orbits as inputs and leverages the geographic positioning consistency of corresponding points to calculate a sensor installation matrix without any need for control points. Initial experiments using simulated data revealed the method to be feasible. Subsequent validation using real data from the Luojia 3–02 satellite showed that the positioning accuracy was comparable to traditional method, but the calculation cost was significantly lower. The method will find applications in satellite constellations and long-term precision maintenance missions."

 The development of digital twins for urban road intersections has attracted significant attention in recent research, driven by their potential to enable intelligent intersections that require accurate and real-time monitoring of dynamic environments. Lidar sensors, with their precise 3D perception capabilities, are particularly well-suited for enhancing intersection perception, offering accurate detection and tracking of road objects, as well as precise velocity estimation. However, existing roadside lidar datasets are deficient in terms of scene diversity and annotation information specifically tailored for intersection monitoring applications. To address the gap, we introduce IntDT, a comprehensive roadside lidar dataset designed specifically for digital twins of intersections. Collected using dual roadside lidar systems across diverse urban intersections, IntDT provides comprehensive annotations that support a range of tasks. Benchmark evaluations are performed for 3D object detection and tracking tasks to facilitate standardized comparative analysis. Additionally, semi-supervised object detection, moving object segmentation, and point cloud completion tasks are firstly benchmarked for roadside lidar data to stimulate more studies in this field.

 The atmospheric aerosol scattering hygroscopic growth factor (f(RH)) is a key parameter for assessing aerosol radiative forcing and atmospheric visibility. In this study, a prediction model for the aerosol scattering hygroscopic growth factor of PM10 at ambient relative humidity (RH) was constructed using a machine learning method based on the observed data of aerosol scattering hygroscopic growth factor (f(RH)) in the urban area of Beijing from 2018 to 2022. CatBoost regression model, utilizing meteorological and air quality data, achieves high accuracy in reconstructing the f(RH), with a coefficient of determination R2 of 0.9388 on the testing dataset. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) showed that: the contribution of SHAP value of RH accounted for 58 % of the total, which was the dominant factor; Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) indirectly influenced f(RH) by affecting the formation of secondary inorganic salts, NO2 concentrations below 35 μg/m3 enhanced aerosol hygroscopicity, while concentrations above 35 μg/m3 weakened it. The model was successfully applied to the analysis of heavy pollution events, with good simulation results for low atmospheric visibility periods; the optical parameters reconstructed by the model showed the potential for application in radiative forcing assessment (relative error = 4.04 % at RH = 85 %).

 We evaluated the risk of Sick House Syndrome in newly constructed wooden houses by measuring the indoor concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including α-pinene, D-limonene, and the total VOCs (TVOCs), in accordance with Japanese indoor concentration guidelines. To ensure quantitative accuracy, a field survey of 55 houses was conducted using a passive air sampling method with experimentally determined sampling rates. Health assessments were conducted using a screening-level margin-of-exposure (MOE) approach. The results revealed that apart from styrene in one house, the concentration of no compounds exceeded that of the Japanese indoor guidelines. The houses (∼80 %) exhibited α-pinene concentrations below the German bicyclic terpenes guideline (RW II). Although elevated concentrations immediately after construction pose potential short-term health risks, the rapid decline within a few months suggests minimal long-term concerns. Similarly, D-limonene concentrations in all houses were below those of the German guideline (RW II), indicating a low risk.With the increasing prevalence of high-insulation and airtight construction, newly built wooden houses will likely experience elevated concentrations of wood-derived VOCs such as α-pinene. To mitigate these risks, it is crucial to minimize the use of adhesives and paints, conduct pre-handover air quality inspections, and ensure adequate ventilation in newly constructed houses."

 Climate warming and moistening are enhancing the frequency and intensity of Tibetan Plateau Vortices (TPVs), altering precipitation patterns across the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and adjacent regions. Although TPVs are the primary weather systems driving heavy precipitation over northern China, how their impacts vary across different geographic environments remains poorly understood. Reanalysis data and potential vorticity (PV) diagnostics are used to examine dynamical and thermodynamic processes associated with the TPV-induced cross-regional precipitation event (8–13 July 2021) across the Eastern Slope of the TP (ESTP) and the North China Plain (NCP). In the ESTP, heavy precipitation results from a dynamical-thermodynamic coupled mechanism, where low-level jets transporting moisture from the Indian Ocean and South China Sea interact with orographic lifting to trigger warm and moist advection, further enhanced by PV advection and diabatic heating. In the NCP, a dual-channel moisture transport pathway emerges as the TPV interacts with warm-moist flow along the western flank of the Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH), with precipitation peaks preceding PV maxima, indicating that dynamical forcing associated with PV advection dominates the heavy precipitation. These findings show that TPV-driven heavy precipitation results from spatiotemporal coupling between dynamical triggering and thermodynamic feedback of moisture. Latent heating rapidly amplifies nascent convection, while thermal processes enhance low-level instability, compensating for weakening dynamical forcing and sustaining precipitation. These findings highlight that regional disparities in TPV-induced heavy precipitation stem from asymmetrical dynamical-thermodynamic coupling, underscoring the need to elucidate the physical mechanisms by which TPVs trigger cross-regional precipitation, in order to improve forecasts of TPV-related weather and associated hazards."

 Phenolic compounds have received widespread attention owing to their light absorption properties and biological toxicity. Semi-volatile polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have a high affinity for soot and particulate matter. Therefore, PAHs were selected to investigate the reaction mechanism and kinetics of 4-nitrocatechol (4NC) with ozone on soot in the troposphere using a combination of quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. Phenanthroline (Phen) demonstrated the strongest adsorption affinity for 4NC, facilitating efficient interfacial reactions with ozone. There were six primary reaction paths of 4NC with ozone, in which the path that R2 was the optimal path for the reaction, while the intermediates produced by the primary decomposition step of ozone in the presence of NO and H2O underwent subsequent reactions. The reaction rate is affected by the atmospheric temperature, and the rate constant exhibits a positive temperature dependence in the temperature range of 200–400 K. The total reaction rate constants are calculated to be 1.33 × 10−20 cm3 molec−1 s−1 and 8.21 × 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 in the gas and aqueous phases, respectively.

 The northeastern slope of the Tibetan Plateau, situated in a complex terrain and the monsoon-westerly transition zone, experiences frequent convective storms and high disaster risk. Based on CINRAD radar and ERA5 reanalysis data from 2015 to 2019, a high-resolution convective climatology was established, and its environmental fields were diagnosed. Results indicate a significant topographic anchoring effect on convection, with persistent hotspots located in the Yellow River valley-Xinglong Mountain, the eastern Qilian Mountains, and the sharp-bend reach of the Yellow River. Moderate convection dominates (64.7 %), while deep convection has a low frequency but high local intensity. The most active month seasonally is July, with June and August exhibiting similar levels of activity. The convective activity in July is most active during the season, with levels in June and August being similar. The configuration of synoptic patterns indicates a synergistic mode of “upper-level trough, lower-level convergence, and strong moisture transport” for convective days. Diurnal variation is characterized by a peak in the afternoon (13:00–18:00 BJT) and is weakest in the early morning to morning, consistent with the synergistic trigger between solar radiation and terrain convergence. Atmospheric environment diagnostics reveal that, compared to non-convective events, convective events have higher CAPE, stronger updrafts, greater vertical wind shear, and more abundant water vapor in the two hours prior to triggering. The statistical distribution of storm scales exhibits an exponential decay with a “long-tail” pattern, with approximately 80 %–85 % of convective events having a propagation distance of less than 20 km and a max area of less than 200 km2. The propagation direction of convective activity exhibits inter-monthly shifts, trending eastward/southward in June, shifting northward to east-southeastward in July, and westward/northward in August. These findings reveal the mechanisms by which large-scale circulation and local topography jointly influence convection, providing critical scientific support for monitoring and early warning systems for severe convection in the Tibetan Plateau and its surrounding areas, as well as for disaster risk prevention and control."
