However, silica scaling impeded the effectiveness of MD for treating hypersaline water and wastewater. Herein, the effects of humic acid (HA) on silica scaling behavior during MD are systematically investigated. The interaction mechanism between typical components of HA and active silica was evaluated by molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the addition of HA alleviated the significant decrease in water flux, with recoveries surpassing 60% and 80% at 10 and 20 ppm of HA, respectively. Quantum chemical calculations indicate that the presence of HA greatly raised the free-energy barriers of silica polymerization compared to the system without HA (489.7 vs 45.1 kJ mol–1). Moreover, the interaction between HA molecules and silica significantly weakened the diffusion capacity of silica scale in water (diffusion coefficient from 1.04 × 10–5 to 0.08 × 10–5 cm2 s–1), consequently decreasing the likelihood of contact between silica scale and the hydrophobic membrane. Finally, a neural network analysis model for the HA and silica interaction was developed to design effective inhibitors for silica polymerization. Overall, this study develops nanoscale modeling and simulations to understand how HA inhibits silica scaling in membrane processes, guiding the formation of new approaches to enhance MD performance."

However, the role of aging for nanoplastics (NPs) in being a carrier of mercury (Hg), a common marine environmental pollutant, and their combined effects remain unclear. This study investigated the carrier effect of ultraviolet-aged NPs on Hg and the ensuing toxicity in a marine copepod Tigriopus japonicus under a multigenerational scenario. Aged NPs revealed a better carrier role in Hg bioaccumulation than pristine ones, which was increased by 1.61, 1.52, and 1.54 times in F0, F1, and F2, respectively, probably attributed to increased levels of O-containing functional groups and better adsorption for Hg. Consequently, relative to Hg alone, Hg combined with aged NPs (rather than pristine ones) significantly compromised the copepod’s fitness, e.g., the survival rate decreasing by 74.2 and 62.1% in F1 and F2, respectively. This is possibly linked to the most pronounced transcriptomic response under Hg combined with aged NPs, including disturbed cuticle formation, activated antioxidants, and down-regulation of reproductive genes. Overall, our findings emphasize the non-negligible risk of aged NPs as carriers of toxic metals and provide a better understanding about the long-term effects of coexisting NPs and metal pollution on organisms in real marine environments."

In view of this, we proposed and implemented a new data-driven algorithm to calculate spectral similarity among PFAS, facilitating the generation of molecular networks to screen for unknown compounds. Using this approach, 81 PFAS across 12 distinct classes were identified in soil samples collected near an industrial park in Shandong Province, China, including the first reported occurrence of 12 iodine-substituted PFAS. Among them, the standards of four iodine-substituted polyfluorinated ether sulfonates (I-PFESA) were successfully synthesized, enabling structural confirmation and subsequent quantitative analysis. Although the median concentration of ∑I-PFESA (0.74 ng/g dw) in soil samples was lower than that of ∑H-PFESA (hydrogen-substituted, 61.96 ng/g dw) and ∑Cl-PFESA (chlorine-substituted, 2.98 ng/g dw), embryotoxicity assays in zebrafish revealed that 6:2 I-PFESA exhibited greater toxicity compared to 6:2 Cl-PFESA of the same chain length. This highlights the need for a closer examination of the toxic effects of I-PFESA. Notably, the proposed algorithm, based on novel PFAS spectral similarity, provides new perspectives on the environmental behavior and transformation of I-PFESA, although further investigation is required to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of their toxicity."

Little is known about how shifting from biomass cooking to a cleaner fuel like liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) could impact exposures for this population. We report 24-h exposures to particulate matter (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), and carbon monoxide (CO) among women aged 40 to <80 years participating in the Household Air Pollution Intervention Network trial. 209 participants were randomized to the intervention and received an LPG stove and continuous fuel supply; controls used biomass (n = 209). Exposures were measured up to six times; we used mixed-effects models to estimate differences between intervention and control groups. Preintervention exposures between groups were comparable; median postintervention exposures were 62% (76.3 vs 29.3 μg/m3), 73% (10.4 vs 2.8 μg/m3), and 57% (1.4 vs 0.6 ppm) lower for PM2.5, BC, and CO among LPG users than for controls. Reductions were similar across countries; 70% of PM2.5 exposures after intervention were below the annual WHO interim target I (IT-1) value of 35 μg/m3.

To assess transmission pathways associated with enteropathogen infection, we measured household environmental conditions and assayed 22 enteropathogens using TaqMan Array Cards in stool samples from 276 six-month-old children living in communities along a rural–urban gradient in Northern Ecuador. We utilized multivariable models, risk factor importance, and distance-based statistical methods to test factors associated with infection. Most children (89%) carried at least one pathogen, and 72% carried two or more. Bacterial infections (82% of participants) were more common than viruses (58%) or parasites (9.1%). Infants living in the urban site had decreased infection risks compared to those in rural locations. Improved water and sanitation were most predictive of reduced infection risk. Improved water was associated with decreased enterotoxigenic E. coli prevalence, and improved sanitation was associated with lower prevalence of any infection and specifically norovirus. Animal exposure was associated with increased Salmonella prevalence. Children measured during the rainy season had fewer viral and more bacterial infections. Identifying environmental exposures associated with specific pathogen outcomes provides insights into transmission pathways, which contribute critical information for developing effective strategies to improve child health."

Using both eddy covariance and bulk formula flux measurements from the icebreaker R/V Xuelong2, we found that the eastern SO during an austral summer was a sink for CH4. The strongest downward CH4 fluxes occurred in areas of low sea ice concentration (10%–40%), where sea‐ice melting resulted in low temperature and salinity, increasing CH4 solubility. The CH4 fluxes are weak in regions of high sea ice concentration (>50%) due to the blocking effect of sea ice. We estimate that the uptake of CH4 during one summer month in the study region offsets 1.2%–2.6% of annual global oceanic CH4 emissions.

This study investigates molecular composition of BrC derived from combustion of five types of residential solid fuels (i.e., firewood, corn cob, bituminous coal, anthracite, and biomass briquette) and their photooxidation evolution mechanisms using an oxidation flow reactor. Results show that nitrogen‐containing and sulfur‐containing organic compounds are the main components of molecular composition of methanol‐soluble organic compounds (MSOC) emitted from these fuels, with their intensity being 33%–43% and 23%–56%, respectively, depending on fuel type. The photooxidation processes mediated by NO3⋅ and ⋅ OH significantly altered the molecular composition and distribution of aged MSOC. The formation of typical nitrogen‐containing BrC chromophores (e.g., nitro‐aromatic compounds) also proves the role of NO3 ⋅ in the photooxidation reaction. However, the photo‐enhancement effect of NO3 ⋅ mediated photooxidation reaction could not offset the destruction of the molecular conjugation degree and aromaticity of BrC by ⋅ OH oxidation, resulting in a significant reduction in the light absorption capacity of BrC. The mass absorption coefficient at 365 nm of BrC aged for 12 days derived from the remaining fuels decreased by 47.0%–55.8% compared to that of fresh BrC, except for firewood, which only decreased by 5.3%.

The present study explored the spatiotemporal attributes of spring frost days (FD) over northeast China in recent decades, and the potential mechanisms underlying their interannual variations. The results indicated an evident decline in spring FD over northeast China, accompanied by substantial interannual variation. Further analyses suggested that anomalous springtime North Atlantic tripole sea surface temperature (SST) and Eurasian snow depth are critical factors controlling the interannual variations of spring FD in northeast China. Rossby wave trains can be stimulated by the anomalous North Atlantic tripole SST (NAT), which propagates eastward through the Eurasian continent to northeast China, significantly affecting the atmospheric circulation along the pathways. This results in anomalous negative geopotential heights and cyclonic circulation over northeast China, causing low‐temperature anomalies by moderating wind‐induced alterations in surface heat fluxes and cloud‐induced modifications in surface radiation. Meanwhile, Eurasian snow depth anomalies represent a consistent effect with NAT. The anomalous Eurasian snow depth may modify the atmosphere thickness by regulating surface heat flux, promoting the propagation of wave trains as a snow‐atmosphere bridge, which enhances the impact of NAT on FD.

Observational and experimental evidence reveals an unidentified competitive mechanism involving transition metal ions (TMIs) that catalyze the heterogeneous oxidation of isoprene. Hydroxyl radicals (OH) were generated through the reaction of singlet oxygen (O(1D)) with molecular water at the surface of earth‐abundant manganese (Mn) nanoparticles. The energy threshold for OH production was minimized to 213 kJ mol−1 in the presence of alkali K+ ions, significantly lower than the 392 kJ mol−1 required for ozone photolysis. The rapid loss of isoprene (1.60 × 10−2 s−1) for the particulate mixtures resulted in the formation of approximately 70% C1–C4 carbonyl oligomers via interfacial binding modes, which promoted particle growth. This contrasts with the higher yields of C5 products typically observed in gas‐phase reactions of isoprene with OH radicals. The findings could enhance the understanding of severe haze formation, particularly under complex air pollution conditions."

 Patterns of ionospheric luminosity provide a unique window into our complex, coupled space environment. The aurora, for example, indicates plasma processes occurring thousands of km away, depositing immense amounts of energy into our polar ionospheres. Here we show observations of structured continuum emission associated with the dynamic aurora. The presence of weak ambient continuum emission has long been recognized. However, studies of its relationship to aurora are scarce and limited by observational constraints. We use spectrally resolved measurements to analyze these previously unexplained emissions, adding critical information about spatial structure, characteristic spectra, and location within auroral dynamics. Our findings demonstrate that the coupling among auroral processes, the plasma, and the neutral atmosphere can unfold at meso-scales and is more complex than previously reported. We suggest that the meso-scale auroral precipitation may, under certain circumstances, effectively couple to atmospheric chemistry and conditions to produce the continuum structure.

 Plate tectonics is a unique feature of Earth, but its proposed time of initiation is still controversial, with published estimates ranging from ca. 4.2 to 0.7 Ga. Paleomagnetic data can provide a robust argument for one essential aspect of plate tectonics: large-scale relative lateral motions of distinct, rigid crustal blocks. Previously, the oldest relative horizontal motion between two or more blocks was constrained to a broad age interval of ca. 2.7–2.17 Ga using paleomagnetic data. In this study, we obtain a robust ca. 2.48 Ga paleomagnetic pole from Wyoming craton. Combining this result with the ca. 2.7–2.17 Ga apparent polar wander paths from Wyoming and Superior cratons, we suggest that they assembled during ca. 2.7–2.5 Ga and remained directly juxtaposed until ca. 2.17 Ga.

Ny Aina Rakotoarivony;Hamed Gholizadeh;Kianoosh Hassani;Lu Zhai;Christian Rossi,Mapping the spatial distribution of species using airborne and spaceborne imaging spectroscopy: A case study of invasive plants,"•Trait-based mapping of species distribution outperformed abiotic-based approaches. •Spatial resolution limits the performance of mapping species distribution. •Fusing data improved the performance of mapping the spatial distribution of species. 
 Predicting the spatial distribution of invasive plants remains challenging because of the complex relationships between plant invasion, abiotic, and biotic factors. While conventional species distribution models (SDMs) are often developed using abiotic factors, recent studies have suggested that including biotic factors, particularly plant functional traits, can improve our capability to model the distribution of invasive plants. Remote sensing is capable of estimating plant functional traits across large spatial extents. These remotely-estimated plant functional traits can then be used as predictors in mapping the spatial distribution of species. However, exploring the application of remotely-estimated plant functional traits in mapping the spatial distribution of invasive plants is relatively understudied. In this study, we aimed to (1) develop trait-based approaches for mapping the spatial distribution of an invasive plant, (2) assess the scale-dependency of these trait-based approaches, and (3) determine the capability of spaceborne hyperspectral imagery in mapping the spatial distribution of invasive plants through fusing their data with fine spatial resolution multispectral data. We focused on Lespedeza cuneata (hereafter, L. cuneata), commonly known as sericea lespedeza, an invasive legume threatening grassland ecosystems of the U.S. Southern Great Plains. To achieve our objectives, we collected in situ data, including plant functional traits, such as foliar nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, and measured average canopy height, and percent cover of L. cuneata from 900 sampling quadrats. We also collected remote sensing data, including airborne hyperspectral data (400–2500 nm, 1 m spatial resolution), spaceborne hyperspectral data from DLR's DESIS (401.9–999.5 nm, 30 m spatial resolution), and PlanetScope multispectral data (8 bands, 3 m spatial resolution). We also fused DESIS and PlanetScope imagery to produce fine spatial and fine spectral imagery (401.9–999.5 nm, 3 m spatial resolution). We used partial least squares regression (PLSR) to estimate plant functional traits from remotely sensed data and developed approaches for mapping the spatial distribution of invasive plants using remotely-estimated plant functional traits. We developed approaches for mapping the spatial distribution of invasive plants across spatial scales, at 1 m, 3 m, and 30 m spatial resolutions, using (1) abiotic factors only, (2) remotely-estimated plant functional traits only, and (3) remotely-estimated plant functional traits along with abiotic factors. Our findings showed that trait-based approaches for mapping the spatial distribution of invasive plants had higher accuracy than abiotic-based approaches, mapping the spatial distribution of L. cuneata at fine spatial resolution performed better than at coarse spatial resolution, and fusion of coarse spatial resolution hyperspectral imagery with fine spatial resolution imagery had the highest performance at modeling the spatial distribution of L. cuneata. Results showed that fusing forthcoming imagers, such as NASA's Surface Biology and Geology data (SBG) mission, with fine spatial resolution multispectral data, such as PlanetScope data, is a promising approach to modeling the distribution of invasive plants in grasslands."

 This paper introduces a method for estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) using the Interferometric SAR (InSAR)-based Phase Histogram (PH) technique. This novel technique allows for the extraction of 3D vertical forest structure using only a single interferometric pair to acquire a coarse-resolution backscatter intensity distribution in the height direction. Through 3D backscatter distribution, we can extract forest height, the intensity at predefined height bins and introduce the volume-to-ground intensity ratio (VGR) factor to investigate their sensitivities to forest AGB. To validate the method, we use the airborne fully polarized TomoSense dataset, flight-tested by European Space Agency (ESA) in Kermeter area at Eifel National Park, Germany, in 2020. We adopt both multivariate linear stepwise regression (MLSR) and random forest (RF) models to verify the feasibility of the PH technique in forest AGB estimation. Experimental results show that the PH technique effectively captures the vertical structure of the forest at a certain resolution. The forest height, the PH-derived backscatter intensity at a fixed height and VGR have good positive correlation with AGB. Notably, combining forest height, the intensity at fixed height layers and VGR significantly improves the inversion precision of forest AGB. Specifically, compared with LiDAR-derived AGB, the average root-mean-square error (RMSE) of MLSR and RF models estimates combining P- and L-band 2D + 3D observables are 57.92 ton/ha and 55.11 ton/ha, with Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.75 and 0.77, respectively. This study presents a promising alternative approach for current and future SAR Earth observation missions aimed at forest vertical structure construction and AGB estimation when only a few of single-polarization SAR images are available."

 Multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar interferometry (MT-InSAR) offers unique advantages in monitoring ground deformation and structural stability along the metro lines. However, a vast number of complex deformation points, millions and even more, can be derived from InSAR making it challenging to identify the deformation hotspot in time series automatically. This paper proposes a novel method for quantitatively assessing the MT-InSAR-derived deformation results. We first introduce an iterative seasonal trend decomposition using loess (STL) method to confirm the optimal period for separating seasonal components from the displacement time series. Then, an absolute differences detector with rolling windows is proposed to quantify the subsidence ratio within the time series and allow deformation hotspots to be more visible. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, 468 scenes of Sentinel-1A ascending images from Jun. 2015 to Nov. 2023 over the Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway (MTR) are adopted. The results indicate that 99.2% of areas are relatively stable with the displacement velocity ranging from −2 mm/year to 2 mm/year, and 84% of the study area remained a subsidence ratio below 0.3, except for localized hotspots that exhibited either short or long-term subsidence trends. The findings of this study indicate that multiple deformation hotspots were identified at the intersections of several metro lines in the Kowloon Peninsula and along the Island line. In addition to the displacement velocity from the conventional MT-InSAR, the overall and annual subsidence ratios have been demonstrated to be useful indicators for quantitative assessment of the construction-induced deformation."

 Under the background of global aging, outdoor public spaces play a crucial role in promoting physical activity among older individuals, helping to advance the process of healthy aging. Among these spaces, urban greenways are particularly effective in encouraging walking behaviors and improving both physical and mental health. However, current assessments of greenway’s walkability have mainly focused on the general population, with scant attention paid to the viewpoint of older adults. Hence, this study proposed a novel walkability assessment framework from the perspective of the elderly, which employs multi-sourced data in conjunction with Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) to measure walkability, taking the renowned 45-km-long Huangpu River waterfront Greenway in Shanghai as a case study. Apart from using traditional GIS data to quantify the walkability factors, locally collected street view images using wearable GoPro were also utilized in the evaluation. According to the results of overall walkability scores, the Hongkou Riverwalk shows the best walkability for older people, followed by the Huangpu Riverwalk, the Xuhui Riverwalk, the Yangpu Riverwalk, and the East Coast Riverwalk is the worst. It is also noted that among the walkability factors, older adults place the highest value on safety facilities, green view index and seating facilities. Moreover, four greenway patterns were classified to characterize different walkability, including “safety-dominant” pattern, “comfort-dominant” pattern, “interestingness-dominant” pattern, “usefulness-dominant” pattern.

The three branches include a detail branch for capturing local detail features, a context branch for extracting global contextual information, and a boundary branch for obtaining crack boundary information.

 A number of recent source apportionment studies have explored high-time resolution organic particulate matter, elemental particulate matter (PM), and Black Carbon (BC) datasets and attributed them independently to specific sources. However, proper unmixing of the actual sources operational on the ground most of the time cannot be achieved based on such an independent source apportionment approach, especially owing to the presence of secondary aerosol factors. Therefore, a combined analysis of all major PM2.5 species is needed to better recognize the actual physical sources. Accordingly, in this study, using a combined dataset consisting of non-refractory PM2.5 organic factors/major m/z signals from organics, elements, and BC, we evaluated two disparate factor analytic methodologies – namely, double-PMF (D-PMF) and Tracer-conjugate PMF (TC-PMF), to apportion PM2.5 sources in Delhi winter (from December 15, 2020 to February 28, 2021) through real-time instrumentation (ACSM, Xact, and Aethalometer(AXA)). During the study period, the average PM2.5 concentration was 182 μg/m3 (C-PM2.5 = sum of NR-PM2.5 (Organics, NO3−, SO4−2, NH4+), BC, and elements). For D-PMF, organic aerosols (OA) were initially deconvolved with positive matrix factorization (PMF) into hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), biomass burning OA (BBOA), low volatile oxidized OA (LVOOA 1 and 2) and semi-volatile oxidized organic aerosols (SVOOA) before being coupled with elemental species and BC for a second PMF. The TC-PMF combined the major m/z signals from organics with the elemental species and BC. Both D-PMF and TC-PMF identified biomass burning, industrial, waste incineration, dust-related, traffic, secondary chloride, Pb-rich, power plant, and LVOOA dominated as the sources. Both solutions (D-PMF, TC-PMF) were found to be dominated by biomass burning (33.3% and 26.5%), followed by the power plant (27.4% and 18.4%) and the LVOOA dominant (14.2% and 18.6%) factors. The D-PMF and TC-PMF improved the interpretation of organic factor sources, such as apportioning considerable contributions of LVOOA2 (85%) to the power plant factor, which is often linked with regionally carried aged OA in the Organics PMF (O-PMF). Lastly, the D-PMF results significantly agreed with TC-PMF, indicating that either of the two techniques could be used to unmix the complex variety of PM2.5 sources in the Delhi-NCR (National Capital Region) region and, arguably, the larger Indo-Gangetic Plains."

South Africa's reliance on coal combustion has led to poor air quality. Indoor air pollution exacerbates health risks in low-income households, necessitating thorough assessment. In this study, a human health risk assessment (HHRA) provided an understanding of health risks posed by indoor and outdoor PM2.5 concentrations in rural and urban settings.MethodsDuring two campaigns, PM2.5 concentrations were monitored indoors (low-cost sensors in households) and outdoors (Zephyr sensors). We employed the method of the US Environmental Protection Agency in 22 urban households and 22 rural households.ResultsDuring a cooler period, indoor PM2.5 concentrations in all households exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) Air Quality Guidelines. In Soweto, the winter 24-h PM2.5 concentrations reached as high as 491.4 μg/m³ (Household 19), surpassing all the WHO guideline targets, with the highest at 75 μg/m³. Even with conditions of higher atmospheric dispersion and less solid fuel burning, almost half of rural households had Hazard Quotients (HQs) > 1. In both seasons in urban areas and winter in rural areas, HQ values consistently remained >1, signalling greater health risks. Indoor PM2.5 concentrations almost consistently exceeded outdoor reference limits in both rural and urban locations throughout the year, underscoring the additional pollution burden due to indoor solid fuel burning and personal smoking habits. One Agincourt household recorded a warm period 24-h peak PM2.5 concentration of 1054 μg/m³ indoors, far higher than any corresponding outdoor values.ConclusionsThere is an urgent need for interventions to mitigate indoor air pollution that presents significant health risks to household occupants. Reducing health risks associated with high PM2.5 concentrations require interventions to mitigate outdoor PM2.5 levels and solid fuel use indoors. (347 words)"
None,True,Atmospheric Environment,这篇论文研究了HCFOs（氢氯氟烃）臭氧分解反应生成CF3H的机制，特别是关注了E-和Z-CF3CH=CHCl两种异构体的差异。这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为HCFOs和CF3H都是重要的温室气体和大气痕量气体，它们在大气中的浓度变化会影响气候变化和空气质量。研究HCFOs的臭氧分解反应有助于了解这些物质在大气中的寿命和迁移转化过程，这对于利用卫星或地面遥感技术监测大气成分，评估其对环境的影响至关重要。例如，傅里叶变换红外光谱（FTIR）技术可以用来测量大气中CF3H的浓度，而卫星上的遥感仪器可以提供全球尺度的大气成分分布信息。因此，该研究结果可用于改进大气化学模型，提高大气环境遥感技术的精度和可靠性，从而更好地进行空气质量监测和气候变化研究。,"['Atmospheric composition', 'Halocarbons', 'Air quality', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'FTIR', 'Ozone']",O.J.

 Deep learning has attracted more and more attention in the field of tropical cyclone (TC) intensity estimation (TCIE). It is able to achieve promising results when the testing data follows the same distribution as the training data. However, due to the difference of geographical locations, TC intensity distributions, and imaging sensors, TC in different basins often show diverse distributions, making deep learning models trained on one basin can hardly be generalized to other basins. In this paper, we propose a cross-basin incremental learning model (CBIL-TCIE) to estimate the intensity of TC in multiple basins. CBIL-TCIE consists of domain-shared and domain-specific layers within the framework of multi-task learning. The domain-shared layers learn the common knowledge of all basins, and the domain-specific layers learn the specific knowledge of the current basin. Additionally, most of the existing studies have primarily focused on utilizing either maximum sustained wind (MSW) or minimum sea level pressure (MSLP) to represent TC intensity. Differently, in order to better characterize the intensity of TCs, our model can output MSW and MSLP concurrently as the TC intensity in different basins. To test the performance of our proposed model, we conduct experiments on a widely used dataset named GridSat, which consists of TC data across multiple basins. The performance of the CBIL-TCIE in multiple basins can improve by 19.2 % compared to the widely used fine-tuning method. Furthermore, the experiment demonstrates that concurrently outputting MSW and MSLP can effectively facilitate the ability of TC intensity estimation."

Pattanaik,Decadal seasonal characteristics of precipitation microphysics over the Western Ghats using the space-borne precipitation radar,"•Ten years of continuous GPM-DPR-derived precipitation microphysics data are examined across the Western Ghats. •Microphysical characteristics of precipitating clouds in different seasons are discussed. •Contributions of primary microphysical processes are determined, according to the cloud type and season. 
 Global Precipitation Measurement satellite equipped with space-borne dual-frequency precipitation radar (GPM-DPR) allows to investigate the precipitating cloud microphysics and precipitation structures, irrespective of the terrain's ruggedness. Ten years (from March 2014 to December 2023) of continuous GPM-DPR level2 V07A data is processed to understand the decadal changes in precipitation microphysics across the Western Ghats (8°N-20°N and 73°E-77°E) during the monsoon season including before onset (pre-monsoon) and withdrawal (post-monsoon) periods. The spatial distribution of rain rate (R: mm/h), mass-weighted mean diameter (Dm: mm), and normalized intercept parameters (Nw: m−3 mm−1) shows considerable variations depending on cloud types and seasons. During the stratiform precipitation, low-intensity rainfall dominates, characterized by low Dm and high Nw, indicating a significant concentration of smaller raindrops. In contrast, the escalation of high-intensity rainfall due to increased convective activity and strong updrafts during the convective precipitation causes the enlargement of raindrops, augments the concentration of bigger raindrops. Dm-Nw joint histogram displayed distinguishable patterns; range and peak varied with the cloud type and season. It may result from differences in the occurrence rate of various microphysical processes. The share of collision-coalescences process is a maximum of 72.35 % for the convective precipitation in the monsoon season. At the same time, the highest break-up process contribution is 52.05 % during stratiform rainfall of the post-monsoon season."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2024.107878,False,Atmospheric Research,这篇论文关注的是次季节到季节（S2S）尺度降水预报的误差订正方法。它提出了一种新的非均匀误差订正方法（NUEC），并将其与传统的均匀误差订正方法（UEC）进行了比较。研究结果表明，NUEC方法在提高中国东部地区S2S降水预报的准确性方面优于UEC方法，尤其是在较长预报时效的情况下。该研究主要集中在改进数值预报模型的精度，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）并没有直接关系。,[],Rong Ai;Ruoyu Liu;Chenwei Yao;Tongwen Wu;Qingquan Li;Guolin Feng;Zhiqiang Gong,Non-uniform error correction for daily precipitation forecasting in Eastern China on the S2S model,"•The proposed method captures non-uniform errors more effectively than previous method. •The proposed method improves anomaly correlation coefficient by 10.2 %. •The proposed method reduces root mean square error more than previous method. •Independent sample testing confirms the proposed method's superior performance. 
 Subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) precipitation forecasting bridges the gap between weather forecasts and monthly or seasonal outlooks. Due to the accumulation of model errors over time, error correction has become a critical step in improving forecast accuracy. This study proposes an error correction method tailored for subseasonal precipitation forecasting: the Non-uniformity Error Correction (NUEC) method. NUEC is a dynamic correction method that accounts for the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of model forecast errors. It allocates errors proportionally across each year and day, resulting in a more nuanced and precise error correction process. In contrast, the Uniform Error Correction (UEC) method, which is widely recognized, applies a simpler approach by distributing uniform errors based on multi-year average errors across individual days. Validations show that NUEC consistently outperforms UEC in precipitation forecasting correction from 1998 to 2017 in eastern China, particularly over the forecasting with longer leading time. NUEC achieved 10.2 % enhancement in mean anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC), surpassing UEC's 3.0 % improvement. NUEC also demonstrated a higher reduction in errors of the root mean square error (RMSE) across all time frames than those of UEC. Independent sample validation for the years 2018 to 2020 further confirms the effectiveness of NUEC, particularly in eastern China, where substantial error reduction demonstrates its potential for enhancing S2S precipitation forecasting."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2024.107890,False,Atmospheric Research,这篇论文主要研究了印度次大陆混合相季风云中二次冰晶产生(SIP)的重要性。研究使用了高分辨率模拟，重点关注三种主要的SIP机制：Hallett-Mossop (HM)过程，冰晶碎裂(DS)和冰晶碰撞(IIC)。结果表明，IIC是主要的SIP机制，贡献了高达90%的总冰晶产生量。研究还发现，包括这三种SIP机制显著增加了冰晶浓度，并影响了多种云参数，最终导致地表降水减少了15%。该研究与大气环境遥感技术关系不大，因为它主要关注的是云微物理过程的模拟和分析，而非利用遥感技术进行大气成分的观测和分析。,"['cloud microphysics', 'ice nucleation', 'precipitation', 'monsoon rainfall', 'cloud modeling', 'mixed-phase clouds']",Sachin Patade;Gayatri Kulkarni;Sonali Patade;Deepak Waman;Georgia Sotiropoulou;Soumya Samanta;Neelam Malap;Thara Prabhakaran,Importance of secondary ice production in mixed-phase monsoon clouds over the Indian subcontinent,"•Ice-ice collision (IIC) is the main secondary ice production (SIP) mechanism, contributing up to 90% of total SIP in simulated clouds. •SIP mechanisms (HM, DS, IIC) boost ice concentration by 3-4 orders of magnitude at temperatures warmer than −20°C. •SIP affects cloud parameters (ice concentration, crystal mass, rimed mass, liquid water) and reduces surface precipitation by 25%. 
 The accurate representation of mixed-phase monsoon clouds and their phase distribution is of great importance for numerical models used to predict monsoon rainfall. Therefore, it is essential for these models to correctly capture the phase fraction of clouds, which includes the proportions of liquid and ice. Ice particle formation in clouds occurs through primary ice production and secondary ice production (SIP). Most weather and climate models tend to overlook secondary SIP mechanisms, often only including rime-splintering. This oversight can introduce biases in the phase partitioning of mixed-phase clouds and monsoon rainfall predictions.In this study, we investigate the roles of three major SIP mechanisms: Hallett-Mossop (HM), droplet shattering (DS), and ice-ice collision (IIC) in mixed-phase monsoon clouds. This investigation is the first of its kind and was conducted using high-resolution simulations of mixed-phase convective clouds observed during the fourth phase of the Cloud Aerosol Interaction and Precipitation Enhancement Experiment (CAIPEEX) over a rain shadow region of India. The default cloud microphysical scheme, which originally included only the HM process, was modified to incorporate additional SIP mechanisms such as DS and IIC. The simulated cloud parameters, including liquid and ice water content and ice number concentration, showed good agreement with airborne measurements.Our findings indicate that IIC is the predominant SIP mechanism, contributing 90 % to the total ice production through SIP. The inclusion of the three SIP mechanisms resulted in an enhancement of ice concentration by three to four orders of magnitude at temperatures warmer than -20 °C. SIP significantly influenced various cloud parameters between 0 to −20 °C, including total ice number concentration, ice crystal mass, rimed mass, liquid water content, and phase fraction. It also influenced the Ice Water Path (IWP), Liquid Water Path (LWP), and cloud top temperature. The rates of several mixed-phase processes were also affected by the SIP mechanisms. Overall, SIP led to a 15 % reduction in accumulated surface precipitation."
