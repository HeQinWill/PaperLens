Recent epidemiological studies have suggested links between O3 exposure and outbreaks of infectious diseases. However, whether environmentally relevant levels of O3 exacerbate the colonization and infection of airborne pathogens remains unclear. This study demonstrated that exposure to environmentally relevant levels of O3 (0.15 and 0.60 ppm) significantly enhanced pulmonary colonization of low-dose Klebsiella pneumoniae (1 × 103 CFU/mouse) in mice, which failed to colonize without O3 exposure. Unexpectedly, in vivo and in vitro coculture experiments with BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells demonstrated that O3 exposure also enhanced the ability of K. pneumoniae to penetrate the lung-blood barrier, thereby inducing bacteremia that spread to the liver and caused severe liver injury. O3 exposure reduced the proportions of T cells, B cells, and macrophages in the lungs and altered the expression of key pulmonary genes (Tlr4, Il-18, Traf6, and Tgf-β1) involved in resisting K. pneumoniae colonization. In addition, lipid peroxidation product MDA in plasma acted as a mediator in the signal transmission along the lung-liver axis. This study underscores the critical role of air pollutants in pathogen colonization and infection, emphasizing the urgent need to address air quality to mitigate respiratory health risks."

Overcoming the permselectivity trade-off to improve both the permeance and rejection of polyamide (PA) nanofiltration (NF) membranes beyond the log–log upper bound remains a significant scientific challenge. Herein, we explored advanced ion-transport barriers by constructing a chitin-assisted PA NF membrane, incorporating a biomass-derived carboxylated chitin nanofiber (CO-ChNF) interlayer that simultaneously modulates the pore architecture and surface charge of the PA layer. CO-ChNFs, sustainably extracted from squid cartilage and featuring rich carboxyl and amino functionalities, effectively suppressed the diffusion kinetics of amine monomers during interfacial polymerization. The engineered CO-ChNF/PA membranes demonstrated a sharper pore size distribution and an enhanced charge density, providing an ideal platform to systematically investigate the mechanisms behind ion sieving at PA microinterfaces by exploring ion dehydration energy and electrostatic repulsion energy. Leveraging the enhanced transport barriers, the optimal CO-ChNF/PA membrane achieved impressive performances with a permeance of up to 31.4 L m–2 h–1 bar–1 and a superior Cl–/SO42– selectivity of 91.3, surpassing most commercial and reported NF membranes.

Here, we fabricate an electrified chainmail membrane, composed of copper nanowires encapsulated by reduced graphene oxide (CuNW@rGO), exhibiting both high catalytic activity and long-term stability. The electrified CuNW@rGO membrane/peroxymonosulfate (PMS) system efficiently degrades various water contaminants, including dyes, pharmaceuticals, and phenolics (73–98%). Meanwhile, this system also maintains stable performance over 50 h, with ∼100% PMS utilization efficiency and <10% performance degradation even under realistic treatment environment conditions. The exceptional performance of the CuNW@rGO membrane is attributed to the physical protection provided by the rGO shell and the promotion of copper valence redox cycling through the use of an applied electric field. High-valent copper species (Cu(III)) and electron transfer processes (ETP) dominate pollutant degradation (66.28%), while radical reactive species play a minor role. Oxygen-containing functional groups on the rGO shell serve as electronic transport pathways and reaction binding sites, facilitating charge permeation from the Cu core through the rGO shell to PMS.

While environmental policies have accelerated the replacement of solvent-borne coatings with water-borne alternatives, the secondary formation potential induced by this substitution remains poorly constrained. In this study, we investigate the total reactive organic compound emissions of solvent- and water-borne coatings in terms of total OH reactivity (OHR). The emission factors of the OHR for solvent-borne coatings are 128 times higher than those for water-borne coatings. The huge difference dominantly stems from solvent contents by a factor of 80, with the remaining difference attributed to the average OH reactivity for unit mass of emissions (a factor of 60%). We show that substitutions of solvent-borne coatings with water-borne coatings avoided coating-sector OHR emissions by 64% for the year of 2022. However, solvent-borne coatings still dominate daily OHR emissions (99%). Our future projection indicates that continuous substitution of solvent-borne coatings is still the most effective policy measure for reducing environmental impacts of coating sector emissions, which will gradually decline over the next two decades."

In observational and reanalysis data sets, these increases are linked to trends in mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) and extreme deep convection (cold clusters). Throughout this period, precipitation metrics have increased first via increases in MCS frequency and the relative increase in cold clusters, and later via an increase in storm precipitation intensity. Until the late 2000s, increases in the frequency of strong storms were supported by increased vertical shear of the zonal wind, as the African easterly jet intensified in response to the strengthening meridional temperature gradient over the Sahel. Afterward, the storm frequency and vertical wind shear stopped increasing. Yet, extreme precipitation continued to increase, as the storms' precipitation intensity increased.

Here, we find that the west‒east sea surface temperature (SST) gradient over the northeastern Atlantic can influence the remote development of ENSO through the wave train along the subtropical westerly jet in boreal winter. Specifically, a positive SST gradient favors a positive precipitation anomaly over the northeastern Atlantic by inducing a cyclonic anomaly. Diabatic heating induced by anomalous rainfall excites an anticyclonic response in the upper troposphere, which propagates eastward along the subtropical westerly jet and eventually leads to an anticyclonic anomaly over the eastern tropical Pacific. This anticyclonic anomaly tends to cause an anomalous divergence there, which promotes atmospheric convection. As a result, the low‐level westerly winds over the equator strengthen (i.e., 850 hPa), contributing to the development of an El Niño‐like SST anomaly."

Our results reveal significant year‐to‐year differences in AGW activity with markedly reduced spectral power and shifted propagation directions in January 2015 compared to 2014 and 2016.

 Tropical forests, strongholds of biodiversity and carbon storage, face increasing threats from selective logging and fires. Selective logging disrupts forest structure, leaving canopy gaps where commercially valuable trees once stood, potentially increasing fire susceptibility through heating and drying understorey microclimates and altering fuel conditions. Here, we empirically examine the effects of selective logging on microclimate and flammability in the Brazilian Amazon. Using a controlled fire experiment during the first dry season post-harvest, we found that logging gaps were hotter and drier than surrounding forests, with larger gaps showing steeper temperature gradients. Leaf-litter moisture, a strong predictor of ignition, was modestly lower in gap centres. Despite this spatial variability in fuel moisture, the propensity of fuels to catch and sustain fires consistently increased as the dry season advanced, suggesting the selectively logged mosaic may be uniformly vulnerable to fire once exposed to ignition sources. These findings suggest that selective logging does not act alone in driving fire risk, with seasonal drying and ignition sources also contributing to increased vulnerability. These results highlight the importance of ignition suppression in post-logging management of forests that continue to hold substantial conservation value, including biodiversity and ecosystem services, as dry seasons intensify under climate change.

 In recent years, sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) retrieved from satellite platforms has been demonstrated to be a good proxy of gross primary production (GPP). However, existing data-driven methods based on singular value decomposition (SVD) commonly lead to high retrieval noise for single SIF observations, given the fact that SIF often has a low signal-to-noise ratio. Spatial and/or temporal aggregation has typically been used to reduce these noises. Such aggregation may diminish the effective spatial and/or temporal resolutions of current SIF products but potentially exacerbate uncertainty in interpreting SIF data. To address this issue, this study proposes a more precise data-driven method for retrieving SIF using an artificial neural network (ANN), which was trained using spatially aggregated SIF as the response variable and radiance in the spectral region of 743–758 nm as the explanatory variable. The feasibility of the ANN-based SIF retrieval method was first demonstrated using model simulations based on SCOPE and MODTRAN. Then, the ANN models were trained using OCO-2/3 SIF and TROPOMI radiance after careful matching of the overpass time and “sun-target-viewing” geometry. OCO-2/3 SIF, retrieved using high-spectral-resolution data within a narrow spectral window, is considered accurate and OCO-2 SIF was further validated by airborne SIF measurements. The resulting ANN model led to a high retrieval accuracy for SIF with an R2 of 0.85 and an RMSE of 0.217 mW∙m−2∙nm−1∙sr−1. Finally, the ANN-based method was adopted to produce the global TROPOMI SIF from May 2018 to December 2024. Assuming that the RMSE is representative of the average retrieval noises of single ANN-based SIF, the retrieval noises of ANN-based TROPOMI SIF were approximately half of the reported noises of SVD-based TROPOMI SIF. The advantage of the low retrieval noise of ANN-based SIF was proven in interpreting the seasonal patterns of SIF and estimating GPP compared with SVD-based SIF. This study provides a new insight into SIF retrieval, and the resulting ANN-based SIF product would contribute to better global carbon cycle observations."

 Radiative transfer models (RTMs) describe how light is absorbed, scattered, and transmitted within leaves by simulating mechanistic light propagation processes. The PROSPECT model is based on measurable parameters (the leaf biochemical content) and a non-measurable parameter (the leaf anatomical structure represented by the leaf structure parameter (N)). The effect of N on the optical properties of leaves has been investigated through a number of local and global sensitivity analyses. Other studies have directly evaluated the effect of the leaf anatomical structure on spectral reflectance, particularly in the near infrared region. However, the relationship between N and the anatomical structure is unclear. In this study, we leveraged eLeaf, a ray tracing-based 3D rice leaf simulator, to establish relationships between leaf anatomical features and spectral properties, enabling us to replace N in the PROSPECT-4 model with measurable leaf anatomical parameters and develop the RSPECT model. The leaf thickness at minor vein, leaf thickness at bulliform cells, mesophyll thickness at minor vein, and distance between two minor veins could be used to predict N effectively. The RSPECT model achieved spectral simulation accuracy comparable to PROSPECT-4 and was more suitable for parameter inversion of the physical and chemical properties of rice leaves, with relative root mean square errors of 7.4 % for chlorophyll content, 5.6 % for equivalent water thickness, and 7.5 % for dry matter content.

To address this limitation, we developed a deep learning framework, coupling data from Sentinel-1 (S1), Sentinel-2 (S2) and from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission, to generate a time series of forest height, growing stock volume, and aboveground biomass at 10 to 30-m spatial resolution that we refer to as FORMS-T (FORest Multiple Satellite Time series). Unlike previous studies, we train our model on individual S2 scenes, rather than on growing season composites, to account for acquisition variability and improve generalization across years. We produced these maps for France over seven years (2018–2024) for height at 10 m resolution and further converted them to 30 m maps of growing stock volume and aboveground biomass using leaf type-specific allometric equations. Evaluation against the French National Forest Inventory (NFI) showed an average mean absolute error of 3.07 m for height (r2 = 0.68) across all years, 86 m3 ha-1 for volume and 65.1 Mg ha-1 for biomass. We further evaluated FORMS-T capacity to capture growth on a site where two successive airborne laser scanning (ALS) campaigns were available, showing a good agreement with ALS data when aggregating at coarser spatial resolution (r2 = 0.60, MAE = 0.27 m for the 2020–2022 growth of trees between 10 and 15 m in 5 km pixels). Additionally, we compared our results to the NFI-based wood volume production at regional level and obtained a good agreement with a MAE of 1.45 m3 ha-1 yr-1 and r2 of 0.59. We then leveraged our height change maps to derive species-specific growth curves and compared them to ground-based measurements, highlighting distinct growth dynamics and regional variations in forest management practices. Further development of such maps could contribute to the assessment of forest-related carbon stocks and fluxes, contributing to the formulation of a comprehensive carbon budget at the country scale, and supporting global efforts to mitigate climate change."

 The PlanetScope CubeSat constellation provides unprecedentedly high spatiotemporal resolution for Earth observations but is limited by radiometric inconsistencies resulting from sensor degradation and spectral configuration differences. Existing harmonization methods often rely on internal or external references, limiting harmonization to only a subset of spectral bands or restricting applicability to localized spatiotemporal scales. To address these limitations, we propose Harmoni-Planet, a novel harmonization method that leverages graph-based greedy optimization to achieve holistic radiometric consistency across all PlanetScope bands without requiring reference data. The method consists of two components: (1) graph construction, which integrates unharmonized images into a graph with nodes representing images and edges connecting intersecting images, and (2) graph optimization, which iteratively minimizes radiometric inconsistencies between each image and its intersecting images to optimize consistency. Harmoni-Planet was validated across four geographically diverse regions (the Nile, Beijing, Indonesia, and Greenland), achieving substantial mean absolute error (MAE) reductions of 53 %, 53 %, 57 %, and 25 %, respectively, and outperforming the CubeSat-enabled spatiotemporal enhancement method (CESTEM; 40 %, 41 %, 47 %, and − 69 %, respectively) and the official harmonization algorithm (25 %, 33 %, −9 %, and 9 %, respectively). Harmoni-Planet significantly improves the spatial and temporal comparability of imagery across all PlanetScope bands, regardless of whether images are acquired by the same or different generations of satellites. In addition, it supports flexible scene-based and strip-based implementations, effectively resolving both intra-strip and cross-strip inconsistencies. It also demonstrates robust potential for near-real-time harmonization of newly acquired imagery to accommodate the rapidly expanding data volume of the PlanetScope constellation. Furthermore, Harmoni-Planet supports seamless integration with standard third-party reflectance products such as Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2. Harmoni-Planet provides a practical solution to address cross-sensor radiometric inconsistencies, substantially improving the quality and reliability of PlanetScope data for diverse Earth observation applications."

 The urban land-use map reflects the distribution of the different functional lands in the city, serving as a valuable reference for urban planning and management. High-resolution remote sensing (HRS) images provide detailed spatial information about parcels but lack socio-economic information, which is crucial for identifying land-use types. To enhance the mapping performance and obtain more comprehensive land-use information, the integration of HRS images and points of interest (POIs) with socio-economic information is crucial. Nonetheless, the existing land-use mapping methods based on HRS images and POIs are generally confronted with the following challenges: 1) due to the reliance on prior knowledge, the existing methods cannot automatically capture the complex relationships between multi-source data and land-use categories; 2) there are substantial semantic disparities between HRS images and POIs, so that the simple fusion approaches cannot fully utilize the complementary information; and 3) the existing methods are generally based on the assumption of complete modalities, resulting in them failing to work on POI-deficient parcels. In this paper, to address these issues, an end-to-end urban land-use mapping framework integrating HRS images and multi-source geographic data (Multi-E2E) is proposed. The Multi-E2E framework automatically establishes the mapping from multi-source data to land-use categories through a data-driven approach, and generates informative fused representations with an adaptive fusion module (AFM). In Multi-E2E, the labeled HRS image-POI pairs are constructed using the areas of interest (AOIs), and the interactions between modalities are facilitated by the end-to-end architecture. To identify POI-deficient parcels and ensure that the modality-specific encoders are adequately supervised, a unimodal supervision module (USM) is introduced in the Multi-E2E framework. Experiments conducted with multi-source samples from 34 Chinese cities and the urban regions of Beijing, Wuhan, Hong Kong, Macao, and Helsinki validate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework for urban land-use mapping applications. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Rayoll/Multi_E2E."

 Generating composite images from satellite data is crucial for crop mapping over defined periods. However, producing reliable composites for cropland segmentation presents challenges, particularly in maintaining temporal coherence and preserving key phenological stages in time series data. This study proposes a compositing method that improves temporal coherence for tracking phenological stages in deep learning–based cropland segmentation. The compositing method integrates the near–infrared to blue band reflectance ratio with a Gaussian weighting function to prioritize pixel selection based on temporal proximity to the center of the target month. Sentinel–2 monthly time series composites were generated using Google Earth Engine and evaluated through proximity analysis to assess pixel distribution within the target month and correlations with consecutive months. The performance of deep learning models trained on these composites was further assessed by comparing their segmentation results. To evaluate generalizability, the method was applied across various study areas and across different crop types and environmental conditions. The results consistently show that proposed method outperforms other techniques in preserving temporal continuity, reducing cloud–related noise, and maintaining the coherence necessary for deep learning models to effectively track crop growth patterns."

 A robust and trustworthy rainfall projection over the Indian landmass is vital for devising climate adaptation strategies. However, past studies show large inter-model spread in Indian Summer monsoon (ISM) rainfall projections thus calling for more detailed investigations on the underlying process. In the present study, we investigate this aspect using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) model projections (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, SSP5–8.5) and historical simulations. The Multi-Model Ensemble mean (MME) results show intensification of ISM rainfall at the end of the 21st century with ISM rainfall increasing by 1.6 ± 0.8 mm/day under SSP5–8.5 scenario. A moisture budget analysis for the MME further infers that the thermodynamic effect (TH) due to global warming plays a dominant role in enhancing ISM rainfall in the projections, with its dynamic counterpart (DY) assuming an additional contribution. It is also revealed that both DY and TH terms contribute to the inter-model uncertainty in ISM rainfall, but with DY dominating over the other this time. The inter-model uncertainty in DY and ISM rainfall changes is linked to inter-model spread in interhemispheric thermal contrast which in-turn depends on the diversity in Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) and Global Mean Temperature (GMT) among the models. Intriguingly, when we remove the inter-model diversity in ECS through a GMT scaling, an Atlantic meridional surface temperature gradient, involving both land and ocean, emerges as a crucial driver in controlling the uncertainty in both DY and ISM rainfall changes, and drives large-scale monsoon circulation changes over African and the Indian subcontinents."
