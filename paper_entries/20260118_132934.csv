Utilizing reactive transport modeling, we demonstrate that CO2 leakage can markedly decrease the pH and thus elevate As concentrations downstream of the leakage point, primarily due to As desorption from adsorbents under acidified conditions. Results indicate that the extent of pH decrease and As enrichment is significantly attenuated in aquifers abundant in adsorption sites. Furthermore, we demonstrate that arsenic mobilization is redox-dependent, as the reduction of As(V) to As(III) under favorable conditions leads to arsenic scavenging, driven by the superior adsorption affinity of As(III) on aquifer minerals. Our findings highlight the critical importance of thoroughly characterizing both adsorption site density and redox potential to accurately assess the risks of CO2 leakage-induced arsenic contamination in groundwater systems. The identified geochemical controls provide a valuable reference for predictive modeling of As enrichment in carbon sequestration projects."

Conventionally, extracellular catalysis is primarily attributed to biotic enzymes. However, the contribution of abiotic processes to extracellular catalysis remains largely unquantified in terrestrial ecosystems, leading to inaccuracy in our understanding of soil carbon degradation potentials and responses to global changes. Here using a large-scale investigation across diverse ecosystems, assisted with validation experiments and laboratory simulations with commonly occurring soil minerals, we demonstrate that abiotic catalysis, primarily driven by iron- and manganese-containing minerals, contributes on average 43% (7–99%) and 54% (15–92%) of total oxidative and hydrolytic activities in soils, respectively. Moreover, unlike enzyme-driven catalysis that varies with environmental changes, abiotic catalysis maintains a constant activity under varying temperature, pH, microbial activity, and moisture conditions. Based on the large-scale soil survey results, we further reveal that abiotic catalysis plays particularly important roles in biologically unfavorable environments such as deep soils and wetlands where reactive minerals accumulate. Overall, our findings refine the current enzyme-centric paradigm and reveal the previously underappreciated role of abiotic catalysis in regulating soil carbon decomposition and climate feedbacks across terrestrial ecosystems."

Early onset liver cancer, diagnosed before the age of 50, is becoming prevalent, suggesting the potential influence of emerging environmental exposures. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants that have been linked to liver toxicity in humans and shown to cause hepatotoxic effects in animals, but their role in liver cancer remains unclear. This systematic review synthesizes evidence from animal and epidemiological studies to evaluate associations between PFAS exposure and liver cancer risk. PubMed and Embase were searched through November 2025 for studies on PFAS and liver cancer. Data were independently extracted by two reviewers, and quality was assessed using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines. Twenty-three studies (seven animal, 16 human) met inclusion criteria. Most studies focused on legacy PFAS, primarily perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). Animal studies demonstrated increased liver tumor incidence with high-dose PFAS exposure. Human epidemiological findings were mixed: three studies reported positive associations between PFAS and liver cancer, while others showed null associations.While animal studies strongly suggest hepatocarcinogenic effects of PFAS, epidemiological evidence remains inconsistent. Large, prospective studies with robust exposure assessment are needed to clarify these associations and inform public health policy."

This work aimed to develop a SciRAP tool for the evaluation of the reliability and relevance of observational epidemiological studies (SciRAPepi tool), including cross-sectional, classical case-control, nested case-control, and cohort studies. A first version of the SciRAPepi tool was created, and an expert testing round was conducted to assess its scientific soundness and user-friendliness. Thirty-seven epidemiologists and risk assessors took part in the testing using the tool to evaluate four epidemiological studies representing the main epidemiological study designs. The majority of experts considered the criteria appropriate, and overall evaluations indicated good consistency across most criteria. Based on the testing results, the tool was further developed and refined. Together with the SciRAPepi tool, guidance and instructions on its use were developed, along with a reporting checklist to support researchers in reporting their studies. The SciRAPepi tool intends to enhance the use of reliable epidemiological data in the hazard and risk assessment of chemicals and other scientific assessments, offering a broader range of options for evaluating these data for epidemiologists and risk assessors."

However, potential biases in spatial distribution, magnitude, and trends in ozone simulated by global chemistry-climate models limit their applicability in regional evaluations. In this study, LightGBM, a machine learning (ML) algorithm, is applied to correct biases in CESM2-simulated ozone over China, the United States, and Europe and to calibrate future projections under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1–2.6 and SSP5–8.5) from 2020 to 2060. The ML-based correction significantly improves spatial distribution and reduces bias by 40 to 60%, also reversing the potentially incorrect trend under SSP1–2.6 in eastern China. When the ML-based correction is applied to CESM2 projections, the warm-season mean ozone shows substantial changes from 2020 to 2060. Under SSP1–2.6, corrected ozone decreases by 13.5, 17.9, and 13.7 μg/m3 in China, the United States, and Europe, respectively. In contrast, under SSP5–8.5, ozone increases over the same period by 9.4, 2.0, and 5.2 μg/m3 in these regions. The decomposition analysis shows that anthropogenic emission changes dominate future ozone trends, while a strong climate penalty occurs in polluted eastern China and climate benefits are found in western China, the United States, and Europe under SSP5–8.5. These findings demonstrate the value of combining ML with chemistry-climate models to produce more accurate air quality projections, indicating more effective and region-specific environmental protection strategies."

However, nanoenabled agriculture must balance the proposed benefits with potential risks associated with material incorporation into soil matrices. This work establishes a full-process risk assessment profile for MoS2 encompassing precursor particles, exfoliated nanosheets, and dissolved ionic species using the soil invertebrate Eisenia fetida under exposure-recovery cycles. The results showed that although precursor MoS2 exposure at 5–50 mg Mo/kg for 7 days significantly activated (p < 0.001) earthworm lumbrokinase (9.4%), antimicrobial peptide (10.2–14.0%), and hemolysin (11.9%) levels compared to the control, the biota exhibited transient immune memory and persistence upon another 7 days of recovery. Once exfoliated to nanosheet form at a consistent 5–50 mg Mo/kg dose range, more pronounced ion release (3.8–6.4%) and prolonged in vivo accumulation (43.9–55.4% excluded) of MoS2 nanosheets mediated persistent immune-related gene initiation. Importantly, the filamentous extension of external DNA between immune cells and deterministic clustering of endosymbiotic microbial communities were shown to collaboratively establish the in vivo homeostasis after MoS2 nanosheet exposure. These findings mechanistically demonstrate the persistent stress on soil invertebrate immune systems under MoS2 nanosheet exposure and highlight the need to link nanoenabled agriculture to soil eco-sustainability."

For centuries, this process has been regarded as merely a process of charge redistribution without involving any redox reactions. By using NO3– reduction as a model reaction, this study demonstrated for the first time that water flow drives abiotic denitrification associated with streaming potential generation. The nitrate (NO3–) reduction rate reached 10.6 μmol·L–1·d–1, which is comparable to that of FeS-driven chemical NO3– reduction (75.0–380 μmol·L–1·d–1) and significantly higher than that of photochemistry-driven NO3– reduction (0.1–1 μmol·L–1·d–1). Through monitoring of nitrogenous products and 15NO3– isotopic experiments, we showed that NO3– was selectively reduced to nitrogen (99%) via nitrite and nitrous oxide, confirming a denitrification process. Electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR) spectroscopy using DMPO as the probe detected the generation of hydrogen radicals (H•), which served as the reducing force for NO3– reduction. Using TEMPO as the electron probe, linear electron production was observed with an electron efficiency of 6.3% for NO3– denitrification. Moreover, H218O isotope experiments demonstrated that water oxidation is the ultimate electron source for NO3– reduction, indicating a chemical-free NO3– reduction process. An electric field strength of approximately 106 V/cm was detected using surface-enhanced Raman scattering, providing evidence of a strong interfacial electric field (IEF)-induced electron transfer process during water flow. This work reveals ubiquitous but long-overlooked redox reactions associated with streaming potentials. Water-flow-driven denitrification also highlights a newly identified abiotic NO3– elimination pathway, suggesting potent chemical-free NO3– remediation strategies."

Here we reveal the critical yet overlooked roles of the adsorbent/adsorbate interfacial dynamics and nanoconfinement effects in governing HMC removal. Using UiO-66(Zr), a zirconium-based metal–organic framework (MOF), we demonstrate that interfacial proton transfer induces rapid acidification, decomplexing Cu(II)–carboxyl species into free copper ions and ligands. Nanoconfinement within UiO-66(Zr) octahedral cavities promotes ligand deprotonation and selective adsorption, while further released copper ions are precipitated via alkali treatment. This synergy achieves over 99.95% Cu removal, surpassing standalone methods. Fixed-bed column experiments validated its practicality, producing 1828 bed volumes of compliant water (<0.3 mg Cu/L) and enabling Cu recovery, outperforming individual components by 6–208-fold. Density functional theory calculations confirm stronger MOF interactions with deprotonated ligands than complexes, driven by electrostatic and Lewis acid–base interactions. This work highlights the mechanistic understanding of HMC removal by bridging dynamic interfacial processes and nanoconfinement-driven reaction pathways, offering a cost-effective, scalable solution for metal recovery as well."

Convergence was limited: Only 16% of MP categories were shared (notably black fibrous PET), and high-density MPs consistently accumulated in sediments in both ecosystems. However, divergence was pronounced. Seagrass meadows acted as selective filters that facilitated sedimentation of larger MPs, leaving smaller fractions to dominate transport to reefs, where they accumulated on coral surfaces and tissues. Notably, biological selectivity altered this pattern internally: while small MPs were prevalent, coral tissues disproportionately accumulated large (1–2 mm), high-density transparent fibers, likely triggered by physical entanglement and prey-mimicking optical cues. Seagrass leaves intercepted high-density MPs on surfaces, whereas corals were highly susceptible to internal accumulation within tissues and skeletons. Furthermore, coral skeletons served as long-term archives sequestering diverse, predominantly high-density MPs, while seagrass leaves acted as short-term dynamic traps with significantly higher surface abundance. Specifically, surface accumulation was morphologically driven, whereas internal incorporation in corals was biologically regulated and decoupled from surface loads. Mechanistically, these patterns suggest that intrinsic biological modulation is the primary driver of MP heterogeneity between ecosystems. These findings highlight the need for habitat-specific risk assessments."

Barchyn;Tyler Gough;Coleman Vollrath,Source Category Attribution of Methane Emissions in Calgary Using Positive Matrix Factorization,"Cities emit methane (CH4) and have a role to play in mitigating the climate impacts of their emissions. Research suggests that CH4 emissions from most North American cities have large contributions from natural gas distribution and end use. In this work, we examine trace gas measurements from a central air monitoring station in Calgary, Alberta, Canada to attribute the city’s CH4 emissions to major source categories. Using positive matrix factorization (PMF), we identified four primary CH4 emissions source categories: natural gas─fugitives, natural gas─incomplete combustion, waste/biogenic, and petroleum product processing. Results from PMF modeling indicate that the bulk of CH4 emissions in Calgary are from natural gas fugitives and incomplete combustion (81% ± 35%). This is much higher than the proportion derived from available bottom-up emissions inventories. The CH4 emissions from natural gas sources increase in winter and may be related to increased natural gas use for space heating. Emissions from waste/biogenic sources were the next largest contributor, which doubled in warmer months, consistent with temperature-driven microbial activity. Though relatively small, CH4 emissions from petroleum product processing are non-negligible and consistent. Overall, these findings underscore the need for targeted mitigation strategies focused on the natural gas supply chain, while also highlighting the influence of seasonal dynamics on urban CH4 emissions."

This study implements a new turbulent orographic form drag (TOFD) parameterization scheme using 30‐m‐resolution terrain data in the WRF‐Chem model. Over a 1‐month simulation, this scheme reduced the overestimated surface wind speed by 45%. Compared with observations from 41 meteorological stations and one radio‐sounding station in the Taklimakan Desert, it also decreased the root mean square errors for surface and near‐surface winds by about 20% and 5%, respectively. Furthermore, the 30‐day simulation showed a 31% reduction in PM10 RMSE and a better‐matched aerosol optical depth distribution. The results demonstrate that the novel TOFD scheme, which utilizes high‐resolution terrain data, effectively resolves dunes and accurately accounts for the drag of small dunes on the near‐surface atmosphere in deserts."

Wrangell in Southcentral Alaska,"Recent studies have challenged the classical view of magma chambers as ephemeral, melt‐rich bodies confined to shallow depths beneath arc volcanoes at subduction zones. Instead, increasing evidence supports the existence of long‐lived, vertically extensive magmatic systems with persistent partial melts within the crust. Nevertheless, the depth and extent of crustal magma reservoirs remain poorly constrained. We use 549 P‐wave receiver function events at station AV.WACK and 223 at AV.WAZA to image the crustal structure beneath Mt. Wrangell in southcentral Alaska. We identify a prominent low‐velocity layer in the lower crust, approximately 4–9 km thick and 40 km wide, and a narrower low‐velocity layer at shallower depths. These observations suggest a large lower‐crustal magma chamber containing 9%–33% melt and a localized shallow reservoir with ∼10% melt, supporting the existence of a long‐lived, multi‐layered magmatic system. Our findings provide critical constraints for evaluating and monitoring volcanic hazards in this region."

Accurate simulation of such compound extremes by global climate models underpins reliable climate projections for spatially compound risk assessment. Using complex network analysis combined with event synchronization, here we evaluate the performance of 11 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models in representing global synchronized structures of extreme precipitation during 1981–2014. Compared to state‐of‐the‐art reanalysis data, CMIP6 models effectively capture the scale‐dependent behavior of synchronized event pairs, particularly for teleconnections beyond 2,500 km. While the CMIP6 multi‐model ensemble mean overestimates short‐range (300–2,500 km) synchronization frequency by 5.7%, it well reproduces the overall network topology of global extreme precipitation. However, significant regional biases emerge in monsoon regions, where models systematically underestimate node connectivity by more than 20% during boreal summer, highlighting key areas for model improvement in simulating long‐distance synchronized precipitation events."

Using multisource cloud, aerosol, and meteorology data during summer of 2015–2024, this study investigates ACI from the perspective of aerosol size (denoted by Ångström exponent, AE) over the ocean and land in eastern China. Our findings reveal that at a fixed cloud water path, the cloud droplet effective radius (CER) increases with the aerosol index (AI) under high‐AE conditions (fine‐mode aerosols), while CER decreases with increasing AI when AE is below 1.4 (coarse‐mode aerosols) in both regions. We interpret the opposite correlations as arising from aerosol size‐dependent regulation of cloud‐nucleating ability, which leads to distinct dominant cloud microphysical processes. Over land, smaller aerosols with lower cloud‐nucleating ability lead to weaker competition for water vapor and the collision‐coalescence process becomes dominant due to the enhanced turbulence as aerosols increase. Conversely, activation efficiency is significantly stronger for coarse‐mode aerosols over the ocean and the competition effect becomes the dominant process. In addition, the dominant aerosol size decreases as cloud top pressure increases over land, leading to a transition in the CER‐AI relationships from negative to positive. The link between lower cloud tops and finer aerosols is consistent with the enhanced radiative stabilization induced by a higher proportion of fine aerosols (often light‐absorbing). In contrast, AE values over the ocean remain consistently low, resulting in persistent negative correlations. Despite variations in meteorological conditions, the opposite correlations under dominant coarse‐ and fine‐mode aerosol conditions still exist."

Simulations in winter of the North China Plain (NCP) reveal that non‐ideal treatment enhances condensation of organics species and water vapor, amplifies interactions between OA, aerosol liquid water content (ALWC), and secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA, pSO42−, pNO3− and pNH4+). The revised framework reduces mean bias in OA and SIA predictions from normalized mean bias (NMB) of −18.4% to −2.9%, −33.4% to −23.0%, −2.0% to −0.3%, and −35.4% to −30.2%, respectively, achieves better performance in reproducing ALWC with better correlation (from 0.81 to 0.88), and improves PM2.5 modeling accuracy (NMB from −18.0% to −9.5%) in “2 + 26” city cluster among the NCP.

Pekeris modes are a class of global normal modes whose energy is trapped in two height regions that is, around the stratopause and the surface, while the energy of Lamb mode is trapped only at the surface. Statistically significant spectral peaks corresponding to both Pekeris and Lamb modes are detected for seven normal modes. The vertical structures closely match theoretical expectations for most modes. Notably, the geopotential height amplitudes of the Pekeris modes are comparable to or greater than those of the Lamb modes in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere, suggesting an important role for Pekeris modes in the dynamics of this region. On the other hand, the Lamb modes are dominant in the stratosphere."

Beck,"Coral Reef Protection May Help Avert Risks to People, Property, and Economic Activity Caused by Projected Reef Degradation","Degradation of coral reefs over the past several decades has caused regional‐scale erosion of the shallow seafloor that serves as a protective barrier against coastal hazards along southeast Florida, USA. How future change in coral reefs may affect coastal flooding, however, has been less attended than other factors contributing to increasing risks such as sea‐level rise and more intense storms. Here, the increased flooding hazard faced by Florida's coastal communities from the projected future degradation of its adjacent coral reefs is evaluated through oceanographic, coastal engineering, habitat, geospatial, and socioeconomic modeling. Risk‐based valuation approaches were followed to map flood zones at 10‐m2 resolution along 430 km of Florida's reef‐lined coast for the current and projected future coral reef conditions. The projected degradation of Florida's coral reefs can increase annual flooding to more than 8.77 km2 of land and 4,980 km of roads, affecting more than 7,315 people, $412.5 million in damages to 1,400 buildings, and economic disruption of $438.1 million annually (2024 US dollars). The degradation of Florida's coral reefs would increase the annual risk to people and structures by more than 42% and 47%, respectively, but is spatially variable due to the heterogeneous alongshore nature and distribution of the reefs and communities: the increased risk exceeds $1 million/km annually to more than 17% of the coastline but also disproportionately would affect vulnerable populations. These results help identify areas where coral reef protection could help reduce the projected increased storm flooding risk to Florida's coastal communities."

Here, the authors demonstrate a membrane-free CO2 hydrogenation electrolyzer that stabilizes pH and enables efficient and stable formic acid production. 
 Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) in acidic electrolytes minimizes CO2 loss and carbonate formation issues, allowing for high CO2 utilization efficiency and showing good potential for practical CO2 upgrading applications. However, in the membrane-based electrolyzer, the proton transfer efficiency across the membrane from the anolyte to the catholyte is crucial for the stability of the catholyte pH in acidic ECR, especially at high current density and during long-term electrolysis. Here, we investigate the effects of proton transfer efficiency and salt precipitation in different acidic ECR electrolyzer and propose a membrane-free CO2 hydrogenation electrolyzer, which couple CO2 reduction and hydrogen oxidation. This electrolyzer design effectively maintains a stable electrolyte pH during long-term electrolysis, and simultaneously achieves high Faradaic efficiency for HCOOH production, high single-pass carbon utilization efficiency, and a lower cell voltage. At a current density of 100 mA cm−2, the system requires only 1.7 V to achieve a 90% HCOOH Faradaic efficiency and demonstrates stable operation for 208 hours. Acidic electrochemical CO2 reduction promises efficient carbon use, but maintaining stable acidity at high current remains a major challenge.

Here, authors present Af-CUT&amp;Tag, a chromatin profiling strategy based on CRISPR-integrated peptide tags which enables sensitive bulk and single-cell mapping of transcriptional regulators. 
 Conventional chromatin profiling techniques are often limited by antibody availability and performance. Here, we introduce Af-CUT&Tag, a target antibody-free method that overcomes these limitations by using CRISPR-integrated peptide tags (HiBiT/ALFA-tag) recognized by engineered binders (LgBiT/NbALFA) fused to a Tn5 transposase. Af-CUT&Tag eliminates dependence on traditional target antibodies, achieving robust specificity and sensitivity with as few as 500 cells. It provides high-quality chromatin profiles, with improved signal-to-noise ratios and library quality compared with conventional antibody-based counterparts, while also enabling single-cell resolution (scAf-CUT&Tag). Applying Af-CUT&Tag to Hippo effectors (YAP1/TAZ) during liver regeneration reveals dynamic chromatin remodeling, including YAP1/TAZ-mediated control of lipid metabolism (e.g., Lpin1, Fasn) and heme clearance (Hpx, Trf). We further identify miR-122 as a critical regulator of these processes, impacting liver regeneration. The versatility of Af-CUT&Tag in cell lines, bulk tissues, and single nuclei establishes it as a powerful tool for studying gene regulation in development, disease, and regeneration.

 Base editors (BEs) enable precise base substitutions, but their size exceeds the packaging capacity of adeno-associated virus (AAV), impeding in vivo applications. Here we design a split BE system that recruits deaminases to Cas9 nickase via coiled-coil heterodimers, resulting in various coiled-coil heterodimers-mediated base editors (CC-BEs), including cytidine base editor (CC-CBE), adenine base editor (CC-ABE), and their derivatives. We reveal that CC-BEs maintain and even improve the editing efficiency of the original unsplit BEs across various cell types and editing scopes, achieving maximum enhancements of 9.6-fold in human immortalized cells and 12.4-fold in primary somatic cells for CC-CBE. Using CC-ABE, we validate in vivo editing efficiency and successfully achieve A-to-G conversion in the Pcsk9 and Dmd genes via dual-AAV vectors in mice. Altogether, we develop a simple and universal strategy to address the challenges posed by the large size of BEs without compromising editing efficiency for base substitutions in vivo.

This study identifies regions of high avian biodiversity and individual bird species predicted to be highly exposed to future high severity. 
 Fire is a pervasive biogeographic process that shapes biodiversity globally and is now experiencing unprecedented changes. Despite well documented impacts of fires on biodiversity, we do not know where biodiversity might be most vulnerable to changing fire regimes. We leverage recent advancements in fire forecasting and species distribution modeling to assess the exposure of bird species richness, community uniqueness, and functional richness to altered fire regimes in the western United States. We find that 55-58% of biodiversity hotspots are classified as “refugia”, where high biodiversity intersects with predicted low severity burn areas. In contrast, 24-30% of biodiversity hotspots are classified as “areas of concern”, where high biodiversity intersected with predicted high severity burn areas. Over half (52-60%) of “areas of concern” occur in geographies with historically low-severity fire regimes; a fire regime mismatch indicating a potential threat to biodiversity. We find that species with a preference for high-density vegetation and with shallower beak depth are most likely to be exposed to high severity fire, indicating a potential for habitat losses for species with these traits. Our findings reinforce calls for targeted management to reduce impacts of future fire where it is predicted to be outside the historical range of variation. Changing fire regimes, leading to higher likelihood of high severity fire, are having unknown impacts on biodiversity.

 Diet plays a crucial role in health, with low-carbohydrate diets often proposed to exert metabolic benefits. We aim to investigate metabolomic adaptations in 164 adults with overweight or obesity who were randomly assigned to high- (n = 54), moderate- (n = 53), or low-carbohydrate (n = 57) diets during a 20-week weight-loss maintenance phase of the Framingham State Food Study [(FS)2], a controlled, parallel feeding trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02068885). We measure fasting plasma metabolites by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using samples from 147 participants who completed the study (n = 45, 48, and 54 in the high-, moderate-, and low-carbohydrate diet groups, respectively). Significant associations (False Discovery Rate<0.05) are identified between carbohydrate-to-fat ratio (CFR) and diet-induced changes in 148 of 479 metabolites at 20 weeks, with nearly all showing consistent trends at 10 and 20 weeks. Phosphatidylcholines plasmanyls/plasmalogens, phosphatidylethanolamines plasmanyls/plasmalogens, and sphingomyelins generally decrease with higher CFR, whereas lysophosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylethanolamines, and triglycerides generally increase. Our findings are largely reproducible in an independent feeding trial involving diets with similar CFR (Popular Diets Study, ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00315354). Eleven triglyceride species (≤3 double bonds), linked to type 2 diabetes risk, increase with higher CFR. Our findings demonstrate metabolomic changes caused by varying CFR dietary patterns, offering potential insights into mechanisms that could guide targeted dietary intervention strategies.

Here, the authors show that Smc5/6 junction polarity preferences, targeting, and dwell times are determined by its structural modules as well as the RPA and PCNA genomic factors. 
 Smc5/6 is an essential genome maintenance complex that interacts with double-stranded (ds) DNA, single-stranded (ss) DNA, and ss-dsDNA junctions. DNA association underlies Smc5/6’s functions in managing intermediates generated during genome replication and repair. However, the mechanisms of this activity are not fully understood. Here, we report a single-molecule study examining Smc5/6 association with a dsDNA substrate containing a ssDNA gap with defined 3’ and 5’ junctions. We found that Smc5/6 associates with both 3’ and 5’ junctions but prefers the 3’ junction in the presence of the ssDNA-binding complex RPA. Further, Smc5/6’s junction association frequency and dwell time are regulated by two non-SMC subcomplexes and DNA binding residues of Smc6. Moreover, Smc5/6 prefers binding to junction sites free of the sliding clamp PCNA over those occupied with it. These results suggest that Smc5/6 utilizes its multiple structural modules to associate with junction sites in coordination with other genome maintenance factors.

 The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is a dominant mode of variability in the Northern Hemisphere with strong impacts on temperature, precipitation, and storminess. The predictive skill of the NAO on annual to decadal scales is therefore an important topic, which is often studied using (initialized) climate models. The temporal structure of a time series is closely related to its predictability, and on inter-annual time scales the observed NAO is frequently described to have power at 2–10 years and sometimes with a distinct peak around 8 years. However, the observational record is brief, and such estimates have high uncertainty. Here, we present a thorough study to address the following questions: (1) Is the winter mean NAO distinguishable from white noise? (2) Does the temporal structure of the NAO differ between observations and historical experiments with contemporary climate models (CMIP6)? To this end, we use a range of statistical tools in both the temporal and spectral domains: Power-spectra, wavelet-spectra, autoregressive models, and various well-known time series test statistics. Overall, for both the observed and modelled NAO we find little evidence to reject the null-hypothesis of white noise. For observations, the peak in the power spectrum near 8 years is, taken alone, significant in the period after 1950 but not before. However, considering the complete spectrum, significant peaks will often occur at some frequencies, even for white noise. The large CMIP6 multi-model ensemble is statistically very similar to an ensemble of similar size of white noise. These results suggest limited decadal predictability of the NAO."

 During the last glacial period, Heinrich Stadials disrupted North Atlantic circulation and induced major continental climate shifts. However, their spatial variability and latitudinal intensity remain poorly constrained. Here we investigate Heinrich Stadial signals across the West Mediterranean, West Africa and West-Central Africa by integrating pollen-based quantitative precipitation reconstructions, paleohydrological records and HadCM3B climate simulations. Results reveal pronounced aridity in the West Mediterranean, driven by reduced evaporation and weakened westerlies. West Africa also experienced aridity, primarily linked to intensified wind systems, including the northeast trade winds and African easterly jet. Notably, Heinrich Stadial 3 is absent in this region. By contrast, Heinrich Stadials are undetected in West-Central Africa, likely due to its transitional position between arid northern and humid southern air masses, positive evaporation-precipitation anomalies, and the influence of southeast trade winds that sustained humidity. These findings highlight strong regional contrasts in the Heinrich Stadial impacts over the last 70 kyr.

 Recent advances in deep learning and multimodal data fusion technologies have significantly enhanced hyperspectral image (HSI) classification performance. Nevertheless, classification accuracy of hyperspectral data continues to degrade substantially under diverse degradation scenarios, such as noise interference, spectral distortion, or reduced resolution. To robustly address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel cross-modal guided classification framework that integrates active remote sensing data (e.g., LiDAR) to improve classification resilience under degraded conditions. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Modal Feature Pyramid Guidance (CMFPG) module, which effectively utilizes cross-modal information across multiple levels and scales to guide hyperspectral feature extraction and fusion, thereby enhancing modeling stability in degraded environments. Additionally, we develop the HyperGroupMix module, which enhances cross-domain adaptability through grouping spectral bands, extracting statistical features, and transferring features across samples. Experimental results conducted under complex degradation conditions demonstrate that our proposed method exhibits stable high-level classification accuracy and robustness in overall performance.

 Southeast Asia faces rapid growth in energy demand and continues to depend heavily on coal-based generation, creating an urgent need for renewable alternatives that can be deployed at scale. Biomass residues from agriculture represent an abundant but underutilized resource in the region. This study develops a machine learning–based spatial economic framework to quantify biomass energy potential from paddy, oil palm, cassava, and sugarcane residues across eight Southeast Asian countries and assess the feasibility of these residues for hybrid power generation. Crop yields were estimated using Random Forest regression with high-resolution (5 m) remote sensing predictors, achieving model performance achieving a maximum R2 of 0.628. Biomass residues were converted into electricity potential using crop-specific residue-to-product ratios and availability coefficients. The results show that Indonesia and Malaysia possess the highest agricultural residue potential from paddy and oil palm, while sugarcane residues exceed 20,000 MW across the region, with notable concentrations in Laos. Techno-economic modeling indicates that the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) ranges from 0.04 to 0.11 USD/kWh, with payback times of 20–130 months, demonstrating cost competitiveness with coal, especially when the monetized cost of CO2 emissions are included. Spatial hybrid integration analysis reveals that paddy-rich corridors near existing coal plants have the strongest potential for biomass co-firing and hybridization. The proposed framework provides a scalable methodology for regional biomass planning and offers practical insights for policymakers in accelerating renewable energy transition and reducing fossil fuel dependence in Southeast Asia."

Currently, the majority of maps are generated through volunteered efforts, which significantly extends the critical and participatory aspects of geospatial information and provide diverse perspectives and scopes in terms of the geospatial characteristics of a place. However, most of these crowdsourced volunteered maps are often limited in spatial resolution due to file size, editing errors, printing limitations, and image quality issues, among others. This challenge poses a demand for deep learning-enhanced super-resolution reconstruction that can effectively convert low-resolution maps into high-resolution ones. Our previous research has revealed that map reconstruction presents unique requirements for preserving global content and local details involving map annotations and elements, which differ from the objectives of general image reconstruction. In this paper, we integrate MapSR—a CNN-based single map super-resolution reconstruction method we previously developed—into a GAN framework comprising a generator module, a discriminator module, and a local discriminant learning module. This integrated framework enables reconstructing both global map content and individual map elements. To testify the performance of CartoSR, we design three sets of experiments involving comparison with state-of-the-art methods for map super-resolution reconstruction, assessment of GANs’ effectiveness in map reconstruction, and analysis of CartoSR’s scalability. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed CartoSR achieves state-of-the-art performance in single map super-resolution reconstruction. We hope it can serve as a routine for future research in this area."

 Atmospheric inverse modelling for source estimation typically relies on hourly-averaged concentration measurements, overlooking valuable extra information contained in real-world high-frequency data, largely due to the absence of suitable modelling frameworks. We present a novel inverse modelling approach that leverages this information by representing the full concentration probability distribution function (PDF) through concentration percentiles derived from a left-shifted clipped-gamma parameterisation, requiring only the mean and variance of concentration, with intermittency parameterised empirically. Mean and variance are modelled using Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches, respectively, within a backward dispersion framework to efficiently compute percentiles for integration within a Bayesian inversion. Applied to a controlled methane release field experiment at a geological carbon capture and storage site, higher-order percentiles improve emission rate estimates and reduce source location uncertainty compared to mean-based inversions, though location accuracy declines slightly; lower-order percentiles worsen performance, likely due to background methane variability. Percentiles inherently encapsulate mean concentration, so combining both offers no added benefit. The primary limitation lies in variance prediction, which is more uncertain and sensitive to turbulence than mean modelling. Exploiting high-frequency data beyond mean values, the proposed percentile-based inverse modelling (PBIM) approach offers a practical path to improved source estimation, warranting further validation with longer-term, spatially extensive datasets or tracer releases with minimal background interference."

 Aerosols influence the climate system, human health, and the surfaces of machines. The ingestion of aerosols into aircraft engines leads to fouling, erosion, and performance deterioration. This study evaluates data sources used for engine deterioration modeling. For this purpose, a comparison of atmospheric composition reanalysis data with in-situ measurements of a commonly modeled and frequently occurring aerosol species, namely hydrophobic black carbon, is presented. High-resolution observations are obtained from a field campaign performed with the uncrewed aerial system ALADINA (Application of Light-weight Aircraft for Detecting IN-situ Aerosol), near the German airport Berlin-Brandenburg in October 2021. A total of 140 vertical profiles of hydrophobic black carbon and meteorological parameters are compared with mass mixing ratios extracted from two different atmospheric composition reanalysis datasets, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast Atmospheric Composition Reanalysis 4 (EAC4) and the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2). The differences between model outputs and atmospheric measurements are large. 95% of the deviations between measurements and model outputs lie under 8480% in the case of EAC4 data and under 2302% in the case of MERRA-2 data, indicating that the MERRA-2 data better represents the local conditions at the Berlin-Brandenburg airport. The deviations are mainly affected by the stability of the planetary boundary layer, showing the highest discrepancies during well-mixed conditions. The results imply the need to create models in airport proximity that represent currently parametrized micro-scale emission phenomena."

 This study investigated the transport pathways and sectoral potential source areas of PM2.5 in Tangshan in January, April, July, and October of 2020. Utilizing the HYSPLIT model upon MeteoInfo software, cluster analysis was conducted on the backward trajectories of airflow at different starting heights and times. The sectoral potential source areas of PM2.5 in Tangshan were determined by calculating the weighted potential source contribution function (WPSCF) and weighted concentration-weighted trajectory (WCWT) while examining pollution transport pathways. The findings are as follows: Firstly, the higher PM2.5 concentration carried by pollution trajectories in January (114.8 μg m−3) and October (110.7 μg m−3) is mainly due to the impact of short-distance transport through Hebei and Tianjin, trajectory 1 (950 hPa) accounts for 30.52 % (124.8 μg m−3) of the contaminated airflow. Secondly, the potential source area for PM2.5 pollution in Tangshan during January has the highest value of WPSCF and WCWT. WCWT high-value areas exceeding 90 μg m−3 were distributed in the Langfang, parts of Tianjin, Beijing, and the junction of the Hebei Beijing Tianjin. Thirdly, the contribution of various sector sources to Tangshan's PM2.5 concentration varies across different months, with industrial and residential sources being the primary contributors. Fourthly, the airflow trajectories at 500 m and 1000 m heights were consistent. 24-h PM2.5 was more concentrated, and the potential source area (24/72-h) results indicated the high-value areas were industrially dense areas. These findings underscore the importance of regional collaborative efforts and sector collaborative management to mitigate PM2.5 pollution in Tangshan."

 The emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) worsen air quality and pose potential health and environmental risks. The steel industry is an important NMVOCs source category, yet studies on NMVOCs emissions in steel industry remains limited, particularly for stainless steel manufacturing. This study presents a field investigation of NMVOCs emissions for different processes in both stainless steel and carbon steel plants, revealing clear differences in emission characteristics between them. The results show that the NMVOCs emissions were higher in stainless steel production, with notable different species profiles compared to carbon steel plant. The emission of carbon disulfide during the sintering process in stainless steel manufacturing was lower compared to carbon steel production. These discrepancies were attributed to the different raw materials used for production of the two types of steel, and higher fuel consumption and lower combustion efficiency for stainless steel production. The NMVOCs emission factor for stainless steel sintering was 40 times higher than that of carbon steel sintering, thus the NMVOCs emissions from steel production could be underestimated without consideration of this high emission factor. In addition, this study examined the impact of air pollution control devices (APCDs) on NMVOCs emissions for steel production. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and flue gas desulfurization (FGD) technologies demonstrated great NMVOCs removal efficiency, while fabric filter (FF) might elevate NMVOCs emissions. The diverse effects resulted primarily from the removal mechanisms of these APCDs and the physicochemical properties of NMVOCs. Through field measurements, this study improves the understanding of NMVOCs emission characteristics in the steel manufacturing industry and provides valuable insights for development of NMVOCs emission control strategies."

 The Mongolian Plateau (MP), a typical arid and semi-arid region, hosts fragile ecosystems that are highly sensitive to variations in precipitation. Within a summer season, precipitation in the MP exhibits significant 10–30-day variability, accounting for ∼40% of the total precipitation variability. This study investigates the characteristics of quasi-biweekly precipitation in the MP and evaluates its representation in 20 CMIP6 climate models. Surprisingly, all models underestimate the intensity of the quasi-biweekly precipitation (only 35–80%). Further analysis shows that this deficiency mainly results from the insufficiency of dynamic conditions associated with ascending motion rather than the thermodynamic conditions related to moisture. Diagnosis of the scale-decomposed moisture budget equation reveals that the anomalous water vapor in the MP mostly comes from horizontal moisture advection, in which both anomalous southeasterlies transporting the background moisture and background westerlies transporting the moisture perturbations into the MP play positive roles. CMIP6 models reasonably capture these moisture processes, but they poorly simulate the mid-latitude wave-train system that is critical for generating ascending motion. The pronounced positive vorticity advection observed on the lee-side of the Altai Mountains is not captured in the CMIP6 simulations. Consequently, compared to the ascending motion appearing over the entire MP in the observations, the simulated upward motion is only present in the eastern plateau. The negative biases of the circulation anomalies greatly suppress the quasi-biweekly rainfall intensity, highlighting dynamical deficiencies in current climate models."

 Clouds are a critical component of the Earth–atmosphere system, exerting strong influence on climate change and the global water cycle. Temperature is a fundamental parameter governing cloud development and evolution, and its vertical gradient directly shapes the vertical structure of clouds, thereby modulating key cloud physical processes. However, cloud temperature observations remain limited, and previous studies have primarily focused on single-layer clouds (SLC) or a single inversion layer. In this study, ten years of radiosonde data (2014–2023) in Xi’an were used to investigate the occurrence frequency and vertical temperature structure of SLC, double-layer clouds (DLC), and multi-layer clouds (MLC). The results show that the occurrence frequency of SLC tends to decrease over time, while the frequency of DLC and MLC increases year by year in Xi’an. Cloud top heights (CTH) exhibit significant seasonal variations. In SLC, temperature inversions (TI) occur more frequently in the upper cloud during winter and spring and are generally stronger at cloud tops than at cloud bases, with the probability of strong cloud-top TI exceeding that at the cloud base by more than a factor of two. While SLC is dominated by single-layer radiative cooling, TI in DLC and MLC exhibits complex interlayer radiative coupling mechanisms. In DLC and MLC, upper clouds tend to show shallow inversion depths under strong TI, whereas weak TI is associated with deeper inversions. Lower clouds, in contrast, exhibit nearly twice the probability of strong cloud-top TI compared with upper clouds. This pronounced enhancement suggests that radiative forcing from upper clouds plays a key intermediary role in strengthening TI in lower clouds. When temperature gradients are small, however, this enhancement is reduced and inversion development in lower clouds may be suppressed. Overall, these findings clarify the vertical coupling between cloud layers and TI, providing refined insights and valuable observational evidence for future studies on cloud–radiation interactions and cloud physical processes."
