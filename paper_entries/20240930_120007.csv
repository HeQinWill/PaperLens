10.5194/acp-24-10617-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了斯图加特市冬季城市背景下气溶胶的组成、空气质量和边界层动力学。研究发现，冬季静止的气象条件会导致气溶胶的累积，而前一天晚上的云层会减弱温度逆温，加速日出后边界层的混合，从而影响早高峰时段的地面气溶胶稀释。论文还利用遥感和原位观测数据，以及高分辨率大涡模拟模型 PALM-4U，对边界层高度和气溶胶混合进行了评估。研究结果表明，PALM-4U 模型能够模拟气溶胶时空分布，但由于缺少二次气溶胶形成过程以及模型中排放和边界条件的不确定性，模拟结果仍然低估了观测值。,"['aerosol composition', 'air quality', 'boundary layer dynamics', 'remote sensing', 'in situ methods', 'radiosondes', 'large eddy simulation (LES)', 'PALM-4U model', 'air pollution']",Hengheng Zhang;Wei Huang;Xiaoli Shen;Ramakrishna Ramisetty;Junwei Song;Olga Kiseleva;Christopher Claus Holst;Basit Khan;Thomas Leisner;Harald Saathoff,"Aerosol composition, air quality, and boundary layer dynamics in the urban background of Stuttgart in winter","Our study unravels how stagnant winter conditions elevate aerosol levels in Stuttgart. Cloud cover at night plays a pivotal role, impacting morning air quality. Validating a key model, our findings aid accurate air quality predictions, crucial for effective pollution mitigation in urban areas. 
 Aerosol distributions are of great relevance for air quality, especially for cities like Stuttgart, which has limited air exchange due to its location in a basin. We collected a comprehensive set of data from remote sensing and in situ methods including radiosondes for the urban background of downtown Stuttgart to determine the impact of boundary layer mixing processes on local air quality and to evaluate the simulation results of the high-resolution large eddy simulation (LES) model PALM-4U at 10 m grid spacing. Stagnant meteorological conditions caused accumulation of aerosols, and chemical composition analysis shows that ammonium nitrate (37 ± 9 %) and organic aerosol (OA; 34 ± 9 %) dominated during this winter study. Case studies show that clouds during previous nights can weaken temperature inversion and accelerate boundary layer mixing after sunrise by up to 3 h. This is important for ground-level aerosol dilution during the morning rush hour. Furthermore, our observations validate results of the LES model PALM-4U in terms of boundary layer heights and aerosol mixing for 48 h. The simulated aerosol concentrations follow the trend of our observations but are still underestimated by a factor of 4.5 ± 2.1 due to missing secondary aerosol formation processes and uncertainties of emissions and boundary conditions in the model. This paper firstly evaluates the PALM-4U model performance in simulating aerosol spatio-temporal distributions, which can help to improve the LES model and to better understand sources and sinks for air pollution as well as the role of horizontal and vertical transport."

This study aims to enhance the potential of breathomics in various frontiers by categorizing exhaled volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as endogenous or exogenous. Analyzing ambient air and breath samples from 271 volunteers via TD-GC × GC-TOF MS/FID, we identify and quantify 50 common VOCs in exhaled breath. Advanced quantitative structure–property relationships and compartment models are employed to obtain VOCs kinetic parameters. This in-depth approach allows us to accurately determine the alveolar concentration of VOCs and further discern their origins, facilitating personalized application of breathomics in exposure assessment and disease diagnosis. Our findings demonstrate that prolonged external exposure turns humans into secondary pollutant sources. Analysis of endogenous VOCs reveals that internal exposure poses more significant health risks than external. Moreover, by correcting environmental backgrounds, we improve the accuracy of gastrointestinal disease diagnostic models by 15–25%. This advancement in identifying VOC origins via compartmental models promises to elevate the clinical relevance of breathomics, marking a leap forward in exposure assessment and precision medicine."

Drawing from natural sediment research provides valuable insights to address this knowledge gap. One key dimensionless number used to describe sediment transport is the transport stage, referring to the ratio between the flow shear velocity and the particle settling velocity. However, variations in physical properties, such as shape and density, raise concerns about the applicability of existing sediment transport theories to microplastics. To address this challenge, we employed a physical modeling approach, examining 24 different nonbuoyant microplastic particles in a turbulent open channel flow. Utilizing 3D particle tracking, a total of 720 trajectories were recorded and analyzed. Microplastic particles exhibited transport modes akin to natural sediments, including rolling/sliding, saltation, and suspension. The transport stage strongly correlated with these modes, as well as with the mean forward velocity and mean position in the water column. Notably, particle shape emerged as a critical factor influencing transport dynamics. Due to their lower settling velocity, fibers tended to stay closer to the water surface with lower forward velocities compared to spheres. Based on the laboratory results, a new phase diagram for microplastics is introduced analogous to an existing diagram for sediments."

Results indicated that VUV/Fe(VI) could significantly facilitate the CBZ degradation, and the removal efficiencies of VUV/Fe(VI) were 30.9–83.4% higher than those of Fe(VI) at pH = 7.0–9.0. Correspondingly, the degradation rate constants of VUV/Fe(VI) were 2.3–36.0-fold faster than those of Fe(VI). Free radical quenching and probe experiments revealed that the dominant active species of VUV/Fe(VI) were •OH and Fe(V)/Fe(IV), whose contribution ratios were 43.3 to 48.6% and 48.2 to 46.6%, respectively, at pH = 7.0–9.0. VUV combined with Fe(VI) not only effectively mitigated the weak oxidizing ability of Fe(VI) under alkaline conditions (especially pH = 9.0) but also attenuated the deteriorating effect of background constituents on Fe(VI). In different real waters (tap water, river water, WWTPs effluent), VUV/Fe(VI) retained a remarkably enhanced effect on CBZ degradation compared to Fe(VI). Moreover, VUV/Fe(VI) exhibited outstanding performance in the debasement of CBZ and sulfamethoxazole (SMX), as well as six other micropollutants, displaying broad-spectrum capability in degrading micropollutants. Overall, this study developed a novel oxidation process that was efficient and energy-saving for the rapid removal of micropollutants."

The default two‐dimensional (2D) standard Smagorinsky model with a single universal constant in Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF) model has been proven to be over dissipative for TC, leading to underprediction of TC intensity. This study provides the first attempt to implement the physically based 2D dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM) for horizontal turbulence parameterization in WRF model for TC forecasts. The DSM dynamically computes the Smagorinsky coefficient as a function of the resolved flow during the simulation, avoiding the need to prescribe the coefficient a prior. The test results of the DSM in a TC NWP model show that the DSM can significantly improve the wind intensity forecasts compared to the standard Smagorinsky model."

We estimate the LP filter parameters and WEC thresholds for the piecewise‐linear coupling between SRZ and evaporative fraction (EF) at remote sensing and field scale over the Contiguous U.S. We use θS from the Soil Moisture Active‐Passive (SMAP) satellite and 218 in‐situ stations, with EF from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. The estimated SRZ compares well against SMAP Level‐4 estimates and in‐situ θRZ, at the corresponding scale.

It identifies hundreds of precursory failures and shows sustained detection hours before and during the major collapse. Event size and signal‐to‐noise ratio (SNR) are the key performance dependencies. As a critical part of our algorithm operates unsupervised, we suggest that it is suitable for general monitoring of natural hazards."

Simple projections based on modeled exponential decay illustrate that the timing of the return to humidity levels that would have been expected absent the Hunga hydration depends on the ongoing stratospheric water vapor trend. With the Hunga hydration compounding an underlying moistening trend, the stratosphere could remain anomalously humid for an extended period."

However, a warming hole exists in the North Atlantic where SST has cooled by 0.4 K/century during 1900–2017. It has been argued that this cooling is due to a slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), and subpolar North Atlantic SST has thus been utilized to estimate AMOC variability. We assess the robustness of subpolar North Atlantic SST as a proxy for AMOC strength under historical forcing, abrupt quadrupling of CO2, and a medium future emissions pathway, finding that AMOC's fingerprint on SST depends upon forcing scenarios. AMOC is important in warming hole development during significant warming periods, although SST may introduce uncertainties for AMOC reconstruction in stabilized regimes due to diverse forcing mechanisms and decadal variability. Our results caution against using SST alone as a proxy for AMOC variability—both on paleoclimatic and contemporary time scales."

We conducted physical experiments, using homogeneous erodible rock simulants, to study notch‐forming mechanisms under periodic sediment‐laden bore impacts. Our findings reveal shifts in the temporal dynamics of notch development. Initially, swash uprush and vortex formation contribute to a positive feedback loop that creates a shallow and wide notch. Subsequently, upward erosion ceases, and notch backwear and downwear are dominated by the vortex. Eventually, sediment deposition armors the notch floor; this negative feedback loop reduces erosion. The sediment size determines the amount of erosion, with a range of grain sizes generating maximum erosion. This indicates a dependence on the momentum of the sediment particles entrained within the bore. This research reveals fundamental notch formation mechanisms driven by swash abrasion."

Emissions of N2O are controlled by both anthropogenic and environmental factors and can vary by orders of magnitude over short times and distances. This nature of emissions is difficult to capture with models and presents an observational challenge. In the 2021 and 2022 growing season, we collected airborne measurements of N2O over Iowa to characterize N2O emissions at the farm to multi‐county spatial scales across days. We link our airborne observations to surface emissions using a Lagrangian particle dispersion model and quantify emissions using a Bayesian inversion framework. We find emissions magnitudes across Iowa, showing greater skew than modeled predictions, with a small fraction of fields contributing disproportionately to the total [25% of the domain contributing to 52%–77% of total emissions]. In addition to the high spatial variation, we find high temporal variability between flight days by a factor of 2 at the 100 km scale, and an order of magnitude at the 2 km scale], with peak emissions occurring at median soil moisture. This work illustrates the importance of transient, intense emissions from concentrated areas in explaining total cropland emissions, and demonstrates how airborne measurements can provide insights into variation that may be missed by other observational systems. Investigation into environmental factors highlights the need for observations, models and their input data to be spatiotemporally resolved to enable direct comparison, facilitating evaluation of predicted and reported emissions and providing guidance and feedback on mitigation strategies."

Comparison of a control simulation and re‐initialized simulations in which land‐surface feedback is suppressed shows that much of the long rains deficit experienced between 1980 and 2014 is synchronized with the warming of the Northwestern Eurasian landmass. In agreement with the modeling results, multiple observational data sets reveal a strong negative correlation between MAM mean East African rainfall amount and the surface temperature over Northwestern Eurasia. Idealized simulations further indicate that warming in Northwestern Eurasia weakens the regional Hadley Cell and diverts the monsoonal transport of moisture away from Eastern Africa toward Europe and southern Africa, highlighting the role of remote land surface warming on the observed precipitation decline."

The partitioning of n‐alkanes in Nanjing can be primarily explained by the absorption mechanism, while the adsorption mechanism dominates that for n‐alkanes in Denver and PAHs in both cities. To obtain an optimal simulation, the poL of n‐alkanes and PAHs was estimated using the SPARC and SIMPOL—two group contribution methods, respectively, and the difference between desorption and vaporization enthalpies was set between 2 and 3 kcal mol−1 for n‐alkanes in Denver and PAHs in both cities.

Here we document a bias in the magnitude and extent of minimum temperature extremes in the CMIP6 model ensemble, relative to ERA5. The bias is present in the southern Cascadia region (i.e., Pacific Northwestern United States and southwestern British Columbia, Canada, spanning from the coast to the Rocky Mountains), with some models showing a bias magnitude in excess of −10°C in the first percentile of daily winter minimum temperature. The sea level pressure pattern for these events is similar in CMIP6 models and ERA5, showing high anomalies in the Northeast Pacific that are indicative of an atmospheric blocking pattern and consequently more northerly flow. Though this atmospheric blocking pattern is typically concurrent with cold winter temperatures across much of North America, Rocky and Cascade mountain ranges prevent the cold air from reaching the southern Cascadia region as confirmed by the observations and reanalysis. Our results suggest that the bias in CMIP6 minimum temperatures is a result of unresolved topography in the Rockies and Cascade mountain ranges, such that the terrain does not adequately block cold air advection from reaching the southern Cascadia region."

Here, global data sets were compiled to disentangle the effects of environmental variables on EF variations along climate and land surface gradients. We found that (a) at annual timescales, ecosystem‐level EF could be expressed as a power law function of aridity index. The relationships of mean annual soil water content (SWC) and leaf area index (LAI) with mean annual EF resembled the traditional evaporative regime theory; (b) at daily timescales, the boosted regression tree method quantitatively revealed that the impacts of environmental variables (including meteorological variables) on EF showed equal importance, especially at humid sites, primarily due to the different response direction and magnitude of latent heat (LE) and sensible heat (H) fluxes to environmental changes. Particularly, the contrasting responses of LE (positive) and H (negative) to SWC, LAI, and relative humidity enhanced the positive effects of those influencing variables on EF; whereas, the correlations between EF and energy‐related factors (i.e., net radiation‐Rn and air temperature‐Ta) deteriorated as both LE and H showed positive response patterns to those variables; (c) meteorological factors were also found to have nonlinear effects on daily EF, further modified by climatic conditions.

Craig,Identifying Robust Decarbonization Pathways for the Western U.S. Electric Power System Under Deep Climate Uncertainty,"Climate change threatens the resource adequacy of future power systems. Existing research and practice lack frameworks for identifying decarbonization pathways that are robust to climate‐related uncertainty. We create such an analytical framework, then use it to assess the robustness of alternative pathways to achieving 60% emissions reductions from 2022 levels by 2040 for the Western U.S. power system. Our framework integrates power system planning and resource adequacy models with 100 climate realizations from a large climate ensemble. Climate realizations drive electricity demand; thermal plant availability; and wind, solar, and hydropower generation. Among five initial decarbonization pathways, all exhibit modest to significant resource adequacy failures under climate realizations in 2040, but certain pathways experience significantly less resource adequacy failures at little additional cost relative to other pathways. By identifying and planning for an extreme climate realization that drives the largest resource adequacy failures across our pathways, we produce a new decarbonization pathway that has no resource adequacy failures under any climate realizations. This new pathway is roughly 5% more expensive than other pathways due to greater capacity investment, and shifts investment from wind to solar and natural gas generators. Our analysis suggests modest increases in investment costs can add significant robustness against climate change in decarbonizing power systems. Our framework can help power system planners adapt to climate change by stress testing future plans to potential climate realizations, and offers a unique bridge between energy system and climate modeling."

However, the potential consequences of floods on specific medical causes in densely populated metropolitan cities has not been characterized yet. Therefore, we evaluate the changes in healthcare utilization patterns after the 2022 Seoul flood using nationwide health insurance data. Based on the flood inundation map, districts within the flooded municipalities of Seoul were classified as severe‐(n = 12), mild‐(n = 22), or non‐(n = 38) flood‐affected districts. Capitalizing on the timing of the flood as a natural experiment, a generalized synthetic control method was applied to estimate changes in the number of disease‐specific hospital visits in flood‐affected districts during 2 weeks after the flood. We found excess hospital visits for external injuries (20.2 visits, 95% CI: −6.0, 45.2) and fewer visits for pregnancy and puerperium (−3.0 visits, 95% CI: −5.1, −0.5) in residents of flooded districts. When comparing severe‐ and non‐flood districts, the increase in hospital visits for external injuries (56.2 visits, 95% CI: 17.2, 93.2) and a decrease in hospital visits related to pregnancy and puerperium (−5.3 visits, 95% CI: −8.4, −1.6) were prominent in residents living in severe‐flood affected districts. Disease specific analysis showed an increase in hospital visits for injuries to the elbow and forearm, ankle and foot injuries, and chronic lower respiratory diseases in severe‐flood‐affected districts. However, these impacts were not observed when comparing the mild‐ and non‐flood‐affected districts. Our study suggests an immediate and substantial change in medical demand following flood exposure, highlighting the importance of public health responses after flood events."

Here, authors report an electrolyte additive which promotes the formation of a bilayer solid electrolyte interphase, increasing the efficiency and utilization of zinc plating and stripping. 
 Construction of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) of zinc (Zn) electrode is an effective strategy to stabilize Zn electrode/electrolyte interface. However, single-layer SEIs of Zn electrodes undergo rupture and consequent failure during repeated Zn plating/stripping. Here, we propose the construction of a robust bilayer SEI that simultaneously achieves homogeneous Zn2+ transport and durable mechanical stability for high Zn utilization rate (ZUR) and Coulombic efficiency (CE) of Zn electrode by adding 1,3-Dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone as a representative electrolyte additive. This bilayer SEI on Zn surface consists of a crystalline ZnCO3-rich outer layer and an amorphous ZnS-rich inner layer. The ordered outer layer improves the mechanical stability during cycling, and the amorphous inner layer homogenizes Zn2+ transport for homogeneous, dense Zn deposition. As a result, the bilayer SEI enables reversible Zn plating/stripping for 4800 cycles with an average CE of 99.95% (± 0.06%). Meanwhile, Zn | |Zn symmetric cells show durable lifetime for over 550 h with a high ZUR of 98% under an areal capacity of 28.4 mAh cm−2. Furthermore, the Zn full cells based on the bilayer SEI functionalized Zn negative electrodes coupled with different positive electrodes all exhibit stable cycling performance under high ZUR. The stabilization of the zinc electrode/electrolyte interface is critical for aqueous zinc battery operation.

Here, the authors solve the Cryo-EM structure of LRRK2 complexed to RAB12 and demonstrate that their interaction regulates cilia formation in astrocytes. 
 The leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) phosphorylates a subset of RAB GTPases, and their phosphorylation levels are elevated by Parkinson’s disease (PD)-linked mutations of LRRK2. However, the precise function of the LRRK2-regulated RAB GTPase in the brain remains to be elucidated. Here, we identify RAB12 as a robust LRRK2 substrate in the mouse brain through phosphoproteomics profiling and solve the structure of RAB12-LRRK2 protein complex through Cryo-EM analysis. Mechanistically, RAB12 cooperates with LRRK2 to inhibit primary ciliogenesis and regulate centrosome homeostasis in astrocytes through enhancing the phosphorylation of RAB10 and recruiting RILPL1, while the functions of RAB12 require a direct interaction with LRRK2 and LRRK2 activity. Furthermore, the ciliary and centrosome defects caused by the PD-linked LRRK2-G2019S mutation are prevented by Rab12 deletion in astrocytes. Thus, our study reveals a physiological function of the RAB12-LRRK2 complex in regulating ciliogenesis and centrosome homeostasis. The RAB12-LRRK2 structure offers a guidance in the therapeutic development of PD by targeting the RAB12-LRRK2 interaction. LRRK2 variants are linked to Parkinson’s disease.

 Exploration of efficient molecular water oxidation catalysts for long-term application remains a key challenge for the conversion of renewable energy sources into fuels. Cuboidal {Co4O4} complexes keep attracting interest as molecular water oxidation catalysts as they combine features of both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis with bio-inspired motifs. However, the application of many cluster-based catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction still requires new stabilization strategies. Drawing inspiration from the stabilizing effects of natural polymers, we introduce a conductive polymer-hybrid approach to covalently immobilize {Co4O4} cubane oxo clusters as oxygen evolution catalysts. Polypyrrole is applied as an efficient p-type conducting polymer that promotes hole transfer during the oxygen evolution reaction, resulting in higher turnover frequency compared to the pristine {Co4O4} oxo cluster and heterogeneous Co-oxide benchmarks. The asymmetric coordination of {Co4O4} not only mitigates catalyst decomposition pathways, but also increases the catalytic efficiency by exposing a directed cofacial dihydroxide motif during catalysis.

 Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis in the hypothalamus has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diet-induced obesity (DIO) and type 2 diabetes; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remain vague and debatable. Here we report that SEL1L-HRD1 protein complex of the highly conserved ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) machinery in POMC-expressing neurons ameliorates diet-induced obesity and its associated complications, partly by regulating the turnover of the long isoform of Leptin receptors (LepRb). Loss of SEL1L in POMC-expressing neurons attenuates leptin signaling and predisposes mice to HFD-associated pathologies including fatty liver, glucose intolerance, insulin and leptin resistance. Mechanistically, nascent LepRb, both wildtype and disease-associated Cys604Ser variant, are misfolding prone and bona fide substrates of SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD. In the absence of SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD, LepRb are largely retained in the ER, in an ER stress-independent manner. This study uncovers an important role of SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD in the pathogenesis of central leptin resistance and leptin signaling. The importance of protein degradation in the ER during leptin signaling has been unclear.

 Mid-ocean ridges are unique, tectonically active geographical units on Earth that profoundly control the ocean environment and dynamics at the global scale. However, high-resolution topographic data from mid-ocean ridges are rarely available due to the difficulty in detecting ocean floors, which further limits ocean research at the global scale. Here, we divide the global mid-ocean ridge system into 2805 tiles and reconstruct their high-resolution topography by using a transfer learning approach with freely available low-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) and limited high-resolution DEMs. A high-frequency terrain feature-based deep residual network is proposed to generate high-resolution global mid-ocean ridge DEMs. In this network, topographic knowledge related to mid-ocean ridges is integrated and quantified to improve the learning efficiency and reconstruction quality of the network. A series of verifications and evaluations demonstrate the reliability of reconstructed topographies for submarine topography research. We observe that reconstructed topography can achieve good environmental understanding and information acquisition in the global mid-ocean ridge range. We find that the complexity of the previous terrain environment is underestimated by 26.63% in terms of the slope gradient and by 14.95% in terms of terrain relief, while a 101.10% information improvement can be obtained for the reconstructed topography. The reconstructed topography indicates that diverse and intricate topographical environments of mid-ocean ridges exist among different ocean regions. The proposed transfer learning method for reconstructing high-resolution mid-ocean ridge topographies is valuable and can be utilized for reconstructing information in regions that are difficult to observe directly and lack sufficient data."

 To gain insights into air quality dynamics, a high-end instrument such as High-Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) alongside an Aethalometer was used to measure the Composite PM2.5 (C-PM2.5) in Lucknow and Kanpur during winter. It encompasses non-refractive PM2.5 (NR-PM2.5) and Black Carbon (BC) mass concentrations. Significant variation was noted in average C-PM2.5 concentrations at both sites, as 168.8 ± 61.3 μg m−3 in Lucknow and 90.7 ± 25.7 μg m−3 in Kanpur. Organics emerged as the predominant component, constituting ∼55%–65% of the C-PM2.5 mass, followed by inorganics (24% and 30%) and BC (20% and 8%). The present study employs Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) on combined organic and inorganic source apportionment, resolving eight and seven source factors at Lucknow and Kanpur, respectively. Both sites exhibit significant contributions from solid-fuel combustion organic aerosol (SFC-OA), with ∼11% in Lucknow and 8% in Kanpur. However, SFC-OA mass concentration in Lucknow, at 24.67 μg m-³, is nearly double that in Kanpur (12.05 μg m-³). This was likely due to domestic coal burning in the nearby households, unregulated open burning, and burning of garbage on roadsides. The study shows that both sites were affected by oxidized biomass burning OA (O-BBOA) emissions, with increased concentration during the night due to dark oxidation by NO3 radicals. The diurnal variation of secondary organic aerosols (SOA), such as O-BBOA and semi-volatile oxygenated OA (SVOOA), shows increasing concentration during daytime hours. Therefore, the photochemical aging (ta) role in SOA formation was analyzed, and it was revealed that the formation might primarily be driven by photochemical oxidation. Additionally, two inorganic-rich factors, sulfate and nitrate-related OA (SO4-OA and NO3-OA) at both sites and additional ammonium chloride-related OA (NH4Cl-OA) resolved at Lucknow. Our study shows that NO3-OA and SO4-OA formation was dominated by aqueous phase processes due to high relative humidity and decline in concentration with increasing ta (ta > 30 h) during winter."

 Light-absorbing organic carbon (i.e., brown carbon, BrC) significantly contributes to light absorption and radiative forcing in the atmospheric particles. However, the secondary formation of BrC and optical properties of secondary BrC are poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed and evaluated the light absorption and environmental effects of BrC and secondary BrC from July 1st to 31st, 2022 (summer) and January 20th to February 20th, 2023 (winter) in Chongqing. BrC and secondary BrC light absorption were estimated via a seven-wavelength aethalometer and the statistical approach. The average values of secondary BrC light absorption (AbsBrC,sec,λ) accounted for 46.2–56.5% of AbsBrC. AbsBrC,370 and AbsBrC,sec,370 were significantly higher during winter (26.2 ± 13.2 and 9.1 ± 5.2 Mm−1 respectively) than that during summer (7.2 ± 4.1 and 5.2 ± 3.5 Mm−1 respectively) (p < 0.001), suggesting secondary formation played an essential role in BrC. A diurnal cycle of AbsBrC,sec,370 was explained by the photobleaching of light-absorbing chromophores under the oxidizing conditions in the daytime, and the formation of chromophores via aqueous reactions with NH4+ and NOx after sunset during winter. PSCF analysis showed that transport of anthropogenic emissions from the northeastern and southeastern areas of Chongqing was the important source of the secondary BrC in PP during winter. During winter, the average values of SFEBrC and SFEBrC,sec were 31.9 and 27.4 W g−1 lower than that during summer (64.7 and 44.5 W g−1), respectively. In contrast, J[NO2] values of SFEBrC and SFEBrC,sec decreased by 23.3% and 8.7% during winter higher than that during summer (19.9% and 5.6%), indicating that BrC and secondary BrC cause substantial radiative effects and atmospheric photochemistry. Overall, this study is helpful in understanding the characterization and secondary formation of BrC and accurately evaluating the environmental effects of BrC in Chongqing."

 Initial and model uncertainties are the main sources of forecast errors, making the single and deterministic forecasts unreliable. To estimate these uncertainties, a growing consensus shifts towards ensemble forecasting, aiming to provide the probability density distribution of the atmosphere. However, current ensemble methods either focus on single-source uncertainties or employ a simple superposition of the two, neglecting the nonlinear interaction between them, and thus fail to reflect the real forecast uncertainty. Motivated by this, this study extends the CNOP approach, defined as the optimal growth considering nonlinear interaction between initial and model parameters, to the scenario of ensemble forecasts and proposes an orthogonal CNOPs method (O-CNOP-IPs). This method concerns the nonlinear effect of initial and model parametric uncertainties through a joint optimization strategy and enhances the estimation of this effect by providing diversity and independent CNOPs (via orthogonality). To evaluate the performance of O-CNOP-IPs, extensive experiments are conducted for North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) ensemble forecasts in the realistically configured Community Earth System Model (CESM). Our findings reveal that the O-CNOP-IPs method outperforms existing methods in forecast skill and reliability, improving deterministic skill by 17.5 % and probabilistic skill by 52 %–63 %. Our dynamic analysis also unveils that this method undergoes rapid development in the early stage and effectively neutralizes errors in control forecasts, significantly enhancing the reliability of ensemble forecasts. It is expected that O-CNOP-IPs plays a significant role in accurately representing the forecast uncertainty of other high-impact weather and climate phenomena."
