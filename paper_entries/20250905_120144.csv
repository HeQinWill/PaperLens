High-accuracy sensors were deployed, and the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) was utilized to simulate CO2 transport, capturing variations and assessing contributions from both anthropogenic and biogenic sources. 
 Atmospheric CO2 concentrations in urban areas reflect a combination of fossil fuel emissions and biogenic fluxes, offering a potential approach to assess city climate policies. However, atmospheric models used to simulate urban CO2 plumes face significant uncertainties, particularly in complex urban environments with dense populations and vegetation. This study addresses these challenges by analyzing CO2 dynamics in the Metropolitan Area of São Paulo (MASP) using the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). Simulations were evaluated against ground-based observations from the METROCLIMA network, the first greenhouse gas monitoring network in South America, and column concentrations (XCO2) from the OCO-2 satellite spanning February to August 2019. To improve biogenic fluxes, we optimized parameters in the Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (VPRM) using eddy covariance flux measurements for key vegetation types, including the Atlantic Forest, Cerrado, and sugarcane. Results show that at the urban site (IAG), the model consistently underestimated CO2 concentrations, with a negative mean bias of −9 ppm throughout the simulation period, likely due to the complexity of vehicular emissions and urban dynamics. In contrast, at the vegetated site (PDJ), simulations showed a consistent positive mean bias of 5 ppm and closely matched observations. Seasonal analyses revealed higher CO2 concentrations in winter, driven by greater atmospheric stability and reduced vegetation uptake estimated by VPRM, while summer exhibited lower levels due to increased mixing and higher agricultural productivity. A comparison of biogenic and anthropogenic scenarios highlights the need for integrated emission modeling and improved representation of biogenic fluxes, anthropogenic emissions, and boundary conditions for high-resolution modeling in tropical regions."
10.5194/acp-25-9843-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文关注亚洲季风反气旋对流层上层甲烷的影响。通过化学传输模型GEOS-Chem，研究了季风动力系统和区域排放对流层上层甲烷增强的综合影响。研究发现，亚洲季风反气旋的东-西振荡与流层上层甲烷的空间分布密切相关，且大规模环流对流层上层甲烷异常的影响比区域地表排放的影响大1-2倍。该研究强调了季风动力学和地表排放之间复杂的相互作用，从而决定了流层上层甲烷的含量。,"['methane', 'upper troposphere', 'Asian monsoon anticyclone', 'atmospheric composition', 'chemical transport model', 'GEOS-Chem']",Sihong Zhu;Mengchu Tao;Zhaonan Cai;Yi Liu;Liang Feng;Pubu Sangmu;Zhongshui Yu;Junji Cao,Significant response of methane in the upper troposphere to subseasonal variability in the Asian monsoon anticyclone,"Methane (CH4) emissions can be transported into the upper troposphere (UT) via the Asian monsoon anticyclone (AMA), driving CH4 enhancements. Whether emissions or upward transport is the dominant factor remains debated. We analyzed UT CH4 variability with AMA dynamics, finding strong ties between CH4 distribution and the AMA's east–west oscillation. When centered near 80° E, vertical transport largely enhances CH4 anomalies, with circulation effects 1–2 times greater than those of emissions. 
 Substantial methane (CH4) emissions in Asia are efficiently transported to the upper troposphere through the monsoon dynamical system, which forms a remarkable seasonal CH4 enhancement in the upper troposphere. Using a chemical transport model, GEOS-Chem, driven by surface optimized CH4 flux, the CH4 enhancement over the Asian monsoon region is explored as a combined effect of the monsoon dynamical system and regionally increased emissions during the late monsoon season. The spatial distributions of CH4 at the upper troposphere show strong subseasonal variability, which is closely tied to the east–west oscillation of the Asian monsoon anticyclone (AMA). Besides, the AMA patterns influence the efficiency of methane-rich air transport to the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. The AMA center around 80° E favors the upward transport from organized monsoon convective sources over the Indian subcontinent and Bay of Bengal, while the AMA center around 105° E favors the source from southwest China transported to the upper troposphere.  When the AMA shifts over the Iranian Plateau, further vertical transport from the convective outflow level to the upper troposphere is weakened and the horizontal redistribution becomes dominant. According to our model sensitivity study, the differences in the upper-troposphere CH4 anomalies caused by large-scale circulation are 1–2 times the difference caused by regional surface emissions. Our research highlights the complex interaction between monsoon dynamics and surface emissions to determine the upper-troposphere methane."

We show that lower wind speeds cause this transition. In addition, we look at the changes in the cloud coverage, the height of the clouds, the cloud particles, and the radiative properties. 
 This case study explores the evolution of clouds during an Arctic cold-air outbreak in the Fram Strait region observed during the HALO–(𝒜𝒞)3 aircraft campaign. Our research provides information about the formation, structure, microphysical and macrophysical properties, and radiative effects and investigates the role of vertical wind shear and buoyancy forces in the transition from regular cloud streets to rather isotropic cloud patterns. Our findings show that lower horizontal boundary layer wind speeds (<12 m s−1) disrupt the formation of cloud streets, leading to more isotropic cloud patterns, characterized by increasing cloud fraction (from 0.73 to 0.84) and cloud top height (from 330 to 390 m), and quantify the increase in liquid water path as well. In addition, we observe an increase in the number concentration of ice crystals in a size range between 100–1000 µm and notable riming processes within organized cloud streets. Concurrent radiation measurements in our case study reveal that isotropic cloud patterns can exhibit either low or high albedo as well as low or high Fnet,TIR, suggesting that these patterns represent different developing stages."

We found that SOA in fine particles is mainly produced through aqueous chemical reactions, especially those involving iron. In contrast, coarse particles form SOA through reactions with ozone and gases from both fossil fuels and natural sources. These findings highlight the need for size-specific air pollution models. 
 Elucidating size-dependent formation mechanisms of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) remains a critical research gap in atmospheric chemistry. Here, we analyzed water-soluble compounds in size-segregated aerosol samples (0.056–18 µm) collected at a coastal site in southern China. Radiocarbon (14C) isotope analysis reveals that fossil sources dominate SOAs in both fine (95.8 %) and coarse (80.4 %) modes, while the small quantity of biogenic SOAs mostly exist in the coarse mode (74.1 %). Fine-mode oxygenated organic carbon (OOC) correlates strongly with polar carbonyl compounds (e.g., glyoxal, methylglyoxal, acetone, and MVK + MACR), while coarse-mode OOC exhibits better correlations with nonpolar aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., toluene, C8 aromatics, C9 aromatics, styrene) and biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (e.g., monoterpenes, isoprene), indicating that the sources of fine- and coarse-mode OOC are different. Multivariate analyses incorporating inorganic ions, pH, water-soluble iron ions, aerosol liquid water content, and O3 revealed divergent size-dependent mechanisms, emphasizing the significant role of aqueous-phase reactions in fine-mode OOC formation, particularly the key contribution of water-soluble Fe ions (r2 = 0.74), while coarse-mode OOC exhibited a notable correlation with O3 (r2 = 0.63). Combining the information on VOC precursors and key components, our study elucidates the fact that aqueous-phase reactions play a key role in fine-mode OOC, especially the Fenton reaction, while gas-phase VOC autoxidation plays an important role in coarse-mode OOC generation. By examining OOC formation across a wide range of particle sizes, our study highlights the critical need for mode-specific treatment of SOA generation in atmospheric chemical transport modeling."

 Climate change is deeply impacting mountain areas around the globe, especially in the Himalaya. However, the lack of long-term meteorological observations at high elevations poses significant challenges to understanding and predicting impacts at various scales. This also represents a serious limit for model-based projections of future behavior of crucial elements of the mountain cryosphere such as glaciers.

The network is composed of seven meteorological stations located between 2660 and 7986 ma.s.l., which have collected continuous climatic data during 30 recent years (1994–2023). In this paper, we provide details regarding instrument types and characteristics as well as data quality control and assessment. The obtained data series are available on a newly created geoportal. We leverage these unique records to present new knowledge on the Himalayan climate, also benefiting from the highest observational climatic series in the world (Pyramid station, located above 5000 ma.s.l., close to the Khumbu Glacier).

These models' computational cost poses a challenge in studying low-probability extreme weather. We use machine learning to construct a new probabilistic system. We give an in-depth explanation of how we constructed this system. We present a thorough pipeline to validate our method. Our method requires fewer computational resources than existing weather and climate models. 
 Simulating low-likelihood high-impact extreme weather events in a warming world is a significant and challenging task for current ensemble forecasting systems.   While these systems presently use up to 100 members, larger ensembles could enrich the sampling of internal variability. They may capture the long tails associated with climate hazards better than traditional ensemble sizes.  Due to computational constraints, it is infeasible to generate huge ensembles (comprised of 1000–10 000 members) with traditional, physics-based numerical models. In this two-part paper, we replace traditional numerical simulations with machine learning (ML) to generate hindcasts of huge ensembles.  In Part 1, we construct an ensemble weather forecasting system based on spherical Fourier neural operators (SFNOs), and we discuss important design decisions for constructing such an ensemble.  The ensemble represents model uncertainty through perturbed-parameter techniques, and it represents initial condition uncertainty through bred vectors, which sample the fastest-growing modes of the forecast.  Using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) as a baseline, we develop an evaluation pipeline composed of mean, spectral, and extreme diagnostics.  With large-scale, distributed SFNOs with 1.1 billion learned parameters, we achieve calibrated probabilistic forecasts.  As the trajectories of the individual members diverge, the ML ensemble mean spectra degrade with lead time, consistent with physical expectations. However, the individual ensemble members' spectra stay constant with lead time.  Therefore, these members simulate realistic weather states during the rollout, and the ML ensemble passes a crucial spectral test in the literature. The IFS and ML ensembles have similar extreme forecast indices, and we show that the ML extreme weather forecasts are reliable and discriminating.  These diagnostics ensure that the ensemble can reliably simulate the time evolution of the atmosphere, including low-likelihood high-impact extremes.  In Part 2, we generate a huge ensemble initialized each day in summer 2023, and we characterize the simulations of extremes."

O'Brien;Michael Pritchard;David Pruitt;Mark Risser;Shashank Subramanian;Jared Willard,Huge ensembles – Part 2: Properties of a huge ensemble of hindcasts generated with spherical Fourier neural operators,"We use machine learning emulators to create a massive ensemble of simulated weather extremes. This ensemble provides a large sample size, which is essential to characterize the statistics of extreme weather events and study their physical mechanisms. Also, these ensembles can be beneficial to accurately forecast the probability of low-likelihood extreme weather. 
 In Part 1, we created an ensemble based on spherical Fourier neural operators. As initial condition perturbations, we used bred vectors, and as model perturbations, we used multiple checkpoints trained independently from scratch.  Based on diagnostics that assess the ensemble's physical fidelity, our ensemble has comparable performance to operational weather forecasting systems.  However, it requires orders-of-magnitude fewer computational resources.  Here in Part 2, we generate a huge ensemble (HENS), with 7424 members initialized each day of summer 2023.  We enumerate the technical requirements for running huge ensembles at this scale. HENS precisely samples the tails of the forecast distribution and presents a detailed sampling of internal variability. HENS has two primary applications: (1) as a large dataset with which to study the statistics and drivers of extreme weather and (2) as a weather forecasting system. For extreme climate statistics, HENS samples events 4σ away from the ensemble mean. At each grid cell, HENS increases the skill of the most accurate ensemble member and enhances coverage of possible future trajectories.  As a weather forecasting model, HENS issues extreme weather forecasts with better uncertainty quantification. It also reduces the probability of outlier events, in which the verification value lies outside the ensemble forecast distribution."

We developed a new method called CRITER, which uses machine learning to fill in the gaps in SST data. Our two-stage approach reconstructs large-scale patterns and refines details. Tested on Mediterranean, Adriatic, and Atlantic sea data, CRITER outperforms current methods, reducing errors by up to 44 %. 
 Satellite observations of sea surface temperature (SST) are essential for accurate weather forecasting and climate modeling. However, these data often suffer from incomplete coverage due to cloud obstruction and limited satellite swath width, which requires development of dense reconstruction algorithms. The current state of the art struggles to accurately recover high-frequency variability, particularly in SST gradients in ocean fronts, eddies, and filaments, which are crucial for downstream processing and predictive tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel two-stage method CRITER (Coarse Reconstruction with ITerative Refinement Network), which consists of two stages. First, it reconstructs low-frequency SST components utilizing a Vision Transformer-based model, leveraging global spatio-temporal correlations in the available observations. Second, a UNet type of network iteratively refines the estimate by recovering high-frequency details. Extensive analysis on datasets from the Mediterranean, Adriatic, and Atlantic seas demonstrates CRITER's superior performance over the current state of the art. Specifically, CRITER achieves up to 44 % lower reconstruction errors of the missing values and over 80 % lower reconstruction errors of the observed values compared to the state of the art."

By utilizing best software practices like modular design, version control, and clear documentation, the new WaterGAP supports collaboration across teams. It can be easily understood, applied, and enhanced by both novice and experienced modellers. Additionally, we share the reprogramming process to assist in the reprogramming of other large geoscientific research software. 
 Global hydrological models (GHMs) improve our understanding of water flows and storage on the continents and have undergone significant advancements in process representation over the past four decades. However, as research questions and GHMs become increasingly complex, maintaining and enhancing existing model codes efficiently has become challenging. Issues such as non-modular design, inconsistent variable naming, insufficient documentation, lack of automated software testing suites, and containerization hinder the sustainability of GHM research software as well as the reproducibility of study results obtained with the help of GHMs. Although some GHMs have been reprogrammed to address these challenges, existing literature focuses on evaluating the quality of model output rather than the quality of the reprogrammed software. To address this research gap and guide other researchers who wish to implement their existing models as sustainable research software, we describe how the most recent version of the GHM WaterGAP was reprogrammed. The success of reprogramming is assessed based on various software sustainability criteria and the FAIR4RS principles – findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability – since the primary goal was to improve software sustainability and research reproducibility, rather than model output quality. Following an agile project management approach, WaterGAP was rewritten from scratch in Python with a modular Model-View-Controller architecture. Due to the switch from C/C++ in the legacy code to Python, execution time doubled. Our evaluation indicates that the reprogramming substantially improved the software's usability, maintainability, and extensibility, making the reprogrammed WaterGAP software much more sustainable than its predecessor. The reprogrammed WaterGAP software can be easily understood, applied, and enhanced by novice and experienced modellers and is suited for collaborative code development across diverse teams and locations, fostering the establishment of a community GHM. We outline four lessons learned from the reprogramming process concerning the sustainability-runtime trade-off, the applicability of the agile approach, software design patterns, variable naming, external documentation, and automation."

We studied 12 peatlands on a trophic gradient in northwestern Canada, including permafrost peat plateaus and thawed bogs and fens, to determine the effects of thaw on MeHg production from measures of soil and porewater MeHg and in situ methylation assays. The production of MeHg was greater in thawed peatlands, especially rich fens, as indicated by higher potential rates of microbial methylation of inorganic mercury (Hg) to MeHg and higher soil %MeHg (MeHg:total Hg). Soil %MeHg was 0.1% in permafrost peat plateaus, 0.7% in bogs, and 2.0% in fens. Microbial analysis indicated three putative methylators (two methanogens and one novel bacteria) as most influential to the community composition, although their abundances were not consistently highest in fens. Fens had a greater range of porewater MeHg concentrations than bogs, potentially due to hydrological flushing, controls on MeHg solubility, or redox disequilibria in fens. MeHg in porewater was strongly associated with dissolved organic matter that had a low aromaticity and a low oxygen-to-carbon ratio. Regionally upscaling our results suggested that the expansion of bogs and fens due to thawing may increase the landscape-scale potential for MeHg production by 65% by 2100, representing a substantial risk to downstream aquatic ecosystems."

The current paradigm suggests that the microbial methylation of inorganic Hg within the oceanic water column produces monomethylmercury (MMHg) and potentially dimethylmercury (DMHg). Reaction rates and main drivers governing MeHg levels (sum of MMHg and DMHg) are poorly constrained. We conducted ambient Hg species measurements and enriched isotopic tracer experiments in waters of two contrasting marine environments: the oligotrophic Mediterranean Sea (MED) and the mesotrophic Atlantic Ocean (ATL). Maximum subsurface MeHg levels were ∼2 times higher in the MED compared to the ATL, essentially driven by higher DMHg concentrations (0.45 ± 0.06 vs 0.16 ± 0.02 pM). Methylation was detectable only in unfiltered subsurface waters and presumably biotically driven. The highest methylation rate (MMHg to DMHg) was observed in subsurface MED waters, while reduction and demethylation rates were highest in surface waters of both environments. Experimental reaction rates and the potential microbial activity (based on 16S rDNA) were aligned with ambient Hg species distributions. Assuming high DMHg stability and applying our fast experimental DMHg formation rates, a newly developed 1D water column model (MED) successfully reproduced the MeHg species distribution, suggesting that DMHg plays a key role in the global marine Hg cycle."

While the cement industry faces increasing pressure to achieve carbon neutrality, there is a lack of existing transport and storage infrastructure, high investment costs, and public perception risks. In this study, cost-effective CCS systems are designed to abate different fractions of the U.S. cement industry using integrated spatial and cost modeling. The median total capture cost ranges from $144/tCO2 to abate 15% of the sector to $215/tCO2 for 100%. Building on the cement-centric system design, the potential for a large-scale pipeline network based around the location of “carbon hubs”─collections of nearby industries─is analyzed to understand opportunities to reduce costs. While connecting to a carbon hub is not economical for all facilities, there is an opportunity to capture 5X the emissions while only increasing the investment by 2X. If the cement industry were to be a first mover in CCS deployment, the industry could have an outsized positive impact across industrial sectors and accelerate industrial CCS deployment. However, support is needed beyond the Section 45Q Tax Credit since it is not enough for a majority of cement plants to invest in CCS infrastructure."

River basins, with high population densities and poor waste management, are particularly exposed to plastic pollution. Floods amplify the presence of plastic in rivers by mobilizing previously deposited materials and introducing new plastics. Yet, the fate of these mobilized plastics remains unclear, with observations suggesting either downstream export or floodplain deposition. This study assesses flood impact on macroplastic deposition along river floodplains, using data from 14 events─five floods and nine nonflood conditions─across two Dutch rivers. Higher flood return periods increased macroplastic deposition, with the two largest floods depositing two to three times more macroplastic than nonflood conditions. Deposition mechanisms varied by flood type. Obstruction-based deposition dominated during an extreme summer flood, when macroplastics accumulated mainly in inundated vegetation. Low-energy deposition prevailed during a long winter flood, with high plastic concentrations found in wide floodplain sections where flow velocities decreased. Flood severity and plastic entry into the environment are both projected to increase. Therefore, we expect an even more prominent role for floods in the global distribution of plastic pollution."

This study evaluated the adsorption of butylparaben (BP) by pristine (PS) and aged polystyrene nanoplastics (APS) and prepared BP-loaded aged PS to analyze their effects on Microcystis aeruginosa. The results showed that APS had stronger BP adsorption and translocation capacity, with APS increasing BP adsorption by 4.34-fold and significantly enhancing its bioconcentration in M. aeruginosa. Compared with the PS–BP treatment, the 1.13 ng/g APS–BP treatment significantly inhibited algal growth, exacerbated cell membrane damage and oxidative stress, and promoted MC-LR synthesis and release. Transcriptome analyses and molecular docking showed that BP inhibited quorum sensing (QS) by binding to luxR, whereas APS further enhanced the binding affinity of BP and blocked the binding of N-acylhomoserine lactone, a natural QS signaling molecule, to its receptor, amplifying the QS inhibitory effect. QS inhibition downregulated genes related to photosynthesis, membrane synthesis, and oxidative stress and upregulated genes related to MC-LR synthesis. These findings revealed that APS is a pollutant carrier that exacerbates cyanobacterial toxicity and MC-LR release through pollutant adsorption, posing significant ecological risks to aquatic ecosystems."

This study assessed the N removal efficiency and potential of 1.75 million SWBs (<0.33 ha) in China’s rice-growing regions, using an N removal model incorporating key biogeochemical factors. Collectively, these SWBs potentially remove approximately 169.97 kt N y–1 from paddy runoff, equivalent to 23.62% of national crop N emissions, yielding an estimated economic benefit of 1.68 billion USD. However, a spatial mismatch between SWB distribution and N emission hotspots hampers the current efficiency, as 23.04% of paddy fields have high N loads but limited SWBs. Increasing SWBs in these critical areas shows better N removal efficiency than a nationwide increase strategy under land resource constraints. Specifically, increasing SWBs from the current 1.08–1.23% of the rice region achieves the most cost-effective 20.96% increase in N removal. Increasing macrophyte coverage in these SWBs to 25–50% could further augment N removal by 5.98–10.58%. This study highlights SWB spatial optimization and macrophyte manipulation as viable strategies to maximize ecological and economic benefits under resource constraints, offering a nature-based solution for N pollution."

The role of organo-mineral associations in regulating glyphosate retention and transformation pathways, however, remains unclear. In this study, we employed time-resolved in situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and microfluidic experiments coupled with LC-MS quantification to track glyphosate and its oxidation byproducts. A model protein (bovine serum albumin; BSA) and two Mn oxides (K-birnessite and hausmannite) were used to represent environmentally relevant interfaces. Our results show that protein adsorption onto Mn oxide surfaces favors the AMPA oxidation pathway over the glycine and sarcosine pathways, particularly under acidic pH. This pathway selectivity correlates with altered surface coordination, where adsorbed protein promotes mononuclear monodentate binding via the phosphonate group. Additionally, protein association diminishes the extent and rate of glyphosate adsorption, desorption, and oxidation by passivating Mn oxide active sites and forming glyphosate–protein complexes at pH 4.6 and 7.2. Given the ubiquity of organo-mineral associations, the shift toward AMPA formation (a toxic and persistent byproduct) has critical implications for human and ecosystem health. These insights advance the mechanistic understanding of glyphosate behavior at redox-active organo-mineral interfaces and inform sustainable soil management and pollution mitigation strategies."

While bulk composition is typically measured, key interfacial processes, including heterogeneous reactions, water uptake, and cloud activation, occur at the surface. Here, we present the first depth-resolved, in-flight X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of natural salt aerosols generated from hypersaline lake brines in the Qaidam Basin, a pristine region on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. These organic-poor aerosols offer a unique view of inorganic interfacial behavior. Using a synchrotron-based in-flight aerosol delivery system, we performed real-time, surface-specific analysis of freely suspended particles. Results reveal strong surface enrichment of minor ions such as Mg2+ and SO42– and depletion of major bulk ions like Na+ and Cl–. This divergence was consistent across aerosol types and confirmed by ion chromatography of the source brines. A simplified two-layer model indicates a subnanometer surface layer that substantially alters surface identity. Minor components, often overlooked in bulk analyses, dominate the interface and may influence reactivity and cloud activation potential.

Despite their importance, HO2-related processes remain insufficiently represented in current air quality models. Here, we provide comprehensive insights into HO2 chemistry using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model together with airborne observations over South Korea during the KORUS-AQ campaign (1 May–9 June, 2016). Analysis of 20 flight scenarios suggests that modeled HO2 levels might be strongly linked to NO distributions. Under low-NO conditions, HO2 was simulated to be 6.0% higher than the observed levels, likely due to a missing pathway. To address this, we incorporated HO2 aerosol uptake into the CMAQ model by applying an uptake coefficient of 0.08, assuming no H2O2 production. Under high-NO conditions, a substantial underestimation of 9.90 ppt in modeled HO2 levels was observed. This discrepancy may be attributed to (i) underestimated isoprene, monoterpene, and CO emissions and (ii) overestimated NO levels. Finally, we further examined the impact of HO2 aerosol uptake on key atmospheric species (e.g., OH, HO2, H2O2, O3, and PM2.5 components) under different NO levels. Our results indicate that most of these species decrease in concentration due to a weakened oxidizing capacity. In contrast, nitrate concentrations increase in low-NO regions, likely driven by HNO3 partitioning facilitated by excess NH3. These findings pave the way for accurate simulations of HO2 radicals and advance our understanding of atmospheric HO2 chemistry."

During the Pleistocene, coccolithophores experienced several periodic high‐abundance and dominance intervals (acmes) that significantly altered the ocean carbon cycle by increasing the production of carbonate in the ocean. However, the reason for these episodes of enhanced calcification is still unclear. Here, we focus on one of the most significant dominance intervals, the Gephyrocapsa caribbeanica acme event, that lasted between ∼500 and 300 thousand years ago. We find that the variations of seawater alkalinity made only a minor contribution to the increased calcification rates during coccolithophore blooms. Rather, coccolithophore carbon isotopic fractionation indicates that coccolithophores employed a stronger bicarbonate pumping to increase intracellular carbon availability. Greater nutrient availability and shallower living depth likely facilitated higher bicarbonate pumping rates. The upregulation of bicarbonate pumping indicates the vital role of nutrients and light, and not only the ocean carbonate system, in the evolution of marine phytoplankton. Models of future coccolithophore calcification response to changing ocean carbon chemistry would, therefore, benefit from a more comprehensive consideration of how light and nutrient availability affect cellular energy budgets and drive carbon uptake."

Chl a bursts were concentrated within 2° of the typhoon center and peaked 1–6 days after passage. The strongest Chl a responses occurred with slow, large typhoons, while fast, small typhoons induced the weakest response. When translation speeds were below 4 m/s, both R34 and speed influenced the Chl a response; above 4 m/s, R34 was the primary driver.

Pulsating aurora is one distinct type of diffuse aurora, caused by quasi‐periodic electron precipitation with energies ranging from a few keV to tens of keV. Recent studies have suggested that pulsating aurora can also be accompanied by relativistic electron precipitation, which can penetrate into the E/D‐layer of the ionosphere and lead to a significant ionospheric response. However, the energy extent and occurrence rate of the relativistic, quasi‐periodic precipitation are not well understood. In this study, we perform a statistical analysis of quasi‐periodic electron precipitation events observed by the low‐altitude, polar‐orbiting ELFIN CubeSats.

 Prokaryotes create adaptive immune memories by acquiring foreign DNA snippets, known as spacers, into the CRISPR array1. In type II CRISPR-Cas systems, the RNA-guided effector Cas9 also assists the acquisition machinery by selecting spacers from protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)-flanked DNA2,3. Here, we uncover the first biological role for Cas9 that is independent of its dual RNA partners. Following depletion of crRNA and/or tracrRNA, Neisseria apoCas9 stimulates spacer acquisition efficiency. Physiologically, Cas9 senses low levels of crRNA in cells with short CRISPR arrays – such as those undergoing array neogenesis or natural array contractions – and dynamically upregulates acquisition to quickly expand the small immune memory banks. As the CRISPR array expands, rising crRNA abundance in turn reduces apoCas9 availability, thereby dampening acquisition to mitigate autoimmunity risks associate with elevated acquisition. While apoCas9’s nuclease lobe alone suffices for stimulating acquisition, only full-length Cas9 responses to crRNA levels to boost acquisition in cells with low immunity depth. Finally, we show that this activity is evolutionarily conserved across multiple type II-C Cas9 orthologs. Altogether, we establish an auto-replenishing feedback mechanism in which apoCas9 safeguards CRISPR immunity depth by acting as both a crRNA sensor and a regulator of spacer acquisition."

 Soybeans fix atmospheric N2 through symbiosis with rhizobia. The relationship between rhizobia and soybeans, particularly those with high nitrous oxide (N2O)-reducing (N2OR) activities, can be leveraged to reduce N2O emissions from agricultural soils. However, inoculating soybeans with these rhizobia under field conditions often fails because of the competition from indigenous rhizobia that possess low or no N2OR activity. In this work, we utilize natural incompatibility systems between soybean and rhizobia to address this challenge. Specifically, Rj2 and GmNNL1 inhibit certain rhizobial infections in response to NopP, an effector protein. By combining a soybean line with a hybrid accumulation of the Rj2 and GmNNL1 genes and bradyrhizobia lacking the nopP gene, we develop a soybean-bradyrhizobial symbiosis system in which strains with high N2OR activity predominantly infect. Our optimize symbiotic system substantially reduces N2O emissions in field and laboratory tests, presenting a promising approach for sustainable agricultural practices.

 The composition of Earth’s core is a fundamental property of the Earth’s deep interior, defining its present structure and long term thermal and magnetic evolution. However, the composition of the core is not well understood, with several combinations of light elements being able to satisfy the traditional constraints from cosmochemistry, core formation and seismology. The classic view of inner core formation does not include the necessity for liquids to be supercooled to below their melting point before freezing. Attempts to calculate the magnitude of this supercooling have found that several binary core compositions are incompatible with inner core nucleation. Here we show, through molecular dynamics simulations, that nucleation from an Fe1−xCx=0.1-0.15 composition is compatible with a range of geophysical constraints. Whilst not a complete description of core chemistry, our results demonstrate that inner core nucleation places a strong constraint on the composition of Earth’s core that may allow discrimination between previously identified potential compositions.

 Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays a key role in metabolic homeostasis through its thermogenic effects and the secretion of regulatory molecules. Here we report that RAP250 haploinsufficiency stimulates BAT in mice, thus contributing to a decrease in fat accumulation. Local in vivo AAV-mediated RAP250 silencing in BAT reduces body weight and fat mass and enhances glucose oxidation, thereby indicating that RAP250 participates in the regulation of BAT metabolic activity. Analysis of the mechanisms led to the finding that Neuritin 1 is produced and released by brown adipocytes, it plays a key metabolic role, and it participates in the enhanced BAT metabolic activity under RAP250 deficiency. Forced overexpression of Neuritin 1 in UCP1-expressing cells markedly decreases fat mass and body weight gain in mice and induces the expression of thermogenic genes in BAT. Neuritin 1-deficient brown adipocytes also shows a reduced β-adrenergic response. We demonstrate a metabolic role of BAT-derived Neuritin 1 acting through an autocrine/paracrine mechanism. Based on our results, Neuritin-1 emerges as a potential target for the treatment of metabolic disorders. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is key for metabolic balance.

 Solar radiation modification-based climate interventions may cause uneven regional hydrological changes while mitigating warming. Here, we investigate the effects of climate interventions on China’s North Drought-South Flood pattern using the Norwegian Earth System Model supplemented by volcanic data. Our results indicate that equatorial stratospheric aerosol injection could mitigate the north-south water divide by reducing inter-hemispheric and equator-to-North-pole temperature gradients, thereby modifying atmospheric circulation and the East Asian monsoon to increase precipitation and surface runoff in northern China while reducing them in the south, compared to the high emissions scenario. This mechanism is supported by observed precipitation changes following the Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption. In contrast, marine cloud brightening may intensify southern flood risks, while cirrus cloud thinning and moderate emissions reduction might exacerbate northern droughts. Our findings reveal distinct regional hydroclimatic impacts of different climate interventions, highlighting potential synergies and trade-offs between their global intervention efficacy and regional water security.

 This study focuses on developing comprehensive malaria risk model for Indonesia, integrating susceptibility, vulnerability, and capacity to better understand and manage malaria risks across the country. The primary objective was to identify high-risk areas and prioritize malaria management efforts by combining machine-deep learning techniques and socioeconomic data. Using Gradient Tree Boosting, Classification and Regression Tree, Random Forest algorithms and Deep Learning Multilayer Perceptron, the study analyzed malaria susceptibility, revealing that 38% of Indonesia’s territory was categorized as highly susceptible, with the provinces of Central Kalimantan, West Kalimantan, East Kalimantan, South Sumatra, and Papua identified as the most affected regions. Novel aspects of this study include integrating age and sex ratios to model vulnerability and calculating healthcare access to assess capacity, which showed that 65% of the territory exhibited high vulnerability and 34% had low healthcare capacity, with Kalimantan and Papua consistently ranking highest in risk factors. By combining these factors, the final malaria risk model identified 88 cities with high malaria risk, of which 60 cities with low Gross Regional Domestic Product were prioritized for intervention.

 Wet scavenging is a critical determinant of aerosol–precipitation interactions, yet its net effect on atmospheric aerosol burdens remains poorly constrained globally. Here, we analyzed 146 rainfall events in total based onfield observations in a subtropical near coastal site, revealing that light rainfall has paradoxically amplified aerosol burdens by +6.1 % averagely, with approximate +40 % for hydrophobic species (e.g., HOA/COA) and +5 %–19 % for secondary hygroscopic components (e.g., sulfate, nitrate, OOA). This contradicts conventional knowledge of light rain wet scavenging, indicating critical flaws in model parameterizations of wet scavenging efficiency. Our study also illustrates a pollution-dependent wet scavenging mechanism and shows efficient removal of aerosol particles under polluted conditions (PM2.5 >30 μg m−3), whereas in very clean atmosphere (PM2.5 <10 μg m−3), precipitation elevates aerosol concentrations by +13 %–100 %, implying that precipitation may shift from a clearing sink to a source of aerosols with the continuous improvement of air pollution in future. Furthermore, we identify a nonlinear size-dependent scavenging threshold of ∼100 nm, where the precipitation shows a transition from production to scavenging of fine aerosols; the 20–30 nm particles show peak increases (+23 %–41 %), while particles of around 600 nm exhibit maximum scavenging (−20 %), yet scavenging declines unexpectedly for larger particles (e.g. >1 μm).

 Substantial nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from permafrost-affected regions could accelerate climate warming, given that N2O exhibits approximately 300 times greater radiative forcing potential than carbon dioxide. Pronounced differences exist in N2O emissions between freeze and thaw periods (FP and TP), but the mechanisms by which environmental factors regulate the production and emission of N2O during these two periods have not been thoroughly examined. We therefore combined static chamber gas chromatography, in-situ soil temperature (ST) and moisture (SM) monitoring, and 16S rRNA sequencing to investigate seasonal N2O variations in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) alpine meadow ecosystem, and assess the relative contributions of environmental and microbial drivers. Our findings indicate that N2O fluxes (−3.15 to 6.10 μg m−2 h−1) fluctuated between weak sources and sinks, peaking during FP, particularly at its late stage with initial surface soil thawing. Soil properties affect N2O emissions by regulating denitrification processes and altering microbial community diversity. During the FP, ST fluctuations control N2O release by modifying mineral nutrient availability. During TP, soil texture modulates denitrification-driven N2O production through its effect on SM. Spring N2O pulses likely originate from microbial reactivation in thawed soil. N2O accumulated in frozen soil may gradually release during vertical profile thawing. On the QTP, a warmer and wetter climate scenario may alter N2O emissions by modifying the duration of the FP and TP and phase-specific hydrothermal allocation. This study provides mechanistic insights for predicting climate change impacts on N2O flux in fragile alpine meadow ecosystems."

 The study presents observational evidence for the impact of Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) concentration and atmospheric thermodynamic conditions on the diffusion growth and collision-coalescence processes in warm cloud evolution. We used multi-band optical data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite (2013–2018) to identify the convective cloud clusters and examine the warm cloud evolution under different thermodynamic and pollution conditions based on cloud top temperature (T) - cloud drop effective radius (re) relationships. Analysis revealed that diffusion growth is predominant under polluted and stable (Estimated Inversion Strength (EIS) > 1 K) atmospheric conditions. In the unstable regime (EIS < 1 K), relative dispersion (ϵ) reaches its maximum (∼0.39) at a CCN concentration of around 1000 cm−3 and supersaturation remains higher at lower CCN concentrations and decreases rapidly beyond ∼1000 cm−3 which marks the transitional point between the aerosol-limited and updraft-limited regimes. However in the stable regime (EIS > 1 K), ϵ remains relatively low (between 0.10 and 0.25) with low supersaturation. In unstable conditions the estimated cloud top entrainment index (ECTEI) is found to be −5.6 ± 1.5 indicating more favourable conditions for entrainment, while in stable conditions ECTEI is found to be −2 ± 3.3 reflecting entrainment suppression. Although the Twomey effect is found to be predominant under stable atmospheric conditions, a nonlinear relationship exists between droplet growth and CCN concentration. In the aerosol limited regime, an increase in growth rate ranging from ∼0.0026 μm/s to 0.0032 μm/s is observed while at high CCN concentrations (above ∼1000 cm−3) growth rates decreases to 0.0025 μm/s. These observations can help refine aerosol–cloud interaction (ACI) parameterizations in climate models, thereby reducing uncertainties in the estimation of aerosol effective radiative forcing under a warming climate."

 The Yangtze River Basin (YRB), home to millions of people and vital farmlands, faces increasing flood risks due to extreme summer rainfall. This study demonstrated that the western North Pacific warm pool (WNPWP) can exert significant impacts on extreme precipitation in YRB through modulating atmospheric intraseasonal activities over the northwestern Pacific, which operates on 25–80-day timescales. Extreme precipitation occurs preferentially during warm WNPWP summers compared to cold WNPWP summers owing to that intraseasonal oscillation (ISO) over the northwestern Pacific is more likely to induce extreme rainfall over the YRB during warm WNPWP summers than cold WNPWP summers. The underlying mechanism involves enhanced southwesterly moisture transport by the anomalous anticyclone over the northwestern Pacific driven by the ISO in its specific phases. Crucially, this transport intensifies remarkably during warm WNPWP summers due to the strengthened anticyclonic background manifested as the westward extension of the Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) in response to warm WNPWP conditions, which is statistically tied to preceding El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events."

Neutrophils, which are recruited in high numbers to the ischemic myocardium, promote these arrhythmias. Comparing neutrophils with macrophages, we found that resistin-like molecule γ (Retnlgor RELMγ) was the most differentially expressed gene in mouse infarcts. RELMγ is part of a pore-forming protein family that defends the host against bacteria by perforating their membranes. In mice with acute infarcts, leukocyte-specificRetnlgdeletion reduced ventricular tachycardia. RELMγ elicited membrane defects that allowed cell exclusion dyes to enter the cardiomyocyte interior and also caused delayed afterdepolarizations and later cardiomyocyte death, both of which are strong arrhythmogenic triggers. Human resistin likewise attacked membranes of liposomes and mammalian cells. We describe how misdirected innate immune defense produces membrane leaks and ventricular arrhythmia."

The usual products are multicarbon mixtures because the critical step of heterolytic hydrogen (H2) dissociation at high temperatures complicates selectivity control. In this study, we report that irradiating gold–titanium dioxide at 365 nanometers induces heterolytic H2dissociation at ambient temperature. This process likely relies on interfacial electric dipoles from photogenerated electrons and holes situated on the metallic gold nanoparticles and interfacial gold–oxygen–titanium scaffolds. The heterolytic H2dissociation is further promoted by light-induced coating of gold nanoparticles with a titanium oxide layer.

Extrusion is thought to be triggered by crowding-induced compression of cells at the intestinal villus tip. In this study, we found instead that a local “tug-of-war” competition between contractile cells regulated extrusion in the intestinal epithelium. We combined quantitative live microscopy, optogenetic induction of tissue tension, genetic perturbation of myosin II activity, and local disruption of the basal cortex in mouse intestines and intestinal organoids. These approaches revealed that a dynamic actomyosin network generates tension throughout the intestinal villi, including the villus tip region. Mechanically weak cells unable to maintain this tension underwent extrusion. Thus, epithelial barrier integrity depends on intercellular mechanics."

Chinnaiyan;Abhijit Parolia,Divergent FOXA1 mutations drive prostate tumorigenesis and therapy-resistant cellular plasticity,"FOXA1 is altered in 10 to 40% of prostate cancers, yet its oncogenic mechanisms remain uncharacterized in vivo. We developed knock-in mouse models representing distinct classes of FOXA1 mutations. Histopathological and multiomic analyses of prostate tissues and organoids revealed that Class 1 mutations, in conjunction withp53inactivation, drive androgen-dependent adenocarcinomas through coactivation of mTORC1/2 and oncogenic AR signaling stemming from chimeric AR-half enhancers. By contrast, Class 2 mutations induce intraluminal plasticity by reprogramming differentiated luminal cells into a progenitor-like state through activation of KLF5 and AP-1 neo-enhancer circuitries, which enables enhanced survival and proliferation even under castrate androgen levels. Our findings establish FOXA1 as a multifaceted oncogene, with distinct mutational classes divergently evolving to drive prostate tumorigenesis or therapy-resistant progression."

Following the transformative impact of single-cell gene expression profiling techniques on numerous fields of human biology, recent years have seen increased application to microbes. We review progress in the development of these techniques and discuss challenges in applying them to microbial communities. We highlight applications for dissecting the microbiome in human health and disease that reveal functional heterogeneity within gut communities, antibiotic responses, and the dynamics of mobile genetic elements. As single-cell gene expression technologies continue to develop, they are becoming ever more essential for examining and modulating the role of microbial communities in clinical and wider environments."

Here, we present a bioinspired twist-hyperbolic metamaterial (THM) integrated with a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) for simultaneously impact buffering and self-powered sensing. The THM-TENG protector exhibits tunable stiffness (40 to 4300 newtons per millimeter), ~70% impact energy absorption, and achieves a specific energy absorption of ~0.25 joules per gram at a weight of only 10 grams. Through triboelectrification, the protector converts mechanical energy into electrical signals, enabling real-time monitoring of impact loads up to 1000 newtons (≤5 hertz). Integrated with a microcontroller unit, wireless transmission, and alarm systems, THM-TENG demonstrates dual functionality in UAVs: mitigating vibration while providing real-time force monitoring, positioning, and early warning, all without external power sources. This work establishes a transformative framework for lightweight, multifunctional protective systems with applications in aerospace, robotics, and autonomous vehicles."
