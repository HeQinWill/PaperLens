Here, we compare the climate and air pollution-related health damages from electric versus diesel long-haul truck fleets. We use truck commodity flows to estimate tailpipe emissions from diesel trucks and regional grid emissions intensities to estimate charging emissions from electric trucks under various grid scenarios. We use a reduced complexity air quality model combined with valuation of air pollution-related premature deaths (using two hazard ratios (HRs)) and quantify the distributional health impacts in different scenarios. We find that annual health and climate costs of the current diesel fleet are $195–$249/capita compared to $174–$205/capita for a new diesel fleet, and $156–$177/capita for an electric fleet, depending on the HR. We find that freight electrification could avoid $6.2–8.5 billion in health and climate damages annually when compared to a fleet of new diesel vehicles (with even higher benefits when compared to the current diesel fleet). However, the Midwest and parts of the Gulf Coast would experience an increase in health damages due to vehicles charging using electricity from coal power plants. If old coal power plants (operating in 1980 or earlier) are replaced with zero-emission generation, electrification of all U.S. freight would result in $32.3–39.2 billion in avoided damages annually and health benefits throughout the U.S. Electrifying transport of consumer manufacturing goods (including electronics, transport equipment, and precision instruments) and food, beverage, and tobacco products would provide the largest absolute health and climate benefits, whereas mixed freight and manufacturing goods would result in the largest benefits per tonne-km. We find small variations in health damages across race and income. These results will help policymakers prioritize electrification and charging investment strategies for the freight transportation sub-sector."

The long-term changes of growing season heatwaves, as well as their impacts on croplands productivity, are crucial to food security, but remain unclear. Here, we investigated changes in the frequency, intensity and magnitude of growing season heatwaves from the past to the future over the global croplands, based on observations and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 models. We introduced an index, gross primary productivity (GPP) exposure, as a proxy of the overall impact of heatwaves on cropland productivity. The results show that the frequency and intensity of growing season heatwaves have increased since 1950 and will continue throughout the 21st century. The increase of the annual accumulated magnitude of growing season heatwaves in the future is mainly contributed by the increase of heatwave frequency. This leads to a global-scale increase in the GPP exposure to growing season heatwaves, with Asia, North America, and Europe being the most affected. The continued increase in GPP exposure is dominated by increases in heatwaves rather than GPP itself. Under the lower emission scenario SSP1-2.6, the global cropland GPP exposure will reduce by 86.11% and 330.47% relative to that under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively, by the end of 21st century. Our results provide crucial insights into potential impacts of heatwaves on cropland productivity and hence food security."
10.5194/acp-24-10323-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了海洋边界层云中气溶胶-云-降水相互作用，使用了来自东大西洋（ACE-ENA）和南大洋（SOCRATES）两个飞机观测的现场数据。研究发现，两个区域的云层特性和气溶胶-云相互作用存在显著差异。SOCRATES 云层拥有更高的云滴浓度和更小的云滴半径，而 ACE-ENA 云层则表现出更强的毛毛雨形成和增长。论文还强调了毛毛雨过程对云下气溶胶预算的影响，以及对气溶胶-云相互作用评估的影响。,"['aerosol', 'cloud', 'precipitation', 'marine boundary layer', 'aircraft', 'in situ measurements', 'cloud droplet', 'drizzle', 'CCN', 'aerosol-cloud interaction', 'ACI']",Xiaojian Zheng;Xiquan Dong;Baike Xi;Timothy Logan;Yuan Wang,Distinctive aerosol–cloud–precipitation interactions  in marine boundary layer clouds from the ACE-ENA  and SOCRATES aircraft field campaigns,"The marine boundary layer aerosol–cloud interactions (ACIs) are examined using in situ measurements from two aircraft campaigns over the eastern North Atlantic (ACE-ENA) and Southern Ocean (SOCRATES). The SOCRATES clouds have more and smaller cloud droplets. The ACE-ENA clouds exhibit stronger drizzle formation and growth. Results found distinctive aerosol–cloud interactions for two campaigns. The drizzle processes significantly alter sub-cloud aerosol budgets and impact the ACI assessments. 
 The aerosol–cloud–precipitation interactions within the cloud-topped marine boundary layer (MBL) are examined using aircraft in situ measurements from Aerosol and Cloud Experiments in the Eastern North Atlantic (ACE-ENA) and Southern Ocean Clouds, Radiation, Aerosol Transport Experimental Study (SOCRATES) field campaigns. SOCRATES clouds exhibit a larger number concentration and smaller cloud droplet effective radius (148.3 cm−3 and 8.0 µm) compared to ACE-ENA summertime (89.4 cm−3 and 9.0 µm) and wintertime clouds (70.6 cm−3 and 9.8 µm). The ACE-ENA clouds, especially during the winter, feature stronger drizzle formation via droplet growth through enhanced collision–coalescence that is attributed to a relatively cleaner environment and deeper cloud layer. Furthermore, the aerosol–cloud interaction (ACI) indices from the two aircraft field campaigns exhibit distinct sensitivities, indicating different cloud microphysical responses to aerosols. The ACE-ENA winter season features relatively fewer aerosols, which are more likely activated into cloud droplets under the conditions of sufficient water vapor availability and strong turbulence. The enriched aerosol loading during ACE-ENA summer and SOCRATES generally leads to smaller cloud droplets competing for the limited water vapor and exhibiting a stronger ACI. Notably, the precipitation susceptibilities are stronger during the ACE-ENA than during the SOCRATES campaigns. The in-cloud drizzle behavior significantly alters sub-cloud cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) budgets through the coalescence-scavenging effect and, in turn, impacts the ACI assessments. The results of this study can enhance understanding and aid in future model simulation and assessment of the aerosol–cloud interaction."

Gerber;Stephan Fueglistaler,Beyond self-healing: stabilizing and destabilizing photochemical adjustment of the ozone layer,"Earth's ozone layer absorbs incoming UV light, protecting life. Removing ozone aloft allows UV light to penetrate deeper, where it is known to produce new ozone, leading to ""self-healing"" that partially stabilizes total ozone. However, a photochemistry model shows that, above 40 km in the tropics, deeper-penetrating UV destroys ozone, destabilizing the total ozone. Photochemical theory reveals that this destabilizing regime occurs where overhead ozone is below a key threshold. 
 The ozone layer is often noted to exhibit self-healing, whereby depletion of ozone aloft induces ozone increases below, explained as resulting from enhanced ozone production due to the associated increase in ultraviolet (UV) radiation below. Similarly, ozone enhancement aloft can reduce ozone below (reverse self-healing). This paper considers self-healing and reverse self-healing to manifest a general mechanism we call photochemical adjustment, whereby ozone perturbations lead to a downward cascade of anomalies in UV and ozone. Conventional explanations for self-healing imply that photochemical adjustment is stabilizing, damping perturbations towards the surface. However, photochemical adjustment can be destabilizing if the enhanced UV disproportionately increases the ozone sink, as can occur if the enhanced UV photolyzes ozone to produce atomic oxygen, which speeds up catalytic destruction of ozone. We analyze photochemical adjustment in two linear ozone models (Cariolle v2.9 and LINOZ), finding that (1) photochemical adjustment is destabilizing above 40 km in the tropical stratosphere and (2) self-healing often represents only a small fraction of the total photochemical stabilization. The destabilizing regime above 40 km is reproduced in a much simpler model: the Chapman cycle augmented with destruction of O and O3 by generalized catalytic cycles and transport (the Chapman+2 model). The Chapman+2 model reveals that photochemical destabilization occurs where the ozone sink is more sensitive than the source to perturbations in overhead column ozone, which is found to occur when the window of overlapping absorption by O2 and O3 is optically unsaturated, i.e., when overhead slant column ozone is below approximately 1018 molec. cm−2."

Ghude;Vijay Kumar Soni;Narendra Nigam;Vinayak Sinha;Madhavan N. Rajeevan,"Biomass-burning sources control ambient particulate matter, but traffic and industrial sources control volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions and secondary-pollutant formation during extreme pollution events in Delhi","We use 111 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), PM10, and PM2.5 in a positive matrix factorization (PMF) model to resolve 11 pollution sources validated with chemical fingerprints. Crop residue burning and heating account for ~ 50 % of the PM, while traffic and industrial emissions dominate the gas-phase VOC burden and formation potential of secondary organic aerosols (> 60 %). Non-tailpipe emissions from compressed-natural-gas-fuelled commercial vehicles dominate the transport sector's PM burden. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particulate matter (PM) are major constituents of smog. Delhi experiences severe smog during the post-monsoon season, but a quantitative understanding of VOCs and PM sources is still lacking. Here, we conduct a source apportionment study for VOCs and PM using a  recent (2022), high-quality dataset of 111 VOCs, PM2.5, and PM10 in a positive matrix factorization (PMF) model. Contrasts between clean monsoon air and polluted post-monsoon air, VOC source fingerprints, and molecular tracers enabled us to differentiate paddy residue burning from other biomass-burning sources, which had previously been impossible. Burning of fresh paddy residue, as well as residential heating and waste burning, contributed the most to observed PM10 levels (25 % and 23 %, respectively) and PM2.5 levels (23 % and 24 %, respectively), followed by heavy-duty vehicles fuelled by compressed natural gas (CNG), with a PM10 contribution of 15 % and a PM2.5 contribution of 11 %. For ambient VOCs, ozone formation  potential, and secondary-organic-aerosol (SOA) formation potential, the top sources were petrol four-wheelers (20 %, 25 %, and 30 %, respectively), petrol two-wheelers (14 %, 12 %, and 20 %, respectively), industrial emissions (12 %, 14 %, and 15 %, respectively), solid-fuel-based cooking (10 %, 10 %, and 8 %, respectively), and road construction (8 %, 6 %, and 9 %, respectively). Emission inventories tended to overestimate residential biofuel emissions at least by a factor of 2 relative to the PMF output. The major source of PM pollution was regional biomass burning, while traffic and industries governed VOC emissions and secondary-pollutant formation. Our novel source apportionment method even quantitatively resolved similar biomass and fossil fuel sources, offering insights into both VOC and PM sources affecting extreme pollution events. This approach represents a notable advancement compared to current source apportionment approaches, and it could be of great relevance for future studies in other polluted cities and regions of the world with complex source mixtures."

Shiga;Jia Jung,Insights into the long-term (2005–2021) spatiotemporal evolution of summer ozone production sensitivity in the Northern Hemisphere derived with the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI),"Satellites, like the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), retrieve proxy species of ozone (O3) formation (formaldehyde and nitrogen dioxide) and the ratios (FNRs) which can define O3 production sensitivity regimes. Here we investigate trends of OMI FNRs from 2005 to 2021, and they have increased in major cities, suggesting a transition from radical- to NOx-limited regimes. OMI also observed the impact of reduced emissions during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown that resulted in increased FNRs. 
 Tropospheric ozone (O3) formation depends on the relative abundance of precursor species, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Advancements in satellite retrievals of formaldehyde (HCHO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) vertical column densities (VCDs), and the corresponding HCHO/NO2 ratios (FNRs), provide the opportunity to diagnose the spatiotemporal evolution of O3 production sensitivity regimes. This study investigates trends of Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)-derived summertime VCD HCHO, NO2, and FNRs in the Northern Hemisphere from 2005 to 2021. FNR trends were analyzed for polluted regions, specifically for 46 highly populated cities, over the entire 17-year period and in 2020 when global anthropogenic emissions were reduced due to COVID-19 lockdown restrictions. It was determined that OMI-derived FNRs have increased on average by ∼ 65 % across cities in the Northern Hemisphere. Increasing OMI-derived FNRs indicates a general transition from radical-limited to NOx-limited regimes. The increasing trend is driven by reduced NO2 concentrations because of emission-control strategies of NOx. OMI FNR trends were compared to ground-based in situ measurements in US cities, and it was determined that they can capture the trends in increasing FNRs (R=0.91) and decreasing NO2 (R=0.98) occurring at the surface. OMI FNRs in urban areas were higher (∼ 20 %) in 2020 for most cities studied here compared to 2019 and 2021. In addition to studying the longest period of OMI FNRs across the Northern Hemisphere to date, the capabilities and challenges of using satellite VCD FNRs to study surface-level O3 production sensitivity regimes are discussed."

Harrison,"The behaviour of charged particles (ions) during new particle formation events in urban Leipzig, Germany","Ions enhance the formation and growth rates of new particles, affecting the Earth's radiation budget. Despite these effects, there is little published data exploring the sources of ions in the urban environment and their role in new particle formation (NPF). Here we show that natural ion sources dominate in urban environments, while traffic is a secondary source. Ions contribute up to 12.7 % of the formation rate of particles, indicating that they are important for forming urban PM. 
 Air ions are electrically charged particles in air. They are ubiquitous in the natural environment and affect the Earth's radiation budget by accelerating the formation and growth of new aerosol particles. Despite this, few datasets exist exploring these effects in the urban environment. A neutral cluster and air ion spectrometer was deployed in Leipzig, Germany, to measure the number size distribution of charged particles from 0.8 to 42 nm, between 27 July and 25 August 2022. Following previous analyses, charged particles were classified into small (0.8–1.6 nm), intermediate (1.6–7.5 nm), and large (7.5–22 nm) fractions by mass diameter, and their mean concentrations (sum of positive and negative polarities) during the campaign were 405, 71.6, and 415 cm−3, respectively. The largest peaks in intermediate and large ions were explained by new particle formation (NPF), with intermediate ions correlating well with sulfuric acid dimer. Smaller morning and evening peaks were coincident with black carbon concentrations and attributed to primary emissions. NPF events, observed on 30 % of days, coincided with intense solar radiation and elevated sulfuric acid dimer. Small charged particles were primarily associated with radioactive decay and highest during the early hours, and they are unrelated to primary emissions or NPF. The apparent contributions of charged particles to 3 and 7.5 nm particle formation rates were 5.7 % and 12.7 %, respectively, with mean growth rates of 4.0 nm h−1 between 3–7.5 nm and 5.2 nm h−1 between 7.5 and 22 nm. The ratio of charged to total particle formation rates at 3 nm suggests a minor role for charged particles in NPF. We conclude that NPF is a primary source of > 3 nm ions in our data, with primary emissions being the major source in the absence of NPF."

This study offers a valuable reference for developing parameterizations of other nucleation systems and is meaningful for the accurate quantification of the environmental and climate impacts of new particle formation. 
 Clustering of gaseous sulfuric acid (SA) enhanced by dimethylamine (DMA) is a major mechanism for new particle formation (NPF) in polluted atmospheres. However, uncertainty remains regarding the SA–DMA nucleation parameterization that reasonably represents cluster dynamics and is applicable across various atmospheric conditions. This uncertainty hinders accurate three-dimensional (3-D) modeling of NPF and the subsequent assessment of its environmental and climatic impacts. Here we extensively compare different cluster-dynamics-based parameterizations for SA–DMA nucleation and identify the most reliable one through a combination of box model simulations, 3-D modeling, and in situ observations. Results show that the parameterization derived from Atmospheric Cluster Dynamic Code (ACDC) simulations, incorporating the latest theoretical insights (DLPNO-CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ//ωB97X-D/6-311++G(3df,3pd) level of theory) and adequate representation of cluster dynamics, exhibits dependable performance in 3-D NPF simulation for both winter and summer conditions in Beijing and shows promise for application in diverse atmospheric conditions. Another ACDC-derived parameterization, replacing the level of theory with RI-CC2/aug-cc-pV(T+d)Z//M06-2X/6–311++G(3df,3pd), also performs well in NPF modeling at relatively low temperatures around 280 K but exhibits limitations at higher temperatures due to inappropriate representation of SA–DMA cluster thermodynamics. Additionally, a previously reported parameterization incorporating simplifications is applicable for simulating NPF in polluted atmospheres but tends to overestimate particle formation rates under conditions of elevated temperature (>∼300 K) and low-condensation sink (<∼3×10-3 s−1). Our findings highlight the applicability of the new ACDC-derived parameterization, which couples the latest SA–DMA nucleation theory and holistic cluster dynamics, in 3-D NPF modeling. The ACDC-derived parameterization framework provides a valuable reference for developing parameterizations for other nucleation systems."

AOD retrievals require Rayleigh scattering and atmospheric absorption (ozone, NO2, etc.) corrections. We analysed the NO2 (which has a high spatiotemporal variation) uncertainty impact on AOD  retrievals using the synergy of co-located ground-based instruments with a long-term dataset at worldwide sites and found significant AOD over- or underestimations. 
 This work aims at investigating the effect of NO2 absorption on aerosol-optical-depth (AOD) measurements and Ångström exponent (AE) retrievals of sun photometers by the synergistic use of accurate NO2 characterization for optical-depth estimation from co-located ground-based measurements. The analysis was performed for ∼ 7 years (2017–2023) at several sites worldwide for the AOD measurements and AE retrievals by Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sun photometers which use OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) climatology for NO2 representation. The differences in AOD and AE retrievals by NO2 absorption are accounted for using high-frequency columnar NO2 measurements by a co-located Pandora spectroradiometer belonging to the Pandonia Global Network (PGN). NO2 absorption affects the AOD measurements in UV-Vis (visible) range, and we found that the AOD bias is the most affected at 380 nm by NO2 differences, followed by 440, 340, and 500 nm, respectively. AERONET AOD was found to be overestimated in half of the cases, while also underestimated in other cases as an impact of the NO2 difference from “real” (PGN NO2) values. Overestimations or underestimations are relatively low. About one-third of these stations showed a mean difference in NO2 and AOD (at 380 and 440 nm) above 0.5 × 10−4 mol m−2 and 0.002, respectively, which can be considered a systematic contribution to the uncertainties in the AOD measurements that are reported to be of the order of 0.01. However, under extreme NO2 loading scenarios (i.e. 10 % highest differences) at highly urbanized/industrialized locations, even higher AOD differences were observed that were at the limit of or higher than the reported 0.01 uncertainty in the AOD measurement. PGN NO2-based sensitivity analysis of AOD difference suggested that for PGN NO2 varying between 2 × 10−4 and  8 × 10−4 mol m−2, the median AOD differences were found to rise above 0.01 (even above 0.02) with the increase in NO2 threshold (i.e. the lower limit from 2 × 10−4 to 8 × 10−4 mol m−2). The AOD-derivative product, AE, was also affected by the NO2 correction (discrepancies between the AERONET OMI climatological representation of NO2 values and the real PGN NO2 measurements) on the spectral AOD. Normalized frequency distribution of AE (at 440–870 and 340–440 nm wavelength pair) was found to be narrower for a broader AOD distribution for some stations, and vice versa for other stations, and a higher relative error at the shorter wavelength (among the wavelength pairs used for AE estimation) led to a shift in the peak of the AE difference distribution towards a higher positive value, while a higher relative error at a lower wavelength shifted the AE difference distribution to a negative value for the AOD overestimation case, and vice versa for the AOD underestimation case. For rural locations, the mean NO2 differences were found to be mostly below 0.50 × 10−4 mol m−2, with the corresponding AOD differences being below 0.002, and in extreme NO2 loading scenarios, it went above this value and reached above 1.00 × 10−4 mol m−2 for some stations, leading to higher AOD differences but below 0.005. Finally, AOD and AE trends were calculated based on the original AERONET AOD (based on AERONET OMI climatological NO2), and its comparison with the mean differences in the AERONET and PGN NO2-corrected AOD was indicative of how NO2 correction could potentially affect realistic AOD trends."

The instrument was designed to measure the HDO/H2O ratio in the 2017 Asian Summer Monsoon flight aboard the M-55 Geophysica during the StratoClim campaign, and so far has also flown aboard the WB-57F in the 2021 and 2022 ACCLIP campaigns. The spectrometer scans absorption lines of both H2O and HDO near 2.647 μm wavelength in a single current sweep, and has an effective path length of 7.5 km under optimal conditions. The instrument utilizes a novel non-axially-symmetric optical component which increases the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 3. Ultra-polished, 4-inch diameter cavity mirrors suppress scattering losses, maximize mirror reflectivity, and yield optical fringing significantly below typical electrical noise levels. In laboratory conditions, the instrument has demonstrated a 5-second measurement precision of 3.6 ppbv and 82 pptv in H2O and HDO, respectively."

Reid,Chilean Observation Network De MeteOr Radars (CONDOR): Multi-Static System Configuration & Wind Comparison with Co-located Lidar,"This paper describes the installation of the Chilean Observation Network De MeteOr Radars (CONDOR) and its initial results. The routine winds are point-to-point comparable to the co-located lidar winds. The retrievals of spatially resolved horizontal wind fields, vertical winds, and temperatures are also facilitated benefiting from the extensive meteor detections. The successful deployment and maintenance of CONDOR provide 24/7 and state-of-the-art wind measurements to the research community. 
 The Chilean Observation Network De MeteOr Radars (CONDOR) commenced deployment in June 2019 and became fully operational in February 2020. It is a multi-static meteor radar system consisting of three ~1º latitudinally separated stations. The main (central) station is located at the Andes Lidar Observatory (ALO, 30.25º S, 70.74º W) and is used for both transmission and reception. The two remote sites are located to the north and south and are used for reception only. The southern station is located at the Southern Cross Observatory (SCO, 31.20º S, 71.00º W) and the northern station is located at Las Campanas Observatory (LCO, 29.02º S, 70.69º W). The successful deployment and maintenance of CONDOR provide 24/7 measurements of horizontal winds in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT), and permit the retrieval of spatially resolved horizontal winds, vertical winds, and temperatures. This is possible because of the high meteor detection rates. Over 30,000 quality controlled underdense meteor echoes are detected at the ALO each day and in total ~88,000 events are detected each day over the three sites. In this paper, we present the system configuration of the CONDOR and discuss the validation and initial results of its data products. The motivations of deploying the CONDOR system also include the combination of results with other co-located ground-based instruments at the ALO, which provide uniquely cross-validated and cross-scale observations of the MLT dynamics with multiple scientific goals."

We quantify the uncertainties of several publicly available KDP estimation methods for multiple rainfall intensities. We use C-band weather radar observations and employed a self-consistency KDP, estimated from reflectivity and differential reflectivity, as framework for the examination. Our study provides guidance in the performance, uncertainties and optimisation of the methods, focusing mainly on accuracy and robustness. 
 Accurate and precise KDP estimates are essential for radar-based applications, especially in quantitative precipitation estimation and radar data quality control routines. The accuracy of these estimates largely depends on the post-processing of the radar's measured ΦDP, which aims to reduce noise and backscattering effects while preserving fine-scale precipitation features. In this study, we evaluate the performance of several publicly available KDP estimation methods implemented in open-source libraries such as PyArt and Wradlib, and the method used in the Vaisala weather radars. To benchmark these methods, we employ a polarimetric self-consistency approach that relates KDP to reflectivity and differential reflectivity in rain, providing a reference self-consistency KDP  (KDPSC ) for comparison. This approach allows for the construction of the reference KDP observations that can be used  to assess the accuracy and robustness of the studied KDP estimation methods. We assess each method by quantifying uncertainties using C-band weather radar observations where the reflectivity values ranged between 20 and 50 dBZ."

The algorithms are designed for rapid map updates and estimating new maps as growth in GBIF species occurrence reports continues. 
 The world is facing an unprecedented loss of biodiversity, with nearly one million species on the brink of extinction, and the extinction rate accelerating. Conservation efforts are often hindered by insufficient information on crucial ecosystems. To address this issue, our paper leverages advances in machine-based pattern recognition to estimate species occurrence maps using georeferenced data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Our algorithms have generated maps for more than 600,000 species, including vertebrates, arthropods, mollusks, other animals, vascular plants, fungi, and other organisms. Validation involved comparing these maps with expert maps for mammals, ants, and vascular plants. We found a close similarity in global distribution patterns, with regional differences attributed to technical variations or necessary revisions in existing expert maps based on GBIF data. As a practical application, we identified the global distributions of approximately 68,000 species with small ranges (25 km x 25 km or less) confined to a single country. Our maps reveal a skewed international distribution of these species, identifying 30 countries where 78.2 percent are concentrated. These results highlight the need to integrate the newly mapped GBIF data into global conservation planning. Our algorithms support rapid updates and the creation of new maps as GBIF occurrence reports increase.

The data are discussed in terms of the lithology and age of the source lithologies. This dataset will reduce northern-hemisphere bias in future global strontium isotope models. Other potential applications of the new data include mineralisation, hydrology, food tracing, dust provenancing, and historic migrations of people and animals. 
 Strontium isotopes (87Sr/86Sr) are widely used tracers in the geosciences. Here we exploit an opportunity to determine 87Sr/86Sr ratios on archived fluvial sediment samples from the low-density National Geochemical Survey of Australia. The present study targeted the Yilgarn Craton in southwestern Australia. One hundred and seven new samples were taken from a depth of ~ 60–80 cm in floodplain deposits at or near the outlet of large catchments (drainage basins). A coarse (< 2 mm) grain-size fraction was air-dried, sieved, milled then digested (hydrofluoric acid + nitric acid followed by aqua regia) to release total Sr. The Sr was then separated by chromatography and its 87Sr/86Sr ratio determined by multicollector-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Results demonstrate a wide range of quite elevated Sr isotopic values (0.7152 to 1.0909, median 0.7560) over the survey area, reflecting a large diversity of source rock lithologies, geological processes and bedrock ages. Spatial distribution of 87Sr/86Sr shows coherent (multi-point anomalies and smooth gradients), large-scale (> 100 km) patterns that appear to be broadly consistent with surface geology, regolith/soil type, and/or nearby outcropping bedrock. The most radiogenic sediment values in the Yilgarn region (87Sr/86Sr > 0.8) all come from sites underlain by Archaean bedrock (2500–4000 Ma) and almost exclusively felsic intrusive lithologies. Conversely, almost all sites underlain by younger and non-granitic bedrock have outlet sediments of a less radiogenic character (87Sr/86Sr < 0.8). Sampling sites underlain by mafic and ultramafic bedrock yield unradiogenic Sr sediment signatures despite their Archaean age. Several sediment 87Sr/86Sr results were validated by comparison to previously published whole-rock data from their catchment, for both unradiogenic and radiogenic cases. The new Sr isotopic data are also interrogated in terms of the mineral occurrences (i.e., mineral deposits and/or operating mines) found in their catchment. Several catchments containing mineral resources across a range of commodities stand out as high 87Sr/86Sr outliers (87Sr/86Sr > 0.8), whilst over half of the registered mineral resources come from an intermediate, yet still elevated, catchment sediment 87Sr/86Sr range (87Sr/86Sr = 0.728–0.767). Avenues for future work are proposed, including a national-scale Sr isoscape for Australia. Such isoscape could be useful in future geological, forensic, archaeological, paleontological and ecological studies. The new spatial Sr isotope dataset for the southwestern Australia region is publicly available (de Caritat et al., 2024; https://dx.doi.org/10.26186/149755)."

 We introduce CAMELS-INDIA (Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies – India), the hydrometeorological time series, and catchment attributes for 472 catchments in Peninsular India. Peninsular India covers 15 intrastate river basins defined by the Central Water Commission (CWC), where river flow and water level datasets are available for several gauge stations through the open-source India Water Resources Information System (India-WRIS). However, many of these gauge stations lack reliable metadata, and data are not in an analysis-ready format for large-sample hydrological studies. Therefore, we utilized 472 gauge stations and their catchment boundaries, characterized as stations with reliable metadata, from the 'Geospatial dataset for Hydrologic analyses in India (GHI)' (Goteti, 2023). For each of these catchments, the CAMELS-INDIA provides a catchment mean time series of meteorological forcings for 41 years (1980–2020) and around 211 catchment attributes representing hydroclimatic and land cover characteristics extracted from multiple data sources (including ground-based observations, remote sensing-based products, and reanalyses datasets). The CAMELS-INDIA follows the same standards of the previously developed CAMELS datasets for the USA, Chile, Brazil, Great Britain, Australia, Switzerland, Germany, and Denmark to facilitate comparisons with catchments of those countries and inclusion in global hydrological studies. Notably, the CAMELS-INDIA includes available observed streamflow and catchment mean time series of 19 meteorological forcings, including precipitation, maximum, minimum, and average temperature, long-wave and short-wave radiation flux, U and V-components of wind, relative humidity, evaporation rates from canopy and soil surface, actual and potential evapotranspiration, and soil moisture of four layers (covering depth up to 3 m below ground) for detailed hydrometeorological studies. We also derived catchment attributes representing human influences, including the number of dams and their utilization, total volume contents of dams in catchments, population density, and increase in urban and agricultural land covers to facilitate studies to understand human influences on catchment hydrology. Furthermore, the dataset includes predicted streamflow time series from a regionally trained Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based hydrological model, which can fill gaps in observed streamflow data or serve as a benchmark for testing and developing new hydrological models. We envision that CAMELS-INDIA will provide a strong foundation for a community-led effort toward gaining new hydrological insights from hydrologically distinct Indian catchments and solving pertinent issues related to water management, quantification and risk assessment of hydrologic extremes, unraveling regional-scale hydrologic functioning, and climate change impact assessment of catchments across India.

Since remote sensing techniques cannot measure it directly, it is often deduced from volumetric water content (VWC) information. However, under dynamic field conditions, the relationship between SWP and VWC is highly ambiguous due to different factors that cannot be modeled with the classical approach. Applying a deep neural network with an autoencoder enables the prediction of the dynamic SWP. 
 Information on soil water potential is essential to assessing the soil moisture state, to prevent soil compaction in weak soils, and to optimize crop management. When there is a lack of direct measurements, the soil water potential values must be deduced from soil water content dynamics that can be monitored at the plot scale or obtained at a larger scale from remote sensing information. Because the relationship between water content and soil water potential in natural field soils is highly ambiguous, the prediction of soil water potential from water content data is a big challenge. The hysteretic relationship observed in nine soil profiles in the region of Solothurn (Switzerland) is not a simple function of texture or wetting–drainage cycles but depends on seasonal patterns that may be related to soil structural dynamics. Because the physical mechanisms governing seasonal hysteresis are unclear, we developed a deep neural network model that predicts water potential changes using rainfall, potential evapotranspiration, and water content time series as inputs. To adapt the model for multiple locations, we incorporated a deep autoencoder neural network as a classifier. The autoencoder compresses the water content time series into a site-specific feature that is highly representative of the underlying water content dynamics of each site and quantifies the similarity of dynamic patterns. By adding the autoencoder's output as an additional input and training the neural network model with three stations located in three major classes established by the autoencoder, we predict matric potential for other sites. This method has the potential to deduce the dynamics of matric potential from water content data (including satellite data) despite strong seasonal effects that cannot be captured by standard methods."

To better understand this impact, we developed a specialized model specifically for the NCP region. This model allows us to simulate the double-cropping vegetation and the dynamic irrigation practices that are commonly employed in the NCP. This model shows improved performance in capturing the general crop growth, such as crop stages, biomass, crop yield, and vegetation greenness. 
 Irrigated cultivation exerts a significant influence on the local climate and the hydrological cycle. The North China Plain (NCP) is known for its intricate agricultural system, marked by expansive cropland, high productivity, compact rotation, a semi-arid climate, and intensive irrigation practices. As a result, there has been considerable attention on the potential impact of this intensive irrigated agriculture on the local climate. However, studying the irrigation impact in this region has been challenging due to the lack of an accurate simulation of crop phenology and irrigation practices within the climate model. By incorporating double cropping with interactive irrigation, our study extends the capabilities of the Weather Research Forecast (WRF) model, which has previously demonstrated commendable performance in simulating single-cropping scenarios. This allows for two-way feedback between irrigated crops and climate, further enabling the inclusion of irrigation feedback from both ground and vegetation perspectives. The improved crop modeling system shows significant enhancement in capturing vegetation and irrigation patterns, which is evidenced by its ability to identify crop stages, estimate field biomass, predict crop yield, and project monthly leaf area index. The improved simulation of large-scale irrigated crops in the NCP can further enhance our understanding of the intricate relationship between agricultural development and climate change."

 Ultraviolet (UV) radiation can damage DNA and kill cells.

We conduct a series of simulations with CESM2-UVphyto using the Marine Biogeochemistry Library (MARBL) ecosystem model to calibrate estimates of the sensitivity of phytoplankton productivity to UV radiation. Results indicate that increased UV radiation shifts the vertical distribution of phytoplankton biomass and productivity deeper into the column, causes a moderate decline in total global productivity, and changes phytoplankton community structure to favor diatoms.

Two quite different mechanisms involving sulfuric acid and ammonia or a biogenic organic vapor gave quite similar results which were consistent with measurements in 26 measurement stations across Europe. The number of larger particles that serve as cloud condensation nuclei showed little sensitivity to the assumed nucleation mechanism. 
 The three-dimensional chemical transport model, PMCAMx-UF v2.2, designed to simulate the ultrafine particle size distribution, was used to investigate the impact of varying nucleation mechanisms on the predicted aerosol number concentration in Europe. Two basic case scenarios were examined: the original ternary H2SO4-NH3-H2O parameterization and a biogenic vapor-sulfuric acid parameterization. Using the organic-based parameterization, PMCAMx-UF predicted higher N10 (particle number above 10 nm) concentrations over Europe by 40–60 % on average during the simulated period, which is a relatively small difference given the differences in the two assumed mechanisms. Adjusting the nucleation rate by an order of magnitude for both mechanisms led to an average change of ±30 % in N10 for the ternary ammonia case, and ‒30 to 40 % for the biogenic vapor case. In the biogenic organic nucleation scenario, reducing the fresh nuclei diameter from 1.7 nm to 1 nm resulted in reductions in N10 and N100 by −13 % and −1 %, respectively. Incorporating extremely low-volatility organic compounds (ELVOCs) as the nucleating species resulted in predicted increase in N10 concentration by 10–40 % over continental Europe compared to the ammonia parameterization. Model predictions were evaluated against field measurements from 26 stations across Europe during the summer of 2012. Among the tested scenarios, the measurements showed better agreement with the ternary ammonia and ELVOC-based parameterizations for N10, whereas for N100, all simulated cases appear to agree quite well with the field data."

It enables to accept or reject scenarios within a predefined confidence interval. In particular, it can allow to estimate the probability of a fault acting as a preferential path or a barrier. 
 Groundwater contaminant transport problems remain challenging with respect to their computing requirements. Thus, it often limits the exploration of conceptual uncertainty, that is mainly related to large scale structural features and due to limited characterization. Here, to facilitate geological conceptual uncertainty exploration, we develop further the use of graph representation for geological models to approximate groundwater flow and transport. We consider a faulted multi-heterogeneous-layer medium to test our approach. The existing rank correlation between shortest path distribution from a contaminant source to the model domain outlet and cumulative mass distribution at the outlet enables to perform scenario selection. The scenario selection approach relies on a metric combining the Jaccard dissimilarity and the Wasserstein distance to compare binary images. Among a set combining eight alternative scenarios, where three faults can either act as a flow barrier or a preferential path, we show that the use of graph-approximations allows to retain or reject scenarios with confidence as well as to estimate the individual probability of a fault to act as a barrier or a path. This methodology framework opens up possibilities to explore more thoroughly conceptual geological uncertainty for processes affected by flow and transport."

Here we sampled soils from forests, parks, and farmland across eight provinces in eastern China, using high-throughput sequencing to distinguish between two N2O-reducing bacteria clades. A deterministic process mainly determined assemblies of the nosZI communities. Homogeneous selection drove nosZI deterministic processes, and both homogeneous and heterogeneous selection influenced nosZII. This suggests nosZII is more sensitive to environmental changes than nosZI, with significant changes in community structure over time or space. Ecosystems with stronger anthropogenic disturbance, such as urban areas, provide diverse ecological niches for N2O-reducing bacteria (especially nosZII) to adapt to environmental fluctuations. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and correlation analyses revealed that pH significantly influences the community composition of both N2O-reducing bacteria clades. This study underscores urbanization’s impact on N2O-reducing bacteria in urban soils, highlighting the importance of nosZII and survival strategies.

Considering that industrial wastewater is usually treated in a decentralized manner, in situ utilization of chemical energy to achieve waste-to-treasure should be given priority. Herein, the chemical energy released by the electroreduction of Cr(VI) was used to enhance on-site H2O2 generation in a stacked flow-through electrochemical system. The driving force of water flow efficiently coupled O2 evolution with 2-e O2 reduction to facilitate H2O2 generation by transporting anode-produced O2 to the cathode. Meanwhile, the chemical energy released by Cr(VI) promoted O2 evolution and impeded H2 evolution by regulating the electrode potentials, accounting for the enhanced H2O2 generation. The system could completely reduce 10–100 ppm of Cr(VI), reaching the maximum H2O2 concentration of 2.41 mM. In particular, the H2O2 concentrations in the Cr(VI)-containing electrolyte were 10.6–88.1% higher than those in the Cr(VI) free electrolyte at 1.8–2.5 V. A 24-day continuous experiment demonstrated the high efficiency and stability of the system, achieving a 100% reduction efficiency for 100 ppm of Cr(VI) and producing ∼1.5 mM H2O2 at 1.8 V. This study presents a feasible strategy for Cr(VI) detoxification and synchronous on-site H2O2 generation, providing a new perspective for innovative Cr(VI) wastewater treatment toward resource utilization."

Artificial light at night (ALAN) can disrupt natural sleep–wake cycles, whereas chemical pollutants can impair sleep-related processes. The prevalence of ALAN increases the health risk of coexposure, yet it has not gained sufficient attention. Meanwhile, visual inputs are important for sleep regulation, especially the non-image-forming circadian visual system centered around melanopsin. This study evaluated the light perception ability and sleep performance of zebrafish larvae exposed to flame retardant hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs) at environmentally relevant concentrations (2.5 and 25 μg/L) and to cotreatment of HBCD and ALAN. HBCD induced a longer sleep latency of 34.59 min under 25 μg/L (p < 0.01) versus control (26.04 min). The situation was intensified by coexposure with low-level ALAN (10 lx) to 48.04 min. Similar synergic effects were observed for upregulations of Xenopus-related melanopsin genes and downregulations of the melatonin synthesis gene aanat2, suggesting a melanopsin–aanat2–sleep retina–brain pathway. Image-forming opsins (opn1sw1 and opn1sw2) were also activated by HBCD to 1.29–1.53-fold (p < 0.05), together with elevated retina glutamate, but without synergic effects. Collectively, we found that HBCD and ALAN coexposure caused synergic effects on the non-image-forming visual system and caused sleep difficulty in zebrafish larvae."

However, the floor dust-borne microbiome is commonly used as a proxy for indoor airborne microbiome, and the spatial distribution of indoor airborne microbiome is less well understood. This study aimed to characterize indoor airborne microorganisms at varying heights and compare them with those in floor dust. An assembly of three horizontally and three vertically positioned Petri dishes coated with mineral oil was applied for passive air sampling continuously at three heights without interruption. The airborne microbiomes at the three different heights showed slight stratification and differed significantly from those found in the floor dust. Based on the apportionment results from the fast expectation–maximization algorithm (FEAST), shoe sole dust contributed approximately 4% to indoor airborne bacteria and 14% to airborne fungi, a contribution that is comparable to that from the floor dust-borne microbiome. The results indicated that floor dust may not be a reliable proxy for indoor airborne microbiome. Moreover, the study highlights the need for height-resolved studies of indoor airborne microbiomes among humans in different activity modes and life states. Additionally, shoe sole-dust-associated microorganisms could potentially be a source to “re-wild” the indoor microbiota."

However, precise regulation of such reactions is still restricted by our poor knowledge of underlying mechanisms, especially the correlation between metal site conformation of metal atom clusters and pollutant degradation behaviors. Herein, we investigated the electron transfer and pollutant oxidation mechanisms of atomic-level exposed Ag atom clusters (AgAC) loaded on specifically crafted nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NPC). The AgAC triggered a direct electron transfer (DET) between the terminal oxygen (Oα) of surface-activated peroxodisulfate and the electron-donating substituents-containing contaminants (EDTO–DET), rendering it 11–38 times higher degradation rate than the reported carbon-supported metal catalysts system with various single-atom active centers. Heterocyclic substituents and electron-donating groups were more conducive to degradation via the EDTO–DET system, while contaminants with high electron-absorbing capacity preferred the radical pathway. Notably, the system achieved 79.5% chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal for the treatment of actual pharmaceutical wastewater containing 1053 mg/L COD within 30 min. Our study provides valuable new insights into the Fenton-like reactions of metal atom cluster catalysts and lays an important basis for revolutionizing advanced oxidation water purification technologies."

We developed a targeted, long-read sequencing method utilizing unique molecular identifiers to generate accurate, full length CTX-M gene sequences from wastewater. We characterized CTX-M in Seattle area wastewater influent from April 2020 to March 2021. We identified a core community of alleles that persisted across time and treatment plant.

We observed significant diversity across the CTX-M gene at the nucleic acid level, although most nucleotide mutations were synonymous─resulting in two to three amino acid variants across 19 loci. By average relative abundance, 23% of protein variants were novel, defined as those not represented in CARD.

BHPF exhibits antiestrogenic effects and potential reproductive toxicity. Similar to BPA, BHPF can closely access the active site of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme, interact with the Fe═O moiety, and potentially initiate metabolic reactions. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we explored the mechanisms underlying BHPF activation using a CYP450 compound I (Cpd I) model, identifying several plausible products. Compared with the higher energy barriers associated with phenyl ring addition reactions, the formation of a phenoxyl-type radical through phenolic hydrogen atom abstraction, followed by OH rebound or radical coupling, represents an energetically favorable pathway. The OH rebound process yields three primary products: 9-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-9-(4-hydroxyphenyl)fluorene (PRD1), semiquinone radical anion (PRD2), and 9-(4-hydroxyphenyl)fluorene carbocation (PRD3), constituting the major outcomes of the BHPF metabolic reaction. Importantly, a lipophilic ether metabolite, BHPF-O-BHPF (PRD4), formed through the coupling of phenoxyl radicals, reflects a widespread metabolic pathway observed in phenolic molecules. Despite constituting a minor proportion, the toxicity of this product necessitates increased attention. These findings contribute significantly to an enhanced understanding of the potential hazards associated with BHPF and other unknown chemical entities."

The studies of two different point‐source models, the seismic moment tensor (MT) and the single force (SF), have been performed separately for this eruption, which, interestingly, can explain the seismic data adequately. Here, we use a joint inversion of MT and SF to unravel a composite source of an explosion‐like MT and a significant upward force for the first major explosive event.

The evolution of medium‐lived RCCREs is generally dominated by the 10–30‐day ISO, while the 10–30‐day and 30–90‐day ISOs synergistically contribute to the occurrence of long‐lived RCCREs. Further analysis reveals that, when the East Asian westerly jet (EAWJ) shifts northward to the north of YHRV, a RCCRE in the YHRV occurs in 2 days later. In the medium‐lived RCCREs, the EAWJ retreats southward rapidly; while in the long‐lived RCCREs, the stronger 30–90‐day ISO prevents the southward retreat of EAWJ, which favors the persistence of the RCCREs in the YHRV. The northward shifted EAWJ facilitates the RCCREs by modulating the secondary atmospheric circulation, consequently enhancing the moisture convergence and ascending motion anomalies over the YHRV. The RCCREs‐related precursor wave train originates from northern Europe with at least a 4‐day lead. The wave train propagates southeastward to excite an anomalous high over East Asia, which contributes to the northward shift of EAWJ and subsequently the occurrence of RCCREs. Different from the rapid weakness of the precursor wave train associated with the medium‐lived RCCREs, the precursor wave train associated with the long‐lived RCCREs can be maintained by the 30–90‐day ISO, which consequently leads to a persistence of the northward located EAWJ and long‐lived RCCREs in the YHRV."

These moving hillslopes can inflict damage to buildings and infrastructure, accelerate with urban alterations, and catastrophically fail with climatic and weather extremes. Yet, systematic estimates of slow‐moving landslide exposure and their drivers have been elusive. Here, we present a new global database of 7,764 large (A ≥ 0.1 km2) slow‐moving landslides across nine IPCC regions. Using high‐resolution human settlement footprint data, we identify 563 inhabited landslides. We estimate that 9% of reported slow‐moving landslides are inhabited, in a given basin, and have 12% of their areas occupied by human settlements, on average. We find the density of settlements on unstable slopes decreases in basins more affected by slow‐moving landslides, but varies across regions with greater flood exposure. Across most regions, urbanization can be a relevant driver of slow‐moving landslide exposure, while steepness and flood exposure have regionally varying influences. In East Asia, slow‐moving landslide exposure increases with urbanization, gentler slopes, and less flood exposure. Our findings quantify how disparate knowledge creates uncertainty that undermines an assessment of the drivers of slow‐moving landslide exposure in mountain regions, facing a future of rising risk, such as Central Asia, Northeast Africa, and the Tibetan Plateau."

 Tissue-selective chemoattractants direct lymphocytes to epithelial surfaces to establish local immune environments, regulate immune responses to food antigens and commensal organisms, and protect from pathogens. Homeostatic chemoattractants for small intestines, colon, and skin are known1 2, but chemotropic mechanisms selective for respiratory tract and other non-intestinal mucosal tissues (NIMT) remain poorly understood. Here we leveraged diverse omics datasets to identify GPR25 as a lymphocyte receptor for CXCL17, a chemoattractant cytokine whose expression by epithelial cells of airways, upper gastrointestinal and squamous mucosae unifies the NIMT and distinguishes them from intestinal mucosae. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses show that GPR25 is induced on innate lymphocytes prior to emigration to the periphery, and is imprinted in secondary lymphoid tissues on activated B and T cells responding to immune challenge. GPR25 characterizes B and T tissue resident memory and regulatory T lymphocytes in NIMT and lungs in humans and mediates lymphocyte homing to barrier epithelia of the airways, oral cavity, stomach, biliary and genitourinary tracts in mouse models. GPR25 is also expressed by T cells in cerebrospinal fluid and CXCL17 by neurons, suggesting a role in CNS immune regulation. We reveal widespread imprinting of GPR25 on regulatory T cells, suggesting a mechanistic link to population genetic evidence that GPR25 is protective in autoimmunity3,4. Our results define a GPR25-CXCL17 chemoaffinity axis with the potential to integrate immunity and tolerance at non-intestinal mucosae and the CNS."

 The development of superconducting qubit technology has shown great potential for the construction of practical quantum computers1,2. As the complexity of quantum processors continues to grow, the need for stringent fabrication tolerances becomes increasingly critical3. Utilizing advanced industrial fabrication processes could facilitate the necessary level of fabrication control to support the continued scaling of quantum processors. However, at present, these industrial processes are not optimized to produce high-coherence devices, nor are they a priori compatible with the approaches commonly used to make superconducting qubits. Here we demonstrate superconducting transmon qubits manufactured in a 300 mm complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) pilot line using industrial fabrication methods, with resulting relaxation and coherence times exceeding 100 μs. We show across-wafer, large-scale statistics of coherence, yield, variability and ageing that confirm the validity of our approach. The presented industry-scale fabrication process, which uses only optical lithography and reactive-ion etching, has a performance and yield in line with conventional laboratory-style techniques utilizing metal lift-off, angled evaporation and electron-beam writing4. Moreover, it offers the potential for further upscaling through three-dimensional integration5 and more process optimization. This result marks the advent of an alternative and new, large-scale, truly CMOS-compatible fabrication method for superconducting quantum computing processors.

 Studies of moiré systems have explained the effect of superlattice modulations on their properties, demonstrating new correlated phases1. However, most experimental studies have focused on a few layers in two-dimensional systems. Extending twistronics to three dimensions, in which the twist extends into the third dimension, remains underexplored because of the challenges associated with the manual stacking of layers. Here we study three-dimensional twistronics using a self-assembled twisted spiral superlattice of multilayered WS2. Our findings show an opto-twistronic Hall effect driven by structural chirality and coherence length, modulated by the moiré potential of the spiral superlattice. This is an experimental manifestation of the noncommutative geometry of the system. We observe enhanced light–matter interactions and an altered dependence of the Hall coefficient on photon momentum. Our model suggests contributions from higher-order quantum geometric quantities to this observation, providing opportunities for designing quantum-materials-based optoelectronic lattices with large nonlinearities.

 Persistent colonization and outgrowth of potentially pathogenic organisms in the intestine can result from long-term antibiotic use or inflammatory conditions, and may perpetuate dysregulated immunity and tissue damage1,2. Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae gut pathobionts are particularly recalcitrant to conventional antibiotic treatment3,4, although an emerging body of evidence suggests that manipulation of the commensal microbiota may be a practical alternative therapeutic strategy5–7. Here we isolated and down-selected commensal bacterial consortia from stool samples from healthy humans that could strongly and specifically suppress intestinal Enterobacteriaceae. One of the elaborated consortia, comprising 18 commensal strains, effectively controlled ecological niches by regulating gluconate availability, thereby re-establishing colonization resistance and alleviating Klebsiella- and Escherichia-driven intestinal inflammation in mice. Harnessing these activities in the form of live bacterial therapies may represent a promising solution to combat the growing threat of proinflammatory, antimicrobial-resistant Enterobacteriaceae infection.

 Metallurgical production traditionally involves three steps: extracting metals from ores, mixing them into alloys by liquid processing and thermomechanical processing to achieve the desired microstructures1,2. This sequential approach, practised since the Bronze Age, reaches its limit today because of the urgent demand for a sustainable economy2–5: almost 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions are because of the use of fossil reductants and high-temperature metallurgical processing. Here we present a H2-based redox synthesis and compaction approach that reforms traditional alloy-making by merging metal extraction, alloying and thermomechanical processing into one single solid-state operation. We propose a thermodynamically informed guideline and a general kinetic conception to dissolve the classical boundaries between extractive and physical metallurgy, unlocking tremendous sustainable bulk alloy design opportunities. We exemplify this approach for the case of Fe–Ni invar bulk alloys6,7, one of the most appealing ferrous materials but the dirtiest to produce: invar shows uniquely low thermal expansion6,8,9, enabling key applications spanning from precision instruments to cryogenic components10–13. Yet, it is notoriously eco-unfriendly, with Ni causing more than 10 times higher CO2 emission than Fe per kilogram production2,14, qualifying this alloy class as a perfect demonstrator case. Our sustainable method turns oxides directly into green alloys in bulk forms, with application-worthy properties, all obtained at temperatures far below the bulk melting point, while maintaining a zero CO2 footprint.

 The developing placenta, which in mice originates through the extraembryonic ectoderm (ExE), is essential for mammalian embryonic development. Yet unbiased characterization of the differentiation dynamics of the ExE and its interactions with the embryo proper remains incomplete. Here we develop a temporal single-cell model of mouse gastrulation that maps continuous and parallel differentiation in embryonic and extraembryonic lineages. This is matched with a three-way perturbation approach to target signalling from the embryo proper, the ExE alone, or both. We show that ExE specification involves early spatial and transcriptional bifurcation of uncommitted ectoplacental cone cells and chorion progenitors. Early BMP4 signalling from chorion progenitors is required for proper differentiation of uncommitted ectoplacental cone cells and later for their specification towards trophoblast giant cells. We also find biphasic regulation by BMP4 in the embryo. The early ExE-originating BMP4 signal is necessary for proper mesoendoderm bifurcation and for allantois and primordial germ cell specification. However, commencing at embryonic day 7.5, embryo-derived BMP4 restricts the primordial germ cell pool size by favouring differentiation of their extraembryonic mesoderm precursors towards an allantois fate. ExE and embryonic tissues are therefore entangled in time, space and signalling axes, highlighting the importance of their integrated understanding and modelling in vivo and in vitro.

 The PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway guides the DNA methylation of young, active transposons during germline development in male mice1. piRNAs tether the PIWI protein MIWI2 (PIWIL4) to the nascent transposon transcript, resulting in DNA methylation through SPOCD1 (refs. 2–5). Transposon methylation requires great precision: every copy needs to be methylated but off-target methylation must be avoided. However, the underlying mechanisms that ensure this precision remain unknown. Here, we show that SPOCD1 interacts directly with SPIN1 (SPINDLIN1), a chromatin reader that primarily binds to H3K4me3-K9me3 (ref. 6). The prevailing assumption is that all the molecular events required for piRNA-directed DNA methylation occur after the engagement of MIWI2. We find that SPIN1 expression precedes that of both SPOCD1 and MIWI2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that young LINE1 copies, but not old ones, are marked by H3K4me3, H3K9me3 and SPIN1 before the initiation of piRNA-directed DNA methylation. We generated a Spocd1 separation-of-function allele in the mouse that encodes a SPOCD1 variant that no longer interacts with SPIN1. We found that the interaction between SPOCD1 and SPIN1 is essential for spermatogenesis and piRNA-directed DNA methylation of young LINE1 elements. We propose that piRNA-directed LINE1 DNA methylation requires a developmentally timed two-factor authentication process. The first authentication is the recruitment of SPIN1–SPOCD1 to the young LINE1 promoter, and the second is MIWI2 engagement with the nascent transcript. In summary, independent authentication events underpin the precision of piRNA-directed LINE1 DNA methylation. In male mouse germline development, the precise DNA methylation of young, active transposons requires a two-step process in which SPIN1 and SPOCD1 mark young LINE1 elements before the piRNA pathway triggers DNA methylation."

 Materials with hierarchical architectures that combine soft and hard material domains with coalesced interfaces possess superior properties compared with their homogeneous counterparts1–4. These architectures in synthetic materials have been achieved through deterministic manufacturing strategies such as 3D printing, which require an a priori design and active intervention throughout the process to achieve architectures spanning multiple length scales5–9. Here we harness frontal polymerization spin mode dynamics to autonomously fabricate patterned crystalline domains in poly(cyclooctadiene) with multiscale organization. This rapid, dissipative processing method leads to the formation of amorphous and semi-crystalline domains emerging from the internal interfaces generated between the solid polymer and the propagating cure front. The size, spacing and arrangement of the domains are controlled by the interplay between the reaction kinetics, thermochemistry and boundary conditions. Small perturbations in the fabrication conditions reproducibly lead to remarkable changes in the patterned microstructure and the resulting strength, elastic modulus and toughness of the polymer. This ability to control mechanical properties and performance solely through the initial conditions and the mode of front propagation represents a marked advancement in the design and manufacturing of advanced multiscale materials.

 Entanglement is a key feature of quantum mechanics1–3, with applications in fields such as metrology, cryptography, quantum information and quantum computation4–8. It has been observed in a wide variety of systems and length scales, ranging from the microscopic9–13 to the macroscopic14–16. However, entanglement remains largely unexplored at the highest accessible energy scales. Here we report the highest-energy observation of entanglement, in top–antitop quark events produced at the Large Hadron Collider, using a proton–proton collision dataset with a centre-of-mass energy of √s = 13 TeV and an integrated luminosity of 140 inverse femtobarns (fb)−1 recorded with the ATLAS experiment. Spin entanglement is detected from the measurement of a single observable D, inferred from the angle between the charged leptons in their parent top- and antitop-quark rest frames. The observable is measured in a narrow interval around the top–antitop quark production threshold, at which the entanglement detection is expected to be significant. It is reported in a fiducial phase space defined with stable particles to minimize the uncertainties that stem from the limitations of the Monte Carlo event generators and the parton shower model in modelling top-quark pair production. The entanglement marker is measured to be D = −0.537 ± 0.002 (stat.) ± 0.019 (syst.) for

              . The observed result is more than five standard deviations from a scenario without entanglement and hence constitutes the first observation of entanglement in a pair of quarks and the highest-energy observation of entanglement so far. Entanglement was observed in top–antitop quark events by the ATLAS experiment produced at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN using a proton–proton collision dataset with a centre-of-mass energy of √s  = 13 TeV and an integrated luminosity of 140 fb−1."

Fowler;Robin Ramstad;Hans Nilsson,Mars’s induced magnetosphere can degenerate,"When the cone angle between the solar wind velocity and the solar wind magnetic field is small at Mars, the induced magnetosphere degenerates. 
 The interaction between planets and stellar winds can lead to atmospheric loss and is, thus, important for the evolution of planetary atmospheres1. The planets in our Solar System typically interact with the solar wind, whose velocity is at a large angle to the embedded stellar magnetic field. For planets without an intrinsic magnetic field, this interaction creates an induced magnetosphere and a bow shock in front of the planet2. However, when the angle between the solar wind velocity and the solar wind magnetic field (cone angle) is small, the interaction is very different3. Here we show that when the cone angle is small at Mars, the induced magnetosphere degenerates. There is no shock on the dayside, only weak flank shocks. A cross-flow plume appears and the ambipolar field drives planetary ions upstream. Hybrid simulations with a 4° cone angle show agreement with observations by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission4 and Mars Express5. Degenerate, induced magnetospheres are complex and not yet explored objects. It remains to be studied what the secondary effects are on processes like atmospheric loss through ion escape. When the cone angle between the solar wind velocity and the solar wind magnetic field is small at Mars, the induced magnetosphere degenerates."

Djorgovski,Black hole jets on the scale of the cosmic web,"Radio images reveal distant black hole jets of cosmological length, suggesting that the environmental impact of supermassive black holes extends further in space and time than previously thought. 
 When sustained for megayears (refs. 1,2), high-power jets from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) become the largest galaxy-made structures in the Universe3. By pumping electrons, atomic nuclei and magnetic fields into the intergalactic medium (IGM), these energetic flows affect the distribution of matter and magnetism in the cosmic web4–6 and could have a sweeping cosmological influence if they reached far at early epochs. For the past 50 years, the known size range of black hole jet pairs ended at 4.6–5.0 Mpc (refs. 7–9), or 20–30% of a cosmic void radius in the Local Universe10. An observational lack of longer jets, as well as theoretical results11, thus suggested a growth limit at about 5 Mpc (ref. 12). Here we report observations of a radio structure spanning about 7 Mpc, or roughly 66% of a coeval cosmic void radius, apparently generated by a black hole between

This system demonstrates that jets can avoid destruction by magnetohydrodynamical instabilities over cosmological distances, even at epochs when the Universe was 7 to

 Although a ubiquitous natural phenomenon, the onset and subsequent process of surface wave breaking are not fully understood. Breaking affects how steep waves become and drives air–sea exchanges1. Most seminal and state-of-the-art research on breaking is underpinned by the assumption of two-dimensionality, although ocean waves are three dimensional. We present experimental results that assess how three-dimensionality affects breaking, without putting limits on the direction of travel of the waves. We show that the breaking-onset steepness of the most directionally spread case is double that of its unidirectional counterpart. We identify three breaking regimes. As directional spreading increases, horizontally overturning ‘travelling-wave breaking’ (I), which forms the basis of two-dimensional breaking, is replaced by vertically jetting ‘standing-wave breaking’ (II). In between, ‘travelling-standing-wave breaking’ (III) is characterized by the formation of vertical jets along a fast-moving crest. The mechanisms in each regime determine how breaking limits steepness and affects subsequent air–sea exchanges. Unlike in two dimensions, three-dimensional wave-breaking onset does not limit how steep waves may become, and we produce directionally spread waves 80% steeper than at breaking onset and four times steeper than equivalent two-dimensional waves at their breaking onset.

Edmonds,Rules of river avulsion change downstream,"A novel theoretical framework reveals how topography surrounding rivers causes dramatic changes in their courses, with implications for natural hazard prediction, particularly in the Global South. 
 Avulsing rivers create new pathways on the floodplain and the associated flooding can profoundly affect society1–4. River avulsions are thought to occur when the water column becomes perched above the floodplain5 or when the slope down the flanks of the channel provides a steeper descent than the existing river channel6,7. We test these classical ideas by quantifying the topography around avulsing rivers and show that these mechanisms, historically invoked separately, work together. Near coasts, rivers avulse when the slope away from the channel is steeper, not because they are perched. The opposite is true near mountain fronts; on fans, the alternative paths are similarly steep to the downstream path, so rivers avulse when they are perched above the surrounding landscape. We reconcile these findings and present a new theoretical framework that identifies which rivers are vulnerable to avulsion and predicts the path of an avulsing river. These first-order rules of avulsion suggest that avulsion risks are underestimated in many coastal environments8 and that probabilistic predictions of avulsion pathfinding can efficiently map hazards with minimal information. Applying these principles for risk assessment could particularly benefit the Global South, which is disproportionately affected by avulsions. A novel theoretical framework reveals how topography surrounding rivers causes dramatic changes in their courses, with implications for natural hazard prediction, particularly in the Global South."

 Micronuclear batteries harness energy from the radioactive decay of radioisotopes to generate electricity on a small scale, typically in the nanowatt or microwatt range1,2. Contrary to chemical batteries, the longevity of a micronuclear battery is tied to the half-life of the used radioisotope, enabling operational lifetimes that can span several decades3. Furthermore, the radioactive decay remains unaffected by environmental factors such as temperature, pressure and magnetic fields, making the micronuclear battery an enduring and reliable power source in scenarios in which conventional batteries prove impractical or challenging to replace4. Common radioisotopes of americium (241Am and 243Am) are α-decay emitters with half-lives longer than hundreds of years. Severe self-adsorption in traditional architectures of micronuclear batteries impedes high-efficiency α-decay energy conversion, making the development of α-radioisotope micronuclear batteries challenging5,6. Here we propose a micronuclear battery architecture that includes a coalescent energy transducer by incorporating 243Am into a luminescent lanthanide coordination polymer. This couples radioisotopes with energy transducers at the molecular level, resulting in an 8,000-fold enhancement in energy conversion efficiency from α decay energy to sustained autoluminescence compared with that of conventional architectures. When implemented in conjunction with a photovoltaic cell that translates autoluminescence into electricity, a new type of radiophotovoltaic micronuclear battery with a total power conversion efficiency of 0.889% and a power per activity of 139 microwatts per curie (μW Ci−1) is obtained.

 Subcellular protein localization regulates protein function and can be corrupted in cancers1 and neurodegenerative diseases2,3. The rewiring of localization to address disease-driving phenotypes would be an attractive targeted therapeutic approach. Molecules that harness the trafficking of a shuttle protein to control the subcellular localization of a target protein could enforce targeted protein relocalization and rewire the interactome. Here we identify a collection of shuttle proteins with potent ligands amenable to incorporation into targeted relocalization-activating molecules (TRAMs), and use these to relocalize endogenous proteins. Using a custom imaging analysis pipeline, we show that protein steady-state localization can be modulated through molecular coupling to shuttle proteins containing sufficiently strong localization sequences and expressed in the necessary abundance. We analyse the TRAM-induced relocalization of different proteins and then use nuclear hormone receptors as shuttles to redistribute disease-driving mutant proteins such as SMARCB1Q318X, TDP43ΔNLS and FUSR495X. TRAM-mediated relocalization of FUSR495X to the nucleus from the cytoplasm correlated with a reduction in the number of stress granules in a model of cellular stress. With methionyl aminopeptidase 2 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 as endogenous cytoplasmic and nuclear shuttles, respectively, we demonstrate relocalization of endogenous PRMT9, SOS1 and FKBP12. Small-molecule-mediated redistribution of nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 from nuclei to axons in primary neurons was able to slow axonal degeneration and pharmacologically mimic the genetic WldS gain-of-function phenotype in mice resistant to certain types of neurodegeneration4. The concept of targeted protein relocalization could therefore inspire approaches for treating disease through interactome rewiring. Targeted protein relocalization using shuttle proteins with potent ligands amenable to incorporation into targeted relocalization activating molecules could be used to regulate cellular physiology and correct disease states in neurodegenerative diseases, cancer and genetic disorders."

 The coupling of conduction electrons and magnetic textures leads to quantum transport phenomena described by the language of emergent electromagnetic fields1–3. For magnetic skyrmions, spin-swirling particle-like objects, an emergent magnetic field is produced by their topological winding4–6, resulting in the conduction electrons exhibiting the topological Hall effect (THE)7. When the skyrmion lattice (SkL) acquires a drift velocity under conduction electron flow, an emergent electric field is also generated8,9. The resulting emergent electrodynamics dictate the magnitude of the THE by the relative motion of SkL and conduction electrons. Here we report the emergent electrodynamics induced by SkL motion in Gd2PdSi3, facilitated by its giant THE10,11. With increasing current excitation, we observe the dynamic transition of the SkL motion from the pinned to creep regime and finally to the flow regime, in which the THE is totally suppressed. We argue that the Galilean relativity required for the total cancellation of the THE may be generically recovered in the flow regime, even in complex multiband systems such as the present compound. Moreover, the observed THE voltages are large enough to enable real-time measurement of the SkL velocity–current profile, which shows the inertial-like motion of the SkL in the creep regime, appearing as the current hysteresis of the skyrmion velocity.

 Climate models indicate that dry extremes will be exacerbated in many regions of the world1,2. However, confidence in the magnitude and timing of these projected changes remains low3,4, leaving societies largely unprepared5,6. Here we show that constraining model projections with observations using a newly proposed emergent constraint (EC) reduces the uncertainty in predictions of a core drought indicator, the longest annual dry spell (LAD), by 10–26% globally. Our EC-corrected projections reveal that the increase in LAD will be 42–44% greater, on average, than ‘mid-range’ or ‘high-end’ future forcing scenarios currently indicate. These results imply that by the end of this century, the global mean land-only LAD could be 10 days longer than currently expected. Using two generations of climate models, we further uncover global regions for which historical LAD biases affect the magnitude of projected LAD increases, and we explore the role of land–atmosphere feedbacks therein. Our findings reveal regions with potentially higher- and earlier-than-expected drought risks for societies and ecosystems, and they point to possible mechanisms underlying the biases in the current generation of climate models.

 Metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes are marked by insulin resistance1,2. Cells within the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC), which are crucial for regulating metabolism, become insulin resistant during the progression of metabolic disease3–8, but these mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we investigated the role of a specialized chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan extracellular matrix, termed a perineuronal net, which surrounds ARC neurons. In metabolic disease, the perineuronal net of the ARC becomes augmented and remodelled, driving insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction. Disruption of the perineuronal net in obese mice, either enzymatically or with small molecules, improves insulin access to the brain, reversing neuronal insulin resistance and enhancing metabolic health. Our findings identify ARC extracellular matrix remodelling as a fundamental mechanism driving metabolic diseases.

 Space radiation is a notable hazard for long-duration human spaceflight1. Associated risks include cancer, cataracts, degenerative diseases2 and tissue reactions from large, acute exposures3. Space radiation originates from diverse sources, including galactic cosmic rays4, trapped-particle (Van Allen) belts5 and solar-particle events6. Previous radiation data are from the International Space Station and the Space Shuttle in low-Earth orbit protected by heavy shielding and Earth’s magnetic field7,8 and lightly shielded interplanetary robotic probes such as Mars Science Laboratory and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter9,10. Limited data from the Apollo missions11–13 and ground measurements with substantial caveats are also available14. Here we report radiation measurements from the heavily shielded Orion spacecraft on the uncrewed Artemis I lunar mission. At differing shielding locations inside the vehicle, a fourfold difference in dose rates was observed during proton-belt passes that are similar to large, reference solar-particle events. Interplanetary cosmic-ray dose equivalent rates in Orion were as much as 60% lower than previous observations9. Furthermore, a change in orientation of the spacecraft during the proton-belt transit resulted in a reduction of radiation dose rates of around 50%. These measurements validate the Orion for future crewed exploration and inform future human spaceflight mission design.

 The planarian Schmidtea mediterranea is being studied as a model species for regeneration, but the assembly of planarian genomes remains challenging. Here, we report a high-quality haplotype-phased, chromosome-scale genome assembly of the sexual S2 strain of S. mediterranea and high-quality chromosome-scale assemblies of its three close relatives, S. polychroa, S. nova, and S. lugubris. Using hybrid gene annotations and optimized ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq protocols for regulatory element annotation, we provide valuable genome resources for the planarian research community and a first comparative perspective on planarian genome evolution. Our analyses reveal substantial divergence in protein-coding sequences and regulatory regions but considerable conservation within promoter and enhancer annotations. We also find frequent retrotransposon-associated chromosomal inversions and interchromosomal translocations within the genus Schmidtea and, remarkably, independent and nearly complete losses of ancestral metazoan synteny in Schmidtea and two other flatworm groups. Overall, our results suggest that platyhelminth genomes can evolve without syntenic constraints. Planarians are model systems for stem cells and regeneration.

 Atomically dispersed single atom (SA) and atomic cluster (AC) metallic materials attract tremendous attentions in various fields. Expanding monometallic SA and AC to multimetallic SA/AC composites opens vast scientific and technological potentials yet exponentially increasing the synthesis difficulty. Here, we present a general energy-selective-clustering methodology to build the largest reported library of carbon supported bi-/multi-metallic SA/AC materials. The discrepancy in cohesive energy results into selective metal clustering thereby driving the symbiosis of multimetallic SA or/and AC. The library includes 23 bimetallic SA/AC composites, and expanded compositional space of 17 trimetallic, quinary-metallic, septenary-metallic SA/AC composites. We chose bimetallic M1SAM2AC to demonstrate the electrocatalysis utility. Unique decoupled active sites and inter-site synergy lead to 8/47 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 for alkaline/acidic hydrogen evolution and over 1000 h durability in water electrolyzer. Moreover, delicate modulations towards composition and configuration yield high-performance catalysts for multiple electrocatalysis systems.

 Seismic faults release the stress accumulated during tectonic movement through rapid ruptures or slow-slip events. The role of slow-slip events is crucial as they impact earthquakes occurrence. However, the mechanisms by which slow-slip affects the failure of frictionally locked regions remain elusive. Here, building on laboratory experiments, we establish that a slow-slip region acts as a nucleation center for seismic rupture, enhancing earthquakes’ frequency. We emulate slow-slip regions by introducing a granular material along part of a laboratory fault. Measuring the fault’s response to shear reveals that the heterogeneity serves as an initial rupture, reducing the fault shear resistance. Additionally, the slow-slip region extends beyond the heterogeneity with increasing normal load, demonstrating that fault composition is not the only requirement for slow-slip. Our results show that slow-slip modifies rupture nucleation dynamics, highlighting the importance of accounting for the evolution of the slow-slip region under varying conditions for seismic hazard mitigation.

 Cities are critical for achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Their urban sustainable development (USD) plans and policies cover a wide range of issues, such as biodiversity protection, transportation or poverty reduction. Yet, such policy-making may lack democratic legitimacy if these policies are out of step with the demands and concerns of residents. Considering this, the present study compares residents’ preferences about USD policy issues with the priorities set out in existing USD policy plans. We scrutinized the preferences of 5,800 residents across eight European cities through the application of survey experiments and simultaneously examined 166 existing USD policy plans from these cities and compared them with the survey results. Our findings indicate an on average high acceptance of USD (72.61%) but with substantial democratic discrepancies: while USD policy plans predominantly prioritize issues, such as biodiversity, education and transportation, residents expressed preferences for issues linked to their essential and everyday needs, such as cost of living, public health and poverty. These democratic discrepancies between residents’ priorities and the content of USD policy plans highlight the necessity of securing basic human needs as integral aspects of USD to foster a more profound and democratically supported urban socio-ecological sustainability transformation.

 Climate change is affecting the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as droughts or floods, which result in loss and damage to people, crops and infrastructure. Global data on loss and damage used in research, policy and media primarily come from macrostatistics based on disaster inventories. Here, we propose a different approach, based on survey microdata. We harmonize data from 120,000 agricultural fields in six African countries for a period from 2008 to 2019 and quantify crop production losses related to climate shocks. We find substantial damages which affect around 35% of plots and reduce national crop production by 29% on average. The economic impacts are greater than the global disaster data suggest. The economic losses resulting from droughts and flood alone are US$5.1 billion higher than reported in disaster inventories, affecting between 145 and 170 million people. The difference stems mostly from smaller and less severe but frequent adverse events that go under-reported or undetected in disaster inventories and therefore elude macrostatistics and reporting. The findings have implications for measurement and policies related to loss and damage and disaster risk reduction.

 Interannual global mean surface temperature (GMST) forecast provides critical insights into the economic and societal implications of climate variability. The pronounced GMST elevation in 2023–2024 indicates that the Earth may have accumulated enough heat to cause widespread disasters, underscoring the necessity for establishing accurate short-term GMST predictions to offer timely and sustainable public service. However, capturing high-frequency annual variability (ANV) component of GMST poses challenges due to its susceptibility to intraseasonal-to-interannual (ISI) noises, particularly across the Northern Hemisphere’s mid-to-high latitudes. Averaging these ISI variations in November and December effectively enhances signal clarity, especially over oceans, and masks unpredictable noises on land. By forecasting the average GMST for November and December to extract ANV predictability, a strategy for annual GMST prediction was established. This approach successfully advanced precise GMST hindcasts by up to 2-months during 1980–2022, exceeding performance of existing climate models and boosting early warning for interannual GMST shifts."

 Soil moisture–atmosphere feedback (SAF) is expected to accelerate warming in the future, but its influences on the terrestrial water cycle over non-traditional hotspots of land–atmosphere coupling (e.g., East Asia) remains elusive due to strong heterogeneity and uncertainties at model grid scales. Here we show robust evidence of the integral effects of SAF on streamflow under future warming across major river basins in China. Based on high-resolution hydrological modelings driven by CMIP6 simulations with/without land–atmosphere coupling, SAF is projected to significantly increase spring streamflow by 28–58% in mid-latitude China, but decrease it by 12–48% in other regions. Such contrary effects are attributed to the soil moisture-precipitation interaction, which causes spatially opposite changes in precipitation through thermodynamic (e.g., ascending/descending vertical motions) and thermal (e.g., weakened meridional water vapor transport) atmospheric adjustments. Our result highlights the importance of SAF in altering freshwater resources even in locations not typically considered to be SAF hotspots.

 Nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions from forest soils are typically intensified under elevated anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition, likely due to increased N availability. However, the extent to which these emissions are linked to N availability across different timescales remains poorly understood. Here we investigated the temporal-scale-dependent mechanisms of N₂O emissions in a subalpine forest under N-addition, using hourly-resolved N₂O measurements. Our findings revealed that N-addition induced both pulse emissions and a long-lasting effect on soil N₂O emissions. The pulse emissions occurred immediately after each N-addition, indicating a strong linkage between the pulse events and elevated N availability. However, variations in annual N₂O emissions were not directly regulated by N availability but were instead explained by denitrifying microbial functional genes ratio. A global meta-analysis further confirmed the importance of microbial functional genes in regulating N2O emissions in natural terrestrial ecosystems. Our results suggest a crucial role of microbial functional genes in predicting annual N2O emissions from forest soils. Addition of nitrogen to subalpine forest soil leads to scale-dependent pulses of nitrous oxide emissions and increases in seasonal and annual emissions that were modified by the abundance of microbial functional genes, according to manipulated field experiments."

 Improving our understanding of future ocean carbon uptake requires a nuanced understanding of the value of the annual ocean sink. Here, we combine an abatement cost-based approach and a climate damage-based approach to assess the value of the annual ocean sink. The former shows that the aggregate cost of national climate policies could increase by up to USD 80 billion if the ocean carbon sink weakens by 10 percent. As a complementary perspective, the damage-based approach shows that the annual ocean carbon sink contributes between USD 300 billion and USD 2,332 billion to countries’ inclusive wealth. Despite the conceptual appeal of the damage-based approach for its potential insights into regional wealth redistribution, uncertainties in national social cost of carbon estimates make it less reliable than the abatement cost-based approach, which in turn provides more reliable estimates for a fiscal cost assessment of improved monitoring services of the ocean carbon sink. The annual ocean carbon sink contributes up to 2,332 billion US dollars to countries’ inclusive wealth, and the cost of climate policies could increase by up to 80 billion US dollars if the carbon sink weakens by 10 percent, according to an analysis that uses cost-effective and damage-based approaches."

Grottoli,Ocean acidification does not prolong recovery of coral holobionts from natural thermal stress in two consecutive years,"Ocean acidification played no physiological role in coral susceptibility to thermal-stress-induced bleaching and did not alter the recovery of corals from heat stress in 2014 and 2015 in Hawai'i, according to observations of ambient and simulated ocean acidification. 
 Under predicted future ocean conditions, corals will experience frequent and intense thermal stress events while simultaneously being exposed to chronic ocean acidification. Yet, some corals will likely be more resistant and/or resilient to these predicted conditions than others and may be critical to reef persistence in the future. Following natural thermal stress in two consecutive years (2014 and 2015), we evaluated the effects of feeding and simulated ocean acidification on the physiological recovery of Montipora capitata and Porites compressa sourced from Kāneʻohe Bay and Waimānalo Bay, Hawaiʻi. Following the 2014 thermal stress event, simulated ocean acidification did not slow recovery of the holobiont and feeding enhanced recovery. However, feeding did not decrease susceptibility to the 2015 thermal stress event, and simulated ocean acidification did not increase susceptibility. Recovery strategies employed between species and between sites clearly differed, highlighting that coral reef restoration and management should consider species-level and site-specific vulnerabilities. Overall, our findings call attention to the immediate threat which ocean warming presents, the lack of additional stress to the holobiont from ocean acidification, the importance of heterotrophy in coral resilience, and the potential significance of additional local biotic stressors (i.e., predator outbreaks) for coral resiliency under annual thermal stress. Ocean acidification played no physiological role in coral susceptibility to thermal-stress-induced bleaching and did not alter the recovery of corals from heat stress in 2014 and 2015 in Hawai'i, according to observations of ambient and simulated ocean acidification."

 Understanding spatial interactions in urban environments has become critical in the context of spatio-temporal big data. However, Spatial–temporal big data often exhibit non-uniformity, necessitating the imputation of spatial interaction relationships derived from the analysis of such data. Previous studies often used simplified grid-based or TAZ approaches that ignore the complex interactions for spatial interaction imputation, leading to limitations in accuracy. In this paper, we proposed a two-layer spatial interaction imputation framework (SIF) for accurate multi-scale spatial interaction imputation. To our knowledge, this is the first time that we impute spatial interactions in multi-scale urban areas. In the first layer, it utilised a hierarchical spatial units division algorithm inspired by Shannon’s information entropy to hierarchically classify study area using point of interest (POI) data; In the second layer, it integrates the classified areas and travel flow data into a spatial interaction graph convolutional network (SI-GCN) for spatial interaction imputation. Two case studies were conducted in Beijing, China and New York City, USA, using over eight million taxi data and one million bike-sharing data. The results showed the superior performance of SIF compared to baseline models. The results also analysed the travel behaviours in both Cities, as well as the impact of social, economic and environmental factors on passengers’ spatial choices when travelling."

 Automatic 3D reconstruction from spaceborne charge-coupled device (CCD) optical imagery is still a challenge as the rational functional model (RFM) based reconstruction pipeline failed to amount to the advances of pinhole based approaches in computer vision and photogrammetry. As a consequence, the accuracy and completeness of the reconstructed surface by RFM based pipeline improved slightly recent years. Though the perspective camera approximation model was explored to convert the RFM to pinhole model, it could hardly guarantee the reconstruction accuracy due to the re-projection error introduced when approximating the linear push broom camera to perspective camera. Hence, we present a refined equivalent pinhole model (REPM) for 3D reconstruction from spaceborne CCD imagery. We initially investigated the aspects that influence the re-projection error thru mathematical induction and discovered that the image size and height range of the captured area are the two key factors. To ensure the performance of the 3D reconstruction while minimizing the re-projection error, we explored the optimal image size to crop large-scale image with, while alleviated the height range effect on the image space by re-projecting the cropped images to be closed to the pseudo-image that is captured by the approximated perspective camera. The above-mentioned improvements are implemented in an image partition module and an image geometric correction module respectively, and are encompassed in the proposed REPM-based 3D reconstruction pipeline. We conducted extensive experiments on different images covering various areas from different linear-array CCD sensors to verify the proposed approach. The results indicate that our pipeline can achieve higher accuracy and completeness and exhibits great potential. The implementation of the pipeline is available at here."

 Ozone (O3) pollution is increasing in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), with significant influences from regional transport during pollution events. However, the specific contributions of different regions remain imprecisely quantified. This study estimated the regional contributions of eight regions to summer O3 in the YRD using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model with a source-tagged photochemical mechanism. Non-background O3 is attributed to nitrogen oxides (NOX) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from different regions. Background O3 is the predominant contributor with average ratios of 75.0%, 65.3%, 64.8% and 63.0% for Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou and the entire YRD, respectively. Locally formed O3 are 39.9, 42.0, 39.6, and 36.9 parts per billion (ppb) by volume in the above areas. North Zhejiang and south Jiangsu are the primary sources of heavy pollution episodes as the maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O3 concentrations in these regions increase the most. NOX is the predominant contributor to heavy pollution episodes with the maximum increment attributed to NOX (O3N) of 14.3 ppb, while VOCs only contribute to 2.1 ppb (O3V) in Jiangsu. Relative humidity is crucial in heavy pollution episodes while high temperature, low planetary boundary layer (PBL) height and the wind field are associated with regional transport. Diurnal variation underscores the importance of understanding O3 formation in the afternoon (12:00–16:00), which is essential for devising effective mitigation policies."

 The interaction between ozone and temperature on cardiovascular biomarkers has not been thoroughly examined. A panel study was conducted among 40 college students with four equal interval follow-ups in Hefei, Anhui Province, China between August and October 2021. Real-time concentrations of ozone were collected from a nearby monitoring device. Temperature variability parameters included diurnal temperature range (DTR), the standard-deviation of temperature (SDT), and temperature variability (TV). A set of cardiovascular biomarkers were measured, including markers of inflammation (Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, GM-CSF and serum amyloid A, SAA), coagulation (D-dimer and ADAMTS13), oxidative stress (Myeloperoxidase, MPO and Growth differentiation factor-15, GDF-15), endothelial function (vascular endothelial growth factor A, VEGFA), and stress hormone (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT). Linear mixed-effect models were conducted to analyze the associations between ozone, temperature variability, and all blood markers. The results showed significant associations among ozone, DTR, SDT, TV, and blood markers, suggesting harmful effects on markers. For instance, a 10-μg/m3 increase in ozone at lag 2d was associated with higher levels of SAA by 19.65% (95%CI: 13.70, 25.60), VEGFA by 10.90% (95%CI: 4.57, 17.22), GDF-15 by 5.33% (95%CI: 0.59, 10.06), and GM-CSF by 2.52% (95%CI: 1.70, 3.34), but 13.09% lower D-dimer (95%CI: 6.99, 19.19). We also found statistically significant interaction between ozone and TV exposures for GM-CSF and SAA. This study shows that ambient ozone and personal TV exposures may independently have acute effects on markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, coagulation, endothelial function, and neuroendocrine stress response. Simultaneous exposure to these factors may also lead to interactive effects on inflammation markers. These findings offer valuable insights for developing comprehensive strategies in cardiovascular disease control and prevention."

 Atmospheric background monitoring provides insights into the long-term changes in atmospheric composition resulting from human activities on both global and regional scales. It is important to understand the local characteristics of key air pollutants to evaluate and manage air quality control policies effectively. This study analyzed 13 years of continuous data of PM10 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤10 μm) concentration from the only atmospheric background station in Northeastern China, the Longfengshan (LFS) World Meteorological Organization (WMO)/Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) regional station. The results revealed a significant decrease of 58.02% in PM10 concentrations in the LFS from 2007 to 2019, which was primarily influenced by transport from Changchun and Harbin. Over periods exceeding eight months, the correlation between PM10 levels at the LFS atmospheric background station and those in Changchun and Harbin became more pronounced. The observed decline in PM10 concentrations at the LFS atmospheric background station was largely attributed to reduced emissions from urban residential and agricultural sources. Emissions of carbon monoxide and ammonia from these sources, along with temperature and relative humidity (RH), significantly affected the PM10 concentrations. Using machine learning (ML) methods and PM10 data from the LFS atmospheric background station, this study effectively predicted PM10 concentrations in neighboring cities, demonstrating that the LFS atmospheric background station can effectively assess the trend of PM10 changes in Northeast China. This study quantified the influence of urban areas on atmospheric background stations, highlighting the effectiveness of existing environmental policies, and offering a reference for similar studies and forecasts in other regions."

 Arising from the Chemical Assessment of Surfaces and Air (CASA) 2022 study at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Net-Zero Energy Residential Test Facility (NZERTF), this paper presents the first evaluation of indoor surface emissions to a house measured with a surface flux chamber coupled to an online, non-targeted volatile organic compound (VOC) mass spectrometric detection. These surface emissions are compared to those assessed using ambient, whole house indoor VOC measurements and the outdoor air change rate. Chamber emission rates varied by almost four orders of magnitude across 35 quantified VOCs. The whole house emissions measured by campaign-long ambient measurements and the flux chamber emissions (when scaled to the painted surface area of the house) are similar, with an average ratio between the two of 1.3 ± 1.0. The general agreement between these two approaches indicates that the flux chamber was not solely measuring primary emissions from building materials located below the chamber. Rather, the results suggest that over the 12-year house lifetime, VOCs have been widely distributed around the house, migrating from their primary sources to secondary surface reservoirs. With the house in a quasi-steady state, the thermodynamic activities (i.e., the vapor pressures) of the VOCs within the different reservoirs become similar. Emissions of aromatics and monoterpenes have declined since the house was built, whereas aldehyde emissions have remained relatively constant."

 Particulate Matter (PM), a primary atmospheric pollutant, is characterized by diverse emission sources and complex influencing factors. Particulate matter source profiles (PM-SPs) reported in different studies exhibited significant variability, and their uncertainty is not well documented, highlighting the urgent need for further research. To scientifically evaluate PM-SPs, this study begins with the construction process of PM-SPs, identifying key stages (sampling, weighing, and chemical analysis) that influence their uncertainty. The uncertainty components at each stage, as well as the comprehensive uncertainty, are then quantitatively assessed, resulting in the development of an assessment method that quantifies the uncertainty of PM-SPs. The industrial PM-SPs are evaluated as a case study, which indicate this full-chain method can quantitatively identify the uncertainties introduced at various stages. The sampling uncertainties are mostly below 40%, primarily resulting from errors in repeat sampling. The weighing uncertainties are generally minor, while the impact of the chemical analysis process varies significantly across different components. Among the fifty-three evaluated PM-SPs, 80% have average comprehensive uncertainties below 40%, with only five profiles exhibiting relatively high uncertainties. In practical applications, the uncertainty assessment of PM-SPs should be analyzed on a case-by-case basis, considering the importance of different components, with special attention given to marker components."

 Isocyanates are known as widespread hazardous environmental pollutants emitted from various combustion products in our lives because they cause health effects to the nervous system and respiratory systems through sensitization. In this study, to obtain data on the concentration and composition of isocyanates in indoor and outdoor air, we developed a novel passive sampler (PSG-DBA) for monitoring gaseous and particulate isocyanates; e.g. isocyanic acid (ICA), methyl isocyanate (MIC), ethyl isocyanate (EIC), and propyl isocyanate (PIC), and acquired basic data of isocyanates on the behavior in general households. This proposed method allows for continuous sampling over a week, making it possible to calculate not only intermittent data but also low concentrations and average concentrations of isocyanate in our daily lives. In addition, from the results of this monitoring, in particular, ICA and MIC were frequently detected in ambient air. In summer, indoor concentrations were typically higher than those outdoors in most houses, e.g., mean concentrations; ICA; 0.21 ppb (summer), 011 ppb (winter); MIC; 0.0052 ppb (summer), 0.0038 ppb (winter). These were also affected by temperature fluctuations due to climate change during summer. PSG-DBA can monitor a wide range of environments to further investigate the environmental dynamics of isocyanates in the future."

 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions from the vehicle refueling process is an increasingly significant issue. However, the gasoline formulation showed seasonal variation, potentially leading to the alterations of VOC components during the refueling process. Refueling VOCs of different gasoline and diesel were collected at some typical gas stations during both summer and winter to analyze their seasonal emissions characteristics, environmental impacts, and associated health risks. The refueling VOC profiles in summer consisted of a notably higher proportion of small oxygenated VOCs (C3) and a significantly lower content of halocarbons compared to those in winter, which indicated that the refueling VOC profiles in just a single season failed to capture characteristics of the entire year. The OFP values of gasoline vapor in two test seasons were consistent (around 2.9 g O3/g VOCs), with the dominant species of acrolein (15.7 ± 2.5%) in summer and i-pentane (23.2 ± 2.1%) in winter. Aromatics contributed the most to secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAP), with toluene (65.4%, summer; 48.5%, winter) being the overwhelmingly dominant species. The assessment of inhalation health risks indicated that exposure to adverse VOCs resulted in definite non-cancer risk (HQ = 5.9) and cancer risk (ICR = 4.6 × 10−4) to the gas station attendant, which exceeded the acceptable level, with 1,3-butadiene exhibiting the highest toxicity and a dual toxicity risk. The impact of VOCs on health was more severe during winter compared to summer. It is recommended that seasonal influences should be considered when controlling VOC pollution at gas stations."

 The detrimental impacts of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on human health, climate, ecosystems, crops, and building materials are well-established. However, there remain unresolved inquiries regarding the precise location of the sources of PM2.5. This study is the first attempt to use a calibrated sensors-based ambient air quality monitoring network (SAAQM network) and regulatory government monitors to train micro-satellite images for high spatial-resolution air pollution field determination of PM2.5 in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. A hybrid approach is developed to integrate three different datasets that include microsatellite images, PM2.5 ground measurements, and supporting information (meteorological parameters and geographical coordinates), to be fed into a Random Trees-Random Forest- Convolutional Neural Network (RT-RF-CNN) joint model to estimate PM2.5 concentrations at a sub-km level. The RT-RF-CNN joint model can derive PM2.5 concentrations at a spatial resolution of 500 m with statistically significant indicators such as spatial r of 0.9, a low root-mean-square error of 26.9 μg/m3 and a mean absolute error of 17.2 μg/m3. Based on our approach, the PM2.5 prediction maps using micro-satellite images (spatial resolution of 3m/pixel) and RT-RF-CNN joint model were generated for each day throughout the study period (December 2021–December 2022). The inter-grid comparison of these maps revealed the intra-urban local hotspots and coolspots at a fine-granular level seasonally, monthly, and daily. It is observed that the monsoon season has the highest number of coolspots (67%), while winter (0.1%), post-monsoon (0.5%) and summer (11%) have fewer. It is noted that the high temporal-spatial information of PM2.5 estimates from our integrated approach is not achievable by ground-based measurements and other existing satellite-based estimates alone. The findings of this study have potential applications on a diverse array, encompassing near real-time daily PM2.5 predicted maps, specific air pollution hotspot identification, PM2.5 exposure assessment at the neighbourhood level, and integration of remote sensing-based micro-satellite images and ground-based measurements."

 The short-, medium- and long-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs, MCCPs, and LCCPs) were measured in outdoor fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and gas-phases in Xi'an in spring, autumn and winter of 2021, which containing two special events during this time, the sandstorms happened in spring and the COVID-19 epidemic in winter. The CPs concentrations in PM2.5 were seasonal variated, with spring (mean: 17.5 ng/m3) > autumn (mean: 8.6 ng/m3) > winter (mean: 5.8 ng/m3). The CPs concentrations in gas phases (mean:12.6 ng/m3) were lower than in PM2.5 in spring, and it showed shorter carbon chain and lower chlorinated CPs dominated in SCCPs in gas phase (C10, Cl5,6) compared with in PM2.5 (C11, Cl6,7). The absorption was the main mechanism for the partitioning of CP in particle and gaseous phase. The shorter carbon chain CPs (C10,11, C14) with lower chlorinated (Cl6,7) CPs dominated in SCCPs and MCCPs, while the longer carbon chain (C25 or C29) with Cl6,12 dominated in the LCCPs. So, more researches about the LCCPs should be concerned. Additionally, the CPs concentrations of all samples during the sandstorms in spring were increased 30.4%–136.5% and the proportion of SCCPs was obviously elevated. CPs concentrations obviously decreased during the COVID-19 epidemic in winter, while SCCPs, MCCPs attributed comparable in autumn and winter. Potential source analysis showed that during the sandstorms in spring, atmospheric pollutants were mainly transported over a long distance from northern and northeast of Shaanxi Province, while it was mainly from local emission during the COVID-19 epidemic in winter. The health risk assessment of CPs displayed that there had no or very low inhalation exposure risks of CPs for all age groups, but the younger age groups (younger than 6 years old) should be played more attention for their not fully development of their immune and respiratory systems."

 Accurate modeling of aerosol-cloud interactions is essential for reliable weather and air quality simulations, given their significant impact on precipitation patterns, cloud dynamics, and aerosol distributions. This study employed the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) to examine the impact of enhanced meteorological simulations, achieved through advanced microphysics parameterization supported by data assimilation techniques, on air quality across Texas on August 19 and 20, 2022. We tested four distinct configurations: (1) the Morrison two-moment bulk microphysics scheme, (2) Morrison's with observation nudging, (3) the Spectral Bin Microphysics (SBM), and (4) SBM with observation nudging. While the SBM scheme is known for its detailed representation of aerosol-cloud interactions, our focus was on how improvements in meteorological accuracy translate to more precise air quality simulations. Our findings demonstrated a progressive improvement in simulation accuracy, starting with the Morrison's scheme and further enhanced by adopting the SBM scheme, complemented by incorporating observation nudging. Specifically, the combination of the SBM scheme and the nudging substantially enhanced the model's ability to capture convective precipitation events, as shown by better alignment with NEXRAD radar reflectivity, with R increasing from −0.21 to 0.82, IOA from 0.10 to 0.87, and NMB decreasing from 99% to 34% in Houston. The enhanced meteorology translated into more accurate PM2.5 concentration simulations, particularly through the more accurate representation of aerosol washout during precipitation events. In Houston, the SBM scheme with nudging improved the model's PM2.5 simulations significantly, with NMB decreasing from −20% to 5% and IOA improving from 0.43 to 0.61. In San Antonio, improvements were also notable, with NMB improved from −27% to −22%, R increased from 0.48 to 0.82, and IOA increased from 0.66 to 0.86. Our results underscore the crucial role of accurate meteorological simulations in refining our understanding of aerosol behaviors in relation to precipitation patterns, directly enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of air quality modeling."

 With the development of industry, the issue of air pollution is of great concern. Due to the sparsity of monitoring stations, acquiring full-coverage PM2.5 concentration remains challenging. The satellite remote sensing datasets provide a potential solution for estimation tasks by its spatiotemporal virtue. In this study, the ellipsoidal coordinate system was introduced for the first time to improve the spatial coding method. A two-stage algorithm using satellite datasets and ground-site values was proposed to impute the missing AOD and estimate PM2.5 concentrations. Firstly, the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model was utilized for imputing the missing AOD, achieving superior accuracy (R2 = 0.929). Secondly, the training efficiency and the accuracy of traditional algorithm were enhanced by innovatively utilizing an efficient attention mechanism and a novel embedding layer. The concept of combining convolutional layers with different output channels and novel spatial preprocessing methods were also innovatively proposed. Consequently, the Spatiotemporal Multi-Sample Parallel Network (STMSPNet) was constructed to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations. Finally, the best performance of this model was obtained by 10-fold cross-validation with R2 of 0.913 and RMSE of 10.637 μg/m3. In addition, this study analyses the changing patterns of PM2.5 concentrations in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from 2019 to 2023, taking into account the COVID-19 outbreak and extreme weather. The reasons for the changes are also discussed in depth through the air pollution control policies enacted by the Chinese government and regional factors. The results show that STMSPNet has a strong estimation advantage."

 Economic development has historically led to environmental challenges, notably in China where fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter no greater than 2.5 μm (PM2.5), has significantly influenced human health and social issues. However, the scarcity and uneven distribution of ground-based PM2.5 observation sites hinder studies about air pollution impacts at regional and national scales. Although PM2.5 datasets based on remote sensing retrieval algorithms have provided long-term and high-resolution gridded near surface PM2.5 concentration data recently, comparisons on accuracy between datasets were not conducted by previous studies. This study evaluated eight publicly accessible PM2.5 datasets (i.e., CHAP, GHAP, GWRPM25, HQQPM25, LGHAP v1, LGHAP v2, MuAP, and TAP) across China using independent records at 1020 monitoring sites from 2017 to 2022 at monthly and annual granularities. Mean Absolute Errors (MAEs) showed a seasonal trend, with higher errors in winter and lower in summer. Datasets exhibited a bias towards overestimation or underestimation based on concentration levels. CHAP, GWRPM25, and HQQPM25 had better estimation control. Additionally, the incorporation of spatiotemporal features into original machine learning based algorithms was likely credited to the outperformance compared to conventional PM2.5 simulation methods. Overall, this study contributed to comprehensive references for PM2.5 concentration dataset users and potential explanations to the variations within and among datasets."

 PM2.5 can cause lung cell injury. Due to the complexity and variation of the physical and chemical properties of PM2.5, the risk of lung cell injury may depend significantly on the type of atmospheric environment. With a population of 120 million, the Chengdu-Chongqing region in China is the most populated region in the world that experiences both high humidity and low solar radiation (HHLR). However, PM2.5-related lung cell injury and treatment strategies in this type of environment are still unclear. Thus, our study focuses on the relationships between the chemical components, lung cell injury effects, and pathogenic mechanisms of PM2.5 in HHLR (HHLR-PM2.5). In terms of mass, organic carbon (OC), NO3−, SO42−, and NH4+ are found to be the most significant components of HHLR-PM2.5. Extracts of HHLR-PM2.5 significantly inhibit cell viability, stimulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and trigger inflammation. Utilizing a combination of multi-omics, bioinformatics, and molecular biology, it is found that HHLR-PM2.5 extracts inhibit E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (UHRF1) to suppress DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and hamper DNA methylation, culminating in lung cell injury. Additionally, integrating transcriptomic data with human disease databases highlights chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as a potential lung cell injury-related respiratory affliction induced by HHLR-PM2.5. This study expands the scientific comprehension of the health risks associated with HHLR-PM2.5, deciphers the molecular mechanism of lung cell injury, and provides precise treatment strategies for HHLR-PM2.5-induced lung cell injury."

 This study evaluated the exposure of commuters to particulate matter (PM), black carbon (BC), and ultrafine particulate matter (UFP) concentrations in five different traffic microenvironments (bike, bus, taxi, electric motorbike, and subway) under various conditions, such as regular and dust days, weekdays and weekends, and peak and off-peak commute hours in Nanjing, China. In the morning peak hours, bicycle commuters were exposed to the highest PM concentration, those on buses to the highest BC concentration (3.4 ± 3.0 μg/m3), and those on buses and taxis to the highest UFP number concentration. Throughout the rides, the commuter on the subway had the lowest mean exposure concentration of PM, BC, and UFP number. Bicycle commuters (16.25 μg/km) had the highest total inhaled dose of PM2.5, followed by e-bikers (1.98 μg/km), bus riders (1.28 μg/km), taxi riders (0.69 μg/km), and subway users (0.45 μg/km). Weekday PM2.5 exposure levels (115 μg/m3) and BC exposure levels (1.8 μg/m3) were higher than weekend levels (170% and 158%, respectively). The mean exposure concentration of PM10 (1299 ± 1286 μg/m3) in the evening peak of dust days was 803% and 994% higher than the mean concentrations on weekdays and holidays, respectively. PM2.5, PM10, and BC concentrations on dust days were significantly higher than those on weekdays and holidays. The overall mean ratios of PM1/PM2.5 and PM2.5/PM10 were 0.47 and 0.36, respectively, and the five commuting microenvironments had higher proportions of 2.5–10 μm and 1–2.5 μm particles in PM10 and PM2.5, respectively.

 Aromatherapy can relieve stress and lower blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) in humans. However, whether exposure to ambient aromas in the workplace has positive or negative cardiovascular effects remains unclear. We recruited 356 healthy office workers from 10 companies in Northern Taiwan to conduct a prospective observational study from 2019 to 2022. Six repeated visits were conducted for each worker to measure HR, systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), perceived stress scale (PSS), and exposure to particulate air pollution and total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) at the workplace. Mixed-effects models were used to explore the association between air pollution exposure and cardiovascular effects. The results showed significant associations between TVOCs, particulate air pollution and adverse cardiovascular effects, including increased HR and BP among office workers with heavy use of essential oils (office workers who used and/or were exposed to essential oils for more than 1 h per day in the workplace and home). No significant association between air pollution exposure and cardiovascular effects was observed among workers without essential oils usage. However, an association between TVOCs exposure and beneficial cardiovascular effects (decreased HR and BP) was observed among workers with light use of essential oils. Moreover, workers with heavy use of essential oils were significantly associated with increased PSS scores. We concluded that workers with heavy use of essential oils exposed to TVOCs in the workplace may lead to adverse cardiovascular effects and increased self-reported stress."

 As the core city in northwestern China, Xi'an has suffered from serious O3 pollution in recent years. An observational model, coupled with the Master Chemical Mechanism (V3.3.1) and comprehensive data, analyzed atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC), O3 formation mechanism, precursor sensitivity and control strategies in Xi'an. The study examined two periods (period I and II), with notable temperature and humidity differences. Despite lower precursor levels in period I, an O3 episode (peak value: 102.68 ppb) occurred only in period I, highlighting the crucial influence of meteorological conditions. Higher removal rate of primary pollutants occurs in period I, but meteorological conditions may not alter the dominant factor of AOC. Period I exhibited markedly high OH reactivity, with aromatics, alkenes, and NOx being the main contributors. HONO photolysis (50.78%) in the morning and O3 photolysis (34.13%) in the afternoon were the main HOx sources in period I, while HONO photolysis (62.86–80.68%) was significant at daytime for period II. Higher temperatures in period I accelerated all reaction rates involved in radical cycling, especially emphasizing RO2 + NO → RO + NO2. The results of sensitivity analysis showed that O3 sensitivity regime is VOC-limited in Xi'an, but the specific reactive species target VOC reductions emissions exhibited discrepancies for two distinct periods. A 20% decrease in VOCs and a 50% decrease in NOx (VOCs/NOx = 0.4) was proposed to be the optimal solution to achieve the O3 control target in period I. This study enhances our understanding of O3 formation under different meteorological conditions and provides scientific evidence for O3 pollution abatement policies in northwestern China, with potential applicability to other cities in this region and similar countries."

 The concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the atmospheres above major cities in Northeast China are relatively high. Dew is an effective way to settle and remove particulate and gaseous matter in the formation process. Notably, 16-PAH concentration dew analysis was conducted in four major cities (Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang and Dalian) from April to November 2023. In the study area, 2–3-ring PAHs dominated in dew in both the dissolved and particle phases, followed by 4-ring and 5–6-ring PAHs. Phe was the most common individual PAH in dew. Because PAHs in wet deposition are closely related to those in the atmosphere, the concentration of PAHs in dew was much lower than that in snow. The proportions of the gaseous-phase scavenging ratio (Wg) to the total scavenging ratio (Wt) in Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang and Dalian increased with increasing temperature, reaching 22.98%, 29.02%, 30.71% and 33.22%, respectively, which indicated that the ability of dew to remove PAHs in the particle phase was greater than that to remove PAHs in the gas phase. The concentration of dissolved-phase PAHs in dew was lower than that of particle-phase PAHs. The total PAH fluxes were 43.25, 33.35, 32.16, and 25.63 ng/m2·d in Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang and Dalian, respectively, decreasing from north to south. The dew amount was much smaller than the rainfall and snow amount (by two orders of magnitude), and the PAH flux in dew was much lower than that in rain and snow. Isomeric ratio assessment coupled with principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the source of PAHs in dew was a combination of vehicle emissions and biomass and coal combustion. PAHs in dew mainly originated from local sources rather than from long-range atmospheric transport. This study revealed the effects of PAHs in dew on the air quality and the removal of PAHs by dew."

 Advanced machine learning models have recently achieved high predictive accuracy for weather and climate prediction. However, these complex models often lack inherent transparency and interpretability, acting as “black boxes” that impede user trust and hinder further model improvements. As such, interpretable machine learning techniques have become crucial in enhancing the credibility and utility of weather and climate modeling. In this paper, we review current interpretable machine learning approaches applied to meteorological predictions. We categorize methods into two major paradigms: (1) Post-hoc interpretability techniques that explain pre-trained models, such as perturbation-based, game theory based, and gradient-based attribution methods. (2) Designing inherently interpretable models from scratch using architectures like tree ensembles and explainable neural networks. We summarize how each technique provides insights into the predictions, uncovering novel meteorological relationships captured by machine learning. Lastly, we discuss research challenges and provide future perspectives around achieving deeper mechanistic interpretations aligned with physical principles, developing standardized evaluation benchmarks, integrating interpretability into iterative model development workflows, and providing explainability for large foundation models."

 This study investigated the inter-annual variations, transport pathways, pollution sources, and health implications of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in Zhengzhou, China, a city notably affected by ground-level ozone (O3) pollution. Analyzing VOCs data from the summers of 2017–2021 revealed an average summer VOCs concentration of 61.8 ± 18.2 μg/m3, predominantly consisting of alkanes (55.0%), aromatics (22.5%), and alkenes (16.9%). The study identified significant year-to-year disparities in VOC abundances and compositions, which were closely linked to meteorological conditions, including temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity. Additionally, factors like air mass origin, direction and transport distance critically influenced the VOCs characteristics, with local air masses exhibiting higher VOC concentrations than those from distances of 100–500 km to the northwest, west and east. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis identified major sources of VOCs as vehicle exhaust, oil and gas evaporation, solvent use, and biogenic emissions, with their contributions varying annually influenced by regional transport, environmental policies, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Health risk assessments, following U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidelines, indicated negligible non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks from VOCs exposure, except for a potential carcinogenic risk from ethylbenzene. Solvent use sources were found to have the highest risks, with non-carcinogenic risks at 4.1 × 10−3 (negligible) and carcinogenic risks at 7.8 × 10−7 (with potentially carcinogenic in 2017 but negligible in subsequent years). This research underscored the complex dynamics of VOCs pollution and provided insights for developing effective pollution control strategies and enhancing public health in urban settings."

 Bioaerosols, prevalent in the atmosphere, serve as carriers for microbe transmission and can also act as Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) and Ice Nuclei (IN), exerting significant influence on cloud microphysics, radiative forcing, precipitation processes, and global climate dynamics. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive study of airborne fungi from the Northwest Pacific to the Arctic Ocean. During the 9th Chinese National Arctic Research Expedition (Chinare, 2018) cruise, total suspended particulate matter (TSP) samples were collected, followed by high-throughput sequencing to determine the microbial community's structure. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota are widespread in marine fungal aerosols along this route, with a notably higher abundance of Epicoccum and Cladosporium in fungal aerosols from the low-latitude Northwest Pacific compared to the high-latitude Arctic Ocean region. The composition of fungal communities depended on air mass transport processes and environmental factors. Long-range transport of terrestrial air masses not only enriches the abundance of fungal aerosols but also increases the relative abundance of dominant genera such as Basidiomycota, Epicoccum and Cladosporium. The knowledge gap about fungal aerosols over the Arctic route from the Northwest Pacific to the Arctic Ocean was filled in part by this work.

 The National Park Service (NPS) has a need to measure real-time PM2.5 and haze levels across its many park units to inform the public of unhealthy air and track visual degradation of park scenic vistas. To fulfill this need, the NPS deployed PurpleAir monitors (PA) in several park units. PA monitors are inexpensive monitors promoted as particle counters capable of measuring particle size distributions. Each PA is equipped with two Plantower (PMS) particle counters and a temperature, relative humidity (RH) and pressure sensor. In 2022, the NPS initiated a field study to evaluate PA limitations, uncertainties, and how the measurements relate to particle light scattering. The study was conducted in Fort Collins, CO where five nephelometers, particle sizing instruments, semi-continuous ion concentration measurements, and seven PAs were deployed. One nephelometer and two PA's sampled air from an RH controlled chamber with RH ≤ 40%. The PA temperatures were accurate, but the PA RH measurements were systematically underreported RH by ∼28% and it is recommended to scale these data by 1.35. The PMS reported size distributions are shown to be invalid. PA instruments mounted without protection from wind exhibited biases of ±160% for wind speeds exceeding 5 mph. Hourly CH1 data were precise, with errors of ∼100% at low concentrations of 30 #/dl and 15% for concentrations ≥1000 #/dl. Normalizing all PMS sensors to each other reduced the errors to 20% and 8% for low and higher particle concentrations respectively. The reported total particle count, i.e. ≥0.3 μm channel (CH1), was biased low, and the bias decreased linearly with mean scattering diameter (MSD). The ratio of measured ≥0.3 μm to PA CH1 channel increases linearly with MSD. The overall normalized mean deviation (NMD) between the two measurements is 121.8%. The CH1 channel also increases as a function of RH primarily due to the growth of hygroscopic aerosols. On average, the relationship between the atmospheric scattering coefficient (bsp) and the PMS ≥0.3 μm CH1 channel is described by the equation bsp = 0.015 × CH1 for MSD levels less than 0.35 μm. The PMS CH1 response decreases linearly with MSD. The NMD between ambient PMS derived bsp and measured ambient bsp is 27.0%. Recommendations are made for PA network deployment."

 Pirimiphos-methyl (PMM) and pirimicarb (PM) are two typical N,N-dialkyl substituted pyrimidine pesticides widely applied in agriculture. They are emitted into the atmosphere via spraying and post-application volatilization, but their heterogeneous degradation kinetics toward OH radicals has not been well characterized. Therefore, the degradation rates of particle-associated PMM and PM with OH radicals were studied under different conditions including particle type, relatively humidity (RH), and temperature. The experimental results indicated that the degradation rates of PMM and PM adsorbed on hydrophilic SiO2 particles were faster than those adsorbed on hydrophobic SiO2 particles, suggesting that heterogeneous kinetics was affected by surface properties of SiO2 particles. The degradation rates of PMM and PM adsorbed on these two kinds of SiO2 particles under experimental conditions ranged from (10.8 ± 0.7) × 10−12 and (6.1 ± 0.8) × 10−12 to (28.0 ± 1.7) × 10−12 and (13.5 ± 1.2) × 10−12 cm3 molecule−1 s−1, respectively. Additionally, these rate constants showed a negative relationship with increasing RH level (20−80%) while a positive relationship with elevating temperature (5−35 °C). Arrhenius expressions for their heterogeneous degradation and the corresponding activation energies were calculated. According to the obtained degradation rates, the atmospheric lifetimes of particle-associated PMM and PM toward OH radicals were in the ranges of 9.9–25.8 and 20.7−46.1 h, respectively, suggesting that OH-initiated heterogeneous degradation might be an important pathway during their atmospheric transformation processes. The experimental kinetic data obtained in this work are in favor of improving the understandings of atmospheric lifetimes of particle-associated PMM and PM, and also highlight that the environmental factors including particle type, RH, and temperature should be seriously taken into account for determining the atmospheric lifetimes of pesticides."

 Aerosols and droplets are the main factors of visibility reduction by scattering and absorbing light. In this study we use the 3-D meteorology fields from the 9-km WRF-ADAS Real-Time Modeling System (WARMS) to drive the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. A visibility forecasting framework is developed by combining extinction due to hydrometeors and aerosols, based on WARMS and CMAQ predictions. We have analyzed the results of a one-month forecasting period during the winter of 2021–2022 to assess the performance of the WARM-CMAQ model and to understand the impact of hydrometeor and aerosol extinction on operational visibility forecasting in Shanghai, the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and part of the North China Plain (NCP). With our newly developed framework, we generally find improved or comparable results in visibility forecasts when compared to recent studies. We find that for the city of Shanghai, aerosol extinction has a minor impact on the model's performance when forecasting visibility below 1 km, but it becomes crucial for predictions spanning 1–10 km. Comparison against observations shows that the framework well captures the general contributions from various chemical constituents with nitrate as the most important factor in aerosol extinction (∼60%). Finally, our assessment of the YRD and part of the NCP highlights that in highly polluted areas aerosols could be significant for visibility below 1 km. This study emphasizes the necessity of integrating both aerosol and hydrometeor extinction in visibility forecasting during haze-fog processes, particularly for regions characterized by diverse pollutant levels and environmental conditions."

 Microplastics (MPs) are widely present in atmosphere without understanding about their influences on human health. Spatial variations of MPs in fine particulate matter (PM2.5), along with source contribution and health effects analyses, were investigated at two distinct background air quality locations in Hong Kong: TMS, a coastal site, and HT, a high-altitude site, both remote from anthropogenic activities. The higher concentration of total MPs concentration (∑MPs) was observed at HT (31.67 ± 10.25 pg/m3) compared to TMS (11.00 ± 4.69 pg/m3). Polyethylene (PE) was the dominant MP in both locations, and other MPs showed inconsistent concentration patterns in the analysis. Source identification analysis indicated that the MPs at HT was predominantly affected by marine sources, whereas the MPs at TMS was potentially due to continental/local sources. The HT was not an ideal location for monitoring atmospheric background concentration of MP due to high contributions from marine source. Cellular exposure to MPs experiments (A549 cells) demonstrated stronger correlations (p < 0.05) between exposure to MPs and oxidative stress (determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malondialdehyde (MDA)) than inflammation factors. The polyvinyl chloride, nylon 6,6 and polystyrene were the chemical compounds that can induce oxidative stress, and interactions among MPs.

 Elevated mercury (Hg) emissions since industrialization have created worldwide elevated levels of Hg in environment, causing ecosystem and human health impacts. Addressing these concerns requires across-nation efforts and international cooperation. In cooperation with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), through its implementation of the Minamata Convention (MC), several international and intranational projects have monitored Hg levels in the atmosphere, water, soil and biota for decades. Obviously, these global monitoring projects require substantial resources, such as government funding, human resources, and analytic instruments. Different types of Hg analyzers have been developed and used in these global monitoring projects, however, most of them require inert carrier gas (i.e. Ar, He) supply, especially if detection requires fluorescence spectroscopy. Frequent consumption and replenishment of carrier gas during normal operation incur substantial financial and human resource costs. Therefore, these instruments cannot operate autonomously for long periods of time and require a carrier gas cylinder exchange, a limitation especially in remote regions and on ocean research cruise campaigns where it is challenging to function autonomously for long duration, limiting data collection in these locations. To address this issue, we developed a novel prototype automated Hg analyzer with a new design using a circulated carrier gas system. This development decreases the carrier gas consumption and increases the Hg analyzer operation duration, saving up to 99% on carrier gas consumption compared to the widely used Tekran 2537 and NIC AM-6F atmospheric Hg analyzers instruments. By using the circulated carrier gas design, our Hg analyzer only consumes 1 L per week. Overall, this improvement not only saves carrier gas but also enhances the instrument's self-operating capability in remote areas and reduces the financial and human resource costs associated with frequent replacement of the carrier gas."

 Air pollution episodes are critical environmental challenges in urban areas, primarily linked to the lack of ventilation during calm and stable atmospheric conditions, rather than a significant increase in emissions. The prevailing circulation pattern under these conditions is the Urban Heat Island Circulation (UHIC), which governs the characteristics of the urban pollution dome and the distribution of pollutants. This study aims to assess the UHIC's influence on spatial and temporal variations in pollutant concentrations and to investigate the efficiency of an Urban Chimney (UC) in improving air quality. Due to the interaction of micro- and meso-scale flows, a multi-scale analysis is required. For this purpose, a pressure-based CFD solver is adapted for analyzing airflow and pollutant dispersion in a multi-scale environment. A coordinate transformation method is used to account for meso-scale effects, and the resulting source terms are applied to the solver. The species transport equation is transformed to the new coordinate system, and the effects of species diffusion on enthalpy transport are included in the governing equations. The results demonstrate that UHIC reduces the average pollutant concentration and causes pollution peaks near ground level and at the city center. The interaction of micro-scale flow within the chimney with meso-scale UHIC impacts the flow field and pollutant concentration across the entire domain, decreasing the urban plume's vertical velocity by 40 percent and the mixing height at the city center by 20 percent. It also increases the vertical velocity within the UC by 23 percent. The UC can serve as a controlling tool for urban ventilation, and its capacity to remove pollutants increases sixfold when interacting with UHIC, reducing pollutant concentration citywide."

 The use of a high-precision a priori zenith wet delay can effectively improve the convergence time and increase the accuracy of precise point positioning (PPP). Considering the limitations of empirical and blind ZWD models, a new lightweight ZWD model was developed based on GNSS observations and ERA5 precipitable water vapor (PWV) and temperature information that can provide reliable ZWD with 0.25° spatial resolution and hourly temporal resolution without relying on massive meteorological parameters. The correlation between the ERA5 PWV/temperature and the GNSS-derived ZWD was first analyzed in 2020 in this study. Subsequently, a functional mapping model based on machine learning was established, considering the effects of spatial and temporal factors, such as time, topography, geographical location. The validation results showed the proposed model's RMSE/STD/Bias were 1.70/1.70/0cm compared with GNSS ZWD, respectively.

 Black carbon (BC) is a harmful pollutant to human health and the environment. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the local contribution of road traffic and residential biomass burning to BC pollution levels at urban scale by implementing an integrated modelling approach with high spatial and temporal resolution. The traffic emission was extended to include BC emission factors considering road network as line emission sources. A new module to calculate emissions from residential biomass burning was developed based on the heating degree days methodology and local surveys. The modelling approach implemented in Coimbra, Portugal, was validated with observations collected during a six-month monitoring campaign at urban traffic and urban background stations using thermo-optical and optical methods. At the traffic station, modelling results showed that 86% of BC concentrations are related to traffic activity, which are mostly due to hot exhaust emissions (76%). Nevertheless, biomass burning has a significant contribution in the whole urban area during winter. The results of monthly average BC concentrations obtained from dispersion modelling revealed a contribution from local road traffic and residential biomass burning emissions of around 4 μg m−3 at both monitoring sites during the coldest period, but this contribution was two times higher for the hotspots identified within the urban area. Moreover, hourly values at hotspots obtained from the modelling may achieve 85 μg m−3, thus stressing the importance of spatial and temporal analysis with high resolution. The validation approach applied in this work highlight the need for more transparency in defining “black carbon” reported by modelling to ensure comparability with measurements obtained by different techniques."

 In order to clarify the concentration levels and sources of the water-insoluble amino acids (WIAA) in aerosols that have been received little attention in previous studies and to discuss their potential impact on nitrogen deposition, the WIAA in the coarse-mode (d = 2.0–10 μm) and fine-mode (d < 2.0 μm) aerosols were measured at a forested site in Japan together with the water-soluble free and combined amino acids. The sum of the WIAA showed more than a 6-times higher concentration than that of the water-soluble amino acids in the coarse-mode range and a similar concentration to that in the fine-mode range, which suggests a significant contribution of the WIAA to the amino acids pool in aerosols. The WIAA were predominantly partitioned into the coarse-mode range. The concentration of the coarse-mode WIAA was the highest in the summer and a strong correlation was found between the coarse-mode WIAA and nss-K+ concentrations. These results suggest that plant debris and the associated materials are important sources for the coarse-mode WIAA and the increase in the suspension of these particulate materials caused the enhancement of the WIAA in the summer. Remarkably higher concentrations of the coarse-mode WIAA than the water-soluble amino acids would be caused by these particulate materials. In the fine-mode range, on the other hand, the concentration of the WIAA was the highest in the spring and strongly correlated with the fine-mode nss-K+ concentrations. The fine-mode WIAA would be mainly derived from the biomass burning particles. The coarse-mode WIAA were estimated to significantly contribute to the dry deposition flux of the total nitrogen. The present study implies a potential impact of the WIAA in the coarse aerosols on nitrogen deposition."

 The atmospheric aqueous-phase chemistry has received increasing attention in the last decades for its non-negligible environmental significance. Yet, the insufficient experimental data on oxidative reaction rate constants (kaq) obstructs the further analysis and modeling of this system. Predictive models based on machine learning (ML) algorithms have shown potential as an effective estimation tool, however, they are restricted to the lack of training data as well. To overcome this data limitation, we developed multi-task (MT) models that could exploit the common knowledge from reactions in gas- and aqueous-phases simultaneously. Toward kaq of organic compounds with hydroxyl radical (OH), nitrate radical (NO3), and ozone (O3), the MT models showed a notably better predictive ability compared to benchmark models, while obtaining wide applicability on compounds from different chemical classes. By interpreting the models using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), we evidenced that the MT models utilized the common knowledge in both phases and correctly identified the reaction mechanisms.

 This study investigates the vertical distribution characteristics of ozone (O3) in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region during spring, utilising observational data from two tall towers in urban and suburban areas of the PRD, i.e., the 600 m high Canton Tower and the 356 m high Shenzhen Meteorology Gradient Tower (SZMGT), between 2018 and 2020. The observations indicate that the peak times of O3 concentrations differ under polluted and clean conditions, with polluted conditions showing 1–3 h later peaks compared with clean conditions. The diurnal variation in the O3 concentration is more pronounced at the SZMGT than at the Canton Tower. The O3 vertical gradients differ between the two towers, with the Canton Tower showing larger daytime gradients and the SZMGT showing larger nighttime gradients under polluted conditions. The vertical O3 distribution patterns are categorised into three types: Polluted, Moderate, and Good levels. The O3 concentration initially rises with altitude and then decreases under polluted conditions. Elevated O3 is observed in the lower planetary boundary layer (PBL), approximately between 110 and 210 m in height, where the concentration is 1.1–1.4 times higher than the surface level. Both the Moderate and Good levels occur under clean conditions, in which the O3 of the Canton Tower increases with altitude, whereas the O3 of the SZMGT first increases and then decreases with altitude. The correlation between O3 and the meteorological conditions (temperature, relative humidity, wind direction, and wind speed) decreases with increasing altitude. The cluster analysis of backward trajectories identifies three main transport paths affecting the O3 levels: northeasterly continental, southerly oceanic, and easterly coastal paths. Combining the observations from O3 lidar in Guangzhou and Shenzhen and two additional cities within the PRD region, Foshan and Zhongshan, the analysis of a typical pollution case indicates that different cities have different local chemical generation and regional transport contributions to O3 pollution. A conceptual model reflecting the horizontal transport paths and vertical structures of O3 pollution in the spring over the PRD is proposed, which enhances our understanding of the O3 vertical distribution in different cities and contributes to the analysis of the O3 pollution mechanism in the PRD agglomeration."

 The concentrations and behavior of nano particles (10–1000 nm) in Delhi, a densely populated megacity, in different seasons (winter, spring, summer, monsoon, and autumn) are examined, for the first time. The concentration of particles is classified into four different sizes as Nnuc (10–30 nm, nucleation), Nsatk (30–50 nm, small Aitken), Nlatk (50–100 nm, large Aitken), and Nacc (100–1000 nm, accumulation mode), and the total (10–1000 nm) particle number concentration (PNC) as Ntotal. PNC ranges between 104 cm−3 and 106 cm−3 over Delhi during the year, and the highest concentration occurs in winter. Winter concentration is 2, 1.6 and 1.3 times higher than monsoon, summer, autumn and spring concentrations, respectively. Nnuc, Nsatk, Nlatk and Nacc and their respective contributions to total PNC exhibit significant seasonal variations. During winter Nlatk and Nacc contribute more to total due to coagulation, with Nacc alone contributing >40% to total PNC. Nnuc, Nsatk, and Nlatk are higher in spring and summer during mid-day due to nucleation and/or ultrafine particle burst events. The direct primary emissions from engine exhaust produce a prominent double hump structure during morning and evening peak hours in winter and autumn. PNC and their contributions exhibit day-night variations as they are influenced by variations in emission sources and meteorological parameters (wind speed, relative humidity, temperature, solar radiation and boundary layer height) between day and night. Carbon monoxide correlates positively with Nacc in all seasons (R2 ≥ 0.5) as fossil fuel emission is a predominant source for gases and particles in the study environment. These quantitative results on seasonal variations of nano particles and air pollutants together with the knowledge on seasonal variations in meteorological parameters and atmospheric dynamics provide a foundation which can positively contribute better to the urban planning and devising mitigation measures aimed at improving air quality and public health."

 Understanding the effects of mixed anthropogenic pollutants on the photooxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is essential for unraveling the formation pathways of secondary organic aerosols (SOA). Yet, it remains a highly challenging experimental target owing to the complexities in the precise measurement of molecular compositions of products and number/mass concentrations of particles as a function of pollutant concentration in the ambient atmosphere. Here, a series of well-defined chamber experiments were performed to explore the effects of NOx and NH3 on the SOA formation from photooxidation of the most abundant monoterpene, α-pinene. The results indicate that the suppression effect of NO and NO2 on the α-pinene photooxidation shows monotonous and parabolic trends, respectively. The presence of NH3 enhances particle number concentrations during the α-pinene + NOx photooxidation by participating in reactions with organic acids. New compounds, including organic peroxides, esters, organic nitrates, and peroxyacyl nitrates, are observed at molecular weight (MW) = 166, 173, 217, 231, 280, 282, 304, and 410 through threshold photoionization making use of a recently constructed vacuum ultraviolet free electron laser in positive ion mode.

 Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) play a crucial role in ground-level ozone formation, yet emission quantification faces considerable uncertainties stemming from input data. Land cover data, which determines the distribution of growth forms, is an essential driving input of BVOC emissions. This study explores the uncertainty in BVOC emission estimates arising from using two land cover datasets, specifically the MODIS and ESA land cover data, and the implications for ozone mitigation strategies in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region. By employing the MEGAN model for the year 2021, we estimated that ESA land cover data, with a finer 10 m resolution, yields a total BVOC emission estimate of 2299 Gg, which is over 52.9% higher than the MODIS dataset with a resolution of 500 m, attributed to the higher tree coverage (33.9% in ESA vs. 17.6% in MODIS) identified in the ESA dataset. We then simulated the ozone concentrations by both emission estimates with the WRF-CMAQ model. The elevated BVOC emissions based on the ESA data improved the underestimation of simulated isoprene concentrations and consequently resulted in more than 30% higher domain-averaged MDA8 ozone concentration compared to the MODIS-derived BVOC emission. Regarding ozone mitigation strategy, simulation with the ESA-based BVOC emissions results in 0.3–1.2 μg/m3 less ozone reductions compared to that with the MODIS-based emissions when reducing anthropogenic VOC emissions, but 0.7–2.9 μg/m3 higher ozone reductions when controlling anthropogenic NOx emissions. These disparities are more pronounced at the city level, highlighting the importance of accurate BVOC emission estimates for effective ozone control strategies."

 Air quality, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region (APAC), significantly impacts human health and mortality. This study aims to quantify and compare the effects of ambient particulate matter (APM) and household air pollution (HAP) from solid fuels on unhealthy years and life-years lost in APAC from 1990 to 2019. It also examines factors influencing unhealthy years among females due to HAP. Our findings show that females were more vulnerable to HAP, whereas males were at a higher mortality risk from APM. Pacific islands encountered the greatest burden from HAP, while West Asia was most affected by APM. Over the studied period, the impact of APM on unhealthy years and life-years lost increased, primarily affecting the elderly and adults more than children and youth. Conversely, health impacts from HAP declined across all age groups in the Pacific Islands, though less so compared to other subregions. Key predictors of female unhealthy years from HAP included pollution, demographics, and women's empowerment, with no significant economic influences.

 During the Lunar New Year of 2020, the Chinese government implemented a strict nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of the COVID-19, which may have led to changes in the distribution of pollutants. To enhance our understanding of the three-dimensional evolution of pollutants under special control scenarios, this study used vehicle lidar to obtain vertical profiles of aerosols and ozone (O3) in Wuhan during the pandemic. Combined with ground observations and WRF-Chem model simulation results, we explored the evolution characteristics of pollutants. The results showed that the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration near the ground in Wuhan City was significantly reduced (40%) during the emission control period. The aerosol concentration decreased rapidly with an increase in height, and the maximum loading height was consistent with the atmospheric boundary layer height. Conversely, due to factors such as the reduction of the precursor nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and rising temperatures, the near-ground O3 concentration increased by 59%. Despite the significant reduction in emission sources, lidar observations still captured distinct aerosol transport layers on March 7 and March 10, 2020. These transport layers gradually descended, affecting the ground-level aerosol concentration. Additionally, one typical process of O3 external transport was observed in the vertical direction. Our study provides a theoretical basis for a deeper understanding of the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of pollutants during special control scenarios, aiding policymakers in formulating effective air pollution control strategies."

 Accurately predicting air quality levels in urban landscapes is a key environmental and public health challenge due to the complex interactions between pollutant emissions, atmospheric chemistry, and meteorological conditions. Chemical transport models such as Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) and Weather Research and Forecasting Modeling with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) provide fundamental insights into the behavior of atmospheric pollutants but face limitations in spatial resolution and prediction accuracy. Machine learning combined with low-cost sensors can improve prediction accuracy compared to numerical models, but uneven sensor distribution may result in biased prediction results. To address these limitations, this study introduces an innovative framework that leverages a quadtree space division to refine the numerical simulations of air pollutants into higher spatial resolutions by dynamically adjusting grid sizes based on the distribution of increased sensor deployments. Using a variable-resolution grid, the study first aggregates variables into a grid and then calculates spatial dependence based on grid cells. The deep-learning-based Time Series Transformer model is then used to perform detailed temporal predictions of PM2.5 concentration across the entire grid. The spatial and temporal modeling framework is designed to use the past 48 h' aggregated data, including meteorological variables from WRF-Chem numerical simulation and PM2.5 concentrations from ground monitoring stations and sensors, to predict future 48-h’ PM2.5 concentrations and tested across entire grids within Los Angeles County from January to June 2020. The results show that the performance of variable resolution grids is better than that of fixed grids regarding four metrics: minimum resolution, overall spatiotemporal RMSE, average bias, and prediction coverage. Among them, the variable resolution grids with up to 4 sensors showed the best performance, with an overall spatiotemporal RMSE of 1.12 μg/m3, which was about 40% lower than 2-sensor and 8-sensor variable resolution grids, a significant reduction of 55% compared to a 3 km fixed grid configuration. Future work will involve additional relevant factors such as emission sources and sinks to improve prediction accuracy."

 Macao, a renowned tourist city in the Great Bay Area (GBA), faces the challenge of continuously improving its air quality. In this study, we developed a high-resolution anthropogenic emission inventory for air pollutants in Macao in 2017, tailored for regional-scale numerical modeling. This inventory was created by integrating the best available data including emission factors, statistical data, and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The result shows that the emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOX), sulfur dioxide (SO2), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters smaller than 2.5 and 10 μm (PM2.5 and PM10, respectively), and ammonia (NH3) in Macao were estimated to be 4348.23, 10525.64, 2099.34, 4895.15, 586.00, 1063.72, and 263.85 10^3 kg, respectively, in 2017. On-road mobile sources were the largest contributors to CO emissions, accounting for 61% of the total emissions. NOX emissions mainly originated from ship (47%). Power plant contributed the largest SO2 emissions (70%). Solvent use accounted for the most VOCs emissions (69%). Dust source was the major emission source of PM2.5 and PM10, contributing 29% and 53% of total emissions, respectively. Sewage treatment was the primary emitter of NH3, accounting for 88% of the total emissions. These emissions were then spatially allocated to grid cells with a resolution of 500m × 500m. Ship emissions were concentrated in the Macao-Hong Kong and Macao-Shenzhen shipping channels. Local emissions were concentrated in densely populated areas, including the Macao peninsula and Taipa. Air pollutants were lower in February and the fourth quarter, due to business suspensions during Spring Festival in February and emission reductions from power plant in the fourth quarter. Macao had the highest emission intensity per km2 among GBA cities, potentially causing high exposure concentrations and human health risks. The simulation results from WRF-CMAQ indicate that local emissions have a substantial impact Macao 's air quality. This study provides crucial information on air pollutant emission characteristics in Macao, as well as data support for regional air quality modeling and local pollution emission reduction efforts."

 Snowfall is a critical component of the Earth system and an important indicator and amplifier of climate change. Climate warming is reducing the seasonal snowpack globally, which could have catastrophic consequences for the regions in high dependence on snow for water recharge. However, the climate influences on extreme snowfall events, which significantly impact humans, are still poorly understood. This study uses the Tibetan Plateau snowpack observation dataset combined with NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP-CMIP6) climate data to investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of snowfall, and to explore its response mechanism to climate change and future change trends across the Lower Yarlung Zangbo River (LYZR) in Southeastern Tibetan Plateau (SETP). Annual snowfall decreased at a rate of 1.05 mm per decade (P < 0.05) during the historical period (1960–2014). Relative to 1960–2014, annual snowfall would decline of ∼38 % and ∼ 73 % by the end of the 21st century under the SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios, respectively. At the same time, a general decrease in extreme snowfall averaged the LYZR is expected for historical and future periods, but it showed notable spatial variations. The regional increase in extreme snowfall is mainly distributed along the valley of Brahmaputra-Yarlung Zangbo. In addition, precipitation accounted for 66.5 % of the snowfall variations during the historical period. Meanwhile, according to future warming, temperature would dominate snowfall variations, contributing 56.66 % to 72.92 % during 2015–2100. The projected response of mean and extreme snowfall to climate change indicates that it is a double-edged sword. To scientifically address the risks and challenges posed by snowfall changes in alpine regions, it is imperative to limit future climate warming."

 While air pollution due to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been effectively controlled in China; the photochemical pollution characterized by elevated ozone (O3) has emerged as a major concern for air quality improvement. Except for ozone, Lhasa is one of the cleanest cities in China with the lowest annual PM2.5 concentration in 2017. The levels of major air pollutants in Lhasa are much lower than those of other cities in the eastern region of China, especially in May, when the O3 concentration peaks. This study was based on multi-source observations in combination with the Goddard Earth Observing System coupled with chemistry (GEOS-Chem) and the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) models to explore the causes of O3 pollution in Lhasa in May 2023. The results indicated that during the high O3 episodes, the concentrations of O3 precursors were low in Lhasa. Surrounding cities in other parts of the Tibetan Plateau also experienced high ozone concentrations despite being in different airsheds, suggesting that the O3 pollution in Lhasa was caused by regional transport rather than purely local emissions. Stratospheric intrusion events modulated by the westerly jet led to elevated ozone in the troposphere above Lhasa City. The results of the GEOS-Chem model indicated that horizontal advection, turbulence, diffusion, and other effects led to high concentrations of ozone in the near-surface above Lhasa. Vertical transport was the dominant factor leading to ozone concentration increases during high ozone days, with a contribution of 6.33 Gg/day. In addition, high-altitude air masses with a maximum altitude of over 8000 m, were observed arriving in Lhasa during the high ozone days. This study revealed that stratospheric intrusions have a greater contribution to the high O3 concentration in Lhasa in spring and provided a scientific basis for mitigating O3 pollution in the plateau cities."

 In this study, we report significant biennial variability or oscillation (BO) in the boreal spring (March–May) Surface Air Temperature (SAT) over India and unravelled the causative mechanisms. The positive phase of the BO exhibit significant seasonal warming over India, whereas seasonal cooling is observed during the negative phase of BO. Heat wave days are more during the positive phase of BO compared to negative or neutral phase. The positive (negative) phase of BO is generally coherent with the central (eastern) Pacific warming (cooling) years. The anomalous low-level divergence associated with low-level anticyclonic circulation induces less cloudiness and intense surface solar radiation ovr India during the positive phase, favouring surface warming. The evolution of some positive and/or negative phases of BO without any large scale forcing from the equatorial Pacific suggested the possibility of alternate pathways. The strong anomalous upper-level (at 200 hPa) anticyclonic circulation provoked by mid-latitude Rossby waves is found contributing to the positive phase, thereby highlighting the role of dominant mid-latitude pathways in the biennial SAT variability in addition to El Niño forcing. The sinking motion associated with persistent high, and the associated adiabatic compression also supported surface heating during the positive phase of BO. On the other hand, the mid-latitude Rossby wave induced upper-level cyclonic circulation is found contributing to the negative phase.

 Utilizing the reanalysis data and model simulations, we explore the interannual variations of extreme high temperatures over the Indochina Peninsula during 1960–2022, as well as their responses to critical oceanic systems and corresponding mechanisms. Given the intricate interactions among oceanic regions, this study employs the Generalized Equilibrium Feedback Analysis method to extract the atmospheric responses to key ocean systems, including the tropical Indian Ocean (TIO), El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and tropical Atlantic. Results highlight the significant contributions of TIO and ENSO. It is suggested that the anomalous anticyclonic circulation located over the Indochina Peninsula, as a response to the warm TIO and ENSO, favors the local anomalous downward motions, resulting in reduced cloud cover, diminished precipitation, increased net radiative energy to the surface and increased sensible and latent heat flux from the surface to the atmosphere, and finally inducing an increase in extreme high temperatures. These observed patterns are also well simulated by the Community Earth System Model tropical Indian Ocean and tropical Pacific Ocean pacemaker experiments, indicating that the warmer tropical Indian Ocean and ENSO could induce anomalous anticyclonic (cyclonic) patterns at the lower (upper) troposphere over the South China Sea, thereby promoting the subsidence and occurrence of extreme high temperatures over the Indochina Peninsula."

 In this study, spatial and temporal variations of spring compound dry and hot events (CDHEs) over northern Asia (NA) during 1950–2020 and the related possible mechanisms are investigated on the interannual timescale. The standardized compound event indicator (SCEI) is used to represent compound dry and hot conditions over NA, which is validated by the observed summer case of CDHEs over western Russia in 2010. The first empirical orthogonal function (EOF1) mode of the SCEI over NA presents a monopole pattern, while the EOF2 mode shows an east-west dipole pattern. Possible mechanism analysis indicates that the CDHEs tend to be modulated by local high-pressure anomalies, accompanied by reduced cloud cover and more solar radiation. The high-pressure anomalies can lead to warm temperature and water vapor divergence, which synergistically contributes to the occurrence of CDHEs. Further analysis shows that the EOF1 mode is jointly affected by the Scandinavian (SCAND) pattern and the Arctic Oscillation (AO); while the EOF2 mode is influenced by the Atlantic-Eurasian (AEA) teleconnection. Moreover, the North Atlantic tripolar pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) can influence the EOF1 mode through changing the AO. And the diagonal tripolar SST pattern over the North Atlantic affects the EOF2 mode via altering the AEA pattern. The influence of the SST patterns is further confirmed by numerical experiments using the Community Atmospheric Model version CAM-5.3."

 Dust storms are associated with large amounts of particulate matter (PM) that can have adverse effects on health and the environment. The contribution of natural dust to atmospheric PM levels represents a scientific challenge, especially in areas with close proximity to dust sources. To improve our knowledge in this area, we collected 300 PM filter-samples across five oasis cities on the southern edge of the Taklimakan Desert in 2016, and applied the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) data to quantify the contribution of natural dust to PM on sand dust and non-sand dust days. Research has shown that the particle size distribution of mineral dust in Taklimakan dust aerosols was relatively uniform. On sand dust days, CaSO4 and Na2SO4 were directly emitted from the surface, leading to higher sulfate concentrations in PM. While the increase in the proportions of organic carbon - OC1 and OC2 was attributed to the mixed anthropogenic emissions. On non-sand dust days, SO42− concentration was significantly affected by emissions from anthropogenic sources. The automotive composite emissions and coal combustion were the main sources of elemental carbon - EC1. Based on the results of MERRA-2 reanalysis data, natural dust constituted 53 % and 70 % of the total PM2.5 and PM10, respectively. In this study, we have quantified the contribution of natural dust under different weather conditions and identifying potential sources of PM in oasis cities.

 Significant vegetation increase in the Loess Plateau (LP) of China could strongly affect the surface water budget. Through the WRF model with the Water Vapor Tracer (WVT) method tracking moisture within the LP, this study conducted three sets of experiments from 1999 to 2018 with GLASS Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) data. The results indicate that vegetation has a critical role in partitioning evapotranspiration (ET) into transpiration (Et), canopy evaporation (Ecan), and soil evaporation (Edir), thus regulating terrestrial internal convective precipitation (P). The local P response largely depends on external P (E_P), while the internal P (I_P) contribution remains minor. In summer, the total wet difference of I_P in the LP is about 0.03 mm/day, almost 5 times that of E_P. Greening also causes surface runoff reduction. Thus, in spring and summer, surface water storage (W) decreases due to the greater increase in ET than in P. In autumn, W increases by about 0.06 mm/day due to a large decrease in Ecan, implying confining the increased W to shallower soils, resulting in accelerated loss of deep soil moisture. The greening trend of 2000–2018 contributed to an increase in I_P, which could not offset increased ET and reduced E_P, leading to terrestrial water storage reduction."

 In this study, we investigate the atmospheric circulation anomalies related to the PM2.5 mass concentration rapid decline cases in Beijing during winter when the PM2.5 concentration is the highest. From 2014 to 2021, 66 PM2.5 concentration rapid decline days (RDDs) are identified by considering the 90 % thresholds of the difference of PM2.5 mass concentration between two adjacent days. The composite evolution of PM2.5 concentration for the rapid decline cases features a slow increase on the accumulation phase but a rapid decline on RDDs with the average daily PM2.5 concentration decreases by 69.1 %. The composite evolution of atmospheric circulation anomalies in the lower troposphere related to these PM2.5 concentration rapid decline cases exhibits the eastward shift of cyclonic/anticyclonic geopotential height anomalies from the Mongolian Plateau/Northeast Asia to the Japan Sea/western Pacific, coinciding with a southerly-to-northerly reverse of wind anomalies in Beijing. The anomalous northerly on RDDs enhances the wind speed and therefore corresponds to the rapid decline of PM2.5 concentration. Further analysis suggests that the above process is responsible for 72.7 % of RDDs, and other about one-third of RDDs display anomalous southerly in Beijing, which also result in comparable PM2.5 reduction amplitude to that resulted from the northerly RDDs. The rapid decline of PM2.5 concentration for the Southerly RDDs cases is related to the near-surface southeasterly, which extends from 125°E to the west of Beijing, bringing the clean air masses from the Bohai Sea to the Beijing region."

 The climatic disparities between urban cores and surrounding rural areas have become increasingly pronounced due to rapid urbanization. The vapor pressure deficit (VPD) serves as a critical meteorological indicator reflecting atmospheric aridity, and identifying the contributions of urban and rural climate factors on the urban-rural VPD disparities plays an important role in understanding urban climate and ecosystem development patterns. This study introduces a quantitative method, utilizing partial differential equations, to assess the relative contributions of two crucial meteorological factors—air temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH)—toward urban-rural differences in VPD. Analyzing daily scale data from 116 pairs of urban and rural stations across mainland China for the period 2000–2017, we derived several key findings: Urban areas generally exhibit higher VPD than surrounding rural areas, with a relative difference in annual VPD of about 21.6 %, and the disparity increases over time. Furthermore, the influence of urbanization on VPD responds differently across seasons and geographical conditions. The simulated trends in VPD urban-rural differences using the partial differential method align closely with the actual observed trends, validating the effectiveness of our quantitative analysis approach. The VPD urban-rural disparity shows greater sensitivity to shifts in RH, with sensitivity coefficients exceeding 1.5 times to changes in T in most cases. RH is the primary factor causing VPD urban-rural differences in mainland China, and the relative contribution of RH is about 2.5 times of T. The patterns of sensitivity and the contribution of factors exhibit notable variation among subregions. This study enhances the understanding of how urbanization affects regional climate and provides insights for assessing the environmental impacts of future urban expansion."

 The potential climate-warming impact from aircraft contrails may be similar in magnitude to the direct effect from carbon dioxide emissions across all aviation. The warming impact may be mitigated through pre-tactical flight trajectory optimization to avoid ice supersaturation regions (ISSRs) while also considering aircraft performance and CO2 emissions. The ability to perform such deviations depends on accurate predictions of water vapor in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). Herein we evaluated the performance of two leading global numerical weather prediction (NWP) models: the Global Forecast System (GFS) developed in the USA and the Integrated Forecast System, (IFS) developed in Europe, and a research mesoscale model, Weather Research and Forecasting configured by SATAVIA (S-WRF) to predict UTLS moisture and ISSR. We compared humidity forecasts to observations from 383 aircraft flights and 3480 radiosonde profiles comprising approximately 1.5 million measurements over Europe and the Middle East for 10 months in 2022. Neither GFS nor IFS properly reproduced the observed distribution of relative humidity with respect to ice (RHice). Moreover, in addition to not being usable for prospective flight planning, the ERA5 reanalysis only slightly improved the outcome of the IFS. Only the S-WRF model with multi-moment cloud physics and high spatial resolution (5 km grid spacing) closely reproduced the observed relative frequency distribution of RHice. Furthermore, ISSR validation using near equal-area neighborhoods when computing Matthews Correlation Coefficient and F1 score showed that S-WRF scored higher (F1 = 0.66) than the IFS (F1 = 0.62), while the GFS had near zero score due to its near complete lack of predictions of RHice greater than 100 % in stark contrast to observations. In fact, S-WRF also correctly predicts 92 % of the time when conditions were not conducive to contrail formation. Ultimately, the S-WRF model could be used to alter flight plans to deviate above or below nearly certain contrail formation regions to reduce non-CO2 climate impacts of aviation."

 This study explores the uncertainty of future summer warming over Iberia using storylines constructed from climate model simulations of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6. Unlike prior storyline approaches focusing on remote drivers and global teleconnections of atmospheric circulation, we use regional factors that directly influence summer temperatures: ridging activity, soil moisture and Mediterranean sea surface temperature. These drivers explain a substantial portion of the observed variability across climate models, with ridging activity and soil moisture showing the strongest influence on Iberian warming. Under a high radiative forcing scenario (SSP5–8.5), the storylines of Iberian warming based on these two drivers range between 7 and 9 °C for the end of the 21st century. The storyline leading to the largest warming is characterised by a drying out of the soil conditions and an increase in the anticyclonic activity over Iberia. We find similar conclusions for simple extreme heat indicators, though the approach struggles with more complex heatwave metrics. We also propose a novel modification of the storyline approach to increase the data sample of climate responses by using different time intervals throughout the 21st century. This modification would allow the application of more complex statistical models, the exploration of non-linear relationships and the identification of other drivers shaping the regional climate projections."

 The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) is recognized as the world's largest and highest plateau, characterized by intricate topography and underlying surfaces. Within this region, volatile meteorological conditions and severe synoptic systems, including thunderstorms, turbulence, sandstorms, and notably low-level wind shear (LLWS), present safety hazards to aviation operations. Therefore, a comprehensive examination of wind shear at typical QTP airports is essential. Xining Caojiapu International Airport (ZLXN) serves as a crucial transportation hub in the northeastern QTP. The frequent incidence of LLWS events due to the airport's unique geographical and meteorological features makes it an ideal location for investigating LLWS on the plateau. This study analyzed 80 pilot reports collected from 2016 to 2021 to elucidate the spatial and temporal characteristics of LLWS events at this plateau-valley airport. Subsequently, reanalysis data and observations from ground automated weather observing systems (AWOS), a geostationary satellite, a Doppler weather radar (DWR), and a Doppler wind lidar (DWL) were comprehensively employed to investigate the underlying meteorological factors and weather patterns associated with these LLWS events. The findings revealed that LLWS events at ZLXN are predominantly triggered by convective systems, followed by cold fronts and downward momentum transportation, with a smaller proportion being induced by orographic winds and turbulence. Analysis of four representative LLWS events utilizing high-resolution DWL measurements provided insights into the types of LLWS generated and their potential impacts on aircraft operations.

The radius of maximum Kψs was contracted rapidly before rapid intensification (RI) and moved inward slowly, then barely moved, and moved inward slowly again during RI.The conversion from kinetic energy of asymmetric rotational flow (Kψa) to Kψs was induced by advection of asymmetric rotational tangential wind by asymmetric divergent radial wind. The conversion and convergence of inward flux of Kψs led to the rapid contraction before RI.

 This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of the seasonal characteristics of raindrop size distribution (DSD) in Metro Manila, Philippines, using two years of measurements (2018–2020) from the PARSIVEL2 disdrometer. Seasonal properties of DSD for both stratiform and convective rain types were examined during the Southwest Monsoon (SWM; June–September), Northeast Monsoon (NEM; October–February), and pre-SWM or Transition period (March–May). Key findings reveal the dominance of small raindrops (<1 mm) during the NEM period, while mid-sized (1–3 mm) to large raindrops (>3 mm) are more prevalent during the SWM and Transition periods. The study highlights notable seasonal differences in DSD at moderate rain rates (5–10 mm hr−1), indicating variations in microphysical processes between stratiform and convective rain. Furthermore, the microphysical properties of convective rain in Metro Manila are found to be influenced by both oceanic and continental convective processes based on their mass-weighted mean diameter and generalized intercept parameter for all the monsoon periods. The DSD-derived dual-polarimetric radar variables are also shown to vary with the monsoon periods. Rainfall estimates using the DSD-derived dual-polarimetric relations statistically outperformed the empirical rainfall retrieval equation currently used by operational weather radars in the Philippines. Additionally, the Gamma shape parameter found in this study aligns with existing rainfall retrieval algorithm assumptions in space-borne radars. This similarity, along with the derived microphysical relations, could provide potential improvements in rainfall retrievals of ground-based and space-borne radars in tropical coastal environments like Metro Manila."

 To analyze the physicochemical mechanisms affecting the variation in fine suspended particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in Taichung City, the largest city in central Taiwan (the second largest city in Taiwan), during a high-pollution event from November 3 to 6, 2021, we applied the sulfur tracking method (STM) and integrated source apportionment method (ISAM) of the WRF/CMAQ model to simulate the impacts of various emission sources. The sources of pollution in Taichung City are very similar, which shows that the impacts of point, line, and area sources should not be neglected in addition to the boundary conditions. SO42− is mainly generated from point emissions and the production of H2O2, Fe, Mn, and O3. NO3− is also mainly generated from point sources in Taichung City, with HNO3 being the main source at noon and ANO3 at other times of the day. NH4+ is mainly generated from area sources in Taichung City. OM is more complex, mainly originating from line sources in Taichung City and other sources, such as point/area emissions in Taichung City and other emissions from Changhua County. The most important mechanism is low-volatility/semivolatile oxidized combustion of OC at noon, followed by low-volatility/semivolatile POA, which is produced in the morning or evening. EC mainly originates from line sources in Taichung City and Changhua County. In other nearby counties, EC is dominated by local emission sources. In addition, when the concentration of PM2.5 is high, the Neutralization Ratio (NR) is high and PM2.5 is relatively neutral or slightly alkaline. On the contrary, when the concentration of PM2.5 is low, the NR is lower than 1 and the aerosol is acidic. Besides, this study used positive matrix factorization (PMF), which indicates that the PM2.5 at the UAPRS originated from eight kinds of pollution, namely, windblown dust, oil cracking, iron and steel industry, sea salt, transport, Cl− containing exhaust, biomass burning, fossil combustion containing abundant SO42− and the heavy oil refining and coal combustion industry. The direction of the source of pollution can be traced by a conditional bivariate probability function (CBPF). Overall, fossil fuel combustion, mainly involving sulfate, is the largest source of pollution, with the heavy oil refining and coal combustion industry contributing less, and the remaining factors contribute relatively evenly."

 To improve forecast skill of extreme weather events, it is of primary importance to construct accurate initial conditions for a convective-scale ensemble prediction system (EPS). The traditional initial perturbation schemes, e.g., dynamic downscaling, fail to capture the amplitude or structure of convective-scale forecast errors accurately, especially near steep terrain or meso- and small-scale systems during weather system's rapid change. In this study, we developed a new initial perturbation optimizing technique, namely the cosine analysis constraint method. This method is then used to improve the downscaled initial perturbations by introducing smaller-scale information from the analysis increments, generated from data assimilation. We demonstrate the feasibility of the cosine analysis constraint method in the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) convective-scale EPS. Using the control experiment (CTRL) without any modification to the initial perturbation scheme as a reference, we designed the cosine analysis constraint experiment (CONS) and compared it with CTRL. We selected a case study of convective precipitation and two groups of one-month experiments were initialized to verify the feasibility of the new method and exclude case dependence. The results of the one-month test show that adopting the cosine analysis constraint method to optimize the initial perturbations can effectively enhance the consistency between the ensemble mean and the corresponding reanalysis field (regarded as observations). In the case study, the larger horizontal distribution of precipitation spread in CONS indicated the location of convective precipitation more effectively, which is important for operational weather forecasting. The significant effect of the moisture process was confirmed, especially in CONS. The verification results of the entire study domain were significantly improved after the initial perturbations were rescaled. Overall, the forecast skill of meteorological fields at different pressure levels and the extreme precipitation of smaller-scale convective systems were enhanced, which illustrated the potential of the cosine analysis constraint method to improve the quality of initial perturbations in CMA convective-scale EPS."

 Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) is a crucial parameter in climate research. However, obtaining high precision PWV data remains a problem. Discrepancies in water vapor elevation data from diverse observation sources pose challenges, emphasizing the need for precise vertical correction. In this paper, we proposed the precipitable water vapor model with systematic difference correction by using ERA5 (the fifth generation of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis) data and GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) data. In this proposed method, two vertical correction models, employing cubic polynomial and exponential functions, were developed. The exponential function demonstrated superior overall performance with the RMS error of 0.96 mm, effectively capturing vertical characteristics across diverse regions, while the cubic polynomial function had the RMS (Root Mean Square) error of 2.77 mm validated by ERA5 PWV. The cubic polynomial function was found more suitable for low-elevation regions, while the exponential function excelled in high-elevation regions. Validated by radiosonde PWV, the cubic polynomial function and the exponential function show a strong correlation with latitude. Both functions exhibit smaller RMS values at higher latitudes and larger RMS values at lower latitudes. Validated by GNSS PWV, the cubic polynomial function exhibits superior accuracy, with the RMS of 2.39 mm, compared to the exponential function, particularly in specific regions. Analyzing six years of data reveals significant systematic differences between ERA5 and GNSS PWV. This discrepancy exhibits a noticeable annual periodic variation. The global GNSS stations were organized into grids, with stations within the same region grouped together for correction. Models considering systematic differences exhibited substantial RMS reductions and better accuracy. These findings can provide reference in atmospheric correction and the study of extreme weather events."

 The Yangtze River basin experienced extreme flooding during the summer of 2020, leading to widespread impact and significant economic losses. However, there is a lack of specific and quantitative anthropogenic attribution analysis. Here, we used the VIC model and the Risk Ratio framework to isolate the contributions of two anthropogenic (ANT) forcings, aka greenhouse gas (GHG) and aerosol (AER), to this event and the associated potential risk. We also assessed future risk by employing projections from four simulations under the SSP2–4.5 scenario in 2041–2100. Our findings reveal that ANT forcing reduces the probability by 74 %, while GHG forcing increase it by 6 %, and AER forcing decreases it by 92 % at the downstream Datong station. At the middle-stream Cuntan station, ANT forcing decreases the probability of extreme floodings similar to the 2020 event by 87 %, while GHG forcing decreases it by 82 %, and AER forcing decreases it by 95 %. In the future period under the SSP2–4.5 scenario, ANT forcing reduces the probability of extreme flood events like 2020 by 78 % and 82 % at the Cuntan and Datong stations, respectively. And The GHG and AER forcings contribute positively and negatively to the probability of flooding in the Yangtze River Basin, respectively, mainly through influencing the probability of extreme precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. Our study provides valuable insights for policymakers to comprehend the anthropogenic influence on extreme flooding and to guide effective risk management strategies.Plain language summaryThe Yangtze River basin experienced severe flooding in the summer of 2020, but there is no specific and quantitative anthropogenic attribution analysis yet. Therefore, we performed an attribution analysis using the hydrological model and global climate models to isolate the anthropogenic (ANT) contribution for the 1961–2020 and 2041–2100 periods. We find that ANT forcing decreases the risk of extreme flooding, similar to the 2020 event, at the middle-stream Cuntan station and the downstream Datong station. In the future, ANT forcing significantly reduces the probability of potential extreme flood events in both stations. Additionally, we discovered that the net effect of ANT forcing on extreme flood events is determined by the counterbalance of anthropogenic greenhouse gas and aerosol forcings. Our study aims to help policymakers gain a better understanding of the human impact on extreme flooding and develop effective risk management strategies."

 Variations in rainfall patterns in the Northeast region of Brazil (NEB) are high and multiscalar, increasing susceptibility to extreme drought and/or flood events. The objective of this study was to characterize rainfall patterns and monthly dry-wet periods using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) from 1990 to 2019 in the South Coast of NEB, utilizing geostatistical interpolation methods. The study was based on a climatological dataset from the coastal region of the state of Bahia, collected from 112 weather stations.

 The north edge of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) is defined by using the isoline with average total column water vapor (TCWV) equal to 25 mm, and the relationship between the north edge of the EASM and summer extreme precipitation in North China (NC) from 1961 to 2020 is discussed. Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) method is used to cluster extreme precipitation in the abnormal years of the north edge in NC, and the circulation characteristics of different types of extreme precipitation are discussed. The results show that the north edge of the EASM is closely related to extreme precipitation in NC. When the north edge is northerly, both the frequency and total amount of extreme precipitation increase significantly in the monsoon marginal zone. Based on different monsoon circulation background, summer extreme precipitation events in NC are divided into four categories, namely, the central type and southern type in the northerly years of north edge, and the central type and eastern type in the southerly years of north edge. The occurrence of different types of extreme precipitation is closely related to the different characteristics of local trough, the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH), and wave trains in the middle and high latitudes. Specifically, the central type extreme precipitation is affected by the mid-latitude wave train in the northerly years of north edge. As for the central type extreme precipitation in the southerly years of north edge, both high-latitude and mid-latitude wave trains transfer from west to east and converge over NC. However, the wave disturbance energy is relatively weak, leading to the extreme precipitation with weak intensity."

 Based on the CLoud, Albedo and RAdiation dataset, AVHRR-based, version 2 (CLARA-A2), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission 3B43 (TRMM-3B43), and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) reanalysis data, the potential cloud precipitation capacity (PCPA) of typical regions in China is compared, and the relationship between impact factors and PCPA is discussed. Results have suggested that the Tarim Basin (TB) has scarce cloud water resources, while cloud water path (CWP) values are higher in South China (SC) and Sichuan Basin (SB) under the influence of the East Asian monsoon. Moreover, different typical regions of China exhibit varying dependencies on the ice water path (IWP) and liquid water path (LWP). There is a strong correlation between the IWP and precipitation in the Tibet Plateau (TP), Northeast China (NE), SC, and SB. The precipitation in TB demonstrates a more pronounced correlation with the LWP. Through a comparison of the correlation between PCPA and influencing factors in different typical regions of China, it is found that convective available potential energy (CAPE), surface latent heat flux (SLHF), surface sensible heat flux (SSHF), and 0–3 km relative humidity (RH) exhibit stronger correlation with PCPA than 2 m temperature (T2m) and 2–5 km vertical wind shear (SHEAR). Further investigation revealed that the joint effect of CAPE, RH, and SLHF has a pronounced effect on PCPA, particularly during spring and autumn. Additionally, the PCPA of TP exhibits significant dependency on the joint effect of these three influential factors. Furthermore, the ratio of LWP to IWP (RLI) also affects PCPA. In spring and autumn, the PCPA of TB and NC exhibits a positive correlation with RLI, whereas the PCPA of TP, SC, NE, and SB shows a negative correlation with RLI. In summer, the PCPA of TB and SC exhibits a notably negative correlation with RLI. This study deepens the understanding of the formation mechanism of cloud precipitation in typical regions of China, provides the basis for climate forecast and improves the accuracy of weather forecast."

 The design of emission abatement measures to effectively reduce ozone (O3) pollution is highly complex due to non-linear chemistry, multi-source precursor emissions, and regional-scale transport. All these processes also depend on the synoptic circulation conditions. This study classified large-scale circulations to explore the synoptic controls on surface O3 pollution over eastern China (EC) during the warm seasons (May to September) from 2013 to 2022. Four prevailing circulation patterns (CPs) were identified, distinguishable by distinct differences in surface O3 anomaly distribution over the EC region. Regional meteorological variables, satellite-based precursors (NO2 and CH2O), and CH2O/NO2 ratio-based O3 formation sensitivity (OFS) were projected onto each CP to explore the underlying physiochemical mechanism of synoptic circulation modulation to surface O3 pollution. The results indicated that circulation-driven regional transport governed the spatial variability of surface O3 anomaly distribution on a synoptic timescale. Additionally, circulation-driven temperature changes caused unsynchronized changes in NO2 and CH2O across different CPs, leading to circulation-dependent OFS distribution. Geographical O3 anomaly changes generally followed the O3-NOx-VOC chemical principle in most synoptic circulation situations, thereby providing a framework for formulating spatiotemporal sensitivity-oriented mitigation strategies for forthcoming O3 pollution episodes with the assistance of synoptic circulation forecasts."

 Sensor networks provide spatially resolved information about the time variation of PM2.5 concentrations in urban areas around the world. With relatively simple improvements to the control of the temperature and humidity of incoming air, and with proper quality assurance and calibration protocols, a low cost monitor was developed that provides measurements that were highly correlated with a reference PM2.5 monitor. These have sufficient resolution and reliability to quantify small differences within an urban area. Nevertheless, many sites report similar concentrations and it can be difficult to interpret the results or distinguish local from regional effects. Generalized Additive Models are an effective Machine Learning method to distinguish the impact of factors across very different scales. As a type of Interpretable Machine Learning / eXplainable Artificial Intelligence, they provide direct information on the link between specific factors and PM2.5 concentrations. GAM simulations were developed for sensors located around Dhaka, Bangladesh, for both the dry and the wet seasons. The simulations show that the largest contributor to high PM2.5 concentration variations across both urban and peri-urban sites is the boundary layer height which represent the vertical mixing of the urban plume. Using Trajectory Cluster Concentration Impacts, the simulations showed that robust estimates of long-range transport could be obtained from measurements located within a polluted environment, and the model further showed that enhancements of more than 40μg/m3 were associated with air transport from the Indo-Gangetic Plain in the dry season. Finally, interaction maps of the effect of horizontal wind speed and direction showed that these could be associated with up to +/−20 % variation in PM2.5 from site to site. Most of the enhancements are related to very calm winds and appear to be more strongly associated with road emissions than with point sources. Overall, the sensor network shows that air is polluted throughout the Dhaka area and into the peripheries, and that a multipronged approach will be needed to improve air quality for its inhabitants."

 Lightning is a self-developing charge transport system that exhibits fundamental manifestations of the macro-scale polarity asymmetry. This asymmetry is tightly connected with peculiarities of the reversal point (the point of zero leader sheath charge or, alternatively, a site where the lightning channel potential coincides with the intracloud one) movement along the leader growth direction. The study presents a stochastic lightning discharge model that is used to analyze the reversal point dynamics. It is shown that the reversal point shifts towards the direction of growth of the dominant leader, i.e. the leader with prevailing peripheral current. The cases of upward and downward directions of the positive leader propagation are considered to study how the difference in altitudes of positive and negative lightning poles influences the mode of reversal point drift. The model predicts that, for the case of an intracloud lightning, the amplitudes of oscillation of reversal point altitude and voltage are of the order of 1 km and 100 MV, respectively, with the reversal point voltage change rate being of the order of 10 MV/ms. The results allow to conclude that the reversal point meandering is a fundamental manifestation of lightning evolution."

 Exploring the links between moist processes, convection, and intensification in modeled tropical cyclones (TCs) remains an important object in the TC internal dynamics. In this study, the full life cycle of an idealized TC is diagnosed by a local moist available energy budget. In general, the diabatic term in available potential energy (APE) mainly from the microphysical processes dominates the rapid intensification (RI) of the TC, while the uplift term makes a negative and considerable contribution, implying the importance of water lifting in TC development. The budgets at different layers in the inner region are further explored. In the lower troposphere, the downward transport of the vertical pressure flux dominates the growth of the available elastic energy (AEE); the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and the microphysical processes contribute more to APE in the pre-RI and RI stage, respectively. In the mid-upper troposphere, the diabatic term mainly from the microphysical processes leads to the growth of APE; then the increased APE is converted into mechanical energy and ultimately the cyclone intensifies. The vertical pressure fluxes transport downward below 10 km and upward above 10 km, with the AEE being deposited in the lower troposphere and removed in the mid-upper troposphere. Compared to previous budget analyses, our approach emphasizes the conditional instability of the atmosphere and the corresponding result aligns more closely with the conditional instability of the second kind (CISK) mechanism. Also, the divergence of the APE flux at high levels indicates an instantaneous strengthening of the wind speed model."

 The selection of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterisation schemes is crucial for the simulation of local meteorology, especially under extreme weather events. A suitable PBL scheme is one of the key conditions to accurately reproduce the real weather conditions. In this study, the performance of all the three available PBL schemes that can be coupled with the multi-layer urban canopy model in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model: Yonsei University (YSU), Mellor-Yamada-Janjic (MYJ), and Bougeault-Lacarrere (BL), is evaluated for a cold spell event with Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) as the study region. It is found that accurate prediction of the strength of the vertical mixing and the change in wind speeds over the upper atmosphere is critical for reproducing the nighttime temperatures during the cold spell. The simulations of the BL scheme are consistent with observations that wind speeds do not vary much during daytime and nighttime, thus exhibiting strong vertical mixing and slowing down the near-surface temperature decrease during nighttime. The MYJ and YSU schemes cause significant underestimation of the nighttime 2-m temperature due to significant overestimation of the nighttime upper-air wind speeds, which leads to more heat transport through horizontal advection and hinders vertical mixing and convective activities. The results confirm that selection of a suitable PBL scheme can effectively reduce the uncertainty of the simulation results, and the coupling of the BL scheme with the multi-layer urban canopy model can better simulate the cold spell events occurring in the GBA, which also provides valuable references for the simulation of other similar coastal cities."

 Understanding the impact of various weather systems on surface wind speed (SWS) holds immense importance in enhancing the efficiency of wind power generation. Among the many systems that affect regional weather patterns, atmospheric blocking stands out as a key influencer. Here, we explored the influence of winter blocking in Eurasia on SWS changes over China. We found that the majority of blockings over Eurasia occurred around the Okhotsk Sea and Europe and that the blockings that occurred at different locations significantly influenced regional SWS changes. The blockings that occurred in western Russia and eastern Okhotsk consistently influenced most of China, increasing the SWS by 0.2–0.5 m/s and decreasing it by −0.4 to −0.2 m/s, respectively. The blocking that occurred over Russia also generally increased the SWS, and the areas with elevated SWS were mainly concentrated on the Tibetan Plateau and southeastern China. The influence of other blockings on SWS showed significant regional differences. Blockings influence SWS mainly through the weather conditions they control, whereas the intensity and duration of blockings have negligible effects on SWS variations."

 The newly launched Fengyun-3E (FY-3E) satellite in the early morning contributes to forming a complete three-orbit observation system, comprehensively improving the spatial coverage of satellite data. This study highlights the importance of applying the Microwave Humidity Sounder-II (MWHS-2) data from the FY-3E satellite by exploring the impact of jointly assimilating FY-3D and FY-3E MWHS-2 data under all-sky conditions on regional typhoon forecasting. Firstly, the impact of the different observation error statistics is studied based on FY-3D all-sky MWHS-2 radiance data assimilation for Typhoon Muifa (2022). The results show that the features of adaptive observation error statistics are rather consistent based on observational and meteorological information samples over different periods. Appropriate observation errors have the potential to improve typhoon track and intensity predictions, especially for rainfall forecasts. Consistent positive benefits of the typhoon intensity forecasts are obtained with the assimilation of the cloud-affected radiances from FY-3D MWHS-2. Moreover, joint assimilation experiments using FY-3D and FY-3E MWHS-2 radiances are conducted to compare the relative impact of each sensor for both clear-sky and all-sky. Results indicate improvements in the analyses of 500 hPa geopotential height and humidity with the introduction of cloud-affected radiance in joint assimilation experiments. The forecast performance of the joint assimilation method is significantly better than that with only FY-3E MWHS-2 observations in terms of the typhoon track, intensity, and precipitation. This superiority is particularly obvious in all-sky data assimilation experiments compared to clear-sky conditions."

 The western North Pacific subtropical high (WNPSH) is a critical atmospheric circulation system influencing weather and climate patterns in eastern China. Accurately predicting its activity is essential for anticipating and managing natural disasters such as droughts and floods in the region. In this study, we employ the decision tree (DT) as the fundamental model and devise a compatible framework to create an integrated model known as the Decision Tree Integration Model for Synthesizing Multiple External Forcing Signals (DTI-MS), to perform classification prediction of the WNPSH ridge line in summer. Within the construction of DTI-MS, the interpretability advantage of DT model is fully exploited. Three significant sources of external forcing signals, namely sea surface temperature in the Pacific, Tropical Indian Ocean and Atlantic Ocean, and snow depth across the Eurasian continent, are identified from distinct DT models, with clear physical meanings. Through the voting strategy, these signals are integrated, laying the groundwork for DTI-MS to synthesize multiple external forcing signals. Regarding prediction performance, DTI-MS achieves a high classification accuracy of 91% in the training set and 93% in the testing set, with recalls for the southerly and northerly positions of the WNPSH in the testing set also exceeding 80%. Compared with the commonly used machine learning models such as DT and Random Forests constructed through general modeling approaches, DTI-MS also demonstrates higher classification accuracy. Overall, DTI-MS not only shows promising potential in predicting the WNPSH ridge line, but its integration framework also provides a new paradigm for short-term climate prediction modeling."

 Accurate representation of the land use/land cover (LULC) in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model has been shown to be crucial for improved simulation of surface variables and urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon. In this study, a ground truthed LULC dataset over Metro Manila (MM) was integrated in the WRF model to assess and quantify the relative contributions of using an updated land use/land cover (ULULC), activating the single-layer urban canopy model (WSLUCM) and anthropogenic heat (WAH), and consideration of urban surface heterogeneity (LIR) representation on simulated Surface Temperature (ST) relative to the default model settings (CTRL) of the WRF model. Additionally, the study examines the daytime and nighttime UHI features over MM, using a reference simulation where urban grids were replaced with cropland (CRP). Numerical simulations were carried out for April 2018, a typical dry month without monsoonal influence over MM to get a clear UHI characterization. Data from nine weather stations distributed across MM was used for performance evaluation. Results show negligible daytime biases in ST for CTRL, ULULC, and WAH, and underestimated ST for WSLUCM. At night, CTRL and ULULC (WSLUCM and WAH) tend to overestimate (underestimate) ST. Of the four factors analyzed, updating LULC, using SLUCM, including AH, and accounting for urban surface heterogeneity can change daytime ST by 0.3 °C, -0.6 °C, 0.3 °C, and 0 °C, respectively, and nighttime ST by 0.5 °C, -1.2 °C, 0.3 °C, and 0.4 °C, respectively. Widespread daytime warming and a distinct nocturnal UHI following urbanization were confirmed for MM when the LULC accounted for urban heterogeneity. While data limitations for MM limit the specification of the SLUCM, its UHI features are best represented in WRF when an updated land cover dataset is used."

 In recent years, China has made certain progresses regarding the monitoring of ozone (O3) pollution. However, a comprehensive understanding of the three-dimensional distribution and evolutionary characteristics of O3 is still relatively lacking. This study analyzed an O3 pollution episode in the Pearl River Delta during September to October 2019 using data from five O3 lidars and air pollution monitoring stations combined with the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation data assimilation system. The model's performance in the vertical direction improved after assimilation, with the correlation coefficient of model simulations improving by 87 %, errors decreasing by 30 %, and simulation accuracy increasing by 29 %. Results showed that O3 pollution persisted for more than a week due to high temperatures and the influence of Typhoon Mita. However, after October 2, the concentration of O3 decreased under the combined effects of southerly winds and reduced traffic emissions during the National Day period. Besides, lidar observations indicate that residual O3 at night can disrupt its typical diurnal variation patterns. Moreover, O3 pollution occurred both at ground level and greater heights. Overall, O3 is primarily produced by photochemical reactions. Nevertheless, the O3 concentration was also affected by pollutant transport from northeast to southwest at a height of 0–3 km during the pollution period, with an average transport flux of 366 μg·m−2·s−1. Anomalously high nighttime O3 concentrations (>100 μg·m−3) were observed in both coastal and inland cities. Residual O3 could lead to persistent pollution the next day. The results clarify the vertical distribution and evolutionary characteristics of O3, which is crucial for devising more targeted pollution control strategies in the Pearl River Delta."

 The Sertã wildfire started on October 15th, 2017, in a mountainous area in central Portugal, on the hottest day of an exceptionally dry month compared to the previous two decades. This dry spell was attributed to a persistent heatwave from October 1st to 16th, which impacted most of mainland Portugal. Due to the critical weather and vegetation conditions, the fire was very intense, generating a thermal plume that reached high altitudes. The main purpose of this work is to analyze and discuss the impact of the Sertã wildfire on the dynamics of atmospheric mountain circulation. To accomplish this, a numerical modeling system integrating meteorological, fire spread, and smoke dispersion models was employed. The results indicate that the interaction between the wildfire and the local mountain breeze in central Portugal, under the synoptic weather conditions in Europe, which included the Hurricane Ophelia over the Atlantic Ocean and a warm-sector polar frontal depression in northern Europe, led to a locally disturbed weather situation. The consistent, efficient, and uniform local transport of atmospheric properties at lower levels was disrupted, intensifying wind shear and developing more turbulent advection patterns. Moreover, the fire's impact contributed to the development of a baroclinic wave at 500 hPa over mass centers, which settled at the surface and enhanced cloud development over the region. This phenomenon aligns with the atmospheric circulation effects studied in the Bjerknes and Rossby theories."

 The coincidence of extreme cold, precipitation, and freezing weather is one of the most significant natural disasters in winter, with extensive impacts on public transportation, the energy industry, and the ecological landscape. Despite the importance of such events, comprehensive analyses of the performance of cutting-edge numerical weather prediction models at convection-permitting scales remain inadequate. This paper investigates the prolonged freezing event that occurred from January 24 to 28, 2018 in South China using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with a horizontal grid spacing of 3 km. The focus is on evaluating the performance of the WRF model and the impact of microphysical parameterizations and nudging techniques. The results show that the WRF model successfully captures the main features of the prolonged freezing event, including the low-level collision of cold and warm air in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River valley and the spatial distribution of precipitation. However, the model overestimates the strength of warm air from the south, leading to a northward shift of the precipitation belt. The choice of physical parameterizations significantly influences model performance, with microphysical schemes of P3, Thompson, and MYDM showing better model skill in terms of root mean square error (RMSE). The analysis also highlights the importance of nudging techniques, particularly grid nudging, which significantly improves model performance. Furthermore, the inclusion of local, very dense station observations from the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) during the nudging process provides additional improvement. A further investigation reveals that the accuracy in reproducing low-level convergence over South China is the main factor influencing model performance across different sensitivity simulations. This study underscores the value of convection-permitting simulations in accurately reproducing extreme freezing events over China."

 Exploring the physical characteristics of lightning discharge channels based on spectrum can help to reveal the microscopic mechanism of the discharge process and provide a theoretical basis for lightning protection research. According to the spectra of six cloud-to-ground lightning return stroke processes and plasma conduction theory, we investigated the evolution of the total intensity of ionic and atomic lines in the spectra, conductivity, and other parameters along the discharge channel at different stages of the return stroke. The results show that the intensity of ionic lines in the spectrum present an obvious decaying trend with increasing height along the channel during the initial current-rise phase of the return stroke. In the later stages, the decay of ionic line intensity along the channel height slowed down. The intensity of the atomic lines varied slightly with increasing height along the channel during the entire return stroke process. The different space-time evolution characteristics of the spectral line intensity with different excitation energies reflect the differences in the mechanism of light radiation in the core current-carrying and surrounding thermal channels. The spectral characteristics further confirm that the ionic line with higher excitation energy directly relates to the physical process in the core current-carrying channel, and its intensity can roughly reflect the change in current along the channel. The attenuation of the return stroke current along the channel was mainly manifested in the initial stage of the return stroke. The decay rate of conductivity along the channel height is slower than that of the ionic line intensity throughout the return stroke stage, which is related to the channel diameter, it is another key parameter affecting the current transmission in the discharge channel."

 As a key component of rainfall estimation, the understanding of raindrop size distribution (DSD) is a long-standing goal in meteorology and hydrology. Given that weather radar can observe the precipitation microphysics over large spatial and temporal scales, it has been broadly applied in DSD estimation. Traditional polynomial regression algorithms that correlate DSD parameters and radar signatures are still widely applied due to their simple structure and acceptable accuracy. This study proposes a new DSD retrieval model using dual-polarization radar observations based on long short-term memory (LSTM) network techniques. Three schemes able to retrieve the parameters of a normalized gamma DSD (LSTM-D0, LSTM-Nw, and LSTM-μ) are proposed with different combinations of polarimetric radar measurement inputs. All LSTM estimators exhibit better performance than the polynomial regression method. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient for estimates of drop median diameter (D0) and intercept parameter (Nw) increases from 0.93 and 0.70 to 0.95 and 0.93 respectively at Chilbolton station. Poor estimates of the shape parameter (μ) using the polynomial regression estimator complicate real applications, whereas the remarkable improvement of LSTM model estimation facilitates practical applications. The temporal and spatial predictability is then estimated to investigate long-term estimator performance for various radars, or at least for all radar pixels of a single radar. The predictability, measured by the Nash coefficient, increases temporally by 0.08, 0.31, and 0.39 and spatially by 0.03, 0.19, and 0.23 for the parameters D0, log10Nw, and μ respectively.

 Cloud bursts have become a pressing concern with their devastating impact and increasing frequency over the Himalayan region. Therefore, understanding the physical mechanisms associated with their occurrence is essential and urgent. Our investigation into the physical mechanisms of a cloud burst over Sauni Binsar, Uttarakhand, India, which occurred on 10 June 2021 around 06 UTC, is a step towards addressing this urgency. On the day of the cloud burst, there was a continuous accumulation/stagnation (at 850 hPa) of moist air over Sauni Binsar due to the northward propagation of the southwest monsoon, leading to atmospheric column supersaturation. The advection of warm air (dry) from the monsoon heat low at higher (700 hPa) caused potential instability over this region. Orographic lifting and a gradual increase in convergence over this region caused moist convection. Further, the analysis of Richardson's number indicated that turbulence was maximum in the middle and upper troposphere. Just a few hours before the cloud burst event (02–06 UTC 10 June 2021), the decrease in potential vorticity indicates the squashing of the moist columns and the decrease in the vorticity. The sudden squashing of the supersaturated atmospheric column might have caused enormous rainfall (Cloud burst) over the Sauni Binsar region."

 The variation characteristics of rain storms (RSs) are closely related to complex internal physical processes and external dynamic and thermodynamic conditions. Using a 17-year observational rainfall dataset from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar (PR), the diurnal cycles of various RS characteristics and their responses to the South China Sea Summer Monsoon (SCSSM) are investigated in South China (SC) during the presummer rainy season (PSRS). Before SCSSM outbreaks, the RSs in the western inland region of SC (WSC) have stronger precipitation intensities and convective features due to orographic lifting, especially at night, while those in the eastern inland region of SC (ESC) have higher RS occurrence frequencies with higher moisture transport, especially in the afternoon. The onset of the SCSSM leads to abundant moisture and sufficient convective available potential energy over the entire SC area, resulting in significant increases in the occurrence frequency, convective fraction, and precipitation top height of RSs. In the WSC, the weakened upward motion and smaller convective inhibition limit RS development, resulting in weaker rainfall intensity. In the ESC, a particularly unstable atmosphere and enhanced low-level moisture transport in the afternoon lead to a larger three-dimensional size, more active convection, and greater precipitation intensity in the RSs. These results offer fresh insight into the diurnal variation in rainfall during the PSRS and can be effectively used to evaluate numerical model simulations."

 The quasi-biweekly oscillation (QBWO) is an important component of tropical monsoon variations. In this study, the QBWO rainfall demonstrates a westward propagation across the tropical Asian monsoon region, originating from the western North Pacific, passing through the South China Sea and the Bay of Bengal, and ultimately reaching the northwestern Indian Peninsula. Notably, the rainfall anomalies over the South China Sea precede those over the Bay of Bengal by one quarter of the QBWO life cycle. Enhanced (suppressed) rainfall is closely associated with significant positive (negative) specific humidity anomalies, primarily induced by meridional moisture transport at the lower levels, as revealed by a moisture budget analysis. Specifically, the alternating presence and westward movement of northerly anomalies on the eastern (western) flank of anticyclonic (cyclonic) circulation anomalies are responsible for transporting low-frequency moisture across tropical Asia, thereby instigating the westward propagation of QBWO rainfall. Thus, the multiscale interactions between atmospheric circulation and moisture play a pivotal role in the development of QBWO monsoon rainfall, and understanding the moisture dynamics of this rainfall development would provide useful information for subseasonal rainfall prediction in tropical Asia."

 An extremely heavy rainfall occurred in Henan Province, China, from July 19th to 21st in 2021, with large precipitation, long duration and wide precipitation area. Impact of water vapor transportation from atmospheric river (AR) on the rainfall was studied through reanalysis data and weather research and forecasting (WRF) model. Precipitation reached over 600 mm around Mount Song, which lasted for 48 h. The AR provided sufficient water vapor condition for the long-lasting rainfall. Regional averaged hourly precipitation was positively correlated with the amplitude of Integrated Horizontal Water Vapor Transport (IVT) and negatively correlated with IVT divergence (IVTD). Maximum precipitation regions were consistent with large IVT and IVTD regions. Peaks of IVT and IVTD were advancing of precipitation peak. Precipitation was affected by Mount Song through influencing spatial distribution and vertical structure of ARs and vertical velocity. Orographic lifting and wind converging around Mount Song caused the heavy rainfall in Zhengzhou City on July 20th. Precipitation, large IVT, IVTD and updrafts region located northwesterly of Mount Song in half mountain and without mountain tests.

 The influence of cold fronts on the formation of ozone (O3) pollution, particularly the contributions of physical and chemical processes to O3 abundance during the passage of cold fronts in winter over the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) region was still unclear. This study provided an in-depth analysis on the occurrence of high O3 pollution based on data from field measurements and simulation of a chemical transport model (i.e., WRF-Chem) over the PRE region during winter 2021 when cold fronts were frequently observed. Totally 7 high O3 episode days were observed during pre- and post-frontal stages at DWS (i.e., Da Wan Shan island), a downwind island site of the inland Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, which were accompanied with the prevailing northerly wind patterns with insignificant variations of wind speeds in a stable boundary layer over the whole PRE region. The quantitative analysis based on simulation results indicated that horizontal transport and chemical processes accounted for the buildup of O3 abundance at DWS, with the highest mean rates of 7.3 and 5.6 ppbv/h at pre- and post-frontal stages, respectively. The high contributions from horizontal transport to O3 levels at DWS were associated with the persistent northerly winds with small variations, while the contributions of chemical processes were varied with the abundance of precursors and meteorological conditions. However, vertical transport made negative contributions to O3 abundance, with the most significant mean diffusion rate of −2.6 ppbv/h at the frontal stage because of the control of high-pressure system, while the less influence of vertical transport at pre- and post-frontal stages was associated with the weak pressure gradient forces and wind patterns. The sensitivity analysis further demonstrated that the emissions of precursors from the inland PRD region contributed 50–76% to O3 abundance over PRE at different stages. Overall, the above results quantitatively confirmed the dominant role of transport from inland PRD to the O3 pollution over the downwind PRE region and were helpful for better understanding of O3 pollution in winter over PRE."

 Accurate precipitation data are crucial in atmospheric and hydrological studies, especially for water resource management and disaster early warning. Satellite precipitation product (SPP) with high spatiotemporal resolution has been regarded as a valuable alternative precipitation source to ground observations. However, the hourly SPP generally performs poorly compared to daily SPP, thereby bias correction is urgently required. This study investigates the viability of utilizing machine learning methods to correct the bias of the hourly Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement-Early (IMERG-E) product. Meanwhile, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is utilized to generate high-resolution fields of four hourly meteorological variables, namely, temperature at 2 m (TEMP2), specific humidity at 2 m (Q2), wind direction at 10 m (WDIR10), and wind speed at 10 m (WSPD10), which further serve as covariates in machine learning models to enhance the correction process. Four machine learning models were developed, i.e., Random Forest (RF) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTM) without WRF-simulated covariates, and RF-WRF and Bi-LSTM-WRF with meteorological covariates. The results demonstrated that incorporating WRF-simulated meteorological covariates improved model performance. Specifically, correlation coefficient (CC) values increased from 0.47 (RF) to 0.51 (RF-WRF) and rose from 0.55 (Bi-LSTM) to 0.60 (Bi-LSTM-WRF), along with reduced root mean square error (RMSE) and increased critical success index (CSI) values. Furthermore, two Bi-LSTM models consistently outperformed two RF models. Overall, the Bi-LSTM-WRF model emerged as the most effective correction method, which increased CC from 0.43 (IMERG-E) to 0.60, reduced RMSE from 1.91 mm to 1.08 mm, and enhanced CSI from 0.34 to 0.41. This study underscores the potential of integrating high-resolution WRF meteorological outputs into machine learning frameworks for correcting hourly SPPs, contributing significantly to the advancement of precipitation estimation in meteorological and hydrological applications."

 Droughts cause significant economic damage worldwide. Evaluating their impacts on crop yield and water resources can help mitigate these losses. Using single variables such as precipitation, temperature, the soil moisture condition index (SMCI) and the vegetation condition index (VCI) to estimate drought impacts does not provide sufficient information on these complex conditions. Therefore, this study uses station-based and remote-sensing-based data to develop new composite drought indexes (CDIs), including the principal component analysis drought index (PSDI) and the gradient boosting method drought index (GBMDI). The first dataset includes historical observations of the standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), and the self-calibrated Palmer drought severity index (SC-PDSI) at the 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month timescales. The second dataset consists of remote-sensing-based data including the VCI, SMCI, temperature condition index (TCI), and precipitation condition index (PCI). We validated the results of PSDI and GBMDI by comparing them with historical drought events, in-situ drought indices, and annual winter wheat crop yield data from 2003 to 2022 using a regression model. Our temporal analysis revealed extreme to severe drought events during1990s and 2010s. GBMDI typically aligned with actual drought events and exhibited stronger correlations with in-situ drought indices than PSDI. We observed that drought intensity in winter were more severe than in summer. GBMDI was the most effective method, followed by PSDI, for assessing drought impacts on winter wheat yields. Thus, the proposed integrated monitoring framework and indexes offered a valuable and innovative approach to addressing the complexities of agricultural drought, particularly in evaluating its effects."

 Extratropical cyclones (ECs) play an important role in precipitation generation at mid-latitudes. EC circulation involves multiple precipitation-generating structures, raising questions regarding the origin of their moisture uptake. Our study aimed to identify the origin of precipitation using a Lagrangian approach by targeting EC characteristics in different regions. To achieve this goal, we focused on the 28 most intense ECs that affected the Iberian Peninsula (IP) in winter, with a detailed analysis of three cases, namely, Daniel, Elsa and Fabien, which occurred in December 2019. Our EC masking methodology defines target regions using the radius, warm conveyor belt (WCB) footprint stages, and a square root spiral contour centred on the cyclone, fitted to the decreasing mean sea level pressure field. Our results revealed that variations in the water budget radial target regions are driven by the intensity of moisture uptake over the spatial distribution. Furthermore, the moisture uptake patterns of the WCB ascent and outflow footprints closely resemble those of the central areas due to their geographical proximity. In the integral WCB uptake framework, the moisture gained from initial ascending particles within the inflow footprints effectively accounts for contributions from remote sources. Despite the broader precipitation inclusion, the spiral shape maintains systematic and efficient cyclone moisture dynamics."

 The winter sea ice over the Barents-Kara Sea (BKS) is reducing at an alarming rate, which impacts the Arctic shipping routes and the local ecosystems as well as the climate system across other regions. Consequently, it is imperative to project the winter ice-free state in this region to adequately prepare for future climate change and its impacts. However, most models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) show higher climatological values, weaker decreasing trends, and lower interannual variabilities in winter BKS sea ice concentration compared to observation. Additionally, it can be also seen that there exist great uncertainties in the projections of different models on whether the BKS region will be ice-free in future winters and the ice-free period, which spans almost the entire 21st century. Therefore, the study adopts two approaches developed from distance between indices of simulation and observation (DISO) method to project the winter ice-free period of the BKS under different emission scenarios. The results indicate that under SSP1–2.6, the winter BKS will not be ice-free by 2100. For SSP2–4.5, SSP3–7.0, and SSP5–8.5, the winter BKS is projected to be ice-free during 2076–2086, 2063–2068, and 2049–2061, respectively. By employing the DISO method, the projection uncertainty is reduced and the results highlight the urgency of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to delay the winter ice-free period over the BKS. These projections are intended to provide a reference for policymakers."

 We simulated three different thunderstorm events over India using a regional model with two different multi-moments cloud microphysical schemes: (i) Morrison double moment (Morrison-2 M) and (ii) National Taiwan University (NTU) triple moment (NTU-3 M). The results show that the choice of microphysical scheme significantly impacts storm structures, cloud formations, lightning intensity, and rainfall patterns. The lightning flash counts from the in-situ lightning detection network (LDN) are also used to compare the simulated storms. The Lightning Potential Index (LPI) was computed for both Morrison-2 M and NTU-3 M microphysics schemes and compared it with the LDN observation. Differences in simulations are attributed to the simulation of ice crystals, snow, and graupel by the microphysical schemes. The effects on the size distributions of cloud hydrometeors between the two microphysical schemes are also found to be important. The inclusions of ice crystal shapes likely accounted for the key differences between the two microphysics schemes. The results demonstrate that the simulation of lightning event characteristics is sensitive to the choice of microphysical parameterization schemes in numerical weather prediction models. In comparison to both the microphysical schemes, some aspects are better in the 2 M microphysics scheme, and some are better in the 3 M microphysics scheme. Morrison-2 M simulates more mixing ratio for the majority of cloud hydrometeors across all cases than the NTU-3 M whereas the Morrison-2 M has less rainfall bias over the ocean for the majority of the cases. Overall, the present study suggests that the choice of microphysical scheme can greatly influence the accuracy of thunderstorm and lightning event predictions in operational weather forecasting models."

 Cloud and aerosol contribution to the Earth's radiative budget constitutes one of the most significant uncertainties in future climate projections. To distinguish between clouds and cloud-free air, atmospheric scientists have been using a wide range of instruments, techniques, and algorithms with various detection thresholds. However, since the change from a cloudy to a cloud-free atmosphere may be gradual and, in some cases, far from obvious, recent research is questioning where the threshold between both phases should be established. These considerations lead to contemplate a transition zone (TZ) between cloud and cloud-free conditions. In the present study, backscatter profiles obtained by a Vaisala CL31 ceilometer were processed to assess the transition zone. First, two widely used cloud detection algorithms were applied and compared: the method provided by the ceilometer manufacturer (Vaisala) and Cloudnetpy, the algorithm from ACTRIS Cloudnet, a project devoted to aerosol, clouds, and trace gases research. Second, a sensitivity analysis was applied to the backscatter and signal-to-noise ratio thresholds used for cloud detection in Cloudnetpy. This methodology has allowed us to assess the vertical distribution of clouds, aerosols, the TZ, and its frequency of occurrence. Results indicate a gradual transition in backscatter retrievals from cloud to cloud-free, where particles detected near cloud boundaries induced higher backscatter values than those found further away. Depending on the thresholds used, we observed a 9.3% (with an estimated range of uncertainty of 5.420%) variation in cloud occurrence which can be attributed to TZ conditions. Analysing the whole backscatter profile, we found as many TZ conditions as cloudy values, which emphasises the importance of studying the vertical distribution of the TZ. Moreover, the analysis of TZ occurrence in height and time revealed that such conditions concentrate below 800 m during night periods, although annual height-hour distributions involve a remarkable variability among seasons. These findings highlight the importance of either including an additional phase between ‘pure clouds’ and ‘pure aerosols’ or treating them as a continuum of suspended particles in the atmosphere."

 This study examined three Mediterranean Sea cyclones classified as medicanes: Zorbas, Ianos, and Apollo. All three cyclones traversed warm-core eddies during their propagation. We investigated the role of those eddies in the cyclones' development and the responses of those eddies to the passage of a cyclone. Cyclones Zorbas and Apollo intensified considerably in close proximity to warm-core eddies; whereas Ianos, the strongest cyclone ever recorded in the Mediterranean Sea (reaching Category 2), underwent marginal intensification. In the case of Ianos, a strong marine heatwave was present during the intensification, releasing more latent and sensible heat fluxes due to the high ocean heat content, which masked the effect of the warm core eddy. For Zorbas and Apollo, the intensification above the warm-core eddy was accompanied by moisture convergence at the warm-core eddy, yielding substantial precipitation. In the case of Ianos, the convergence of moisture and subsequent precipitation aligned with the occurrence of a marine heatwave. For Zorbas and Apollo, chlorophyll-a concentrations and Phytoplankton increased after the cyclone passed over a warm-core eddy; whereas for Ianos, they increased near the site of a marine heatwave. All three cyclones responded similarly to elevated temperatures at the mesoscale (i.e., warm-core eddy) and regional scale (i.e., marine heatwave)."

 The variations in the track and intensity of a tropical cyclone (TC) are closely correlated with the fine-scale evolution of its structure. The fine-scale track, intensity, and structural evolution of Typhoon Doksuri (2023) can be comprehensively analyzed by combining multi-source observations. The results herein show that Doksuri (2023) experienced secondary eyewall formation (SEF), concentric eyewall maintenance (CEM), and eyewall replacement cycle (ERC) processes when entering the South China Sea and prior to landfall. These processes can be further delineated into three subsequent stages. In the first stage, the SEF phase, the secondary (outer) eyewall formed, exhibiting features that were non-concentric with the inner eyewall. Concurrently, the track of Doksuri (2023) displayed notable oscillations in both its forward translational direction and speed, accompanied by the emergence of two radial maxima centers of wind speed. Subsequently, during the second stage, the CEM phase, the geometric centers of the inner and outer eyewalls of Doksuri (2023) coincided, initiating a rapid intensification process characterized by an accelerated forward translational speed. Both the inner and outer eyewalls further contracted during this phase. In the third stage, the ERC phase, the asymmetry of the inner eyewall increased, and the outer eyewall gradually contracted while the inner eyewall dissipated until the replacement was completed prior to landfall. Accordingly, Doksuri (2023) experienced rapid weakening. These findings have the potential to enhance our understanding of the physical mechanisms governing the intricate structures of TCs at fine scales, bolstering the forecast accuracy of TC tracks and intensities."

 This study investigates the interannual relationship of extreme precipitation days (EPD) over South China (SC) and Indochina Peninsula (ICP) with tropical Pacific-Indian Ocean Sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies during May, utilizing observations, reanalysis, and Coupled-Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) model outputs. The results uncover a dipole mode in the interannual variations of May EPD over SC and ICP, characterized by an east–west inverse pattern. This dipole mode is significantly attributed to large-scale circulation anomalies induced by tropical Pacific–Indian Ocean mode (PIM). During the positive phase of PIM, SST anomalies in the tropical east-central Pacific and western Indian Oceans are anomalously warm, contrasted with negative SST anomalies in the western Pacific, leading to anomalous Walker circulations. Accordingly, two robust anticyclones appear in the lower levels of the Northwest Pacific and the Bay of Bengal, respectively. The southwesterlies on the western flank of the anticyclone in the Northwest Pacific cause moisture convergence over SC, favoring the occurrence of extreme precipitation in SC. Conversely, the anticyclonic circulation centered at the Bay of Bengal is not conducive to the transport of warm water vapor from oceans to ICP, resulting in reduced occurrence of extreme precipitation there. The results derived from CMIP6 models unequivocally support the notion that the dipole mode is predominantly shaped by large-scale circulation anomalies induced by PIM. Our results underscore the importance of accounting for the collective impact of oceanic drivers in the tropics, laying a scientific foundation for enhanced precision in simulating extreme precipitation across SC and ICP."

 This work was dedicated to provide a first systematic assessment of the role played by deep stratosphere-to-troposphere transport events (denoted as “stratospheric intrusions–SIs”) in influencing the CO2 and CH4 variability at a high-elevation site in Italy (Monte Cimone, CMN, 2165 m a.s.l.). To select SI events, we used a methodology based on the analysis of the temporal variability of in-situ observed stratospheric tracers (O3, CO and RH), modeled PV along 5-day back-trajectories starting at the measurement site, and satellite measurements of total column ozone (TCO). The analysis of two case studies revealed clear fingerprints of the stratospheric air masses on the atmospheric composition at CMN: CO2 and CH4 decreases were observed in winter, while CO2 CH4 increased (decreased) in summer. For 2015–2022, 9.8% of the hourly data were selected as influenced by SI events. The systematic analysis of the SI effect on CO2 confirmed differences between vegetative and non-vegetative seasons: during May–September, air masses from the stratosphere were richer in CO2 (+1.2 ± 0.1 ppm, average ±σ/N). On the other hand, during winter, air masses from higher altitudes were characterised by a lower amount of CO2 (−1.5 ± 0.1 ppm). Furthermore, SI events were usually characterised by an overall decrease in CH4 compared to the remaining data throughout the solar year (with average values ranging from −7.6 to −16.1 ppb as a function of the seasonal period). However, based on the analysis of seasonal anomalies of residuals, it looks that SI events did not play a major role in determining the interannual variability of CO2 and CH4 at CMN."

 Global warming is rapidly changing the precipitation structure, and the shift in precipitation phases is even more pronounced in the Tibetan Plateau (TP), a region sensitive to global climate change. The accuracy of precipitation phase discrimination is essential for studying precipitation variability. Based on the observed data from 112 meteorological stations in the study area obtained from the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) and the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) before 1980, we compared and assessed six methods for distinguishing precipitation phases and the optimal method was determined to complete the precipitation phase data after 1980 in the study area. Subsequently, the changes in precipitation amount, intensity, and frequency were analyzed by classifying them into light, moderate, heavy, and extreme precipitation using the percentile threshold discrimination method. It found that the dynamic threshold temperature method (presented by Ding et al., 2014) was the most effective to distinguish precipitation phases in the TP, and its performance was further improved from 80.9% to 86.1% after using frequency intersection and probability guarantee methods. Precipitation was mainly concentrated in July. Meanwhile, the proportion of snowfall to total precipitation (S/P) was approximately 9%. From 1961 to 2020, the amount of total precipitation, rainfall and snowfall in the TP exhibited increasing trends, while the sleet demonstrated a persistent decline. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity existed in the changes of precipitation of different phases. The average single precipitation amount increased. Moreover, the changes in the amount and frequency of extreme precipitation were more pronounced. Increased frequency and amount of both rainfall and snowfall were distributed in the central and eastern parts of the study area with a more significant proportion. In contrast, the peripheral areas witnessed a decrease. The spatial distribution of frequency and amount of different precipitation intensities was comparable to that of the total precipitation. This study offers novel procedure into changes of precipitation phases at high altitudes, which will inform future research on climate change and water resource management."

 Intensifying global hydrological cycle has led to significant changes in climate extremes. Recently, compound dry-hot extremes (CDHE) have received considerable attention due to their greater adverse impact than individual extremes. Thus, the present study aims to assess the monsoonal CDHEs over India for past and future. Here, an integrated approach using comprehensive statistical (variance transform method, regression and reliability ensemble averaging-REA) and probabilistic methods (copula) is proposed to study these extremes. The study evaluates the Standardized Compound Event Indicator (SCEI) across two distinct periods: the observed data from 1975 to 2015 and future projections for 2055–2095 under RCP8.5, to analyse the frequency and spatial extent of dry-hot extremes during the monsoon season (JJAS). Furthermore, the estimation of vegetation losses under different dry-hot conditions for 1982–2013 is examined using bivariate copulas. Also, the association of climate indices with SCEI is evaluated using variance transformation method. The results show that SCEI encompasses a negative trend during 1975–2015, which represents a rise in dry-hot extremes. Such extremes exhibit a substantial impact on vegetation, as the bivariate assessment of SCEI and NDVI show that around 65.70% of the country's area is vulnerable to vegetation loss under extreme SCEI condition. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that Nino3.4 (ENSO) is the most influential climate indice for SCEI, for >50% of country's area. Subsequently, for future (2055–2095), it is found that frequency and spatial extent of dry-hot extremes would increase relative to past (1975–2015), across the country. The present study improves the understanding of dry-hot extremes and can contribute towards effective adaptation strategy."

 Using the multivariate EOF analysis performed on the observation datasets, this study reveals that the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) has been toward warm-dry springs over most regions especially after the 2000s, accompanied by increased surface temperature and decreased precipitation anomalies. Such climate condition provides favourable environment for compound heat and drought events, raising questions about how the spring climate in GMS will change as climate warms. Based on a multi-model weighting scheme among CMIP6 models, we project the regional climate changes in GMS in a warmer world under the SSP5–8.5 scenario. Results show that the southern GMS including Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and Cambodia will become warmer-drier throughout the 21st century in response to global warming. In contrast, the climate condition over the northern GMS including Myanmar and Yunnan province of Southwest China is expected to experience a transition from dry to wet springs in a warmer world, resulting in a tendency toward the warm-wet springs particularly in the long-term future. This knowledge indicates the spatial non-uniformity of regional climate under global warming and will aid in advance to plan for water management and agricultural adaptation."

 Eolian dust darkens the snowpack, accelerates the snowmelt and alters atmospheric radiative budget and climate. Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), a typical geological cold stage, is featured by more dust and snow cover than present day, which seems to own a stronger snow-darkening. In this study, we used a couple of climate model experiments in order to evaluate the effect of dust-in-snow changes on Northern Hemispheric climate and Asian monsoon. The results show that, compared to present day, more dust and snow cover in LGM allows heavier dust deposition and snowmelt, which produces a larger snow-albedo-temperature feedback. This snow-darkening leads to an annually averaged northern hemisphere warming of 0.31 °C, stronger in boreal spring and summer. Spatially, the prominent warming centers are found around LGM ice sheets and Tibetan Plateau (TP), up to 2–3 °C annually, which significantly contributes to the melt of ice and triggers the termination of glaciation. Over Asia, the present snow-darkening weakens the Indian and East Asian summer monsoon although not significant. However, strong LGM forcing does not amplify the weakening but intensifies the Indian and East Asian monsoon and precipitation. Thus, the potential role of dust and its interaction with snow cover should be mentioned in the glacial-scale climate change."

 Previous studies are primarily based on surface air pollution for a single event, leaving research on the temporal characteristics of aerosols and wind fields in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and their associations unclear due to a lack of long-term vertical profile data. This study was the first to conduct long-term Doppler wind LiDAR measurements from Sep. 2019 to Aug. 2022 in Hefei in western Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, China. The spatiotemporal characteristics of retrieved aerosol backscatter coefficient (β) and wind profiles were analyzed from the perspective of long-term statistics and typical heavy pollution episodes (HPEs). The seasonal profile of β showed a peak in the near-surface layer meanwhile the overall β profile (<0.5 km) was the highest in winter but lowest in summer. Combined with ground-based meteorological and air quality observations, 12 HPEs were identified and classified into dust-related events and fog-haze episodes. The results showed a consistency between hourly variations in PM10 (particulate matter smaller than 10 μm) concentration and β retrieved at 300 m during a high PM10 concentration (>150 μg/m3) period. Different roles of horizontal wind at different altitudes and its associated time delay effect on surface PM10 pollution were evaluated based on correlation coefficients (Ф) and air pollution diffusion conditions. Significant positive Ф values were noticed below 0.5 km during the entire dust-related EP4 and EP6, indicating that the higher wind speeds could exacerbate PM10 pollution. In contrast, large negative Ф values meant the removal of PM10 pollutants by strong winds below 0.8 km during 24 h after peak in EP3. Combining with backward trajectory analysis and meteorological condition, notable transboundary pollution with positive contributions from upper winds (>1.5 km) was discovered in dust-related EP1, EP4, EP7, EP9, and EP10. Time delay effect (1-h/2-h lag) of upper winds (>0.8 km) on surface PM10 pollution was explored in EP5, EP6, EP7, EP8, and EP9. In spring dust-related HPEs, surface PM10 pollution was mostly contributed by long-range transport of aerosol particles at higher altitudes (>1.5 km) from the northwest direction, driven by the Mongolian cyclone and the cold front system. Transboundary aerosols originated from the northern part of Anhui province and the YRD region in the middle altitudes (∼0.5 km) was the main contributor to fog-haze HPEs. The findings demonstrated the ability of the real-time Doppler wind LiDAR system to monitor transboundary air pollution and provided a scientific reference for policy makers."

 Due to the low spatial and temporal density of early meteorological observations in China, The China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System V3.0 (CLDAS3.0) could not obtain high-quality historical, high-resolution assimilated data. In particular, with high-resolution precipitation assimilation data, it is difficult to estimate the precipitation range accurately because of its substantial spatiotemporal heterogeneity. To solve this problem, our team proposes a two-stage downscaling framework for the precipitation field based on multi-task learning, CLDASSD-PRCP. It improves the accuracy of the downscaling task by predicting the precipitation classification mask first. We verify the algorithm using CLDAS3.0 and site observations as ground truth in Yunnan, China. The results show that CLDASSD-PRCP can accurately generate three types of precipitation masks and reduce the MAE of downscaling results by 0.32 mm/h after adding multi-classification masks (MutiClassesMask). In addition, the effects of light and extreme precipitation on precipitation spatial downscaling are also revealed. CLDASSD-PRCP is significant for establishing statistical downscaling models based on deep learning and provides a new way to deal with atmospheric elements with significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity."

The warm core of hurricane over East Pacific ocean displays the widest radial extent (650 km), while that over North India ocean has the deepest vertical extent (8.5 km). As expected, the BA anomalies of tropical storms and tropical depressions are weaker in magnitude and smaller in size than those of hurricanes. An exception is found for the maximum BA anomaly of hurricanes over South Pacific ocean is not located near hurricane centers but at the 175-km radial distance. Accordingly, the mean altitudes of the atmospheric boundary layer estimated from COSMIC-2 BA observations increase from the 175-km radial distances to both sides for hurricanes over South Pacific ocean, while those over the other five ocean basins increase from eye centers outward."

 It is well realized that the planetary boundary layer (PBL) imbalance is essential for the secondary eyewall formation (SEF) in tropical cyclones (TCs). The purpose of this study is to investigate the thermodynamic processes in inducing the PBL imbalance. While the control run in an idealized simulation is capable of generating the SEF, simulations with varying fall speeds of raindrops (FSR) in the microphysics resulted in different outcomes for the formation of SEF. The SEF occurs only within a specific range of FSR relative to its default formulation in the model.The gradient wind equation in the PBL is used to diagnose the imbalance leading to SEF. In the case with a formation of SEF, a substantial downdraft induced by TC outer rainbands is observed, leading to positive agradient force (AF). Such downdraft favors the formation of a moat region. Furthermore, the adiabatic warming induced by the downdrafts also modifies the temperature field and the radial gradient of pressure field, contributing to the PBL imbalance. While previous studies have emphasized the importance of the broadening of tangential wind as a trigger for positive AF, our results highlight the importance of the local pressure gradient imbalance within the PBL."

In this paper, persistent extreme precipitation indices (PEPIs) related to intensity, frequency, duration, and contribution rates were constructed, utilizing a gridded daily precipitation dataset and atmospheric circulation indices data from China for the period 1961–2022 to analyze the spatial distribution, spatiotemporal trends, and seasonal patterns and variations of PEPIs across different regions of China and the potential impact of the dynamic factors on the spatiotemporal variations of PEPIs.

 Large-scale climate oscillations are the main forcings affecting regional meteorological droughts and being relevant to sources of their predictability. However, the physical mechanism of atmospheric teleconnections with respect to regional droughts is still not fully understood. In this study, a univariate-to-multivariate analysis framework is proposed to disentangle the spatially combined and temporally lagged effects of multiple oceanic-atmospheric oscillations on meteorological droughts at regional scale. Our study focuses on the largest freshwater lake basin of China, the Poyang Lake basin (PLB). Pearson's correlation coefficient and cross-wavelet transform are used to analyze the pair-wise linear and non-linear correlations between droughts and each climate oscillation. Random forests model is used to reveal the combined influences of multiple climate oscillations. The associated atmospheric mechanism for the identified combination of climate indices with changing lags is explored by performing composite analysis. Regarding the spatially combined influences, the concurrence of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) are the most important drought precursors. Regarding the temporally lagged influences, ENSO with lag of 11 months and NAO with lag of 2–3 months trigger meteorological droughts. The combined effect of preceding winter El Niño and late-summer negative NAO is the primary cause for triggering autumn droughts. The positive Eurasian teleconnection pattern, triggered by ENSO and NAO and favorable for anomalous northerly currents, is the main drought-prone circulation pattern for the PLB. These findings contribute to improved understanding of joint effects of lagged teleconnections for meteorological droughts, which could eventually lead to more skillful seasonal drought forecasting."

 A record-breaking heavy rainfall event struck North China from 29 July to 1 August 2023, during which the southwest mountain region of Beijing city recorded a rainfall amount over 2 times that of its eastern plain region. Based on multisource observations and convection-permitting numerical simulations, this study analyzes the thermal structure in these regions and its impact on precipitation. The rainfall was caused by a deep extratropical cyclone, which produced strong low-level southeast winds that transported abundant warm moist air toward North China. The light rainfall on 29 July caused extensive evaporation and cooling, and the increase in low-level easterly wind led to uneven heating in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) during the following two days. The PBL over mountains was significantly colder than over plains. The WRF model reasonably reproduces the evolution of rainfall, but with a dry bias. The simulated differences in rainfall amount and temperature between two regions are similar to the observations. The diagnosis of the vertical momentum budget attributes the enhancement of updrafts to horizontal convergence within the PBL, which mainly resulted from the deceleration of easterly wind over the windward slope. The simulated maximum temperature gradient occurred in the strongest convergence zone. Furthermore, the force analysis indicates the important role played by the thermal contrast in the deceleration of PBL easterly wind. The thermal contrast forced a mountain breeze effect, which together with the topographic blocking significantly decelerated the easterly wind and further enhanced updrafts and rainfall over mountainous regions."

However, this assumption is not generally valid, leading to misleading characterization results. Interfacial evaporators yield larger evaporation rates in dark conditions due to enlarged liquid-vapor surface areas, resulting in increased evaporative cooling and larger environmental temperature differentials. Theoretical and experimental evidence is provided, which shows that these temperature differences invalidate the equal energy input assumption. The results indicate that differences in evaporation rates correspond to energy input variations, without requiring enthalpy to be reduced below theoretical values. These findings offer alternative explanations for previous claims of reduced vaporization enthalpy and contradict enthalpy-related conclusions drawn from differential scanning calorimetry. We conclude that postulating a reduced vaporization enthalpy using the dark environment method is inaccurate and that re-evaluation of vaporization enthalpy reduction is required."

ACSL6 promotes tumor growth, metastasis, and immune evasion mediated by IL-18, independent of its metabolic enzyme activity. Mechanistically, upon IL-18 stimulation, ACSL6 is phosphorylated by ERK2 at S674 and recruits IL-18RAP to interact with IL-18R1, thereby reinforcing the IL-18R1–IL-18RAP heterodimer and triggering NF-κB–dependent gene expression to facilitate tumor development. Furthermore, the up-regulation of CXCL1 and CXCL5 by ACSL6 promotes tumor-associated neutrophil and tumor-associated macrophage recruitment, thereby inhibiting cytotoxic CD8+T cell infiltration. Ablation or S674A mutation of ACSL6 potentiated anti–PD-1 therapeutic efficacy by increasing the effector activity of intertumoral CD8+T cells.

Scanning Kelvin probe measurements show that these films substantially alter the surface potential; thus, they provide a platform for silk-based electronics on vdW solids."

Dehmer;Fabian T. Gutjahr;Peter M. Jakob;Ljudmilla Borisjuk,Metabolic imaging in living plants: A promising field for chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a versatile technique in the biomedical field, but its application to the study of plant metabolism in vivo remains challenging because of magnetic susceptibility problems. In this study, we report the establishment of chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) for plant MRI. This method enables noninvasive access to the metabolism of sugars and amino acids in complex sink organs (seeds, fruits, taproots, and tubers) of major crops (maize, barley, pea, potato, sugar beet, and sugarcane). Because of its high signal detection sensitivity and low susceptibility to magnetic field inhomogeneities, CEST analyzes heterogeneous botanical samples inaccessible to conventional magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The approach provides unprecedented insight into the dynamics and distribution of sugars and amino acids in intact, living plant tissue. The method is validated by chemical shift imaging, infrared microscopy, chromatography, and mass spectrometry. CEST is a versatile and promising tool for studying plant metabolism in vivo, with many applications in plant science and crop improvement."

Hurwitz;Danielle R. Kobulsky;Seul K. Jung;Jennifer J. Chia;Jason M. Butler;Peter Kurre,CCR2 cooperativity promotes hematopoietic stem cell homing to the bone marrow,"Cross-talk between hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and bone marrow (BM) cells is critical for homing and sustained engraftment after transplantation. In particular, molecular and physical adaptation of sinusoidal endothelial cells (ECs) promote HSPC BM occupancy; however, signals that govern these events are not well understood. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are mediators of cell-cell communication crucial in shaping tissue microenvironments. Here, we demonstrate that integrin α4β7 on murine HSPC EVs targets uptake into ECs. In BM ECs, HSPC EVs induce up-regulation of C-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) ligands that synergize with CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling to promote BM homing. In nonirradiated murine models, marrow preconditioning with HSPC EVs or recombinant CCR2 ligands improves homing and early graft occupancy after transplantation. These findings identify a role for HSPC EVs in remodeling ECs, newly define CCR2-dependent graft homing, and inform novel translational conditioning strategies to improve HSPC transplantation."

In the tumor microenvironment (TME), macrophage presence is largely associated with poor prognosis because of their reprogramming into immunosuppressive cells. We investigated the effects of hypoxia, a TME-associated feature, on the functional, epigenetic, and transcriptional reprogramming of macrophages and found that hypoxia boosts their immunogenicity. Hypoxic inflammatory macrophages are characterized by a cluster of proinflammatory genes undergoing ten-eleven translocation–mediated DNA demethylation and overexpression. These genes are regulated by NF-κB, while HIF1α dominates the transcriptional reprogramming, demonstrated through ChIP-seq and pharmacological inhibition. In bladder and ovarian carcinomas, hypoxic inflammatory macrophages are enriched in immune-infiltrated tumors, correlating with better patient prognoses. Coculture assays and cell-cell communication analyses support that hypoxic-activated macrophages enhance T cell–mediated responses. The NF-κB–associated hypomethylation signature is displayed by a subset of hypoxic inflammatory macrophages, isolated from ovarian tumors. Our results challenge paradigms regarding the effects of hypoxia on macrophages and highlight actionable target cells to modulate anticancer immune responses."

Allen and Hirofumi Morishita,Local and long-range input balance: A framework for investigating frontal cognitive circuit maturation in health and disease,"Frontal cortical circuits undergo prolonged maturation across childhood and adolescence; however, it remains unknown what specific changes are occurring at the circuit level to establish adult cognitive function. With the recent advent of circuit dissection techniques, it is now feasible to examine circuit-specific changes in connectivity, activity, and function in animal models. Here, we propose that the balance of local and long-range inputs onto frontal cognitive circuits is an understudied metric of circuit maturation. This review highlights research on a frontal-sensory attention circuit that undergoes refinement of local/long-range connectivity, regulated by circuit activity and neuromodulatory signaling, and evaluates how this process may occur generally in the frontal cortex to support adult cognitive behavior. Notably, this balance can be bidirectionally disrupted through various mechanisms relevant to psychiatric disorders. Pharmacological or environmental interventions to normalize or reset the local and long-range balance could hold great therapeutic promise to prevent or rescue cognitive deficits."

Mayer;Joseph Moran,Coenzymes in a pre-enzymatic metabolism,"Experiments now support theoretical suggestions that coenzymes mediated key metabolic reactions before the emergence of enzymes. Three coenzymes believed essential to the core metabolism of the last universal common ancestor to extant life (pyridoxal phosphate, adenosine diphosphate, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) were recently found to be active in their corresponding metabolic reactions in the absence of enzymes. These findings suggest an earlier contribution of coenzymes to abiogenesis, ultimately yielding insights into the prebiotic origins of metabolism."
