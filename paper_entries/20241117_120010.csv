10.1021/acs.est.4c10314,False,Environmental Science & Technology,这篇论文主要研究城市绿化对中国城市温度变化的影响。它通过建立统计模型，量化了城市绿化在过去二十年中的降温潜力，并分析了不同城市区域（核心区和郊区）的降温效果差异。研究发现，城市绿化有效减缓了城市变暖趋势，尤其是在城市核心区效果显著。该研究强调了人工植被管理在抑制城市变暖中的重要性，为建设适应气候变化的城市提供了参考。但该研究主要关注地表温度变化，并未直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等。,"['surface temperature', 'urban warming', 'urban greening', 'ecological restoration']",Dong Xu;Tingting Bai;Lin Yang;Yuyu Zhou;Bin Chen;Haifeng Xu;Yongze Song;Yuan Yuan;Yuanzheng Cui;Meng Lin;Ziqian Xia;Min Chen;Zhenci Xu;Peng Zhao;Guihua Dong;Lei Zhang;Jiacheng Zhao;Wanben Wu;Wei Wang;Zhao Liu;Jie Cheng;Philippe Ciais,Quantifying the Cooling Effect of Urban Greening Driven by Ecological Restoration Projects in China,"Urban greening (UG) affects local climate by altering surface energy balance, while long-term UG cooling potential, patterns, and contribution to curbing urban warming remain unclear. Here, we designed an novel statistical model to evaluate the cooling potential of UG (CPUG) and created the first CPUG map for China. By exploring the trends in observed and simulated urban surface temperatures (UST), we quantified the CPUG of 0.20 K over the past two decades, which slowed down the warming trend by 14.17% in Chinese cities. We found that the CPUG varied significantly between the urban core and sprawl areas. Specifically, the CPUG in the urban core was approximately 1.01 K, and it contributed to curbing urban warming by 56.08%, which was more than 7.2 times higher than in the sprawl areas, where the CPUG was only 0.14 K and contributed to curbing urban warming by 9.93%. We further revealed that urbanization and major ecological restoration projects are the key factors influencing CPUG, emphasizing the need for anthropogenic vegetation management to curb urban warming. The proposed model in this study provides a powerful tool for quantitatively assessing the impact of long-term UG trends on urban warming. The results of the study are an important reference for building climate-adaptive cities."

Considering that sleep is critical for cognitive health and occupies about one-third of human life, understanding the cognitive effects of indoor PM exposure during sleep and the potential cognitive benefits of reducing such exposure is crucial, yet currently unknown. This randomized, double-blind crossover intervention trial was conducted among 80 college students with real and sham PM filtration in their dormitories. Real-time indoor PM levels and nocturnal sleep parameters were monitored, followed by quantification of serum neurotransmitter metabolites and cognitive assessments in the mornings. We found that PM exposure during sleep, particularly PM1 and PM2.5, affected immediate and delayed memory, executive function, and global cognition. Reducing PM exposure during sleep resulted in improvements in multiple cognitive domains, with a 0.21 (95% CI: 0.05, 0.36) increase in global cognitive z-score, in which increased sleep oxygen saturation (SpO2) and alterations in dopamine metabolism and histidine metabolism played important roles. Notably, even when indoor PM2.5 levels were below the WHO air quality guidelines, further reducing PM exposure could still improve sleep SpO2 and neurotransmitter metabolism. This study provides a promising strategy to mitigate indoor PM-induced cognitive impairment."

This study investigated the effects of malathion on Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-like symptoms at environmentally relevant concentrations using wild-type (WT) and APP/PS1 transgenic mouse models. Results showed that malathion exposure induced AD-like cognitive impairment, amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation, and neuroinflammation in WT mice, with worsened symptoms in APP/PS1 mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that malathion induced AD-like gut microbiota dysbiosis (reduced Lactobacillus and Akkermansia, and increased Dubosiella), causing gut barrier impairment and tryptophan metabolism disruptions. This resulted in a significant increase in indole derivatives and activation of the colonic aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), promoting the kynurenine (KYN) pathway while inhibiting the serotonin (5-HT) pathway. Increased neurotoxic KYN metabolites (3-hydroxykynurenine and quinolinic acid) triggered gut and systemic inflammation, upregulating hippocampal IL-6 and IL-1β mRNA levels and thereby causing neuroinflammation. Gut tryptophan metabolism disruptions caused hippocampal neurotransmitter imbalances, reducing the levels of 5-HT and its derivatives. These effects promoted AD progression in both WT and APP/PS1 mice. This study highlights the crucial role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in AD-like cognitive impairment induced by malathion exposure, providing insights into the neurodegenerative disease risks posed by organophosphate pesticides."

Lund;David G. Victor,Transforming Aviation’s Impact on the Climate: Rethinking the Research Strategy,"Aviation is under tremendous pressure to mitigate its impacts on the climate, but the best response strategies are unknown today due to deep uncertainties. How low-emission fuels will scale to levels relevant for the industry, along with the best strategies for managing contrails and other non-CO2 effects, are unknowable today with unknown cost and disruption. A conventional risk-based approach that involves investment across a known set of options is unworkable; instead, we argue that an experimentalist approach is needed that addresses deep uncertainties head on. This hinges on four key factors: a critical mass of actors facing strong incentives to identify solutions, a wide search for alternatives through experiments, periodic assessments, and adjustment of goals and strategies. Present strategies do not give enough attention to higher-risk alternatives with disruptive potential, because those approaches have few political and organizational supporters. Small groups of highly motivated actors─such as the nascent coalition of first movers on clean aviation already forming in Europe and the U.S.─could initiate an experimentalist program. The challenges of the aviation sector mirror other hard-to-abate sectors, making this framework potentially applicable to a wider set of sectors where technological, business, and investment choices are shrouded in deep uncertainty."
10.1021/acs.est.4c08526,True,Environmental Science & Technology,这篇论文研究了中国2015-2023年期间氮氧化物（NO2）的浓度变化，重点关注城市和农村地区NO2趋势的差异。研究发现，尽管城市地区NO2浓度下降显著，这与各项空气清洁政策相符，但农村地区的NO2下降速度远低于预期。通过卫星观测数据和模型模拟，研究人员发现土壤排放的活性氧化氮（Nr）是造成农村地区NO2下降缓慢的重要原因。土壤Nr排放的增加抵消了国家减排努力的一部分效果，对NO2、臭氧（O3）和颗粒物硝酸盐（NO3-）的浓度降低造成了显著影响，尤其是在农业密集的华北平原地区。该研究强调了控制土壤氮排放对改善空气质量的重要性，突出了卫星遥感技术在监测大气成分和评估污染物排放控制措施有效性方面的作用。,"['Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)', 'Ozone (O3)', 'Particulate nitrate (NO3-)', 'Soil reactive oxidized nitrogen (Nr)', 'Satellite measurements', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Atmospheric composition analysis', 'Emission inventory', 'China']",Yurun Wang;Yanan Wang;Qinyi Li;Yue Tan;Mingxue Li;Yingnan Zhang;Cheng He;Tao Wang,Soil Emissions of Reactive Oxidized Nitrogen Reduce the Effectiveness of Anthropogenic Source Control in China,"Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) has decreased by ∼33% across over 1200 monitoring sites in China during 2015–2023, following a series of clean air policies. However, most of these sites are located in or near cities, leading to uncertainties in NO2 trends beyond urban regions due to limited observations. Here, we used satellite measurements to examine the differences in NO2 trends between urban and rural China. In urban areas, NO2 columns decreased by 4.0% per annum (a–1) during summer 2011–2023, consistent with bottom-up anthropogenic emission inventory and in situ measurements. In contrast, rural NO2 columns showed a slower than expected reduction (−2.6 to −0.0% a–1) during the same period. Model simulations with updates in the soil reactive oxidized nitrogen (Nr) scheme indicated that increasing soil Nr emissions can be an important factor contributing to the observed slow NO2 decrease in rural areas. This unregulated source increased summertime pollutant levels, partially offsetting the national efforts to mitigate NO2, ozone (O3), and particulate nitrate (NO3–) levels by 20.9%, 15.4%, and 4.7%, respectively, from 2011 to 2020. In the agriculture-intensive North China Plain, the increase in soil Nr emissions offset 46.6% of the NO2 reductions achieved by clean air policies. Our results highlight the increasing significance of soil emissions and the need to control them in future air-quality policies."

In addition to expanding the morphologic range of basins targeted for lacustrine paleoseismic studies, this work has implications for sediment response in dam‐enhanced basins. Lack of sedimentological evidence for other earthquakes coupled with radiocarbon chronology reveals that the 1959 event is the only clearly recorded earthquake within Henrys Lake since the mid‐Holocene.

For a warm crust, a post‐impact basin structure will viscously relax with inward flow of crustal materials toward the basin center. This effect drastically diminishes the crustal thickness contrasts and associated Bouguer gravity contrasts between the basin center and its surroundings. Here, we analyze Bouguer contrasts of 36 basins (diameter > ${ >} $300 km) located in the northern hemisphere as a proxy for viscoelastic relaxation. Thermal evolution models, assuming the present 3:2 spin‐orbit configuration, are used to predict crustal temperatures. Our analysis reveals that the expected correlation between zones of warm crust and low Bouguer contrast from relaxation is not observed in the available data. This suggests that crustal temperatures have changed in the past, potentially due to a change in Mercury's orbit or to a major volcanic event associated with smooth plain formation."

In both positive and negative NAO phases, high‐skill cases exhibited more stationary NAO patterns than low‐skill cases. The analysis of processes indicates that high‐skill NAO cases are due to stronger baroclinic maintenance of NAO, with its initial position at the climatological thermal trough, whereas low‐skill NAO cases result from forecast biases in wave propagation from the North Pacific. Specifically, biases in baroclinic energy conversion in the meridional direction from week 2 lead to weak advection of the eddy available potential energy (EAPE), resulting in lower prediction skill."

Results show that the enhanced RWR of LTC events usually occurs when LTCs move into regions with large environmental vertical wind shear (VWS), large surface roughness (SURR), high land surface soil temperature (SOILT), low surface latent heat flux (SLHF), and with relatively faster translational speeds (SPD). The SPD and SURR are dominant factors determining the RWR of LTCs over China mainland, contributing about 20% and 18.5% to the RWR of LTCs. VWS is also a key factor affecting RWR of LTCs with mid‐level VWS contributing 17.8% to RWR of LTCs and low‐ and deep‐level VWS contributing about 12.9% and 11.2%, respectively. Furthermore, factors affecting the LTC weakening rate in south and north China are different. In north China, the VWS at different levels are all highly correlated with LTC RWR after landfall, whereas the influence of mid‐layer VWS shows significant correlation with LTC RWR in south China. In addition, surface characteristics, including SURR, SLHF, and SOILT, have significant correlation with LTC RWR in south China. But the relationships between surface characteristics and LTC RWR in north China are not statistically significant.

However, there is still a lack of quantitative methods for analyzing the dynamics of the social‐ecological system. Here, we introduced a social‐ecological network approach incorporating supply and demand of ecosystem services (ESs) as bridges and took the Dongting Lake basin in China as the research area. From 2000 to 2020, we discovered that the number of linkages among meteorological elements and ESs supply decreased from 5 to 0. Along with this, the network density (from 26 to 22) and network connectivity (from 43 to 28) showed the decoupling trends of the social‐ecological networks. These results implied the decreasing impacts of meteorological elements and the importance of considering human activities impacts. Based on the average degree analysis of the networks, proportions of cultivated land and forest land were key for ESs supply (both around 0.900), while population density and artificial land proportion were important for the ESs demand (around 0.850 and 0.800, respectively). More management practices are required because these elements have significant impacts on the supply‐demand alignments of multiple ESs. We further illustrated the spatial supply‐demand mismatches of ESs, along with the negative effects of urbanization.

Forecasting hydroclimatic extremes holds significant importance in an era of increasing hazards such as wildfires, floods, and droughts. We evaluate the performance of five Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) seasonal forecast models (CMCC, DWD, ECCC, UK‐Met, and Météo‐France) in predicting extreme precipitation events from 1993 to 2016 using 14 indices reflecting timing and intensity (using absolute and locally defined thresholds) of precipitation at a seasonal timescale. Performance metrics, including Percent Bias, Kendall Tau Rank Correlation Score, and models' discrimination capacity, are used for skill evaluation. Our findings indicate that the performance of models varies markedly across regions and seasons. While models generally show good skill in the tropical regions, their skill in extra‐tropical regions is markedly lower. Elevated precipitation thresholds (i.e., higher intensity indices) correlate with heightened model biases, indicating deficiencies in modeling severe precipitation events. Our analysis using an impact‐based framework highlights the superior predictive capabilities of the UK‐Met and Météo‐France models in capturing the underlying processes that drive precipitation events, or lack thereof, across many regions and seasons. Other models exhibit strong performance in specific regions and/or seasons, but not globally. These results advance our understanding of an impact‐based framework in capturing a broad spectrum of extreme weather and climatic events, and inform strategic amalgamation of diverse models across different regions and seasons, thereby offering valuable insights for disaster management and risk analysis."

Here, the authors report on biaxial properties in a system of colloidal rods with designed surface anchoring doped into a chiral nematic host. 
 Biaxial nematic liquid crystals are fascinating systems sometimes referred to as the Higgs boson of soft matter because of experimental observation challenges. Here we describe unexpected states of matter that feature biaxial orientational order of colloidal supercritical fluids and gases formed by sparse rodlike particles. Colloidal rods with perpendicular surface boundary conditions exhibit a strong biaxial symmetry breaking when doped into conventional chiral nematic fluids. Minimization of free energy prompts these particles to orient perpendicular to the local molecular director and the helical axis, thereby imparting biaxiality on the hybrid molecular-colloidal system. The ensuing phase diagram features colloidal gas and liquid and supercritical colloidal fluid states with long-range biaxial orientational symmetry, as supported by analytical and numerical modeling at all hierarchical levels of ordering. Unlike for nonchiral hybrid systems, dispersions in chiral nematic hosts display biaxial orientational order at vanishing colloid volume fractions, promising both technological and fundamental research utility. The study of nematic hosts with anisotropic colloidal particles is reported, but not on the chiral counterparts.

Here, authors show it generalises across cell types and evaluate its use for genetic variant effect predictions and in complex traits. 
 Understanding how genetic variants affect the epigenome is key to interpreting GWAS, yet profiling these effects across the non-coding genome remains challenging due to experimental scalability. This necessitates accurate computational models. Existing machine learning approaches, while progressively improving, are confined to the cell types they were trained on, limiting their applicability. Here, we introduce Enformer Celltyping, a deep learning model which incorporates distal effects of DNA interactions, up to 100,000 base-pairs away, to predict epigenetic signals in previously unseen cell types. Using DNA and chromatin accessibility data for epigenetic imputation, Enformer Celltyping outperforms current best-in-class approaches and generalises across cell types and biological regions. Moreover, we propose a framework for evaluating models on genetic variant effect prediction using regulatory quantitative trait loci mapping studies, highlighting current limitations in genomic deep learning models. Despite this, Enformer Celltyping can also be used to study cell type-specific genetic enrichment of complex traits.

Here authors show that a homozygous missense variant in humans, G167R, disrupting its kinase activity upstream of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway, leads to disrupted innate and adaptive immune functions while largely sparing other major organ systems. 
 IKKα is a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase that controls various biological processes, either dependent on or independent of its kinase activity. However, the importance of the kinase function of IKKα in human physiology remains unknown since no biallelic variants disrupting its kinase activity have been reported. In this study, we present a homozygous germline missense variant in the kinase domain of IKKα, which is present in three children from two Turkish families. This variant, referred to as IKKαG167R, is in the activation segment of the kinase domain and affects the conserved (DF/LG) motif responsible for coordinating magnesium atoms for ATP binding. As a result, IKKαG167R abolishes the kinase activity of IKKα, leading to impaired activation of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway. Patients carrying IKKαG167R exhibit a range of immune system abnormalities, including the absence of secondary lymphoid organs, hypogammaglobulinemia and limited diversity of T and B cell receptors with evidence of autoreactivity. Overall, our findings indicate that, unlike a nonsense IKKα variant that results in early embryonic lethality in humans, the deficiency of IKKα‘s kinase activity is compatible with human life. However, it significantly disrupts the homeostasis of the immune system, underscoring the essential and non-redundant kinase function of IKKα in humans.

 Prostate cancer treatment resistance is a significant challenge facing the field. Genomic and transcriptomic profiling have partially elucidated the mechanisms through which cancer cells escape treatment, but their relation toward the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains elusive. Here we present a comprehensive transcriptomic landscape of the prostate TME at multiple points in the standard treatment timeline employing single-cell RNA-sequencing and spatial transcriptomics data from 120 patients. We identify club-like cells as a key epithelial cell subtype that acts as an interface between the prostate and the immune system. Tissue areas enriched with club-like cells have depleted androgen signaling and upregulated expression of luminal progenitor cell markers. Club-like cells display a senescence-associated secretory phenotype and their presence is linked to increased polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cell (PMN-MDSC) activity. Our results indicate that club-like cells are associated with myeloid inflammation previously linked to androgen deprivation therapy resistance, providing a rationale for their therapeutic targeting.

Here, the authors show that the quantum geometry associated with excitons can generate detectable shift currents in a wide-gap semiconductor. 
 Excitons are fundamental quasiparticles that are ubiquitous in photoexcited semiconductors and insulators. Despite causing a sharp and strong photoabsorption near the interband absorption edge, charge-neutral excitons do not yield photocurrent in conventional photovoltaic processes unless dissociated into free charge carriers. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that excitons can directly contribute to photocurrent generation through a nonlinear light−matter interaction in a noncentrosymmetric semiconductor CuI. Epitaxial thin films of CuI exhibit a substantial enhancement of photocurrent at exciton resonance energies even below the bandgap. From the light polarization dependence, this photocurrent is identified to be shift current, a nonlinear photocurrent driven by the change in the geometric Berry phase of electron wave functions upon the optical transition. The shift current at the exciton resonance is much larger than that induced above the band gap by free electron−hole excitation, and their signs are opposite. First-principles calculations elucidate that the sign and magnitude of the exciton shift current are strongly dependent on the strain in the thin film. The present study reveals the crucial role of excitons in enhancing the shift current magnitude and its strain sensitivity, and will open an unprecedented route for efficient manipulation of nonlinear optical effects.

 Deep-sea coral frameworks are understudied in the Red Sea, where conditions in the deep are conspicuously warm and saline compared to other basins. Habitat suitability models can be used to predict the distribution pattern of species or assemblages where direct observation is difficult. Here we show how coral frameworks, built by species within the families Caryophylliidae and Dendrophylliidae, are distributed between water depths of 150 m and 700 m in the northern Red Sea and Gulf of Aqaba. To extrapolate the known (ground-truthed) positions of these deep frameworks, we use environmental and geomorphometric variables to inform well-performing maximum entropy models. Over 250 km2 of seafloor in our study area are identified as suitable for such frameworks, equivalent to at least 35% of the area of photic-zone coral reefs in the same region.

 Soil moisture (SM) is a key variable in hydrometeorology and climate systems. With the growing interest in capturing fine-scale SM variability for effective hydroclimate applications, spaceborne L-band bistatic radar systems using Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) technology hold great potential to meet the demand for high spatiotemporal resolution SM data. Although primarily designed for tropical cyclone monitoring purposes, the first GNSS-R satellite constellation – Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) mission, has demonstrated the benefits of reliably monitoring diurnal SM dynamics through its initial stage of seven-year data record, thanks to its high revisit frequency at sub-daily intervals. Nevertheless, knowledge of SM retrieval from CYGNSS, particularly linked with its distinctive features, remains poorly understood, while numerous existing uncertainties and open issues can restrict its effective SM retrieval and practical applications in the next operating stages. Unlike other review papers, this work aims to bridge this knowledge gap in CYGNSS SM retrieval by highlighting noteworthy design properties based on analyses of its real-world data, while providing a synthesis of recent advances in eliminating external uncertainty factors and improving SM inversion methods.Despite its potential, CYGNSS SM retrieval faces both general and particular challenges arising from common issues in retrieval algorithms for conventional GNSS-R satellites and unique data limitations tied to its technical design. Scientific debates over the contributions of coherent and incoherent components in total CYGNSS signals and accurate partitioning of these two parts are defined as the key algorithm-related challenges to resolve, along with correcting attenuation effects of vegetation and surface roughness. The data-related challenges involve variations in CYGNSS's spatial footprint, temporal frequency, and signal penetration depth across different land surface conditions, inadequate consideration of CYGNSS incidence angle change, excessive dependence on a reference SM dataset for inversion model calibration/training or validation, and computational demands for processing rapid multi-sampling CYGNSS data retrieval. Future research pathways highlight leveraging cutting-edge machine learning/deep learning algorithms to enhance CYGNSS SM data quantity and quality and better interpret its complex interactions with other hydroclimate variables. Assimilating CYGNSS SM data streams into physical models to improve the prediction of related variables and climate extremes also presents a promising prospect."

 With the rapid advancement of remote sensing technology, the recognition of agricultural field parcels using time-series remote sensing images has become an increasingly emphasized task. In this paper, we focus on identifying crops within scattered, irregular, and poorly defined agricultural fields in many Asian regions. We select two representative locations with small and scattered parcels and construct two new time-series remote sensing datasets (JM dataset and CF dataset). We propose a novel deep learning model DBL, the Dual-Branch Model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), which utilizes main branch and supplementary branch to accomplish accurate crop-type mapping. The main branch is designed for capturing global receptive field and the supplementary is designed for temporal and spatial feature refinement. The experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the DBL compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. The results indicate that the DBL model performs exceptionally well on both datasets.

 Near-infrared reflectance of vegetation multiplied by incoming sunlight (NIRvP) is important for gross primary production (GPP) estimation. While NIRvP is a useful indicator of canopy structure and solar radiation, its association with heat or moisture stress is not fully understood. Thus, this research aimed to explore the impact of air temperature (Ta) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) on the NIRvP-GPP relationship. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations, eddy-covariance measurements, and the Parameter–Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) data, we found that NIRvP cannot fully explain the response of plant photosynthesis to Ta and VPD at both seasonal and daily scales. Therefore, we incorporated a polynomial function of Ta and an exponential function of VPD to correct its seasonal response to stress and calibrated the GPP residual via a linear function of Ta and VPD time-varying derivatives to account for its daily response to stress. Leave-one-site-out cross-validation suggested that the improvements relative to its original version were especially noteworthy under stress conditions while less significant when there was no water or heat stress across grasslands and croplands. When compared to six other GPP models, the enhanced NIRvP model consistently outperformed them or performed comparably with the best model in terms of bias, RSME, and coefficient of determinant against measurements in grasslands and croplands. Moreover, we found that parameterizing the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation term using NIRv notably improved the performance of the classic MOD17 and vegetation photosynthesis model, with an average RMSE reduction of 13 % across grasslands and croplands. Overall, this study highlights the need to consider environmental stressors for improved NIRvP-based GPP and shed light on future improvements of LUE models."

 In the first part of this paper series (Sun et al., 2023), we developed an ecological model that partitions the total chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) into three phytoplankton size classes (PSCs), pico-, nano-, and microplankton. The parameters of this model are controlled by sea surface temperature (SST), intended to capture shifts in phytoplankton size structure independently of variations in total Chl-a. In this second part of the series, we present an Ocean Colour Modelling Framework (OCMF), building on the classical Case-1 assumption, that explicitly incorporates our ecological model. The OCMF assumes the presence of the three PSCs and the existence of an independent background of non-algal particles. The framework assumes each phytoplankton group resides in a distinct optical environment, assigning chlorophyll-specific inherent optical properties to each group, both directly (phytoplankton) and indirectly (non-algal particulate and dissolved substances). The OCMF is parameterised, validated, and assessed using a large global dataset of inherent and apparent optical properties. We use the OCMF to explore the influence of variations in temperature and Chl-a on phytoplankton size structure and its resulting effects on ocean colour. We also discuss applications of the OCMF, such as its potential for inverse modelling and phytoplankton climate trend detection, which will be explored further in subsequent papers."

 Satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is inevitably contaminated by clouds and aerosols, causing large uncertainties in depicting the seasonal and interannual variations of terrestrial ecosystems, and potentially misrepresents their responses to climate change and climate extremes. Although various methods have been developed to reconstruct NDVI time series using the similarity in time, space or their combination, they typically require known and accurate data quality information. It is still challenging to effectively reconstruct high-quality NDVI from Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies-3rd Generation V1.2 (GIMMS-3g+), which is one of the longest observation records but lacks reliable data quality information. This study introduces an adaptive spatiotemporal tensor reconstruction algorithm that leverages the spatial and temporal patterns of vegetation to produce high-quality long-term NDVI datasets without the need of data quality information. The reconstruction process employs two different tensor completion models to satisfy the low-rank constraints. These two models can effectively remove the high-frequency noises originating from atmospheric contamination, while preserving the abrupt or low-frequency changes attributable to disturbances such as drought, even in the absence of data quality information. The resultant NDVI shows good consistency with observations from geostationary satellites. Regions that show a strong correlation (r > 0.7) with geostationary satellite NDVI increased from 46.7 % (original GIMMS-3g+) to 62.2 % and 62.3 % (two reconstructions results) for East Asia, and from 41.4 % to 58.0 % and 59.0 % for Amazon. Our method also demonstrates superior performance to traditional methods such as Whittaker, HANTS, SG-filter, and comparable performance with the state-of-the-art ST-Tensor method when the fraction of contaminated observations is low. The proposed method can also be applied to other datasets such as EVI, LAI, etc., without additional data quality inputs. The resultant vegetation index dataset has the potential to improve plant phenology retrievals and evaluation of ecosystem responses to extremes."

 In remote sensing mapping studies, selecting an appropriate test set to accurately evaluate the results is critical. An imprecise accuracy assessment can be misleading and fail to validate the applicability of mapping products. Commencing with the WHU-Hi-HanChuan dataset, this paper revealed the impact of sample size ratios in test sets on accuracy metrics by generating a series of test sets with varying ratios of positive and negative sample size to evaluate the same map. A rigorous approach for accuracy assessment was suggested, and an example of tea plantations mapping is used to demonstrate the process and analyse potential issues in traditional approaches. A scale factor (λ) was constructed to measure the discrepancy in sample size ratios between test sets and actual conditions. Accuracy adjustment formulas were developed and applied to adjust the accuracy of 42 previous maps based on the λ. Results showed a higher ratio of positive to negative sample size in test set led to inflated user’s accuracy (UA), F1-score (F1) and overall accuracy (OA), but had little impact on producer’s accuracy. When the ratio aligned with that in the target area, the UA, F1, and OA closely matched the true values, indicating the proportion of positive and negative samples in test set should be consistent with that in actual situation. The accuracies reported by the traditional approaches including test set sampling from labelled data and 5-fold cross validation were far from the true accuracy and could not reflect the performance of the map. Among 42 previous maps, nearly 60% of the maps had UAs overestimated by 10%, and 9.5% of the maps had UAs and F1s deviations of more than 25%.

 The heterogeneity and complexity of multimodal data in high-resolution remote sensing images significantly challenges existing cross-modal networks in fusing the complementary information of high-resolution optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images for precise semantic segmentation. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) dominated gate fusion network (MGFNet). MGFNet consists of three modules: a multi-path feature extraction network, an MLP-gate fusion (MGF) module, and a decoder. Initially, MGFNet independently extracts features from high-resolution optical and SAR images while preserving spatial information. Then, the well-designed MGF module combines the multi-modal features through channel attention and gated fusion stages, utilizing MLP as a gate to exploit complementary information and filter redundant data. Additionally, we introduce a novel high-resolution multimodal remote sensing dataset, YESeg-OPT-SAR, with a spatial resolution of 0.5 m. To evaluate MGFNet, we compare it with several state-of-the-art (SOTA) models using YESeg-OPT-SAR and Pohang datasets, both of which are high-resolution multi-modal datasets.

 This study investigates the reconstruction of climatological patterns and vegetation dynamics in the Horn of Africa region using high temporal resolution (i.e. daily) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets. The analysis compares a straight-forward processing approach to derive a daily vegetation index from a geostationary (SEVIRI) satellite with existing NDVI series from geostationary or polar-orbiting (MODIS, MetOp-AVHRR) satellites, highlighting the impact of cloud contamination on data quality in high temporal resolution datasets. Using a smoothing process designed to reconstruct the upper envelope of the vegetation status series, we obtained a daily vegetation dataset that effectively mitigated cloud-induced fluctuations, outperforming polar-orbiting (e.g. MODIS) satellite-derived dataset in capturing regional climatology. We demonstrated this through statistical analysis, including autocorrelation and mean absolute difference between consecutive observations. We showed that cloud contamination significantly affects high temporal resolution NDVI series, particularly in forest areas, which makes it difficult to identify a suitable dataset to validate our approach. Therefore, we mitigated this problem using a Maximum Value Compositing technique, designed to remove cloud-induced biases and further compared our results with another independent vegetation index at coarser temporal resolution derived from AVHRR. We found that our vegetation index closely relates with MODIS 10-day composites after removing cloud-contaminated pixels. Furthermore, the study evaluates the sensitivity of the selected NDVI datasets to drought events, demonstrating the strength of the proposed SEVIRI dataset in capturing the intensity and persistence of vegetation anomalies. In conclusion, the study presents an innovative strategy for deriving daily-resolution NDVI datasets in cloud-prone regions, validating it with independent datasets at different sub-monthly temporal scales."

 Impervious surfaces are important indicators of human activity, and finding ways to quantify the gain and loss of impervious surfaces is important for sustainable urban development. However, most relevant studies assume that the transformation of natural surfaces to impervious surfaces is irreversible; thus, the losses of impervious surfaces are often ignored. Here, we propose a novel framework taking advantage of continuous change detection, multitemporal classification, and LandTrendr optimization to track the annual gains and losses in impervious surfaces. It may be the first study to focus on both loss and gain of impervious surfaces using time-series Landsat imagery. Specifically, we built dual continuous-change-detection models to pursue lower commission and omission errors for generating time-series training samples. Then, we adopted time-series classifications from multisource information and derived training samples to develop annual impervious-surface maps from 1985 to 2022 in Beijing. Afterwards, a novel optimization algorithm considering spatial heterogeneity and taking advantage of the LandTrendr algorithm was also proposed to optimize the spatiotemporal consistency of these impervious-surface maps. We further calculated accuracy metrics for the proposed method using time-series validation points, finding overall accuracies of 92.91 %±0.97 % and 93.17 %±1.26 % for gains and losses in impervious surfaces, respectively, using a one-year tolerance. Lastly, we revealed the gains and losses of impervious surfaces in Beijing during 1985–2022. The gained area of impervious surfaces was found to be 1996.21 km2 ± 18.58 km2, and there was a rapid increase during 2000–2010; the total lost area of impervious surfaces was 898.60 km2 ± 4.58 km2, of which 564.85 km2 ± 2.21 km2 first increased and was then lost. Therefore, the proposed method provides a new way of tracking the gain and loss of impervious surfaces, and it offers new possibilities for monitoring urban regreening."

 With advances in data collection technology, the volume of recent remote sensing point cloud datasets has grown significantly, posing substantial challenges for point cloud deep learning, particularly in neighborhood aggregation operations. Unlike simple pooling, neighborhood aggregation incorporates spatial relationships between points into the feature aggregation process, requiring repeated relationship learning and resulting in substantial computational redundancy. The exponential increase in data volume exacerbates this issue. To address this, we theoretically demonstrate that if basic spatial information is encoded in point features, simple pooling operations can effectively aggregate features. This means the spatial relationships can be extracted and integrated with other features during aggregation. Based on this concept, we propose a lightweight point network called DeLA (Decoupled Local Aggregation). DeLA separates the traditional neighborhood aggregation process into distinct spatial encoding and local aggregation operations, reducing the computational complexity by a factor of K, where K is the number of neighbors in the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm (K-NN). Experimental results on five classic benchmarks show that DeLA achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced or equivalent latency. Specifically, DeLA exceeds 90% overall accuracy on ScanObjectNN and 74% mIoU on S3DIS Area 5. Additionally, DeLA achieves state-of-the-art results on ScanNetV2 with only 20% of the parameters of equivalent models. Our code is available at https://github.com/Matrix-ASC/DeLA."

 The Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) mission, spanning the past five years, has collected extensive three-dimensional Earth observation data, facilitating the understanding of environmental changes on a global scale. Its key product, Land and Vegetation Height (ATL08), offers global land and vegetation height data for carbon budget and cycle modeling. Consistent measurement accuracy of ATL08 is crucial for reliable time series analysis. However, fluctuations in the temporal accuracy of ATL08 data have been ignored in previous studies, leading to unknown uncertainties in existing time-series analyses. To bridge the knowledge gap, this study analyzes 59 months of ATL08 version 006 data in Finland to assess terrain and surface height accuracy, with a focus on temporal fluctuations across six major land cover types. A random forest (RF) model is employed to quantify the relative importance of error factors affecting height accuracy. Moreover, the study assesses accuracy at two official spatial resolutions, i.e., 100 m × 11 m and 20 m × 11 m, to evaluate the capability of ATL08 for the high-resolution height retrieval. For the terrain, the 100 m segment shows a bias of 0.04 m, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.44 m, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.66 m, while the 20 m segment exhibits a bias of 0.10 m, a MAE of 0.35 m, and an RMSE of 0.49 m. For the surface height, the 100 m segment shows a bias of −0.59 m, a MAE of 3.06 m, an RMSE of 4.52 m, a bias% of −3.45 %, a MAE% of 21.26 %, and an RMSE% of 31.40 %. The 20 m segment exhibits a bias of −0.72 m, a MAE of 3.51 m, an RMSE of 5.23 m, a bias% of −5.81 %, a MAE% of 28.52 %, and an RMSE% of 42.47 %. The results indicate that improving segment resolution enhances terrain accuracy but reduces surface height accuracy. According to the error factor analysis, surface coverage and beam type are crucial for terrain retrieval accuracy, with their effects varying over time. Seasonal changes, particularly the presence of snow, affect terrain retrieval accuracy, with the lowest accuracy observed around March each year. This study confirms the critical impact of surface height on its retrieval accuracy and suggests avoiding the use of ATL08 for retrieving low target surface heights, especially in steep terrains. Nevertheless, the analysis affirms the applicability of ATL08 for canopy height estimation in boreal forests, primarily composed of coniferous species, highlighting its potential for extensive spatial and temporal research. This contributes to bridging the gaps between accurate estimates and large area coverage in global carbon budget and cycle studies. Additionally, the findings reveal that similar issues may exist in other satellite laser altimetry missions, emphasizing the important impacts of temporal fluctuations in surface and terrain accuracy when utilizing satellite laser altimetry datasets."

 Plant foliage is known to respond rapidly to environmental stressors by adjusting leaf orientation at different timescales. One of the most fascinating mechanisms is paraheliotropism, also known as light avoidance through leaf movement. The leaf orientation (zenith and azimuth angles) is a parameter often overlooked in the plant and remote sensing community due to its challenging measurement procedures under field conditions. In this study, we investigate the synergistic potential of uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV)-based mutlispectral imaging, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and radiative transfer model (RTM) inversion to identify the paraheliotropic response of two distinct soybean varieties: Minngold, a chlorophyll-deficient mutant, and Eiko, a wild variety. We examined their responses to drought stress during the boreal summer drought in 2022 in western Germany by measuring average leaf inclination angle (ALIA) and canopy reflectance. Measurements were taken in the morning and at midday to track leaf movement. Our observations show significant differences between the paraheliotropic response of both varieties. Eiko’s terminal and lateral leaves became vertically erect in the midday (54→61∘), while Minngold’s ALIA remained largely unchanged (52→57∘). Apart from the vertical leaf movement, we also observed leaf inversion (exposing the abaxial side of the leaf) in Eiko under extreme water scarcity. The red edge band at 740 nm showed the strongest correlation with ALIA (r2=0.52−0.76) The ratio of the far red edge to near infrared (RE740/NIR842) vegetation index compensated for varying light levels during morning and afternoon measurements, exhibiting strong correlations with ALIA when considering only sun-lit leaf spectra (r2=0.72). The retrieval of ALIA with PROSAIL varied based on ALIA constraints and the spectra used for retrieval (full spectrum or the combination of bands 742 and 842), resulting in a root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.7-12.9°. PROSAIL faced challenges in simulating the spectra of plots with very low LAI due to the soil background. This study made the first attempt to observe different paraheliotropic responses of two soybean varieties with UAV-based multispectral imaging. Proximal sensing opens up the possibilities to observe early stress indicators such as paraheliotropism, at much higher spatial and temporal resolution than ever before."

 Wood combustion was the key heating source in Greece during the first years at the beginning of the financial crisis. Signals of 137Cs were detected in Thessaloniki during the winter of 2013–2014 on weekends and holidays when the residents were at home burning the biggest amount of wood all day. 137Cs signals were >6–21 μBq m−3 detected using high-volume air filters and γ-spectrometry. No signals have been detected since then, as gas has replaced oil for residential heating, reducing forest wood. Besides, signal <6 μBq m−3 is undetectable because this is the minimum detectable activity. 40K concentrations were also measured, revealing a constant value of 143 ± 16 μBq m−3. The Cs-to-K ratio in air was 0.04–0.14 compared to 0.05 ± 0.01 measured before and after. Higher levels were measured when the air temperature was the lowest, but no correlation was observed with wind or pressure. Simulations using the HYSLIT model were applied on the dates on which the ratio was the highest. The model confirms the experimental results observed. 137Cs signals detected and related to the Chernobyl-contaminated biomass used for central heating indicate that contaminated forest ecosystems remain a source of unwanted radioactivity in the environment."

 This study presents a comprehensive 5-year period assessment of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Å ngströn Exponent (AE) data from a hand-held Calitoo sun photometer on board the Ángeles Alvariño research vessel. Observations spanned March 2018 to September 2023, focusing on key maritime regions such as the Canary Islands, coasts of North Africa, the Mediterranean, Portugal, the Cantabrian, and the Bay of Biscay. The Calitoo device measures solar irradiance at three wavelengths (465, 540, and 619 nm). Uncertainty analysis for Calitoo AOD retrievals was performed using the Monte Carlo method, yielding an expanded uncertainty (UAOD) ranging between 0.008 and 0.050 with a mean and standard deviation of 0.032 ± 0.008 for the three wavelengths. Our results also highlight the remarkable calibration stability of the Calitoo (< 2.6%) over this 5-year period. Calitoo AOD values were assessed using reference AOD data from Santa Cruz de Tenerife (the Canary Islands), El Arenosillo (Huelva), and Palma de Mallorca (the Balearic Islands) AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) stations. The comparison revealed a good agreement with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.727 to 0.917 and mean bias ranging from -0.030 to -0.001. Additionally, the Calitoo AOD data were compared with MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and CAMS-ECMWF (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service-European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) aerosol products obtaining that Calitoo AOD values were generally lower, showing negative mean bias of -0.063 and -0.024, respectively.The aerosol characterizations using AE vs. AOD plots in the three maritime study regions using 5-years of non-routine Calitoo data are similar to the corresponding aerosol characterizations performed with simultaneous AERONET-Cimel data.These findings underscore Calitoo’s reliability for aerosol studies in regions where AERONET instruments or other aerosol networks are unavailable. Likewise, given the low cost of Calitoo photometers, they could be deployed onboard a large number of merchant and passenger ships or in other remote or under-monitored areas, providing near real-time AOD/AE data to enhance our understanding of aerosols processes or for model or satellite assimilation/validation."

 Online detection of cloud water chemistry is a pressing issue in atmospheric outfield observation, with online detection modules representing a significant development direction for cloud water observation. Addressing the common problem of time-delayed errors in manual detection, particularly in the context of cloud water acidity, has remained challenging, with limited understanding and effective solutions available. We developed an Online Cloud Fog Monitor (OCFM) featuring automatic pH and electrical conductivity (EC) detection capabilities, and conducted comprehensive laboratory and field tests. The OCFM utilizes a peristaltic pump, water pipe, and diversion chamber to direct cloud samples to distinct detection chambers, enabling real-time analysis. The diversion chamber is equipped with dual liquid level sensors to segregate and preserve samples once the volume exceeds a predetermined threshold. Calibration results indicate that the instrument's background metal elements do not affect cloud water analysis, and detection occurs within the designed response time. Field tests demonstrate that the OCFM can collect over 50 ml of cloud water, with a response accuracy exceeding 63.6%, though influenced by meteorological conditions. The time-delay error for pH was notably larger than for EC. Comparative analysis with the Caltech Active Strand Cloudwater Collector (CASCC) revealed that the OCFM's sampling process does not introduce errors, and the online detection accuracy of pH and EC is comparable to manual methods. Additionally, water-soluble ions in samples collected by the OCFM showed no significant differences compared to those collected by CASCC. Overall, the OCFM effectively replaces manual testing, mitigating time-delay errors in chemical property testing. The introduction of this cloud water detector promises to significantly reduce labor costs and economic consumption associated with cloud water observation, thereby facilitating long-term, multi-site observation of cloud water chemistry."

 Secondary ice production (SIP) is a crucial phenomenon for explaining the formation of ice crystal clouds, especially when addressing the discrepancies between observed ice crystal number concentrations and ice nucleating particles (INPs). In this study, we investigate parameterizations of three SIP processes (Hallett-Mossop, fragmentation of freezing drops, and fragmentation due to ice–ice collision) by simulating a deep convective cloud observed during the HAIC/HIWC campaign with the 3D bin microphysics scheme DESCAM (DEtailed SCAvening and Microphysics model). The simulated mean cloud properties, including particle size distributions and ice crystal number concentration are compared with in situ probe observations obtained during the campaign. Simulation excluding SIP shows a large underestimation of small ice crystals (< 1 mm diameter) for temperatures warmer than ‐30∘C. In our results, incorporating Hallett-Mossop and fragmentation due to ice–ice collision processes leads to ice crystal number concentrations close to observed values, thereby reducing discrepancies by two orders of magnitude. Our simulations also indicates that fragmentation of freezing drops affect minimally the properties of the cloud at its mature stage. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of fragments sizes resulting from SIP processes and show that the size of fragments generated from fragmentation due to ice–ice collision significantly influences the shape of ice particle size distribution. Employing various parameterizations of the ice crystal sticking efficiency reveals a notable impact on cloud properties. This study shows that SIP mechanisms are important and have to be considered for cold and mixed-phase clouds. However their parameterization lack reliability, highlighting the need for better quantifying these mechanisms. The companion paper, investigates the effects of SIP processes on the formation and the evolution of the deep convective system."
