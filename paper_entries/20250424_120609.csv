Williams;Bjørn H. Samset,Surface temperature effects of recent reductions in shipping SO2 emissions are within internal variability,"In 2020, regulations by the International Maritime Organization aimed to reduce aerosol emissions from ships. These aerosols previously had a cooling effect, which the regulations might reduce, revealing more greenhouse gas warming. Here we find that, while there is regional warming, the global 2020–2040 temperature rise is only +0.03 °C. This small change is difficult to distinguish from natural climate variability, indicating the regulations have had a limited effect on observed warming to date. 
 In 2020, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) implemented strict new regulations on the emissions of sulfate aerosol from the world's shipping fleet. This can be expected to lead to a reduction in aerosol-driven cooling, unmasking a portion of greenhouse gas warming. The magnitude of the effect is uncertain, however, due to the large remaining uncertainties in the climate response to aerosols. Here, we investigate this question using an 18-member ensemble of fully coupled climate simulations evenly sampling key modes of climate variability with the NCAR model, the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2). We show that, while there is a clear physical response of the climate system to the IMO regulations, including a surface temperature increase, we do not find global mean temperature influence that is significantly different from zero. The 20-year average global mean warming for 2020–2040 is +0.03 °C, with a 5 %–95 % confidence range of [-0.09,0.19], reflecting the weakness of the perturbation relative to internal variability. We do, however, find a robust, non-zero regional temperature response in part of the North Atlantic. We also find that the maximum annual mean and ensemble mean warming occurs around 1 decade after the perturbation in 2029, which means that the IMO regulations have likely had very limited influence on observed global warming to date. We further discuss our results in light of other, recent publications that have reached different conclusions. Overall, while the IMO regulations may contribute up to 0.16 °C [-0.17,0.52] to the global mean surface temperature in individual years during this decade, consistent with some early studies, such a response is unlikely to have been discernible above internal variability by the end of 2023 and is in fact consistent with zero throughout the 2020–2040 period."
10.5194/acp-25-4419-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该论文主要研究破碎云层下地表太阳辐射变化的机制。虽然太阳辐射与大气环境相关，但该研究的重点在于云的物理特性和辐射传输过程，而非大气成分分析、空气质量监测或卫星观测等遥感技术。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强，主要集中在云和辐射的相互作用。,"['solar irradiance', 'cloud radiative effects', 'radiative transfer', 'cloud optical properties']",Wouter Mol;Chiel van Heerwaarden,Mechanisms of surface solar irradiance variability under broken clouds,"Sunlight varies often and quickly under broken cloud cover, and every cloud field creates a unique pattern of sunlight on the surface below. These variations affect many processes in the Earth system, from photosynthesis and chemistry to cloud formation itself. The exact way in which cloud particles interact with sunlight is complex and expensive to calculate. We demonstrate a simplified framework which explains how sunlight changes for potentially any cloud field. 
 Surface solar irradiance variability is present under all broken clouds, but the patterns, magnitude of variability, and driving mechanisms vary greatly with cloud type. In this study, we performed numerical experiments to understand which main mechanisms drive surface solar irradiance (SSI) variations across a diverse set of observation-based cloud conditions. The results show that four mechanisms capture the essence. We find that for optically thin (τ<6) clouds, scattering in the forward direction (forward escape) dominates. In cloud fields with enough optically thin area, such as altocumulus, forward escape alone can drive areas of irradiance enhancement of over 50 % of clear-sky irradiance. For flat, optically thick clouds (τ>6), irradiance is instead scattered diffusely downward (downward escape), and (extreme) enhancements are thus found directly below the cloud. For vertically structured clouds, side escape dominates the domain-averaged diffuse irradiance enhancement  until the sides become shaded by anvil clouds. Lastly, under optically thick cloud cover, surface albedo enhances radiative fluxes due to multiple scatterings between surface and cloud. This brightens shadows and contributes 10 % to 60 % of the total irradiance enhancement for low (0.2) to high (0.8) albedo. With these four mechanisms, we provide a framework for understanding the vast diversity and complexity found in surface solar irradiance and cloudiness. A next step is to apply this analysis to multi-layered cloud fields and non-isolated deep convective clouds."

By comparing two different chemistry modeling schemes, we found that including complex chemical reactions leads to a more accurate prediction of how long SO2 stays in the atmosphere. This research helps improve our understanding of volcanic pollution and its impact on air quality and climate, providing better tools for scientists to track and predict the movement of these pollutants. 
 Lagrangian transport models are important tools to study the sources, spread, and lifetime of air pollutants. In order to simulate the transport of reactive atmospheric pollutants, the implementation of efficient chemistry and mixing schemes is necessary to properly represent the lifetime of chemical species. Based on a case study simulating the long-range transport of volcanic sulfur dioxide (SO2) for the 2019 Raikoke eruption, this study compares two chemistry schemes implemented in the Massive-Parallel Trajectory Calculations (MPTRAC) Lagrangian transport model. The explicit scheme represents first-order and pseudo-first-order loss processes of SO2 based on prescribed reaction rates and climatological oxidant fields, i.e., the hydroxyl radical in the gas phase and hydrogen peroxide in the aqueous phase. Furthermore, an implicit scheme with a reduced chemistry mechanism for volcanic SO2 decomposition has been implemented, targeting the upper-troposphere–lower-stratosphere (UT–LS) region. Considering nonlinear effects of the volcanic SO2 chemistry in the UT–LS region, we found that the implicit solution yields a better representation of the volcanic SO2 lifetime, while the first-order explicit solution has better computational efficiency. By analyzing the dependence between the oxidants and SO2 concentrations, correction formulas are derived to adjust the oxidant fields used in the explicit solution, leading to a good trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy. We consider this work to be an important step forward to support future research on emission source reconstruction involving nonlinear chemical processes."

D. Campos;Yang Yang;Xu Yue;Hong Liao,Revisiting the high tropospheric ozone over southern Africa: role of biomass burning and anthropogenic emissions,"The impacts of biomass burning and anthropogenic emissions on high tropospheric ozone levels are not well studied in southern Africa. We combined model simulations with recent observations at the surface and from space to quantify tropospheric ozone and its drivers in southern Africa. Our work focuses on the impact of emissions from different sources at different spatial scales, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of air pollution drivers and their uncertainties in southern Africa. 
 Tropospheric ozone over southern Africa is particularly high and causes tremendous health risks and crop yield losses. It has been previously attributed to the influence by biomass burning (BB), with a neglected contribution from anthropogenic emissions. However, due to the lack of measurements for ozone and its precursors, the modeled impacts of BB and anthropogenic emissions on tropospheric ozone levels in southern Africa were not well evaluated. In this study, we combined the nested GEOS-Chem simulation with a horizontal resolution of 0.5°×0.625° with available multiple observations at the surface and from space to quantify tropospheric ozone and its main drivers in southern Africa. Firstly, BB emissions from current different inventories exhibit similar peaks in the summer season but also have large uncertainties in southern Africa (e.g., uncertainty of a factor of 2–3 in emitted NOx). The model–satellite comparison in the fire season (July–August) in 2019 shows that using the widely used Global Fire Emissions Database version 4.1 (GFED4.1) inventory, the model tends to overestimate by 87 % compared to OMI NO2, while the Quick Fire Emissions Dataset (QFED2) inventory can greatly reduce this model bias to only 34 %. Consequently, the modeled tropospheric column ozone (TCO) bias was reduced from 14 % by GFED4.1 to 2.3 % by QFED2. In addition, the QFED2 also has a much better spatial representativeness than GFED4.1. The simulated surface daily maximum 8 h mean (MDA8) ozone was decreased from 74 ppb by GFED4.1 to only 56 ppb by QFED2. This suggests a highly overestimated role of BB emissions in surface ozone if GFED4.1 is adopted. The model–observation comparison at the surface shows that the global Community Emissions Data System (CEDSv2) anthropogenic inventory tends to underestimate anthropogenic NOx emissions in typical southern African cities and likely misrepresented anthropogenic sources in some areas. That means that urban ozone and PM2.5 concentrations in southern Africa may be strongly underestimated. For example, a 10-fold increase in anthropogenic NOx emissions can change the ozone chemistry regime and increase PM2.5 by up to 50 µg m−3 at the city of Luanda.  Furthermore, we also find that TROPOMI can already capture the urban NO2 column hotspots over low-emission regions like southern Africa, while this is unavailable from the OMI instrument, highlighting the critical role of high-resolution measurements in understanding atmospheric chemistry issues over southern Africa. Our study presents a deeper understanding of the key emission sources and their impacts over southern Africa that will be helpful not only to formulate targeted pollution controls, but also to enhance the capability to predict future air quality and climate change, which would be beneficial for achieving a healthy, climate-friendly, and resilient development in Africa."

Pimlott;Richard J. Pope;Brian J. Kerridge;Richard Siddans;Barry G. Latter;Lucy J. Ventress;Wuhu Feng;Martyn P. Chipperfield,Large reductions in satellite-derived and modelled European lower-tropospheric ozone during and  after the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2022),"Globally, lockdowns were implemented to limit the spread of COVID-19, leading to a decrease in emissions of key air pollutants. Here, we use novel satellite data and a chemistry model to investigate the impact of the pandemic on tropospheric ozone (O3), a key pollutant, in 2020. Overall, we found substantial decreases of up to 20 %, two-thirds of which came from emission reductions, while one-third was due to a decrease in the stratospheric O3 flux into the troposphere. 
 Activity restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic caused large-scale reductions in ozone (O3) precursor emissions, which in turn substantially reduced the abundance of tropospheric O3 in the Northern Hemisphere. Satellite records of lower-tropospheric column O3 (0–6 km) from the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) highlight these large reductions in O3 during the COVID-19 period (2020), which persisted into 2021 and 2022. The European domain average O3 reduction ranged between 2.0 and 3.0 DU (where DU denotes Dobson units) (11.0 %–14.6 %). These satellite results were supported by the TOMCAT chemical transport model (CTM) through several model sensitivity experiments to account for changes in emissions and the impact of the meteorological conditions in 2020. Here, the business-as-usual (BAU) emissions were scaled by activity data (i.e. anonymized mobility data from big tech companies) to account for the reduction in O3 precursor emissions. The model simulated large O3 reductions (2.0–3.0 DU), similar to the satellite records, where approximately 66 % and 34 % of the O3 loss can be explained by emission changes and meteorological conditions, respectively. Our results also show that the reduced flux of stratospheric O3 into the troposphere accounted for a substantial component of the meteorological signal in the overall lower-tropospheric O3 levels during the COVID-19 period."

Wilson;Michael J. Prather,"Gridded surface O3, NOx, and CO abundances for model metrics from the South Korean ground station network","We evaluated how well we can infer air pollutant levels (ozone, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides) between air quality stations throughout South Korea, finding good representation in most densely measured cities in spite of intense small-scale emission hotspots. Comparing observed air quality with gridded model output is desirable, and so we created gridded datasets over South Korea using air quality station measurements, which agreed with airborne measurements around Seoul. 
 We present gridded surface air quality datasets over South Korea for three key species – ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) – during the time frame of the Korea–US Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) mission (May–June 2016). Mixing ratios for the key species were mapped to 0.1° × 0.1° grid cells (hourly resolution), which were constructed from the 300+ air quality network sites using inverse distance weighting with simple declustering. Cross-comparing the interpolated fields against the site data that were used to create them reveals high prediction skill for O3 (80 %) throughout South Korea and moderate skill (60 %) for CO and NOx on average in densely observed regions after individual mean bias corrections. The gridded O3 and CO interpolations predict the NASA DC-8 observations in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) with high skill (80 %) in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) after subtracting the mean bias. DC-8 NOx observations were much less predictable on account of consistently negative vertical gradients within the PBL. Our gridded products capture the mean of and variability in O3 throughout South Korea and the mean of and variability in CO and surface NOx in most site-dense urban centres (SMA, Cheongju, Gwangju, Daegu, Changwon, and Busan)."

It then compares three different ensemble analysis methods that combine radar-based precipitation estimates with forecasts from an ensemble numerical weather prediction model. 
 Reliable estimation of precipitation fields at high resolution is a key issue for snow cover modelling in mountainous areas, where the density of precipitation networks is far too low to capture the complex variability of these fields with topography. Adequate quantification of the remaining uncertainty in precipitation estimates is also necessary for further assimilation of complementary snow observations in snow models. Radar observations provide spatialised estimates of precipitation with high spatial and temporal resolution and are often combined with rain gauge observations to improve the accuracy of the estimate. However, radar measurements suffer from significant shortcomings in mountainous areas (in particular, unrealistic spatial patterns due to ground clutter, leading to local systematic biases). Precipitation fields simulated by high-resolution numerical weather prediction (NWP) models provide an alternative estimate but suffer from widespread systematic biases and positioning errors. Even though these uncertainties can be partially described by ensemble NWP systems and systematic errors can be reduced by statistical post-processing, NWP precipitation estimates are still not reliable enough for the requirements of high-resolution snow cover modelling.In this study, better precipitation estimates are obtained through a specific analysis based on a combination of all these available products. First, a pre-processing step is proposed to mitigate the main deficiencies of precipitation estimates by radar and gauges, focusing on reducing unrealistic spatial patterns. This method also provides a spatialised estimate of the associated error in mountainous areas, based on a climatological analysis of both radar and NWP-estimated precipitation. Three ensemble daily precipitation analysis methods are then proposed, first using only the modified precipitation estimates and associated errors, then combining them with ensemble NWP simulations based on the particle filter and ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation algorithms. The performance of the different precipitation analysis methods is evaluated at a local scale using independent ski-resort precipitation observations. The evaluation of the pre-processing step shows its ability to remove the main spatial artefacts coming from the radar measurements and to improve the precipitation estimates at the local scale. The local-scale evaluations of the ensemble analyses do not demonstrate an additional benefit of ensemble NWP forecasts, but their contrasted spatial patterns are challenging to evaluate with the available data."

Data from all sensors are harmonised in terms of quality control, file format, as well as temporal and vertical resolutions. The quality of this DWL dataset is evaluated against in-situ measurements at the Eiffel Tower and radiosonde profiles.

We developed an online application that allows users to independently select regions of interest, time ranges, and spatial-temporal resolutions to generate their customized LCC products. 
 Leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) is an essential biochemical parameter reflecting vegetation's photosynthetic activity. In the past five years, some global LCC remote sensing products have been generated, and play an important role in vegetation growth monitoring and terrestrial carbon cycle modeling. However, the resolution of current global LCC products ranges from 300 m to 500 m, and the existing 30m-resolution product, Multi-source data Synergized Quantitative remote sensing production system LCC (MuSyQ LCC), is only available in China, resulting in a lack of global high-resolution LCC products. This study used an empirical relationship method based on the chlorophyll sensitive index (CSI) to produce a 10 m resolution global LCC product (MuSyQ Global LCC) with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. A web application was developed, allowing users to independently select regions of interest, time ranges, and spatial-temporal resolutions. The validation results show the MuSyQ Global LCC consists well with the current global MODIS LCC, and MuSyQ Global LCC’s (RMSE = 14.16 μg/cm2, bias = 1.68 μg/cm2) accuracy is slightly higher than that of MODIS LCC (RMSE = 14.74 μg/cm2, bias = -2.65 μg/cm2). The 10m-resolution LCC product has an RMSE of 15.33 μg/cm2, R2 of 0.27, and the accuracy of the vegetation types-specific regression model is stable in different sites across the world. The high-resolution LCC product can show more details of spatial distribution and reasonable temporal profiles than the existing low-resolution product, indicating its ability in precision agriculture, forestry monitoring, and related research."

This is important for understanding greenhouse gas emissions, as frozen soil is associated with methane release. The product provides accurate data on key events such as the first day of soil freezing in autumn, helping scientists to study climate change, ecosystem dynamics and its impact on our planet. 
 The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite is a valuable tool for monitoring global soil freeze-thaw dynamics, particularly in high-latitude environments where these processes are important for understanding ecosystem and carbon cycle dynamics. This paper introduces the updated SMOS Level-3 (L3) Soil Freeze-Thaw (FT) product and details its threshold-based classification algorithm, which utilizes L band passive microwave measurements to detect soil freeze-thaw transitions; this is possible due to the difference in dielectric properties between frozen and thawed soils at this frequency band. The algorithm applies gridded brightness temperature data from the SMOS satellite, augmented with ancillary datasets of air temperature and snow cover, to generate global estimates of freeze-thaw state. A recent update to the algorithm includes improved noise reduction through temporal filtering. Validation results against in-situ soil moisture and temperature measurements and comparisons to ERA5 Land reanalysis data demonstrate the ability of the product to detect the day of first freezing, an important metric for better understanding greenhouse gas fluxes and ecosystem dynamics, with improved accuracy. How- ever, limitations remain, particularly in regions affected by radio frequency interference (RFI) and during spring melt periods when wet snow hinders soil thaw detection. Despite these challenges, the SMOS FT product provides crucial data for carbon cycle studies, particularly in relation to methane fluxes, as soil freezing affects methane emissions in high-latitude regions."

Next to academic education purposes, we envisage that these diagrams will help researchers, model developers, and data users. 
 Numerical models are simplified representations of the real world at a finite level of complexity. Global water models are used to simulate the terrestrial part of the global water cycle, and their outputs contribute to the evaluation of important natural and societal issues, including water availability, flood risk, and ecological functioning. Whilst global water modeling is an area of science that has developed over several decades, and individual model-specific descriptions exist for some models, there has to date been no attempt to visualize the ways that several models work, using a standardized visualization framework. Here, we address this gap by presenting a community-driven process that developed a framework to visualize several global water models. The models considered participate in the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project phase 2b (ISIMIP2b). The diagrams were co-produced between a graphics designer and 16 modeling teams, based on extensive discussions and pragmatic decision-making that balanced the need for accuracy and detail against the need for effective visualization. The model diagrams are based on a standardized ISIMIP2b-complete global water model that represents what is theoretically possible to represent in the current generation of state-of-the-art global water models participating in ISIMIP2b. Model-specific diagrams are then copies of the ISIMIP2b-complete model, with individual processes either included or grayed out. An open-source tool has been developed and published jointly with the diagrams, which allows someone to generate a diagram for their own global water model by adapting the diagrams presented here.

 The Country Level Air Quality Calculator (CLAQC) is an open-source modeling tool that utilizes national sectoral emissions and weather data to forecast monthly and annual concentrations of PM2.5 and O3. CLAQC leverages the recent advancements in the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) system, employing CAMS global gridded emissions and CAMS reanalysis pollutant concentrations to improve the accuracy of its predictions. One of the notable strengths of CLAQC is its ability to provide country-specific and sectoral information. We have developed two methodological approaches, namely, elastic net modeling and extreme gradient boosting regressor, that can effectively predict annual average concentrations for nearly all countries. Both methods show good performance for the country's yearly average, while sensitivity tests show less robust results at the sectoral level. The tool can simulate a vast range of policy scenarios and can be integrated into national policy assessment and optimization frameworks. Finally, we present a method selection framework for each country to optimize performance and an online tool displaying model results.1"

 The ensemble consistency test (ECT) and its ultrafast variant (UF-ECT) have become powerful tools in the development community for the identification of unwanted changes in the Community Earth  System Model (CESM). By characterizing the distribution of an accepted ensemble of perturbed ultrafast model runs, the UF-ECT is able to identify changes exceeding internal variability in expensive chaotic numerical models with reasonable computational costs. However, up until now this approach has not seen adoption by other communities, in part because the process of adapting the UF-ECT procedure to other models was not clear. In this work we develop a generalized setup framework for applying the UF-ECT to different models and show how our specification of UF-ECT parameters allows us to balance important goals like test sensitivity and computational cost. Finally, we walk through the setup framework in detail and demonstrate the performance of the UF-ECT with our new determined parameters for the Model Across Prediction Scales-Atmosphere (MPAS-A), the substantially updated CESM atmospheric model, and realistic development scenarios."

In this study, the transport and retention of Shewanella oneidensis cells in saturated porous media was investigated under different levels of ciprofloxacin (CIP) stress. Exposing to lethal CIP stress caused significant viability loss and stimulated cell transport due to increasing hydrophilicity and decreasing surface roughness. While exposure to sublethal CIP stress did not affect MR-1’s viability, elongation of cells promoted their retention in sand columns via straining and orientation effects. The elongated cells likely adopted an end-on configuration to minimize repulsive interaction energy when approaching sand surfaces and deposited in a side-on position due to local surface roughness and charge heterogeneity of sands. The more diminished breakthrough of MR-1 cells in redox-active media was ascribed to their improving extracellular electron transfer and energy taxis activities under sublethal CIP stress. Moreover, the retention of elongated cells in porous media facilitated the de novo emergence of a resistant gyrase mutant, whose remobilization might exacerbate the AMR dissemination."

Laboratory experiments with tritium-labeled methane have been conducted to help determine the biodegradation rate of methane in natural seawater, and the results, together with literature data, have been used to guide the modeling. From the modeling study, we present results as a function of biodegradation half-life, treating this as a free parameter to reflect the considerable span in values reported in the literature. Considering three different locations on the Norwegian continental shelf, we find that if the biodegradation half-life of methane is in the range of a 9 to 16 days, as suggested by our experiments, then about 57–68% of the released methane will biodegrade in the water column from a seep at 65 m depth.

We project an upper-bound for emissions and releases between 2010 and 2300 (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP)5-8.5; 1.7 Tg) that surpasses the historical total over the past half millennium (1.5 Tg). In contrast, the lower-bound for emissions and releases (SSP1-2.6; 0.7 Tg) is substantially smaller than the historical total. Observational constraints on global modeling suggest that most Hg released to land and water prior to 2010 remains sequestered at contaminated sites. Substantial oceanic enrichment by anthropogenic Hg (270% ca. 2010) has been driven mainly by atmospheric emissions. Cumulative future releases to land and water are projected to be approximately six-times greater than primary anthropogenic emissions to the atmosphere. This Hg is mainly sequestered in legacy Hg waste pools and is unlikely to impact Hg pollution in the global ocean unless it is mobilized by climate change. Modeling results suggest that by 2100 atmospheric Hg concentrations may be similar to present levels if society follows SSP5-8.5.

Pro-thrombotic biomarkers and whole blood transcriptome data were measured repeatedly. Bayesian kernel machine regression revealed that higher serum thromboxane (Tx)B2 levels were associated with increasing levels of joint exposure to air pollutants over 1 week when ozone rather than other pollutants contributed most to the overall effect. Causal mediation analyses found 715 transcripts associated with an increase in TxB2 following ozone exposure, which were enriched in pathways, including ribosome, thermogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and pathways of neurodegeneration. As the temperature increased, we observed a stronger association between ozone exposure and TxB2 increase.

However, the strong competitive adsorption of NO2– over H2 on Ir sites, leading to H* deficiency at high NO2– concentrations, would hinder its real application. Here, we proposed an effective strategy to solve this problem by constructing dual active site Ir–Pt/TiO2 composite catalysts with physical mixing (Ir+Pt/TiO2) and co-impregnation (IrPt/TiO2) methods. On such catalysts, the hydrogen spillover effect on Pt sites could alleviate H* insufficiency on Ir sites, thereby accelerating the NRA reaction. Specifically, the optimal dry-mixed Ir+Pt/TiO2 catalyst exhibited an NRA rate constant of 12.4 L·gIr+Pt–1·min–1, approximately twice that of the Ir/TiO2 sample. Moreover, Ir+Pt/TiO2 catalysts showed first-order reaction kinetics rather than competitive reaction kinetics, confirming the alleviation of the H* deficiency limitation.

Depending on the relative contamination of diet and microplastics, the latter can act either as a vector of contaminants facilitating biological uptake or as a contaminant sink whose sorptive capacity does not diminish during digestion. A comprehensive understanding of these effects ultimately requires the quantification of the effect of microplastics on the thermodynamic driving force responsible for diffusion from the gut lumen to the tissues of an organism. Using silicone-based equilibrium sampling, we quantified the effect of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microplastics on the fugacity of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and two polymer additives in dietary and fecal samples of a zoo-housed polar bear. Although PVC microplastics at concentrations well above current observations reduced the fugacities of spiked isotopically labeled PCBs in the polar bear diet and feces slightly, but significantly, leaching from these microplastics greatly elevated fugacities of the additives UV-328 and octabenzone in these samples. The impact of microplastics in the diet on the biological uptake of environmental hydrophobic organic contaminants is likely to be negligible. Microplastics have the potential to be effective vectors for the dietary uptake of polymer additives."

Intracellular ARGs (iARGs) blt, mecA, and ampC, within vegetative cells of Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively, were treated on PTFE and/or stainless-steel surfaces or in aqueous phosphate buffer (PB; H2O2 only), to simulate potential healthcare and personal care cleaning applications under representative disinfectant exposure conditions. No chemical disinfectant yielded more than limited (≤1.9log10) iARG degradation/deactivation under the conditions investigated, even when ARB cells were extensively inactivated (at levels from 3.1log10 to ≥6log10). In contrast, UV irradiation yielded up to ∼2.8–3.2log10 iARG degradation/deactivation at corresponding ARB inactivation levels up to ∼4log10 in the case of the blt gene within B. subtilis cells on PTFE surfaces, though levels of iARG degradation/deactivation and ARB inactivation were generally lower than expected based on prior aqueous-phase results, likely due to light-shielding effects at the typical ∼108–109 CFU/mL cell inoculum densities used for surface disinfection tests. During exposure to H2O2 in PB, iARG deactivation and ARB inactivation reached up to 1.7log10 and >3.5log10, respectively, while iARG degradation was minimal (≤0.2log10); this appears to be driven by DNA-strand fragmentation (as observed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis) likely resulting from reaction with endogenous HO• (or Fe(IV)) generated via intracellular iron-catalyzed H2O2 decomposition. While all investigated disinfectants were able to effectively inactivate ARB cells themselves, these results demonstrate that most are ineffective in simultaneously degrading and deactivating iARGs, highlighting the potential benefits of employing disinfectants such as 254 nm UV light, that selectively target bacterial DNA, to improve mitigation of antibiotic resistance dissemination."

The order for individual HAN cytotoxicity from most to least toxic was ICH2CN > BrCH2CN ≫ ClCH2CN with the inhibitory concentration that reduced the cell viability by 50% of the untreated cells (IC50) of 2.52 ± 0.19, 7.24 ± 0.68, and 190 ± 18.5 μM, respectively.

Such accumulation is often attributed to the scavenging of MPs by rising frazil ice crystals, but there is no direct evidence of such a process. Furthermore, nanoplastics (NPs, 1 nm–1 μm) are suspected to be present, but their fate is unknown due to the lack of field measurements. Here micro- and nanoplastics’ (MNPs) enrichment by frazil ice was quantified using model particles and an experimental setup which generated realistic frazil ice. Particle size had a significant impact on behavior: on one hand, high-density MPs concentrations were 2.97 ± 1.13 times higher in the ice than in the underlying water, which is consistent with field observations. On the other hand, NPs were depleted to the same extent as sea salts, by a factor of 0.32 ± 0.13.  Like salts, NPs may be locally enriched in the brine channels and pockets of sea ice where microalgae thrive. Overall, this work shows that frazil ice plays an important role in the cycling of MNPs, as it can concentrate MPs in sea ice and concentrate NPs locally in brine channels and pockets."

Cox regressions and generalized estimating equation models were used to analyze associations between greenness and dyslipidemia outcomes. Over a median follow-up period of 3.21 years, 744,732 cases of dyslipidemia were observed. Greener environments were associated with a reduced risk of dyslipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperbetalipoproteinemia (hazard ratios ranged from 0.82 to 0.96) and an increased risk of hypoalphalipoproteinemia (hazard ratios were 1.12 to 1.15). Higher greenness levels were linked to lower serum lipids. These associations were stronger among older adults and those with higher education. Mediation analyses showed that lower air pollution, temperature, and higher physical activity accounted for 2.08–33.72% of the associations between greenness and dyslipidemia.

These drivers include changes in nutrient loading, human‐accelerated chemical weathering of watersheds, acid‐rain and land‐use changes, and ocean acidification due to atmospheric CO2 increase. We lack understanding of how these co‐occurring processes have influenced long‐term pHT changes in coastal waters. To address this knowledge gap, a coupled hydrodynamic‐biogeochemical‐carbonate chemistry model was used to conduct a hindcast simulation and scenario analyses of carbonate chemistry in the Chesapeake Bay between 1951 and 2010. Trend analysis reveals increasing pHT in the upper Bay due to river alkalinization but decreasing pHT in the bottom waters of the mid‐and lower Bay due to ocean acidification. No trend is detected in the surface waters of the mid‐ and lower Bay due to competition between the two drivers. The effect of river alkalinization on the acidic volume in the estuary is twice that of ocean acidification. Our findings show that river alkalinization provides an important buffer against acidification while eutrophication plays a secondary role. Our results also suggest ocean alkalinity enhancement could be effective in mitigating acidification in coastal waters."

The most apparent trend is in MLT: microburst duration increases from midnight through the dawn sector but decreases after noon. These results highlight the primary role of chorus waves in driving microbursts. Furthermore, we build a constraint on the upper magnetic latitude boundary λ2 $\left({\lambda }_{2}\right)$ of chorus waves that can induce 1 MeV microbursts. The constraint is dependent on MLT. On the dayside, the optimal λ2 ${\lambda }_{2}$ typically exceeds 36° $36{}^{\circ}$, which is higher than on the nightside, suggesting ducted chorus propagation dominates.

This dependence is more pronounced for near subsolar shocks but becomes more dispersed for near terminator shocks.

For instance, the original bin microphysics scheme was unable to successfully reproduced the evolution of RSDs with decreasing height, as measured from the multi‐layer observations during the landfall of Typhoon Pakhar (2017). Thus, this study introduces a modified bin microphysics scheme that incorporates the influence of horizontal wind speeds, vertical wind shear and smaller‐scale turbulence on the total movement velocity (including horizontal and vertical components) of raindrops, and consequently on their collisional outcomes.

As a result, global light rain systems were identified into four types based on microphysical (mass‐weighted mean diameter (Dm) and normalized intercept parameter (logNw)) and macrophysical (cloud‐echo‐top height (CETH)) parameters. The four classified types are (a) Type 1: light rain dominant in tropics and mid‐latitude, (b) Type 2: light rain linked to atmospheric deep convection, (c) Type 3: light rain from humid oceanic inflow blocked by topography, and (d) Type 4: light rain associated with subtropical high‐pressure systems. Type 2 shows the largest Dm and the smallest logNw, while Type 4 exhibited opposite patterns. Type 3 has the highest CETH and vertically stretching radar reflectivity profiles. Type 1 showed similar distributions of Dm and logNw with Type 3 and radar reflectivity with Type 4 but different distributions of hydrometeor phase with Types 3 and 4. To clarify the characteristics of Type 1, a detailed analysis was conducted, showing larger Dm and logNw, higher radar reflectivity, and stronger seasonality in tropical regions compared to mid‐latitudes. This study provides valuable insights into geospatial/statistical characteristics of global light rain, which is expected to enhance the accuracy of cloud parameterization in the NWP model."

 Neuroimmune interactions—signals transmitted between immune and brain cells—regulate many aspects of tissue physiology1, including responses to psychological stress2–5, which can predispose individuals to develop neuropsychiatric diseases6–9. Still, the interactions between haematopoietic and brain-resident cells that influence complex behaviours are poorly understood. Here, we use a combination of genomic and behavioural screens to show that astrocytes in the amygdala limit stress-induced fear behaviour through epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Mechanistically, EGFR expression in amygdala astrocytes inhibits a stress-induced, pro-inflammatory signal-transduction cascade that facilitates neuron–glial crosstalk and stress-induced fear behaviour through the orphan nuclear receptor NR2F2 in amygdala neurons. In turn, decreased EGFR signalling and fear behaviour are associated with the recruitment of meningeal monocytes during chronic stress. This set of neuroimmune interactions is therapeutically targetable through the administration of psychedelic compounds, which reversed the accumulation of monocytes in the brain meninges along with fear behaviour. Together with validation in clinical samples, these data suggest that psychedelics can be used to target neuroimmune interactions relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders and potentially other inflammatory diseases. Inflammatory monocytes in the brain meninges promote stress-induced fear behaviour, and the pathways involved can be modulated using psychedelic compounds."

 Several hydrogen-rich superconductors have been found to show unprecedentedly high critical temperatures1–4, stimulating investigations into the nature of the superconductivity in these materials. Although their macroscopic superconducting properties are established1,5–7, microscopic insights into the pairing mechanism remains unclear. Here we characterize the superconducting gap structure in the high-temperature superconductor H3S and its deuterium counterpart D3S by performing tunnelling spectroscopy measurements. The tunnelling spectra reveal that H3S and D3S both have a fully gapped structure, which could be well described by a single s-wave Dynes model, with gap values 2Δ of approximately 60 meV and 44 meV, respectively. Furthermore, we observed gap features of another likely H-depleted HxS superconducting phase in a poorly synthesized hydrogen sulfide sample. Our work offers direct experimental evidence for superconductivity in the hydrogen-rich superconductor H3S from a microscopic perspective. It validates the phonon-mediated mechanism of superconducting pairing and provides a foundation for further understanding the origins of high-temperature superconductivity in hydrogen-rich compounds.

 Will it ever be possible to sue anyone for damaging the climate? Twenty years after this question was first posed, we argue that the scientific case for climate liability is closed. Here we detail the scientific and legal implications of an ‘end-to-end’ attribution that links fossil fuel producers to specific damages from warming. Using scope 1 and 3 emissions data from major fossil fuel companies, peer-reviewed attribution methods and advances in empirical climate economics, we illustrate the trillions in economic losses attributable to the extreme heat caused by emissions from individual companies. Emissions linked to Chevron, the highest-emitting investor-owned company in our data, for example, very likely caused between US $791 billion and $3.6 trillion in heat-related losses over the period 1991–2020, disproportionately harming the tropical regions least culpable for warming. More broadly, we outline a transparent, reproducible and flexible framework that formalizes how end-to-end attribution could inform litigation by assessing whose emissions are responsible and for which harms. Drawing quantitative linkages between individual emitters and particularized harms is now feasible, making science no longer an obstacle to the justiciability of climate liability claims.

Systematic mutagenesis across hundreds of regulatory disordered elements, combined with machine learning, reveals a complex pattern of molecular features important for their activity. The presence and arrangement of aromatic residues strongly predicts the ability of seemingly diverse protein sequences to influence mRNA stability and translation. We further show how many of these regulatory elements exert their effects by engaging core mRNA decay machinery.

 Environmental thermal challenges trigger the brain to coordinate both autonomic and behavioural responses to maintain optimal body temperature1–4. It is unknown how temperature information is precisely stored and retrieved in the brain and how it is converted into a physiological response. Here we investigated whether memories could control whole-body metabolism by training mice to remember a thermal challenge. Mice were conditioned to associate a context with a specific temperature by combining thermoregulatory Pavlovian conditioning with engram-labelling technology, optogenetics and chemogenetics. We report that if mice are returned to an environment in which they previously experienced a 4 °C cold challenge, they increase their metabolic rates regardless of the actual environmental temperature. Furthermore, we show that mice have increased hypothalamic activity when they are exposed to the cold, and that a specific network emerges between the hippocampus and the hypothalamus during the recall of a cold memory. Both natural retrieval and artificial reactivation of cold-sensitive memory engrams in the hippocampus mimic the physiological responses that are seen during a cold challenge. These ensembles are necessary for cold-memory retrieval. These findings show that retrieval of a cold memory causes whole-body autonomic and behavioural responses that enable mice to maintain thermal homeostasis.

 Recent breakthroughs in ultrathin, single-crystalline, freestanding complex oxide systems have sparked industry interest in their potential for next-generation commercial devices1,2. However, the mass production of these ultrathin complex oxide membranes has been hindered by the challenging requirement of inserting an artificial release layer between the epilayers and substrates3,4. Here we introduce a technique that achieves atomic precision lift-off of ultrathin membranes without artificial release layers to facilitate the high-throughput production of scalable, ultrathin, freestanding perovskite systems. Leveraging both theoretical insights and empirical evidence, we have identified the pivotal role of lead in weakening the interface. This insight has led to the creation of a universal exfoliation strategy that enables the production of diverse ultrathin perovskite membranes less than 10 nm. Our pyroelectric membranes demonstrate a record-high pyroelectric coefficient of 1.76 × 10−2 C m−2 K−1, attributed to their exceptionally low thickness and freestanding nature. Moreover, this method offers an approach to manufacturing cooling-free detectors that can cover the full far-infrared spectrum, marking a notable advancement in detector technology5.

 Glacial cycles significantly influenced Earth’s surface processes throughout the Quaternary, impacting the climate, sea level, and seismic and magmatic activity1–3. However, the effects of glaciation and deglaciation (that is, glacial forcing) on lithospheric motion are unknown. To study these effects, we formulated high-resolution numerical models with realistic lithospheric structures, including weak plate margins, lithospheric thickness variations and crustal structure. Our results show that glacial forcing significantly altered lithospheric motion and the spreading rates of mid-ocean ridges situated near major ice sheets in the last glacial cycle. For example, deglaciation-induced motion in the North American plate had a rotational part that was up to around 25% of its tectonic plate motion over 10,000-year timescales. The deglaciation in Greenland and Fennoscandia caused up to 40% fluctuations in the spreading rates of the Iceland Ridge between 12,000 and 6,000 years ago, which may explain the Holocene volcanism in Iceland. Our modelling also indicates increased (decreased) rates of global sea-floor production during the deglaciation (glaciation) periods with implications for mantle degassing rates. These results underscore the critical dynamic interplay between glacial cycles, lithospheric motion, ridge spreading and climate during ice ages.

 Recent advances in quantum communications have underscored the crucial role of optical coherence in developing quantum networks. This resource, which is fundamental to the phase-based architecture of the quantum internet1, has enabled the only successful demonstrations of multi-node quantum networks2–4 and substantially extended the range of quantum key distribution (QKD)5. However, the scalability of coherence-based quantum protocols remains uncertain owing to the specialized hardware required, such as ultra-stable optical cavities and cryogenic photon detectors. Here we implement the coherence-based twin-field QKD protocol over a 254-kilometre commercial telecom network spanning between Frankfurt and Kehl, Germany, achieving encryption key distribution at 110 bits per second. Our results are enabled by a scalable approach to optical coherence distribution, supported by a practical system architecture and non-cryogenic single-photon detection aided by off-band phase stabilization. Our results demonstrate repeater-like quantum communication in an operational network setting, doubling the distance for practical real-world QKD implementations without cryogenic cooling. In addition, to our knowledge, we realized one of the largest QKD networks featuring measurement-device-independent properties6.

 Acute myocardial infarction is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide1. Clinical studies have shown that the severity of cardiac injury after myocardial infarction exhibits a circadian pattern, with larger infarcts and poorer outcomes in patients experiencing morning-onset events2–7. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these diurnal variations remain unclear. Here we show that the core circadian transcription factor BMAL17–11 regulates circadian-dependent myocardial injury by forming a transcriptionally active heterodimer with a non-canonical partner—hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF2A)12–16—in a diurnal manner. To substantiate this finding, we determined the cryo-EM structure of the BMAL1–HIF2A–DNA complex, revealing structural rearrangements within BMAL1 that enable cross-talk between circadian rhythms and hypoxia signalling. BMAL1 modulates the circadian hypoxic response by enhancing the transcriptional activity of HIF2A and stabilizing the HIF2A protein. We further identified amphiregulin (AREG)16,17 as a rhythmic target of the BMAL1–HIF2A complex, critical for regulating daytime variations of myocardial injury. Pharmacologically targeting the BMAL1–HIF2A–AREG pathway provides cardioprotection, with maximum efficacy when aligned with the pathway’s circadian phase. These findings identify a mechanism governing circadian variations of myocardial injury and highlight the therapeutic potential of clock-based pharmacological interventions for treating ischaemic heart disease.

 The coupling between electrons and phonons is one of the fundamental interactions in solids, underpinning a wide range of phenomena, such as resistivity, heat conductivity and superconductivity. However, direct measurements of this coupling for individual phonon modes remain a substantial challenge. In this work, we introduce a new technique for mapping phonon dispersions and electron–phonon coupling (EPC) in van der Waals (vdW) materials. By generalizing the quantum twisting microscope1 (QTM) to cryogenic temperatures, we demonstrate its capability to map not only electronic dispersions through elastic momentum-conserving tunnelling but also phononic dispersions through inelastic momentum-conserving tunnelling. Crucially, the inelastic tunnelling strength provides a direct and quantitative measure of the momentum and mode-resolved EPC. We use this technique to measure the phonon spectrum and EPC of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with twist angles larger than 6°. Notably, we find that, unlike standard acoustic phonons, whose coupling to electrons diminishes as their momentum tends to zero, TBG exhibits a low-energy mode whose coupling increases with decreasing twist angle. We show that this unusual coupling arises from the modulation of the interlayer tunnelling by a layer-antisymmetric ‘phason’ mode of the moiré system. The technique demonstrated here opens the way for examining a large variety of other neutral collective modes that couple to electronic tunnelling, including plasmons2, magnons3 and spinons4 in quantum materials.

 Clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) involves the gradual expansion of mutant pre-leukaemic haematopoietic cells, which increases with age and confers a risk for multiple diseases, including leukaemia and immune-related conditions1. Although the absolute risk of leukaemic transformation in individuals with CHIP is very low, the strongest predictor of progression is the accumulation of mutant haematopoietic cells2. Despite the known associations between CHIP and increased all-cause mortality, our understanding of environmental and regulatory factors that underlie this process during ageing remains rudimentary. Here we show that intestinal alterations, which can occur with age, lead to systemic dissemination of a microbial metabolite that promotes pre-leukaemic cell expansion. Specifically, ADP-d-glycero-β-d-manno-heptose (ADP-heptose), a biosynthetic bi-product specific to Gram-negative bacteria3–5, is uniquely found in the circulation of older individuals and favours the expansion of pre-leukaemic cells. ADP-heptose is also associated with increased inflammation and cardiovascular risk in CHIP. Mechanistically, ADP-heptose binds to its receptor, ALPK1, triggering transcriptional reprogramming and NF-κB activation that endows pre-leukaemic cells with a competitive advantage due to excessive clonal proliferation. Collectively, we identify that the accumulation of ADP-heptose represents a direct link between ageing and expansion of rare pre-leukaemic cells, suggesting that the ADP-heptose–ALPK1 axis is a promising therapeutic target to prevent progression of CHIP to overt leukaemia and immune-related conditions.

 Beneath oceanic spreading centres, the lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary (LAB) acts as a permeability barrier that focuses the delivery of melt from deep within the mantle towards the spreading axis1. At intermediate-spreading to fast-spreading ridge crests, the multichannel seismic reflection technique has imaged a nearly flat, 1–2-km-wide axial magma lens (AML)2 that defines the uppermost section of the LAB3, but the nature of the LAB deeper into the crust has been more elusive, with some clues gained from tomographic images, providing only a diffuse view of a wider halo of lower-velocity material seated just beneath the AML4. Here we present 3D seismic reflection images of the LAB extending deep (5–6 km) into the crust beneath Axial volcano, located at the intersection of the Juan de Fuca Ridge and the Cobb–Eickelberg hotspot. The 3D shape of the LAB, which is coincident with a thermally controlled magma assimilation front, focuses hotspot-related and mid-ocean-spreading-centre-related magmatism towards the centre of the volcano, controlling both eruption and hydrothermal processes and the chemical composition of erupted lavas5. In this context, the LAB can be viewed as the upper surface of a ‘magma domain’, a volume within which melt bodies reside (replacing the concept of a single ‘magma reservoir’)6. Our discovery of a funnel-shaped, crustal LAB suggests that thermally controlled magma assimilation could be occurring along this surface at other volcanic systems, such as Iceland. 3D seismic reflection images of the lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary beneath Axial volcano show a magma assimilation front that focuses magmatism towards the centre of the volcano, controlling both eruption and hydrothermal processes."

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) subsists in a nutrient-deregulated microenvironment, making it particularly susceptible to treatments that interfere with cancer metabolism1,2. For example, PDAC uses, and is dependent on, high levels of autophagy and other lysosomal processes3–5. Although targeting these pathways has shown potential in preclinical studies, progress has been hampered by the difficulty in identifying and characterizing favourable targets for drug development6. Here, we characterize PIKfyve, a lipid kinase that is integral to lysosomal functioning7, as a targetable vulnerability in PDAC. Using a genetically engineered mouse model, we established that PIKfyve is essential to PDAC progression. Furthermore, through comprehensive metabolic analyses, we found that PIKfyve inhibition forces PDAC to upregulate a distinct transcriptional and metabolic program favouring de novo lipid synthesis. In PDAC, the KRAS–MAPK signalling pathway is a primary driver of de novo lipid synthesis. Accordingly, simultaneously targeting PIKfyve and KRAS–MAPK resulted in the elimination of the tumour burden in numerous preclinical human and mouse models. Taken together, these studies indicate that disrupting lipid metabolism through PIKfyve inhibition induces synthetic lethality in conjunction with KRAS–MAPK-directed therapies for PDAC.

 Mendel1 studied in detail seven pairs of contrasting traits in pea (Pisum sativum), establishing the foundational principles of genetic inheritance. Here we investigate the genetic architecture that underlies these traits and uncover previously undescribed alleles for the four characterized Mendelian genes2–7, including a rare revertant of Mendel’s white-flowered a allele. Primarily, we focus on the three remaining uncharacterized traits and find that (1) an approximately 100-kb genomic deletion upstream of the Chlorophyll synthase (ChlG) gene disrupts chlorophyll biosynthesis through the generation of intergenic transcriptional fusion products, conferring the yellow pod phenotype of gp mutants; (2) a MYB gene with an upstream Ogre element insertion and a CLE peptide-encoding gene with an in-frame premature stop codon explain the v and p alleles, which disrupt secondary cell wall thickening and lignification, resulting in the parchmentless, edible-pod phenotype; and (3) a 5-bp exonic deletion in a CIK-like co-receptor kinase gene, in combination with a genetic modifier locus, is associated with the fasciated stem (fa) phenotype. Furthermore, we characterize genes and alleles associated with diverse agronomic traits, such as axil ring anthocyanin pigmentation, seed size and the ‘semi-leafless’ form. This study establishes a foundation for fundamental research, education in biology and genetics, and pea breeding practices.

 Understanding the human de novo mutation (DNM) rate requires complete sequence information1. Here using five complementary short-read and long-read sequencing technologies, we phased and assembled more than 95% of each diploid human genome in a four-generation, twenty-eight-member family (CEPH 1463). We estimate 98–206 DNMs per transmission, including 74.5 de novo single-nucleotide variants, 7.4 non-tandem repeat indels, 65.3 de novo indels or structural variants originating from tandem repeats, and 4.4 centromeric DNMs. Among male individuals, we find 12.4 de novo Y chromosome events per generation. Short tandem repeats and variable-number tandem repeats are the most mutable, with 32 loci exhibiting recurrent mutation through the generations. We accurately assemble 288 centromeres and six Y chromosomes across the generations and demonstrate that the DNM rate varies by an order of magnitude depending on repeat content, length and sequence identity. We show a strong paternal bias (75–81%) for all forms of germline DNM, yet we estimate that 16% of de novo single-nucleotide variants are postzygotic in origin with no paternal bias, including early germline mosaic mutations. We place all this variation in the context of a high-resolution recombination map (~3.4 kb breakpoint resolution) and find no correlation between meiotic crossover and de novo structural variants. These near-telomere-to-telomere familial genomes provide a truth set to understand the most fundamental processes underlying human genetic variation.

 Somatosensory neurons encode detailed information about touch and temperature and are the peripheral drivers of pain1,2. Here by combining functional imaging with multiplexed in situ hybridization3, we determined how heat and mechanical stimuli are encoded across neuronal classes and how inflammation transforms this representation to induce heat hypersensitivity, mechanical allodynia and continuing pain. Our data revealed that trigeminal neurons innervating the cheek exhibited complete segregation of responses to gentle touch and heat. By contrast, heat and noxious mechanical stimuli broadly activated nociceptor classes, including cell types proposed to trigger select percepts and behaviours4–6. Injection of the inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E2 caused long-lasting activity and thermal sensitization in select classes of nociceptors, providing a cellular basis for continuing inflammatory pain and heat hypersensitivity. We showed that the capsaicin receptor TRPV1 (ref. 7) has a central role in heat sensitization but not in spontaneous nociceptor activity. Unexpectedly, the responses to mechanical stimuli were minimally affected by inflammation, suggesting that tactile allodynia results from the continuing firing of nociceptors coincident with touch. Indeed, we have demonstrated that nociceptor activity is both necessary and sufficient for inflammatory tactile allodynia. Together, these findings refine models of sensory coding and discrimination at the cellular and molecular levels, demonstrate that touch and temperature are broadly but differentially encoded across transcriptomically distinct populations of sensory cells and provide insight into how cellular-level responses are reshaped by inflammation to trigger diverse aspects of pain.

 Patients with treatment-refractory pancreatic cancer often succumb to systemic metastases1–3; however, the transcriptomic heterogeneity that underlies therapeutic recalcitrance remains understudied, particularly in a spatial context. Here we construct high-resolution maps of lineage states, clonal architecture and the tumour microenvironment (TME) using spatially resolved transcriptomics from 55 samples of primary tumour and metastases (liver, lung and peritoneum) collected from rapid autopsies of 13 people. We observe discernible transcriptomic shifts in cancer-cell lineage states as tumours transition from primary sites to organ-specific metastases, with the most pronounced intra-patient distinctions between liver and lung. Phylogenetic trees constructed from inferred copy number variations in primary and metastatic loci in each patient highlight diverse patient-specific evolutionary trajectories and clonal dissemination. We show that multiple tumour lineage states co-exist in each tissue, including concurrent metastatic foci in the same organ. Agnostic to tissue site, lineage states correlate with distinct TME features, such as the spatial proximity of TGFB1-expressing myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblasts (myCAFs) to aggressive ‘basal-like’ cancer cells, but not to cells in the ‘classical’ or ‘intermediate’ states. These findings were validated through orthogonal and cross-species analyses using mouse tissues and patient-derived organoids. Notably, basal-like cancer cells aligned with myCAFs correlate with plasma-cell exclusion from the tumour milieu, and neighbouring cell analyses suggest that CXCR4–CXCL12 signalling is the underlying basis for observed immune exclusion. Collectively, our findings underscore the profound transcriptomic heterogeneity and microenvironmental dynamics that characterize treatment-refractory pancreatic cancer.

 The maritime Phoenician civilization from the Levant transformed the entire Mediterranean during the first millennium bce1–3. However, the extent of human movement between the Levantine Phoenician homeland and Phoenician–Punic settlements in the central and western Mediterranean has been unclear in the absence of comprehensive ancient DNA studies. Here, we generated genome-wide data for 210 individuals, including 196 from 14 sites traditionally identified as Phoenician and Punic in the Levant, North Africa, Iberia, Sicily, Sardinia and Ibiza, and an early Iron Age individual from Algeria. Levantine Phoenicians made little genetic contribution to Punic settlements in the central and western Mediterranean between the sixth and second centuries bce, despite abundant archaeological evidence of cultural, historical, linguistic and religious links4. Instead, these inheritors of Levantine Phoenician culture derived most of their ancestry from a genetic profile similar to that of Sicily and the Aegean. Much of the remaining ancestry originated from North Africa, reflecting the growing influence of Carthage5. However, this was a minority contributor of ancestry in all of the sampled sites, including in Carthage itself. Different Punic sites across the central and western Mediterranean show similar patterns of high genetic diversity. We also detect genetic relationships across the Mediterranean, reflecting shared demographic processes that shaped the Punic world.

 Understanding the relationship between antibiotic use and the evolution of antimicrobial resistance is vital for effective antibiotic stewardship. Yet, animal models and in vitro experiments poorly replicate real-world conditions1. To explain how resistance evolves in vivo, we exposed 60 human participants to ciprofloxacin and used longitudinal stool samples and a new computational method to assemble the genomes of 5,665 populations of commensal bacterial species within participants. Analysis of 2.3 million polymorphic sequence variants revealed 513 populations that underwent selective sweeps. We found convergent evolution focused on DNA gyrase and evidence of dispersed selective pressure at other genomic loci. Roughly 10% of susceptible bacterial populations evolved towards resistance through sweeps that involved substitutions at a specific amino acid in gyrase. The evolution of gyrase was associated with large populations that decreased in relative abundance during exposure. Sweeps persisted for more than 10 weeks in most cases and were not projected to revert within a year. Targeted amplification showed that gyrase mutations arose de novo within the participants and exhibited no measurable fitness cost. These findings revealed that brief ciprofloxacin exposure drives the evolution of resistance in gut commensals, with mutations persisting long after exposure. This study underscores the capacity of the human gut to promote the evolution of resistance and identifies key genomic and ecological factors that shape bacterial adaptation in vivo.

 Bridge-like lipid-transport proteins (BLTPs) are an evolutionarily conserved family of proteins that localize to membrane-contact sites and are thought to mediate the bulk transfer of lipids from a donor membrane, typically the endoplasmic reticulum, to an acceptor membrane, such as that of the cell or an organelle1. Although BLTPs are fundamentally important for a wide array of cellular functions, their architecture, composition and lipid-transfer mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Here we present the subunit composition and the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of the native LPD-3 BLTP complex isolated from transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans. LPD-3 folds into an elongated, rod-shaped tunnel of which the interior is filled with ordered lipid molecules that are coordinated by a track of ionizable residues that line one side of the tunnel. LPD-3 forms a complex with two previously uncharacterized proteins, one of which we have named Spigot and the other of which remains unnamed. Spigot interacts with the N-terminal end of LPD-3 where lipids are expected to enter the tunnel, and experiments in multiple model systems indicate that Spigot has a conserved role in BLTP function.

 Earth’s atmosphere underwent permanent oxidation during the Great Oxidation Event approximately 2.45–2.22 billion years ago (Ga) due to excess oxygen (O2) generated by marine cyanobacteria. However, understanding the timing and tempo of seawater oxygenation before the Great Oxidation Event has been hindered by the absence of sensitive tracers. Nitrogen (N) isotopes can be an indicator of marine oxygenation. Here we present an ~200 Myr nitrogen isotope oscillation recorded by Neoarchaean and Palaeoproterozoic banded iron formations from the Hamersley Basin, Western Australia, that were deposited in relatively deep marine shelf environments. Paired with the Jeerinah Formation shale record, our data from the Marra Mamba Iron Formation suggest that oxic conditions expanded to banded iron formation depositional environments from ~2.63 to 2.60 Ga. Subsequently, a positive δ15N excursion occurred in the ~2.48 Ga Dale Gorge Member, marking a decline in seawater O2 and enhanced denitrification. This O2 deficit was followed by a second phase of increasing O2 levels as indicated by a gradual return to moderately positive δ15N values in the ~2.46 Ga Joffre Member and 2.45 Ga Weeli Wolli Iron Formation. These variations underscore a nonlinear history of marine oxygenation and reveal a previously unrecognized oscillation in seawater O2 levels preceding the Great Oxidation Event.

Here, the authors employ cryo-EM, fluorescent microscopy, and AlphaFold modelling to propose how a rotary mechanism of CpaF catalysis drives Tad pilus assembly. 
 The type IV pilus family uses PilT/VirB11-like ATPases to rapidly assemble and disassemble pilin subunits. Among these, the tight adherence (Tad) pilus performs both functions using a single bifunctional ATPase, CpaF. Here, we determine three conformationally distinct structures of CpaF hexamers with varying nucleotide occupancies by cryo-electron microscopy. Analysis of these structures suggest ATP binding and hydrolysis expand and rotate the hexamer pore clockwise while subsequent ADP release contracts the ATPase. Truncation of the intrinsically disordered region of CpaF in Caulobacter crescentus equally reduces pilus extension and retraction events observed using fluorescence microscopy, but does not reduce ATPase activity. AlphaFold3 modeling suggests that CpaF and other motors of the type IV filament superfamily employ conserved secondary structural features to engage their respective platform proteins. From these data, we propose that CpaF uses a clockwise, rotary mechanism of catalysis to assemble a right-handed, helical Tad pilus, a process broadly applicable to other single motor systems.

 The discovery of N6-methyladenine (6mA) in eukaryotic genomes, typically found in prokaryotic DNA, has revolutionized epigenetics. Here, we show that symmetric 6mA is essential in the early diverging fungus Rhizopus microsporus, as the absence of the MT-A70 complex (MTA1c) responsible for this modification results in a lethal phenotype. 6mA is present in 70% of the genes, correlating with the presence of H3K4me3 and H2A.Z in open euchromatic regions. This modification is found predominantly in nucleosome linker regions, influencing the nucleosome positioning around the transcription start sites of highly expressed genes. Controlled downregulation of MTA1c reduces symmetric 6mA sites affecting nucleosome positioning and histone modifications, leading to altered gene expression, which is likely the cause of the severe phenotypic changes observed. Our study highlights the indispensable role of the DNA 6mA in a multicellular organism and delineates the mechanisms through which this epigenetic mark regulates gene expression in a eukaryotic genome.

Here, the authors develop an AFM-based nanorheology platform to measure local molecular mobilities and spatial correlations in lateral diffusion within the membrane. 
 Biological membranes are intrinsically dynamic entities that continually adapt their biophysical properties and molecular organisation to support cellular function. Current microscopy techniques can derive high-resolution structural information of labelled molecules but quantifying the associated viscoelastic behaviour with nanometre precision remains challenging. Here, we develop an approach based on atomic force microscopy in conjunction with fast nano-actuators to map the viscoelastic response of unlabelled supported membranes with nanometre spatial resolution. On fluid membranes, we show that the method can quantify local variations in the molecular mobility of the lipids and derive a diffusion coefficient. We confirm our experimental approach with molecular dynamics simulations, also highlighting the role played by the water at the interface with the membrane on the measurement. Probing ternary model bilayers reveals spatial correlations in the local diffusion over distances of ≈20 nm within liquid disordered domains. This lateral correlation is enhanced in native bovine lens membranes, where the inclusion of protein-rich domains induces four-fold variations in the diffusion coefficient across < 100 nm of the fluid regions, consistent with biological function. Our findings suggest that diffusion is highly localised in fluid biomembranes. The viscoelasticity of fluid membranes is challenging to quantify with nanometre precision.

 Silicate-based meteoric smoke particles (MSPs) resulting from extraterrestrial dust impacting on the upper atmosphere are likely involved in seeding the formation of mesospheric ice-based noctilucent clouds (NLCs). However, the detailed physicochemical properties of MSP seeds remain elusive. Considering that ice formation is sensitive to MSP charging efficiency, here we focus on species which can efficiently capture charge. As in situ MSP characterisation is highly challenging, we mimic atmospheric MSP formation using laser ablation and collisional cooling to produce small anionic magnesium silicate clusters. Our detailed experimental and theoretical characterisation shows that these clusters have unusual oxygen-rich structures. Moreover, the corresponding neutral clusters have extraordinarily high adiabatic electron affinities and 3-18% charging efficiencies, which is remarkably consistent with estimates required by models to simulate atmospheric measurements. Overall, our highly oxidised anionic silicate clusters exhibit all necessary chemical, electronic and optical properties to be highly credible MSP-based seed candidates for NLC nucleation."

 Wildfires cause large damage to natural and human systems. Despite the clear connection between human-induced climate change and increased fire weather risk, a global, systematic attribution of observed extreme fires to human-induced climate change is lacking. Here, we address this gap by first linking observed regional weekly burned area extremes (>85th percentile) to the fire weather index (FWI) during the fire seasons of 2002–2015 via a logistic regression model, and then using simulations from climate models to quantify the impact of human-induced climate change. Focusing on regions with good predictability of the statistical model, we find that human-induced climate change was responsible for a fraction equal to 8% (±4%, standard deviation across climate models) of the predicted probability of more than 700 regional fire extremes on average, thereby increasing the probability of experiencing a fire extreme across 15 out of 19 analysed regions. While higher temperature is the main driver of the increased fire extreme probability, shifts in precipitation, relative humidity, and/or wind speed substantially modulated fire changes across many regions. Mainly because of warming, the probability of extreme fires attributable to human-induced climate change increased by 5.2%/decade globally over 2002–2015, in line with an acceleration of the climate-driven enhancement of fire extremes over the last decades that may continue in the near future. These findings highlight the urgent need for sustainable fire management strategies."

 Leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) is an important indicator of photosynthetic capacity. Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is an optical signal emitted from the leaf interior, providing a unique technique for accurately estimating LCC. The far-red to red ratio of chlorophyll fluorescence (Fratio) has been used to empirically estimate LCC in some previous studies. While these studies support the use of the Fratio for LCC estimation, its theoretical underpinning remains less well-defined and its effectiveness across a wider range of scenarios remains unclear. In this study, we established the relationship between the Fratio and LCC using the light use efficiency (LUE)-based SIF model and spectral invariant radiative transfer theory. Firstly, the LUE-based SIF model demonstrates that the change in the leaf Fratio is controlled by the ratio of the fluorescence escape fraction (i.e., fesc from the photosystem to the leaf surface) at the corresponding bands. Secondly, a fesc modeling approach is presented using the spectral invariant theory and thus the fesc ratio is linked to LCC. Theoretical analysis shows that the Fratio has a strong correlation with LCC, which explains over 90 % of the variation in Fratio. Both experimental measurements and model simulations from a radiative transfer model Fluspect were used to validate the relationship between LCC and three Fratio (i.e., Fratio↑, Fratio↓ and Fratiotot), which were derived from the upward and downward SIF of leaves, as well as the total SIF observed from both sides. The Fluspect simulations were used to assess the sensitivity of the Fratio-LCC relationship to the leaf structure. Two types of experimental measurements, including the field measurements of three crops and the laboratory measurements of 20 tundra plants, were employed to examine the species dependence of the Fratio-LCC relationship. The performance of Fratio for LCC estimation was evaluated and compared with spectral indices and the PROSPECT model using the experimental measurements and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) approach. Both the Fluspect simulations and the experimental measurements indicate that the Fratio is strongly correlated with LCC for a wide range of leaf scenarios. The Fratio-LCC relationship remains relatively stable across different leaf structures and plant species, since the relationship is almost consistent. The LOOCV of experimental measurements shows that the Fratio provides promising and robust LCC estimates, with the Fratiotot performing the best. The Fratiotot outperforms spectral indices, reducing the RMSE for LCC estimation by 19.5 %–93.9 %. Furthermore, compared to the PROSPECT model, the Fratio achieves a reduction in RMSE by 30.4 %–77.8 %. These results demonstrate that the Fratio is effective for estimating LCC of diverse plant species.

 Aerosol optical and radiative properties over the Leh Ladakh, located in the climate sensitive Hindu Kush Himalayan region are examined using one year measurements from a newly installed sky radiometer from July 2023 to June 2024. Columnar aerosol optical depth (AOD), at 500 nm exhibits a distinct seasonal variation with peak during spring (0.104 ± 0.041) and minimum in autumn (0.077 ± 0.031), while Extinction Angstrom Exponent (EAE) is found to be maximum in winter (1.041 ± 0.205) and minimum (0.658 ± 0.225) in spring. The highest EAE in winter is complemented with the highest AOD_Fine-mode (0.071 ± 0.034) among the seasons which may be associated with the combustion of firewood, charcoal, kerosene or other fuels used to burn to bear the cold winter months, when temperature varied between −15 and −25 °C. Seasonal variation of Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) at 500 nm varied from 0.905 ± 0.055 (winter) to 0.942 ± 0.061 (summer), while the lowest value of SSA during winter is complemented with more absorbing aerosols during winter season. The dominance of fine mode aerosols during the winter seasons is also complemented by the bi-modal volume size distribution. However, the station is experiencing a negligible contribution of dust-aerosols (1%), followed by 18% mixed aerosols and 16% non-absorbing aerosols. The current observing site is dominated by absorbing aerosols which contributed by highly absorbing (49%), moderately absorbing (9%) and slightly absorbing (6%) during the one year of study period. The absorbing aerosols are characterized by high values of AOD_Fine-mode (0.061 ± 0.028), imaginary refractive-index (0.014 ± 0.009), EAE (0.932 ± 0.240) and low value of SSA_Total (0.872 ± 0.070). On the other hand, the non-absorbing aerosols are characterized by high values of AOD_Total (0.088 ± 0.040), SSA_Total (0.991 ± 0.016), SSA_Coarse-mode (0.978 ± 0.038), and low value of imaginary refractive-index (∼0.001). The estimated aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) reveals the high heating rates during spring (0.09 K day−1) among the seasons, while the heating rate is found to be highest by absorbing aerosols (0.08 K day−1) among the aerosol types."

 The construction of wind-sensitive structures in the Tibetan Plateau requires detailed information about the near-ground wind. Using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF), one-month numerical investigations on the boundary-layer wind and temperature were conducted considering the Yarlung Zangbo River Valley in the southeast of the Tibetan Plateau. By comparing with site observation, WRF has proved accurate in surface winds over highly complex terrain using a relatively coarse grid. Range analysis is applied to compare model parameters including four-dimensional data assimilation (FDDA) option, reanalysis data, and planetary boundary layer scheme. FDDA option has the strongest impact on wind results. The combination of grid-point data nudging, high-precision reanalysis data, and Quasi–normal Scale Elimination Scheme is recommended. Typical valley wind is observed and successfully simulated, characterized by a diurnal change of near-ground wind and temperature. Stronger winds and neutral air occur around sunset, while weaker winds and stable air appear near sunrise. The wind direction is restricted along the valley. Strong synoptic weather events disturb the local climate, minimize the terrain effects, and produce uniform winds and temperatures. A relatively large wind speed enhanced by the V-shape valley is found."

 Land surface models (LSMs) play a crucial role in the characterization of land-atmosphere interactions by providing boundary conditions to a regional climate model (RCM). This is particularly true over the Iberian Peninsula (IP), a region where a water-limited regime governs most of the territory. This work aims to optimize the Noah LSM with multiparameterization options (Noah-MP) configuration for characterizing heat fluxes in the IP when the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model v3.9.1 is used as RCM. To do that, a set of 70 experiments with a 1-year length has been completed using 35 combinations of Noah-MP parameterizations, both for a year with dry conditions in the IP (2005 year) and for a year with wet conditions (2010 year). Land surface heat fluxes and soil moisture simulated with Noah-MP coupled to WRF (WRF/Noah-MP) have been evaluated using as reference the available FLUXNET station data and CERRA-Land reanalysis data. In general, the results indicate that WRF/Noah-MP accurately simulates soil moisture and surface heat fluxes over the IP, especially for wetter climate conditions. The clustering method has presented an optimal configuration from 10 groups (Clusters from A to J), which showed that the WRF/Noah-MP parameterizations with the greatest influence on the simulation of surface heat fluxes over the IP are canopy stomatal resistance (CRS), surface exchange coefficient for heat (SFC), soil moisture factor controlling stomatal resistance (BTR), runoff and groundwater (RUN), and surface resistance to evaporation/sublimation (RSF). In addition, dynamic vegetation (DVEG) seems to influence simulations. Although several clusters/configurations showed reasonable results, experiment s27I in Cluster I with Jarvis CRS, Chen97 SFC, CLM-Type BTR, BATS RUN, and Adjusted Sellers to decrease RSURF for wet soil for RSF seem to be more adequate to simulate surface heat fluxes in the IP."

Single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing also revealed neonatal Tregcells with an immunomodulatory signature distinct from adult. Neonatal Tregcell ablation resulted in a dysregulated immune response, failed tenocyte recruitment, and impaired regeneration. Adoptive transfer further confirmed the unique capacity of neonatal Tregcells to rescue functional regeneration. We showed that neonatal Tregcells mitigate interleukin-33 (IL-33) to enable tenocyte recruitment and structural restoration, and that adult IL-33 deletion improves functional healing. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that Tregcells and IL-33 immune dysfunction are critical components of failed tendon healing and identify potential targets to drive tendon regeneration."

Here, we measured dendritic signals from individual sONα RGCs at different retinal locations. We measured both postsynaptic Ca2+signals at dendrites and presynaptic glutamate signals from bipolar cells (BCs). We found that temporal sONα RGCs exhibit, in addition to sustained-ON signals with only weak surrounds, signals with strong surround suppression, which were not present in nasal sONα RGCs. This difference was also present in the presynaptic inputs from BCs.

As SCLC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models mimic therapeutic responses, we perform genetic screens in chemosensitive PDX models to identify drivers of chemoresistance. cDNA overexpression screens identifyMYC,MYCN, andMYCL, while CRISPR deletion screens identifyKEAP1loss as driving chemoresistance. Deletion ofKEAP1switched a chemosensitive SCLC PDX model to become chemoresistant and resulted in sensitivity to inhibition of glutamine metabolism. Data from the IMpower133 clinical trial revealed ~6% of patients with extensive-stage SCLC exhibitKEAP1genetic alterations, with activation of a KEAP1/NRF2 transcriptional signature associated with reduced survival upon chemotherapy treatment.

Here, we show that during transmitter loading, SVs substantially increase in size, which is reversible and requires synaptophysin, an abundant membrane protein with an unclear function. SVs are larger when synaptophysin is knocked out, and conversely, liposomes are smaller when reconstituted with synaptophysin. Moreover, transmitter loading of SVs accelerates fusion in vitro, which is abolished when synaptophysin is lacking despite near normal transmitter uptake.

Sulfate (SO42−)–dependent AMO (S-DAMO) was the predominant AMO process at our study site due to tidal inputs of SO42−. However, SO42−dynamics responded differently to the treatments; warming reduced SO42−concentration by enhancing SO42−reduction, whileeCO2increased SO42−concentration by enhancing SO42−regeneration. S-DAMO rates mirrored these trends, with warming decreasing S-DAMO rates andeCO2stimulating them.

Elaborate14C results reveal that the forests ended around 2.1 thousand years before the present, with mild contemporaneous climate changes. The presence of burned marks on buried standing stumps suggests that the forests were destroyed by fire, consistent with fire attacks by the Han army during the conquest of the Nanyue Realm in 111 BCE. The swamp preserved the stumps underwater from the fire. Meanwhile, the increases in Poaceae and pioneer plants indicate a boost of human activity after the two conquests during 221 to 111 BCE, as supported by the increases in anthropogenic metal concentrations and population records."

Here, we exploit the multidimensional multiplexing properties of metalenses and experimentally demonstrate the realization of a compact STED lens with a single metasurface. A 635-nm right-handed circularly polarized excitation laser is focused by the metalens into a diffraction-limited Gaussian beam, while a 780-nm depletion beam with opposite chirality is converted into a high-quality donut-shaped focus on the same plane.

We showed that a mask training procedure using other-race facial disguises altered self-face perception and promoted identification with the other race. Shift in racial identification modulated the medial prefrontal activity, increased electrophysiological responses to pain expressions of other-race faces, enhanced the right premotor/frontal/insular activities in response to perceived painful stimulation to other-race individuals, and decreased own-race favoritism in altruistic decision-making. Furthermore, the medial prefrontal activity related to the shift in racial identification predicted greater neural responses to other-race pain after the training procedure.

Computational linguistic analysis showed that those integrating more noncentral events—those less semantically connected to other events within the narrative—wrote more original endings.

Using α-synuclein (αSyn)—a known VDAC1 cytosolic regulator—we found that higher-conductance substates correlate with increased on-rates of αSyn-VDAC2 interaction but shorter blockage times, maintaining a consistent equilibrium constant across all substates. This suggests that αSyn detects VDAC2’s dynamic structural variations before final binding.
