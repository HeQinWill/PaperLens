10.5194/acp-25-6069-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了东北大西洋地区暖边界层云中气溶胶与云相互作用对云的影响。研究使用了高分辨率的天气模型模拟，发现云系统边缘的非降水云容易蒸发，导致气溶胶干燥效应，并使气溶胶返回到累积模式以便未来活化。研究结果表明，引入更多气溶胶会显著增加环境中的CCN数量，从而在不同程度上提高液态水路径（LWP）值。该研究使用了WRF-Chem模型，该模型考虑了气溶胶化学成分的时空变化，这些成分与云凝结核（CCN）的形成有关。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术，但它研究了气溶胶和云的相互作用，以及气溶胶对云的影响，这些都是大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）所关注的重要参数。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，尤其是气溶胶和云的特性分析，以及模型验证。,"['aerosol-cloud interactions', 'cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)', 'liquid water path (LWP)', 'aerosol chemical components', 'WRF-Chem model', 'air quality']",Hsiang-He Lee;Xue Zheng;Shaoyue Qiu;Yuan Wang,Numerical case study of the aerosol–cloud interactions in warm boundary layer clouds over the eastern North Atlantic with an interactive chemistry module,"The study investigates how aerosol–cloud interactions affect warm boundary layer stratiform clouds over the eastern North Atlantic. High-resolution weather model simulations reveal that non-rain clouds at the edge of cloud systems are prone to evaporation, leading to an aerosol drying effect and a transition of aerosols back to the accumulation mode for future activation. The study shows that this dynamic behavior is often not adequately represented in most previous prescribed-aerosol simulations. 
 The presence of warm boundary layer stratiform clouds over the eastern North Atlantic (ENA) region is commonly influenced by the Azores High, especially during the summer season. To investigate comprehensive aerosol–cloud interactions, this study employs the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with a chemistry component (WRF-Chem), incorporating aerosol chemical components that are relevant to the formation of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and accounting for aerosol spatiotemporal variation. This study focuses on aerosol indirect effects, particularly the long-range transport of aerosols, in the ENA region under three different weather regimes: a ridge with a surface high-pressure system, a post-trough with a surface high-pressure system, and a weak trough. The WRF-Chem simulations conducted at a near-large-eddy scale offer valuable insights into the model's performance, especially in terms of its ability to use high spatial resolution to capture mesoscale cloud features across various weather regimes. Our result shows that introducing 5 times more aerosols to either non-precipitating or precipitating clouds significantly increases ambient CCN numbers, resulting in, to varying degrees, higher liquid water path (LWP) values. The substantial aerosol–cloud interaction especially occurs in the precipitating clouds and demonstrates the susceptibility of the LWP to changes in CCN under different regimes. Conversely, thin, non-rain clouds at the edges of a cloud system are prone to evaporation, exhibiting an aerosol drying effect. The aerosols released during this process transition back to the accumulation mode, facilitating future activation. This dynamic behavior is not adequately represented in prescribed-aerosol simulations."
10.5194/acp-25-6047-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文的标题和摘要都明确表明其与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。该研究利用OMI和TROPOMI卫星观测数据，评估了2005年至2019年期间欧洲地区人为氮氧化物（NOx）排放量的减少情况。研究重点在于卫星观测数据在量化和监测空气质量变化方面的应用，以及通过反演模型改进排放清单的准确性。因此，该论文直接涉及大气成分分析、卫星观测和空气质量监测等大气环境遥感技术领域。,"['NOx emissions', 'OMI', 'TROPOMI', 'Satellite observations', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Atmospheric composition analysis', 'Anthropogenic emissions', 'Emission inventory', 'Inverse modeling']",Audrey Fortems-Cheiney;Grégoire Broquet;Elise Potier;Antoine Berchet;Isabelle Pison;Adrien Martinez;Robin Plauchu;Rimal Abeed;Aurélien Sicsik-Paré;Gaelle Dufour;Adriana Coman;Dilek Savas;Guillaume Siour;Henk Eskes;Hugo A. C. Denier van der Gon;Stijn N. C. Dellaert,Assessing the ability to quantify the decrease in NOx anthropogenic emissions in 2019 compared to 2005 using OMI and TROPOMI satellite observations,"This study assesses the potential of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) satellite observations to inform about the decrease in anthropogenic emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in 2019 compared with 2005 at regional to national scales in Europe. Both the OMI and TROPOMI inversions show decreases in European NOx anthropogenic emission budgets in 2019 compared to 2005 but with different magnitudes. 
 There are great expectations about the detection and the quantification of NOx emissions using NO2 tropospheric columns from satellite observations and inverse systems. This study assesses the potential of the OMI-QA4ECV and TROPOMI satellite observations to improve the knowledge of European NOx emissions at the regional scale and to inform about the spatio-temporal variability of NOx anthropogenic emissions in 2019 compared to 2005, at the resolution of 0.5° over Europe.  We first characterize the level of consistency between retrievals from OMI-QA4ECV and from the more recent reprocessing of the TROPOMI data, called TROPOMI-RPRO-v02.04, and the implications of the possible inconsistencies for inversions. Furthermore, starting from European emission estimates from the TNO-GHGco-v3 inventory for the year 2005, regional inversions using the Community Inversion Framework coupled to the CHIMERE chemistry-transport model and assimilating satellite NO2 tropospheric columns from OMI and TROPOMI have been performed to estimate the European annual and seasonal budgets for the year 2019.  Both the OMI and TROPOMI inversions show decreases in European NOx anthropogenic emission budgets in 2019 compared to 2005. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the reductions of the NOx anthropogenic emissions is different with OMI and TROPOMI data, with decreases in EU-27 + UK between 2005 and 2019 of 16 % and 45 %, respectively.  A TROPOMI inversion giving more weight to the satellite data becomes consistent with the independent TNO-GHGco-v3 inventory for the year 2019, with annual budgets for EU-27 + UK showing absolute relative difference of only 4 %. These TROPOMI inversions are therefore in agreement with the magnitude of the decline in NOx emissions declared by countries, when aggregated at the European scale. However, our results – with OMI and TROPOMI data leading to different magnitudes of corrections on NOx anthropogenic emissions – suggest that more observational constraints would be required to sharpen the European emission estimates."

Marshall;David Dubbert;Mathias Hoffmann;Maren Dubbert,Simple water vapor sampling for stable isotope analysis using affordable valves and bags,"Water-stable isotopes are commonly used in hydrological and ecological research. Until now, measurements have been obtained either destructively or directly in the field. Here, we present a novel, affordable, and easy-to-use approach to measure the stable isotope signatures of soil water. Our gas bag approach demonstrates a high accuracy and extends usability by allowing water vapor samples to be collected and stored in the field without the need for an instrument or a permanent power supply. 
 Water-stable isotopes are commonly used in hydrological and ecological research. Until now, most measurements of soil or plant water isotopes have been made by taking a sample from the field and extracting its water in the laboratory. More recently, samples have been collected with gas-permeable membranes (GPMs) and measured in the field. These new methods, however, present challenges in achieving high-resolution measurements across multiple sites since they require significant effort and resources. Gas bag sampling offers the advantage of non-destructive, cost-efficient, easy-to-perform measurements without the need to bring a cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) analyzer into the field. We used gas-permeable membranes to extract samples of water vapor from the soil, which were then stored in multi-layer foil bags until analysis. The bags were modified with homemade connections to reduce leakage and simplify gas transfers. The bags were tested using laboratory standards to determine their maximum storage time, potential memory effects, and reusability. The storage experiment with new bags demonstrated the ability to store water vapor samples for up to 7 d while maintaining mostly acceptable trueness for δ2H and acceptable to questionable trueness for δ18O. Trueness was defined as the mean difference between the measured and known water vapor placed into the bags and precision by the standard deviation of replicate measurements. The memory experiment using new bags revealed that the influence of previous samples increased with duration of storage. In both experiments, the light standards seemed to result in less accuracy. The reuse experiment confirmed that the bags can be filled repeatedly, provided they are used for similar sample lines and flushed 10 times with dry air. To demonstrate bag applicability in the field, we compared measurements of stored samples to measurements made directly in the field. Storing beyond 24 h needs further investigation but appears promising. With new gas bags up to 24 h of storage, we found accuracies of 0.2 ‰ ± 0.9 for δ18O and 0.7 ‰ ± 2.3 for δ2H. When the bags were reused and stored up to 24 h, they yielded accuracies of 0.1 ‰ ± 0.8 for δ18O and 1.4 ‰ ± 3.3 for δ2H. The proposed system is simple, cost-efficient, and versatile for both lab and field applications; however, case-specific testing is necessary given the remaining uncertainties."

By sampling both open-ocean and island areas, these data can show how plankton size, diversity and abundance change with different environments. We also highlight the usefulness of high-speed plankton sampling when it is not possible to slow the boat during sailing as well as the value of this technique with respect to extending the sampling coverage and frequency. 
 This paper presents the quantitative imaging datasets collected during the Tara Pacific expedition (2016–2018) carried out on the schooner Tara. The datasets cover a wide range of plankton sizes, from microphytoplankton (> 20 µm in size) to mesozooplankton (a few centimetres in size), and non-living particles such as plastic and detrital particles. It consists of surface samples collected across the North Atlantic and the North and South Pacific Ocean from open-ocean stations (a total of 357 samples) and from stations located in coastal waters, lagoons or reefs of 32 Pacific islands (a total of 228 samples). As this expedition involved long distances and long sailing times, we designed two sampling systems to collect plankton while sailing at speeds of up to 9 knots. To sample microplankton, surface water was pumped aboard using a customised pumping system and filtered through a 20 µm mesh size plankton net (hereafter referred to as the deck net – DN). A high-speed net (HSN; 330 µm mesh size) was developed to sample the mesoplankton. In addition, a manta net (330 µm) was also used, when possible, to collect mesoplankton and plastics simultaneously. We could not deploy these nets at the reef and lagoon stations of islands. Instead, two bongo nets (20 µm) attached to an underwater scooter were used to sample microplankton. In addition to describing and presenting the datasets, the complementary aim of this paper is to investigate and quantify the potential sampling biases associated with these two high-speed sampling systems and the different net types, in order to improve further ecological interpretations. Regarding the imaging techniques, microplankton (20–200 µm) from the DN and bongo net were imaged directly aboard Tara using a FlowCam instrument (Fluid Imaging Technologies), whereas mesoplankton (>200 µm) from the HSN and manta net were analysed in the laboratory with a ZooScan system (back on land). Organisms and other particles were taxonomically and morphologically classified using the automatic sorting tools of the EcoTaxa web application; following this, validation or correction was carried out by taxonomic experts. For microplankton smaller than 45 µm, a subsample of 30 % of the annotations was 100 % visually validated by experts. More than 300 different taxonomic and morphological groups were identified. The datasets include the metadata and the raw data from which morphological traits such as size (equivalent spherical diameter) and biovolume were calculated for each particle as well as a number of quantitative descriptors of the surface plankton communities. These descriptors include abundance, biovolumes, the Shannon diversity index and normalised biovolume size spectrum, allowing the study of their structures (e.g. taxonomic, functional, size and trophic structures) according to a wide range of environmental parameters at the basin scale (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6445609, Lombard et al., 2023)."

From 2013–2020, local emissions dominated Beijing's pollution events. The Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan reduced regional transport pollution, but the eastern region showed the smallest decrease. Beijing should prioritize local emission reduction while considering the east region's contributions in future strategies. 
 Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is closely linked to human health, with its sources generally divided into local emissions and regional transport. This study combined concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) analysis with the HYSPLIT trajectory ensemble to obtain hourly resolution pollutant source results. The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was then employed to simulate local emissions and ambient PM2.5 in Beijing from 2013 to 2020. The results revealed that clean air masses influencing the Beijing area mainly originated from the north and east regions, exhibiting a strong winter and weak summer pattern. Following the implementation of the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (Action Plan) by the Chinese government in 2017, pollution in Beijing decreased significantly, with the most substantial reduction in regional transport pollution events occurring in the west region during summer. Regional transport pollution events were most frequent in spring, up to 1.8 times higher than in winter. Pollutants mainly originated from the west and south regions, while polluted air masses from the east showed the least reduction, and the proportion of pollution sources from this region was gradually increasing. The COVID-19 restrictions might have reduced PM2.5 concentrations in 2020. From 2013 to 2020, local emissions were the main contributors to pollution events in Beijing. The Action Plan has more effectively reduced pollution caused by regional transport, particularly during autumn and winter. This finding underscores the importance of Beijing prioritizing local emission reduction while also considering potential contributions from the east region to effectively mitigate pollution events."

This study conducted a comparative nontargeted analysis of Br-DBPs generated during chlorination and chloramination using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with high-resolution (HR) mass spectrometry (MS), including MS and tandem MS experiments. An advanced halogen extraction code identified halogenated compounds via isotopic patterns of chlorine (Cl) and bromine (Br), with MFAssignR assigning molecular formulas. Chlorination resulted in a total of 154 Br-DBPs, most containing carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and bromine (CHOBr), whereas chloramination generated 79 Br-DBPs, predominantly nitrogenous Br-DBPs (CHONBr), including 57 CHOBr and 22 CHONBr, effectively preserving aromatic structures within natural organic matter (NOM). Several Br-DBPs with strong instrument responses, including brominated aliphatic carboxylic acids and aromatic phenolic acids formed primarily during chlorination, were identified, whereas nitrogenous Br-DBPs were exclusive to chloramination. In silico toxicity assessments indicate that many Br-DBPs identified in this study, particularly those with multiple bromine substitutions and functional groups such as nitro and carboxylic acids in aromatic structures, exhibit substantially higher acute toxicity and mutagenic potential compared to regulated DBPs like bromoform and dibromacetic acid. These findings highlight the need to prioritize polybrominated, aromatic, and nitrogenous Br-DBPs in water treatment research and regulation."

Emission factors for carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and other gaseous and particulate effluents varied significantly across these conditions. By implementing a new Toxicity Score method, polyvinyl chloride was identified as the most hazardous fuel, followed by asphalt shingles and vinyl plank flooring under smoldering conditions at 21% oxygen concentration. Hydrogen chloride was the dominant toxicant across all test conditions, while formaldehyde was a major contributor at 25 kW/m2 and carbon monoxide became increasingly significant at 50 kW/m2. Hydrocarbon emissions increased markedly under pyrolysis conditions, particularly from synthetic materials like asphalt shingles. Notably, total particulate matter emissions varied under different conditions and were also influenced by fuel consumption efficiency.

Generalized linear models were fit to test the association between exposures and small-for-gestational-age (SGA), low birthweight (LBW), and Fenton growth z-score outcomes, adjusting for confounders. Living in a high climate vulnerability index neighborhood was tested as an effect modifier. During preconception, increases in heat stress and WF measures were associated with higher odds of SGA. Living in the most climate-vulnerable neighborhoods during preconception significantly modified and nearly doubled the odds of SGA with exposure to heat stress. Similarly, heat stress and WF exposure in trimester-specific time periods were associated with adverse birth outcomes. Conversely, third-trimester exposures were associated with lower odds of LBW. Throughout pregnancy, two measures of infant size (SGA and Fenton z-scores) were lower among those with greater exposure to multiple WF exposures. This study highlights how living in more climate-vulnerable neighborhoods significantly modifies the effect of heat stress on SGA, suggesting that the increasing adaptation capacity of communities may strengthen climate change resilience."

We estimate how a 2010 SO2 NAAQS change that altered policy targeting from peak hourly emissions to annually aggregated hourly emissions affected SO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants. Using data on electricity generating unit (EGU) characteristics, SO2 emissions, fuel prices, and PM2.5 NAAQS classifications from 2001 to 2019 from public data sources, we estimate that, after a county was classified under the 2010 SO2 standard, EGUs reduced SO2 emissions during daily maximum hours by 31.6% (95% CI [−0.381, −0.247]) at the 99th percentile and 34.4% (95% CI [−0.424, −0.253]) at the 50th percentile.

Our results also suggest the new standard had the same effect on peak hourly SO2 emissions as median and that plants in counties prioritized for early designation were less responsive to the policy change.

We investigated the underlying mechanism involving the orchestration of physiological processes between the host and its gut microbiota. We found that SMZ acted as a precondition or driver, while PLA acted as an environmental selective pressure, directionally shaping the gut microbiota communities. This altered microbiota demonstrated an increased ability to break down PLA into lactic acid, activating intestinal gluconeogenesis and consequently generating glucose. Excessive glucose shifted the hepatic glucose-fat balance toward fat accumulation, resulting in triglyceride and lipid droplet accumulation and overweight in the fish.

Herein, an all-solid-state piezoelectric-mediated strategy is proposed for the piezocatalytic destruction of dioxins induced by ball milling (BM) under ambient and solvent-free conditions. Dioxin-like compounds of harmful solid substances including fly ash (FA), sediment, and soil can be effectively eliminated, filling the gap between dioxin-contaminated matrices purification and piezocatalytic technology. Using the dibenzofuran as a dioxin model pollutant, an optimized removal efficiency up to 100% (below the detection limit) in the FA of municipal waste incineration was obtained after stainless-steel BM with the rotary speed of 600 rpm. This process was affected by piezocatalyst species, moisture content, ball-sample mass ratio, and ball size. Under the initiation of ball collisions, a surface piezopotential of 200 mV on commercially tetragonal barium titanate with a piezoelectric coefficient of 195.3 pm/V appeared, enabling favorable charge transfer between the interface. A unique mechanism of combining mechanochemical activation, hydrogen-atom abstraction, and mechano-radicals attack is ascribed to the elimination of dibenzofuran in the all-solid-state system. Multiple reactions such as cleavage, hydrogenation, rearrangement, and mineralization/coupling were subsequently involved. This approach demonstrates a promising way of destructing dioxins in hazardous solid waste without the need of additional solvent, heating, or pressurization."

Comprehensive identification of these TPs is imperative for environmental risk assessment and optimization of oxidation methodologies. Traditional experimental approaches for TP elucidation are often hindered by substantial financial and technical constraints, limiting their applicability in high-throughput scenarios. Here, we introduce TP-Transformer, an advanced deep learning framework designed to predict both the structures of TPs and their corresponding formation pathways. Trained on Chem_Oxi_2K, a meticulously curated data set comprising 2780 pollutant degradation reactions, TP-Transformer achieved a notable accuracy of 86.28% in TP prediction. The model adeptly reconstructs complete degradation pathways, addressing the intricate challenge of pathway elucidation. Attention analyses indicate that the TP-Transformer discerns reactive moieties within substrates and correlates them with specific reaction conditions, emulating expert-level chemical reasoning. Experimental validations corroborate the model’s robustness, with accurate TP predictions ranging from 80.20 to 92.86% for five pollutants absent from the training data set.

Nonetheless, no respective empirical data has been reported so far. In this study, particle samples from a road simulator and a highway tunnel were investigated with a validated imaging method. Different density and size fractions of both samples were measured separately, acquiring sizes and settling velocities of more than 30,000 individual particles. In addition, tire marker polymers were analyzed for each fraction via thermal extraction desorption-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Finally, the acquired particle data was combined according to the fractions’ estimated tire contents in order to deduce detailed probability distributions of particle size and settling velocity for the actual TRWP from both samples. Weighted by TRWP-incorporated tire mass, median diameters of 54 and 44 μm as well as median settling velocities of 0.65 and 0.22 mm/s were found for TRWP from the road simulator and highway tunnel, respectively. This study thus provides the first ever empirical data on TRWP settling velocities in water, which can be highly valuable input for modeling the environmental transport of TRWP and for dimensioning TRWP retention systems."

NOM can form aggregates due to its flexible framework and amphiphilic properties. However, the three-dimensional (3D) structural transformation of NOM and its role in controlling organic desorption has remained unexplored. In this work, sorption of dibutyl phthalate (DBP) on NOM was first investigated. Correlation analysis and density functional theory calculations revealed that nonpolar structures in NOM predominantly governed DBP sorption (309.4–387.8 mg/g). Subsequently, the DBP-NOM aggregates were prepared via solvent dialysis and freeze-drying, and DBP desorption was examined under various pH conditions. DBP desorption hysteresis increased with increasing pH, ranging from 26.02% (pH 9) to 63.91% (pH 4). At low pH, DBP desorption hysteresis was more pronounced for fulvic acids (FAs) than for humic acids (HAs). The 3D structure of aggregates was described using experimental characterizations and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. The core–shell structure of NOM aggregates inhibited DBP desorption at high pH. The hydrophobic part of FAs was more likely to interact with DBP than HAs due to the higher degree of oxidation  and polarity. This work innovatively highlights how 3D structures of NOM aggregates modulate the desorption hysteresis of HOCs."

Recently, HONO has been identified as a primary and secondary product of wildfire smoke, yet mechanisms for its formation are poorly understood. In this study, wildfire-emitted organic compounds, such as levoglucosan (LG), syringic acid (SA), and vanillic acid (VA), were studied to investigate their impact on HONO production from aqueous nitrate photochemistry. The presence of SA and VA increased gas-phase HONO yields by 3- and 5-fold, respectively, while LG increased HONO production the most, 6-fold. Furthermore, a nonlinear relationship between HONO and LG concentration was found. Aqueous nitrate samples exposed to lower concentrations of LG were shown to produce an LG-derived carbonyl compound, whereas the samples exposed to a higher LG concentration resulted in an LG dimer. The mechanisms as to how these differences in products affect HONO enhancement are discussed. Gas-phase HONO yields were quantified using incoherent broadband cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy (IBCEAS), and identification of any condensed phase products from aqueous nitrate samples was done by high resolution mass spectrometry. Studying nitrate photochemistry in the presence of wildfire-emitted organic compounds can potentially minimize the knowledge gap on the observed high concentrations of gaseous HONO formation during biomass burning events."

This study investigates the differences in the macro‐ and micro‐structures between EPEs with and without lightning over eastern and southern China, as well as their underlying environmental conditions. EPEs are defined as convective features with maximum hourly rain rate reaching the gauge‐based climatological extreme precipitation threshold (99.9%). Results show that EPEs with lightning (EPE_LIG) account for 51%, and the other 49% EPEs have no lightning (EPE_NoLIG), whose fractional maxima are located along the coast. Most EPE_NoLIGs are embedded in large organized precipitation systems, although their convective cores are smaller than EPE_LIGs. The parent systems of both EPE types are multicellular in nature, but those of EPE_NoLIGs are more likely to produce multiple extreme precipitation centers. EPE_LIGs have the most intense convection, which is stronger than regular thunderstorms (NonEPEs with lightning), while the convective intensity of EPE_NoLIGs is just close to NonEPEs. Microphysical processes of the two types of EPEs differ significantly. The downward increasing radar reflectivity profiles and drop size distribution analyses suggest that warm‐rain processes highly dominate (94.1%) in the formation of extreme precipitation in EPE_NoLIGs. Even for EPEs with very active ice‐based processes (EPE_LIGs), warm‐rain processes still contribute significantly (83.31%). The large‐scale environments of EPE_NoLIGs are featured by a relatively convectively stable but deep moist troposphere and enhanced low‐level southwesterly winds, highlighting the importance of excessive moisture transport and convergence in these events."

The subgrid variability of aerosol and precursor gas emissions is better represented at the higher resolution. The budget analysis of aerosols in eastern China shows that wet/dry deposition is not sensitive to the model resolution, but sulfate formation (e.g., sulfuric acid gas condensation and aqueous‐phase chemistry) increases and aerosol transport out of the region decreases as the resolution increases, which lead to increased aerosol burden and lifetime. Compared to UN‐CESM, VR‐CESM simulates stronger descending motion along the mountain edge and blocking effects of mountain peaks, which weakens the dispersion of aerosols over the Taihang Mountains and Sichuan Basin. In comparison to surface observations, VR‐CESM simulates higher aerosol concentrations in urban areas than UN‐CESM does. Over eastern China, increasing model resolution improves the simulated aerosol optical depth (AOD) in terms of spatial distribution and magnitude. Over northern (southwestern) China, the simulated AOD increases by ∼17% (∼32%) with increasing resolution and becomes more comparable to satellite retrievals. The improvements are more significant in urban areas and regions with complex terrains than in rural and coastal areas. The regional annual‐mean aerosol direct radiative effect in eastern China simulated by VR‐CESM increases by ∼54% (−1.08 W/m2 more cooling) at the top of the atmosphere compared to UN‐CESM."

The Weather Research and Forecasting Solar (WRF‐Solar) model, especially its sub‐grid cloud scheme (CLD), plays a key role in GHI prediction. This study mainly uses various CLD schemes (icloud option in different WRF‐Solar version, CLD1 v4.4 and CLD3 v3.8, v4.2, and v4.4) to explore the key factors in cloud radiation processes and causes of deviations that affect GHI in China. Results illustrate that WRF‐Solar generally overestimates GHI, with poorer simulations in Henan and southwestern China. The impact on GHI is minimized when the cloud fraction (CF) is the only influencing factor (default CLD) at 3 km horizontal resolution. There will be a compensating effect of CF and cloud condensate content for GHI feedback, but under extremely low CF, its impact exceeds the compensation from increased cloud condensate content. Employing the default climatological effective particle radius of clouds in the RRTMG radiation scheme would improve GHI prediction, especially for Henan Province. All CLD3 versions have enhanced simulations on GHI compared to CLD1 due to the incremental adjustments in cloud condensate content, with CLD3 v3.8 (CLD3_38) showing the best performance, which would reduce MB by 54.8% and RMSE by 11.1% at 13:00 across China. Furthermore, comparing CLD3_38 with Fengyun4A shows WRF‐Solar overestimates high clouds, causing discrepancies in cloud phase representation, especially in northwest China, while poor GHI simulation in southwestern China is linked to inadequate low and medium cloud representation."

Besides, the contribution of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) to tropical precipitation extremes remains loosely quantified on various scales, in particular on kilometer scales. Here, we construct a framework to analyze the cooccurrence of extreme precipitation at km‐scale and 1° × 1 day scale to compare their properties in terms of precipitation morphology and regional predominance. Using a storm‐tracking algorithm, we contrast the occurrence and precipitation statistics for two types of convective systems across 10 global storm‐resolving models and one geostationary satellite product. We do not find a large statistical dependence between rain extremes on these two scales, and they occur in distinct regions. Heavy km‐scale events occur mostly over continents and 40% of them are produced by MCSs in observations. Their intensity is independent from the area of rain features. Conversely, heavy 1° × 1 day rain intensities are dependent on the area of rain features, and occur more frequently over oceans, and a third of these events are produced by MCSs. Overall, the transition from deep to MCSs connect extremes across both scales. Compared to observations, models consistently underestimate the precipitating surface and show large discrepancies in the contribution of convective systems to precipitation extremes at each scale. This diagnostic is a key criterion for evaluating the ability of global storm‐resolving models to represent how individual convective systems produce realistic heavy rain distributions."

One large pyroCb event over the Sparks Lake fire that generated persistent overshooting tops had a remarkable amount of lightning activity, with 5,600 total lightning strikes, while the rest of the pyroCb events corresponded with lower injection altitudes and minimal to no observed lightning activity. The cloud‐to‐cloud (CC) to cloud‐to‐ground (CG) lightning ratio (CC:CG) in this Sparks Lake pyroCb was significantly higher than in other high‐based storms but displayed similar lightning density and slightly lower peak current distributions. All clean and smoke‐filled thunderstorms produced significant levels of lightning activity, regardless of their cloud‐top altitudes.

The Mixed type, most frequent and longest‐lived, features the most extensive and coldest anomalies across Eurasia uniformly distributed over East Asia. The North type shows the coldest anomalies in northeast Asia with weaker effects in southern East Asia. The weakening trend in CAO intensity observed in East Asia is primarily due to long‐term changes in the Mixed types. Anomalous temperature patterns and circulation variations are diverse with the South type associated with a pre‐existing strong stratospheric polar vortex state and the Mixed and North types with a pre‐existing weak vortex state. Under those stratospheric backgrounds, even similar wave activities can result in dissimilar upper‐tropospheric circulation anomalies over East Asia leading to different extents and magnitudes of anomalous coldness.

It has long been controversial and poorly understood how vegetation physiological effects influence meteorological drought characteristics with increasing CO2. To investigate that, we employ multiple CO2 sensitivity experiments of the state‐of‐the‐art Earth System Models (ESMs) in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). We quantify drought characteristics in response to rising CO2 using two drought indices: the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), with SPEI calculated using both the Penman‐Monteith method (SPEI_PM) and energy‐only method (SPEI_Rn). Our findings reveal that plant physiological effects can robustly induce more intense, frequent, and prolonged droughts under elevated CO2 levels. Spatially, drought intensity as measured by SPI, SPEI_PM, and SPEI_Rn, resulting from CO2 physiological forcing, is projected to increase over 61%, 69%, and 78% of global terrestrial areas, respectively. Notably, we found that the contribution of plant physiological effects (βPHY ${\beta }_{\text{PHY}}$) to drought characteristics, including intensity, frequency, and duration, exhibits a significant and spatially extensive declining trend with rising CO2 across most land areas. This declining trend is robustly depicted in both the multi‐model mean and individual models. Vegetation coverage plays an important role in the spatial pattern of βPHY ${\beta }_{\text{PHY}}$. CO2 physiological forcing therefore exerts greater impacts in the tropics, particularly over tropical forests. Our results demonstrate that drought characteristics are expected to become less dependent on plant physiological effects with increasing CO2, a consideration essential for accurate drought projections."

Global atmospheric chemical transport models tend to underestimate the magnitude of N deposition in China and fail to reproduce such a shift. How do underestimation and trend shift in N deposition influence China's terrestrial carbon (C) uptake remains unclear. Here we used a new N deposition data set and three independent methods to investigate the effect of N deposition on terrestrial C uptake in China. We found that the magnitude and trend of China's terrestrial C sink induced by N deposition (∆CNdep) would be underestimated during 1990–2015 when using commonly used global atmospheric N deposition data sets. Despite the decrease in N deposition trend, the increasing rate of ∆CNdep changed from 4.42 Tg C yr−2 in 1990–2005 to 5.64 Tg C yr−2 in 2006–2015, which was dominated by subtropical and tropical monsoon region. The interactive effect of N deposition with other environmental factors has a greater impact on the trend of ∆CNdep than direct effect. Our results highlight the rising terrestrial C uptake as N deposition stabilizes and the crucial role of interaction mechanisms among global change factors in assessing the impact of declining reactive N inputs on China's future land C sinks under C neutrality targets."

Reanalysis products are among the most widely used for driving impact models, evaluating climate models, or bias‐correcting and downscaling model outputs to generate climate change projections. However, they are often outperformed in accuracy by other GGPPs, particularly in tropical regions, including areas of the Global South. Therefore, we assessed the utility and suitability of GGPPs for climate and health research by examining how differences and uncertainties in these products affect area‐level precipitation estimates, often used in health studies when epidemiological data are linked to administrative units. We compared reanalysis (ERA5/‐Land) with satellite‐based (CHIRPS, PERSIANN‐CDR) and interpolated gauge‐based products (CRUTS, GPCC), each a viable candidate to serve as reference climatology in climate change impact assessments. We focused on seasonal patterns, disease‐related bioclimatic variables, and climate change‐relevant indices, such as the number of wet or dry periods. Our findings revealed substantial variation in the accuracy of local precipitation estimates across GGPPs, with differences in maximum pixel precipitation values exceeding 75% between ERA5‐Land and CHIRPS. These differences in GGPPs translated into area‐level precipitation and, consequently, in vector carrying capacity estimates, demonstrating their impact on health assessments. Our analysis focused on Brazil and Colombia, two diverse countries differing for example, in orography, climate, and size. Each product was evaluated against national station data. Our results indicate that estimating tropical precipitation is particularly challenging for reanalysis, while CHIRPS demonstrated the best overall performance."

 The ephemeral, supraglacial meltwater ponds of the McMurdo Ice Shelf’s undulating ice serve as analogues for refugia where eukaryotic organisms could have thrived during the Cryogenian period. The seafloor sediment and debris lined ponds support the growth of a diverse array of cyanobacterial mat communities and provide habitats for a variety of protists and meiofauna. Here, we show that these eukaryotic assemblages, assessed by steroid biomarker and 18S rRNA gene analyses, inform long-standing questions regarding the diversity of, and controls on, community composition in these environments. Sixteen photosynthetically active microbial mats from meltwater ponds, a 700-year-old relict microbial mat, and a microbial mat from the Bratina Lagoon were analysed for their sterol compositions. These sterols were subjected to simulated diagenesis via catalytic hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis affording their sterane hydrocarbon counterparts, facilitating comparisons with ancient settings. Pond salinity appeared to be a factor influencing the sterol distributions observed. Analyses of 18S rRNA gene sequences conducted on the modern mats independently confirm that the ponds host diverse eukaryotes, including many types of microalgae, protists, and an array of unclassifiable organisms. Our findings support the hypothesis that supraglacial meltwater ponds like those of the McMurdo ice are strong candidates for refugia that sheltered complex life during Snowball Earth episodes.

 Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) remodels the host chromatin structure and induces a host-to-virus transcriptional switch during lytic infection. We combine super-resolution imaging and chromosome-capture technologies to identify the mechanism of remodeling. We show that the host chromatin undergoes massive condensation caused by the hijacking of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) and topoisomerase I (TOP1). In addition, HSV-1 infection results in the rearrangement of topologically associating domains and loops, although the A/B compartments are maintained in the host. The position of viral genomes and their association with RNAP II and cohesin is determined nanometrically. We reveal specific host–HSV-1 genome interactions and enrichment of upregulated human genes in the most contacting regions. Finally, TOP1 inhibition fully blocks HSV-1 infection, suggesting possible antiviral strategies. This viral mechanism of host chromatin rewiring sheds light on the role of transcription in chromatin architecture.

 Most previous studies on the climatic effects of Antarctic ozone have focused primarily on the Southern Hemisphere. This study suggests that September-October Antarctic ozone anomalies account for approximately 12% of the interannual variability in East Asian summer precipitation. The precipitation anomalies linked to the Antarctic ozone index are characterized by increased rainfall between the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers in central East China and decreased rainfall over Southeastern China. Our analysis reveals that positive Antarctic ozone anomalies during September–October are associated with a negative phase of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) during the subsequent boreal winter. The resulting SAM-related circulation anomalies exert a significant influence on sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) in the southwestern Indian Ocean, particularly near the Madagascar region. Owing to the ocean’s thermal inertia, these SSTAs persist into the subsequent boreal spring, altering the meridional circulation and leading to anomalous subsidence near 15°N, which in turn results in elevated skin temperature anomalies (SKTAs) over the Indochina Peninsula. Numerical experiments conducted with the Community Atmospheric Model version 5 further confirm the role of southwestern Indian Ocean SSTAs in driving this response. Land memory and positive land–atmosphere feedbacks sustain these SKTAs into boreal summer. Consequently, the SKTAs-induced heating over the Indochina Peninsula enhances the southwesterly monsoon and strengthens precipitation over central East China, as demonstrated by linear baroclinic model experiments. Furthermore, the Specified-Chemistry version of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model is used to verify the remote influence of Antarctic ozone anomalies on East Asian summer precipitation. Our findings provide an additional predictor for summer precipitation over East Asia and deepen our understanding of the interhemispheric impacts of Antarctic ozone."

 Intense short-duration summer rainfall in mountainous areas can trigger a variety of natural hazards, including flash floods, debris flows, and urban floods. Warming is expected to intensify extreme sub-hourly rainfall events in response to an increased atmospheric water vapor content and invigorated storm dynamics. Here, we employ a new physically-based statistical model to estimate the projected intensification of sub-hourly and hourly extreme rainfall across 299 high-mountain Alpine stations in France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and Austria. Analyzing the projected intensification for 10-min rainfall at 1 to 3 °C of warming confirms a general intensification at a rate of 9% °C−1 over the Alpine region, with a stronger intensification at higher elevations. With a 2 °C increase in average regional temperature relative to the 1991–2020 period, extreme rainfall statistics over the Alps are likely to undergo significant changes, resulting in a two-fold increase in the probability of occurrence of the extreme rainfall levels used for infrastructure design and risk management."

 Understanding the changing flood magnitude and frequency is crucial for managing flood risks. Current flood projections are hindered by uncertain rainfall changes and inadequate representation of spatial-temporal rainfall characteristics from global climate models. Here we develop a framework for flood projection integrating large ensemble climate model outputs and dynamic downscaling simulations. By unveiling the shifting importance of changes in atmospheric circulation and water vapor to rainfall extremes of varying magnitudes, a scaling ratio is derived to constrain rainfall projections from thermodynamics-perturbed experiments. Applying this framework to the North China Plain, we reveal substantial rainfall increases partially attributed to more favorable synoptic conditions. This leads to a nearly fivefold rise in population exposure to moderate and high flood depths (i.e., 0.5 ~ 2 m). The region with heightened flood risk is spatially offset from that with rainfall increases. These findings highlight an urgency for improved flood risk management in the densely populated region.

 Addressing current environmental crises requires a fundamental shift in our relationship with nature. Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities can guide diverse pathways towards sustainable and just futures, rooted in ancestral knowledge and relational values that challenge the status quo. Indigenous knowledge and practices, however, are still largely underappreciated, not being recognized as agents of transformative change. Inspired by the Seeds of Good Anthropocenes approach, this research identifies types of initiatives driven by Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities.

Three out of these six groups, i.e., Empowering, Reconnecting people and nature, and Intercultural and ancestral education (named here as I-Seeds), apply knowledge co-design processes led by Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities and have higher transformative potential. Such initiatives also implement amplification strategies of scaling deep that catalyze profound shifts in values and mindsets beyond the I-Seed. This study draws attention to the importance of Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities and their (retro)innovations to foster sustainability transformations.

 Carbon mineralization in humidified carbon dioxide offers a promising route to mitigate anthropogenic emissions in a world stressed by water security. Despite its technological importance, our understanding of carbonation in water-poor environments lags, as traditional dissolution-precipitation pathways struggle to explain the adsorbed water nanofilm-mediated reactivity. Here, we utilize in operando X-ray diffraction (XRD) and advanced molecular simulations to investigate nanoconfined reactions driving forsterite carbonation, the magnesium-rich olivine. By examining magnesium ion dissolution and transport in atomistic simulations of the forsterite-water-carbon dioxide interface and comparing these with the in operando XRD activation energies, we identify both processes as rate-limiting at saturation. Our simulations reveal a mechanistic view of interfacial carbonation, where dissolution and precipitation are mediated by anomalous quasi two-dimensional diffusion. The transport process involves intermittent diffusive hopping in the desorbed state, separated by crawling events that are spatially short but temporally long. This understanding transcends carbon mineralization, with implications for understanding the transport of contaminants in geosystems, the design of multifunctional materials, water desalination, and molecular recognition systems.

 Northern peatlands are an important carbon store in mid to high latitudes, but become increasingly discontinuous in the higher latitudes, associated with temperature and precipitation limits on plant growth. During the last four decades, mean annual temperatures in the Arctic have increased on average by ~3 °C. Warmer temperatures and longer growing seasons likely drive increases in plant productivity throughout northern latitudes, but it is not clear whether warming has resulted in lateral spread of Arctic peatlands. Using long time-series Landsat satellite data, coupled with information gathered from fieldwork in situ, we show that Arctic peatlands have likely undergone lateral expansion over the last 40 years. On 21 transects from the edges of 16 extant peatlands in the European and Canadian Arctic (both high and low Arctic locations from 62 to 79°N), over two thirds of the peatland edges we studied showed statistically significant peak-summer greening (as Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) in the last 15 to 20 years, compared to the period 1985–1995. Peak summer moisture (as normalised Difference Moisture Index) levels remained stable or increased at most study sites.

 Burning the reserves of the 200 largest fossil fuel companies could generate 673 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide, far exceeding the remaining 400-gigatonne budget needed to limit warming to 1.5 °C by 2050. Rapid action is needed to reduce, or where necessary, offset emissions from burning fossil fuels but it remains unclear who will bear the cost. Our study aims to show the limits of offsetting using reserve data from the 200 largest fossil fuel companies sourced from Fossil Free Funds and carbon capture rates from peer-reviewed ecological studies. We show that if the cost of offsetting fossil fuel emissions exceeds $150 per tonne of carbon dioxide, fossil fuel companies could have negative market valuations. Using the social cost of carbon, we find the climate-related externalities associated with these reserves exceed their market valuation. Afforestation is often proposed as a carbon sequestration solution, but offsetting emissions from fossil fuel reserves would require covering an area the size of North and Central America solely with trees, displacing communities, farmland and existing habitats.

 Remote sensing has revolutionized crop mapping and monitoring, providing valuable insights for sustainable agricultural practices. However, successfully implementing remote sensing-based crop type identification in tropical regions remains challenging. Unlike temperate regions, tropical areas benefit from favorable weather conditions that support diverse land management practices, resulting in complex crop dynamics that are difficult to model. Additionally, frequent cloud cover in tropical regions limits the use of optical data during extended periods of the year, making SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) a more attractive alternative. Traditional models like Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) have been useful in classifying crop types using spatial and temporal contexts. However, these models often use fixed inputs, optimizing them towards a specific task, and fail to consider the CRFs’ feedback for end-to-end learning features and the spatiotemporal dependencies. This work addresses this gap by introducing an end-to-end hybrid model that combines deep learning with CRFs to incorporate prior knowledge-based modeling of crop dynamics. The proposed framework integrates a backbone encoder–decoder to capture spatial and temporal contexts, with a CRF block that models temporal dynamics by accounting for label dependencies between adjacent epochs. This block facilitates the integration of both data-driven and expert-domain temporal constraints, allowing the framework to adapt to local agricultural practices and enhance crop dynamics modeling. We evaluate the framework using multi-temporal SAR image sequences from two municipalities in Brazil, comparing the effectiveness of learned versus prior-knowledge temporal constraints. The results show improvements of up to 30% in per-class F1 score and 12% in average F1 score compared to a baseline model that excludes temporal dependencies. These findings highlight the value of incorporating prior knowledge-driven temporal constraints into crop mapping models."

 Deep learning approaches have gained prominence for automatic glacier boundary extraction due to their localized nature of convolutional operations, potentially leading to incomplete or fragmented glacier pixel representations. Moreover, the accuracy of extracting glacier boundaries from a single remote sensing image (RSIs) is often influenced by seasonal snow, clouds, shadows, and frozen lakes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel model for extracting the non-debris-covered areas of glaciers (NDCAG) from RSIs, termed GlacierSTR-UNet. This model enhances information flow and overall performance by embedding the Swin Transformer (ST) as an encoder into a U-shaped architecture and reduces training time and improves gradient handling by incorporating the ResNet block in the decoder. We deploy the GlacierSTR-UNet model on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to efficiently generate multiple NDCAG results from RSIs taken at different periods. A pixel-by-pixel synthesis algorithm is then applied to aggregate the multiple NDCAG extraction results, producing the final NDCAG. Accuracy assessments indicate that GlacierSTR-UNet achieves an overall accuracy of 0.8817, and the relative deviation between automatically extracted and manually interpreted NDCAG remains within 2 %. Finally, we obtain the NDCAG datasets for the periods of 2015/2016 and 2022/2023 in High-Mountain Asia, revealing a reduction of 4,185.12 ± 7,870.96 km2 in NDCAG from 2015/2016 to 2022/2023. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in efficiently and accurately extracting NDCAG, highlighting its potential for monitoring glacier changes and supporting glacier inventory efforts."

 Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have demonstrated exceptional potential across various generative modeling tasks. Despite evident promise in semantic segmentation, their adoption for remote sensing remains limited primarily due to computationally demanding inference. While initial approaches using DDPMs in remote sensing achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art models, the multi-step nature of their image generation process poses a major bottleneck. To address this limitation, this paper investigates three key strategies for accelerating inference: (1) optimizing training and inference steps, (2) applying DDPM acceleration techniques adapted to segmentation task (including Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models, Improved Denoising Diffusion Models, and Progressive Distillation), and (3) thoroughly analyzing the trade-off between accuracy improvement and additional inference time when using test-time augmentation. These strategies are extensively tested with two established remote sensing semantic segmentation datasets focused on buildings and roads. Finally, we compare the optimized diffusion-based model with state-of-the-art convolutional-based models in terms of accuracy and inference times, showing the narrowing gap between both approaches and the increasing viability of diffusion-based segmentation for practical applications."

 Recent advancements in drone-based fire early warning technologies have significantly improved fire detection, particularly in remote and forested areas where drones are widely utilized. However, the constrained battery life and limited computational resources of drones present challenges for real-time fire detection. Existing methods primarily focus on fire target identification without considering the distinct color and thermal characteristics of flames, leading to suboptimal detection accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a Flame-Specific Attention (FSA) mechanism, which integrates heat conduction principles and flame shape features to enhance receptive field expansion while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, the Neck of the model is optimized with a Focal Modulation module to improve feature fusion, and a variable multi-attention detection head is introduced to refine detection precision. Experimental results on our Comprehensive Fire Scene Dataset (containing 3,905 images) demonstrate that our model achieves a mean Average Precision ([email protected]) of 87.7%, surpassing both Vision Transformers (ViTs) and traditional CNN approaches. Compared to the YOLOv10 baseline, our approach improves precision by 5.7% while maintaining an inference speed of 182 FPS, enabling real-time deployment in edge-computing scenarios such as drone-based fire detection. Additionally, the model effectively detects small- and medium-sized flames, reducing false positives in challenging lighting conditions (e.g., sunset and urban illumination).

 Since 2013, China's air quality has significantly improved due to the reduction of anthropogenic emissions. The influence of long-distance transport of biomass burning emissions in Southeast Asia (BBSEA) on air quality in southern China (SC) would likely continue to increase, especially under the trend of global warming.

For three severe pollution events in SC in 2014, the contributions of BBSEA to daily average BC concentrations in GZ are 0.08–0.19 μg m−3 (2 %–5 %) at the surface and 0.20–0.78 μg m−3 (59 %–73 %) at 700 hPa. In KM, the corresponding contributions are 0.27–0.54 μg m−3 (15 %–33 %) and 0.25–0.45 μg m−3 (28 %–45 %). The transport time of BBSEA to the surface of GZ (KM) is about 3–6 days (1–5 days). The shift in wind fields from southwest to west and stronger wind speeds in April likely shorten the transport time of BBSEA to SC.

 A significant increase in summer precipitation was observed in Northwest China (NWC) from 1961 to 2014, posing opportunities and challenges for the local ecosystem and human society. Using multi-model pre-industrial control simulations, and historical and single-forcing simulations from the state-of-the-art MIROC6 model, we attributed this wetting trend and explored the relative roles of individual external forcings. Our finding indicated that external forcing is the primary driver of this observed wetting, with anthropogenic forcing—dominated by greenhouse gases (GHG) and secondarily by anthropogenic aerosols (AA)—playing a significant role than natural forcing. Moisture budget analysis indicated that intensified moisture flux convergence, driven by circulation changes, is a key mechanism behind the NWC wetting in both GHG and AA simulations. Specifically, GHG forcing alters the Asian subtropical westerly jet (ASWJ), inducing a southward shift of the western branch and a weakening of the eastern branch. These changes correspond to an anomalous cyclone (anticyclone) in the west (east) of NWC, promoting moisture convergence over NWC of anomalous southwesterly and southeasterly winds. AA forcing weakens the ASWJ, producing a meridional dipole pattern of an anomalous anticyclone (cyclone) in the north (south), along with lower-level anomalous anticyclone over Mongolia and Northeast China. This circulation pattern facilitates moisture transport from the western North Pacific into inland NWC via anomalous easterlies and intensified moisture flux convergence."

 Char and soot represent distinct types of elemental carbon (EC) with varying sources and physicochemical properties. However, quantitative studies in sources, atmospheric processes and light-absorbing capabilities between them remain scarce, greatly limiting the understanding of EC's climatic and environmental impacts. For in-depth analysis, concentrations, mass absorption efficiency (MAE) and stable carbon isotope were analyzed based on hourly samples collected during winter 2021 in Nanjing, China. Combining measurements, atmospheric transport model and radiative transfer model were employed to quantify the discrepancies between char-EC and soot-EC. The mass concentration ratio of char-EC to soot-EC (RC/S) was 1.4 ± 0.6 (mean ± standard deviation), showing significant dependence on both source types and atmospheric processes. Case studies revealed that lower RC/S may indicate enhanced fossil fuel contributions, and/or considerable proportions from long-range transport. Char-EC exhibited a stronger light-absorbing capability than soot-EC, as MAEchar (7.8 ± 6.7 m2g−1) was significantly higher than MAEsoot (5.4 ± 3.4 m2g−1)(p < 0.001). Notably, MAEchar was three times higher than MAEsoot in fossil fuel emissions, while both were comparable in biomass burning emissions. Furthermore, MAEsoot increased with aging processes, whereas MAEchar exhibited a more complex trend due to combined effects of changes in coatings and morphology. Simulations of direct radiative forcing (DRF) for five sites indicated that neglecting the char-EC/soot-EC differentiation could cause a 10 % underestimation of EC's DRF, which further limit accurate assessments of regional air pollution and climate effects. This study underscores the necessity for separate parameterization of two types of EC for pollution mitigation and climate change evaluation."

This study set the spatial domain to 20°N–43°N and 117°E–132°E, primarily to encompass South Korea and the Yellow Sea. By employing a deep learning-based data-to-data (D2D) translation technique, we trained and tested the D2D model to learn the GEMS AOD values from infrared (IR) bands at the Advanced Meteorological Imager (AMI) onboard the co-located GK-2A satellite. We used the paired daytime GEMS AOD datasets and ten IR brightness temperature (BT) and BT difference (BTD) measurements at the GK-2A AMI sensor. The trained D2D model was subsequently applied to nighttime AMI BT and BTD data to simulate daytime-like nighttime GEMS AOD values, assuming consistency in IR datasets without reliance on solar reflection. Our proposed nighttime AOD generation model was quantitatively evaluated using daytime GEMS AOD as a reference. The results showed excellent performance, with a probability of detection of 0.888, a false alarm ratio of 0.159, a critical success index of 0.760, a Heidke skill score of 0.778, and a proportion correct of 0.895 for the case on February 25, 2022, at 05:45 UTC (14:45 Korea Standard Time).

Here we show that DRT9 forms a hexameric complex with its upstream noncoding RNA (ncRNA) to mediate antiphage defense by inducing cell growth arrest through abortive infection. Upon phage infection, the phage-encoded ribonucleotide reductase NrdAB complex increases intracellular deoxyadenosine triphosphate levels, activating DRT9 to synthesize long, polyadenylate [poly(A)]–rich single-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA), which likely sequesters the essential phage single-stranded DNA binding (SSB) protein and disrupts phage propagation. We further determined the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the DRT9-ncRNA hexamer complex, providing mechanistic insights into its cDNA synthesis. These findings highlight the diversity of RT-based antiviral defense mechanisms, expand our understanding of RT biological functions, and provide a structural basis for developing DRT9-based biotechnological tools."

However, their broader application is limited by complex manufacturing processes and the necessity for lymphodepleting chemotherapy, restricting patient accessibility. We present an in vivo engineering strategy using targeted lipid nanoparticles (tLNPs) for messenger RNA delivery to specific T cell subsets. These tLNPs reprogrammed CD8+T cells in both healthy donor and autoimmune patient samples, and in vivo dosing resulted in tumor control in humanized mice and B cell depletion in cynomolgus monkeys. In cynomolgus monkeys, the reconstituted B cells after depletion were predominantly naïve, suggesting an immune system reset. By eliminating the requirements for complex ex vivo manufacturing, this tLNP platform holds the potential to make CAR T cell therapies more accessible and applicable across additional clinical indications."

Despite the transformative impact, visible-light photoredox catalysis remains constrained by the thermodynamic limits of photon energy and inefficiencies arising from unproductive back electron transfer, both of which become particularly pronounced in thermodynamically demanding reactions. In this work, we introduce an organic photoredox catalyst system that overcomes these obstacles to drive chemical transformations that require super-reducing capabilities. This advancement is accomplished by coupling the energy of two photons into a single chemical reduction, whereas inefficiencies from back electron transfer are mitigated through a distinct proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism embedded in the catalyst design. The super-reducing capabilities of this organic catalyst system are demonstrated through efficient application in a broad scope of challenging arene reductions."

However, the neuronal circuits that mediate this process remain elusive. From a circuit screen in mice, we identified a group of thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) neurons activated during sleep deprivation (SD) and required for sleep homeostasis. Optogenetic activation of RE neurons leads to an unusual phenotype: presleep behaviors (grooming and nest organizing) followed by prolonged, intense sleep that resembles RS. Inhibiting RE activity during SD impairs subsequent RS, which suggests that these neurons signal sleep need. RE neurons act upstream of sleep-promoting zona incerta cells, and SD triggers plasticity of this circuit to strengthen their connectivity. These findings reveal a circuit mechanism by which sleep need transforms the functional coupling of a sleep circuit to promote persistent, deep sleep."

Leveraging the patchwork of bag policies across different geographic scales in the United States and citizen science data on 45,067 shoreline cleanups, we assess the impact of these policies on plastic bag litter. We find that plastic bag policies lead to a 25 to 47% decrease in plastic bags as a share of total items collected at cleanups relative to areas without policies, with taxes possibly further reducing shoreline litter. At a time when many jurisdictions are considering bag policies, while others are preemptively prohibiting them, our study provides evidence that they mitigate shoreline plastic pollution."

This universal process is mediated by peptide release factors (RFs) that recognize stop codons and catalyze the hydrolysis of peptidyl transfer RNA (peptidyl-tRNA) on the ribosome, presumably by activating a water molecule. We report structures of the bacterial ribosome in complex with peptidyl-tRNA and RFs in the prepeptide release state. No hydrolytic water molecule was seen in the peptidyl transferase center. Instead, RFs induced rearrangements of the peptidyl-tRNA adenine 76 (A76) ribose pucker that orient the 2′-OH for the nucleophilic attack onto the neighboring carbonyl group. These findings suggest a catalytic mechanism of RF-mediated peptide release and provide a structural basis for the universal conservation of the catalytic domain in peptide RFs."

Single-cell RNA sequencing can detail these constraints by systematically profiling homologous cells. The conserved invariant embryonic lineage ofCaenorhabditis elegansandC. briggsaemakes them ideal for comparing cell type gene expression across evolution. Measuring the spatiotemporal divergence of gene expression across embryogenesis, we find a high level of similarity in gene expression programs between species despite tens of millions of years of evolutionary divergence. Nonetheless, thousands of genes show divergence in their cell type specific expression patterns, with enrichment for functions in environmental response and behavior. Neuronal cell types show higher divergence than others such as the intestine and germline. This work identifies likely constraints on the evolution of developmental gene expression."

We found that the exposure data required for retrospective risk assessment were available for less than 1% of chemicals with potential environmental concern (n≈ 297,000). In contrast to the situation with persistent and often inorganic contaminants in the 1970s, current monitoring schemes lack control of a much larger number of organic chemicals and their degradates.

Sourness, one of the primary tastes, is aversive in mammals, whereas many birds frequently consume acidic fruits, suggesting a potential tolerance. Our study uncovers a mechanism enabling avian sour tolerance that involves changes to the sour receptor [otopetrin 1 (OTOP1)]. We demonstrate that sour tolerance is a conserved trait in birds, with avian OTOP1 exhibiting acid-induced inhibition and OTOP1 modulation affecting sour perception and tolerance. Ancestral reconstruction reveals that the increase in acid tolerance may have evolved at the same point in the songbird phylogeny as the regain of sweet sensing in this clade. This shift might have enabled songbirds to feed on a wider range of fruits, affecting the evolution and diversification of the songbird radiation."

We investigated basal forebrain cholinergic neurons modulating olfactory bulb (OB) circuits in mice. The activity of cholinergic feedback axons in OB correlated with orofacial movements, with little responses to passively experienced odors. When mice engaged in an olfactory task, OB cholinergic axons rapidly shifted their response patterns from movement correlated to odor aligned. This response shift was absent in cholinergic axons projecting to the dorsal cortex during olfactory task engagement, and in OB, during an auditory task. Inactivation of OB-projecting cholinergic neurons impaired olfactory task performance and reduced odor responses in OB granule cells. Thus, the cholinergic system dynamically modulates sensory processing in a modality-specific and context-dependent manner."
