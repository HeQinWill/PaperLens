10.5194/acp-25-13429-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文利用EMeRGe飞机观测数据和WRF/CMAQ模型，评估了中国地区黑碳（BC）和一氧化碳（CO）的排放情况。研究通过对比观测数据和模型结果，评估了不同排放清单的适用性，并对中国地区的BC和CO排放量进行了估算。该研究结果表明，现有的HTAPv2.2z排放清单对中国地区的BC排放量存在高估，而对CO排放量存在低估。这项研究对于改进排放清单、提高空气质量模型预测精度以及制定更有效的气候变化减缓策略具有重要意义。,"['Black Carbon (BC)', 'Carbon Monoxide (CO)', 'Emission Inventory', 'Air Quality Modeling (WRF/CMAQ)', 'Airborne Observation (EMeRGe)', 'Anthropogenic Emissions', 'Combustion Emissions', 'Short-Lived Climate Forcers', 'Emission Scaling']",Phuc Thi Minh Ha;Yugo Kanaya;Kazuyo Yamaji;Syuichi Itahashi;Satoru Chatani;Takashi Sekiya;Maria Dolores Andrés Hernández;John Philip Burrows;Hans Schlager;Michael Lichtenstern;Mira Poehlker;Bruna Holanda,Assessing BC and CO emissions from China using EMeRGe aircraft observations and WRF/CMAQ modelling,"Black carbon and CO are important to climate change. EMeRGe airborne observation can identify the suitability of emission inventories used in the CMAQv5.0.2 model for Asian polluted regions. GFEDv4.1s is suitable for fire emissions. Anthropogenic BC and CO emissions from the Philippines (REASv2.1) are insufficient. The estimated Chinese emissions in 2018 are 0.65±0.25 TgBC, 166±65 TgCO, and 12.4±4.8 PgCO2, suggesting a reduction and increment for China's BC and CO emissions in the HTAPv2.2z inventory. 
 Accurate estimates of short-lived climate forcer emissions are essential for effective climate change mitigation, yet large uncertainties remain across Asia. This study integrates the Weather Research and Forecasting/Community Multiscale Air Quality version 5.0.2 (WRF/CMAQv5.0.2) simulations with Effect of Megacities on the Transport and Transformation of Pollutants at Regional and Global Scales (EMeRGe) airborne observations from spring 2018 to refine combustion-related emissions of black carbon (BC) and CO over East Asia. Aircraft observations, which are less affected by near-surface processes, confirmed the accuracy of the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFEDv4.1s) inventory near Thailand. In contrast, anthropogenic BC and CO from the Regional Emission Inventory for Asia (REASv2.1) in the Philippines showed negative biases. For Chinese air masses, the Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution with corrections (HTAPv2.2z) resulted in overestimation for BC and underestimation for CO, agreeing with our prior ground-based findings on Fukue Island. Scaling Chinese BC emissions using an observation/model ratio (0.48 ± 0.13) gave our best estimate of 0.65 ± 0.25 Tg BC yr−1. Chinese emissions were further estimated at 166 ± 65 Tg CO yr−1 and 12.4 ± 4.8 Pg CO2 yr−1 using the BC/CO and CO/CO2 ratios from observations. These results suggest HTAPv2.2z requires revisions of 50 % downward for BC and 20 % upward for CO, particularly over central East China during spring. Other inventories including Community Emissions Data System (CEDSv2021_02_05) remain notably biased, while Evaluating the Climate and Air Quality Impacts of Short-Lived Pollutants (ECLIPSEv6b) and Tropospheric Chemistry Reanalysis (TCR2) estimates fall within our identified uncertainty ranges."
10.5194/acp-25-13453-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注雷暴云的极化雷达结构与闪电活动之间的关系，通过分析雷达数据（如差分反射率ZDR和差分传播相移KDP）来研究云的微物理过程和动力学特征，并探讨这些特征与闪电发生的关联。研究旨在提高对雷暴云内部结构和闪电活动机制的理解，从而改进闪电预警能力。虽然该研究使用了雷达遥感技术，但其重点在于雷暴云的物理过程和闪电活动，而不是大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['thunderstorm', 'lightning activity', 'polarimetric radar', 'cloud microphysics', 'differential reflectivity (ZDR)', 'specific differential phase (KDP)', 'updraught', 'supercooled liquid water', 'graupel']",Chuanhong Zhao;Yijun Zhang;Huiyan Zhai;Zhe Li;Dong Zheng;Xueyan Peng;Wen Yao;Sai Du;Yuanmou Du,Bridging the polarimetric structure and lightning activity of isolated thunderstorm cells during the cloud life cycle,"Lightning activity is highly related to the signatures of polarimetric radar on the basis of cloud electrification physics. However, few studies have focused on bridging the polarimetric structure and lightning activity during the cloud life cycle. Here, we evaluated the sequence and interactions of polarimetric parameters for indicating lightning activity from the perspective of the cloud life cycle, and the cloud microphysics of the polarimetric structure were explored. 
 Polarimetric structures detected by radar can characterize cloud microphysics and dynamics. Many studies have indicated that differential reflectivity (ZDR) and specific differential phase (KDP) columns, which serve as proxies for updraught strength, are related to lightning activity; moreover, the quantities of ice and supercooled liquid water strongly influence the occurrence of lightning flashes via non-inductive charging. However, the sequence or interactions among these factors with dynamics and microphysics from the perspective of the cloud life cycle are uncertain. Here, we improve the “3D mapping columns” method to identify and quantify the ZDR/KDP columns, which is based on Cartesian grid datasets; this method is sensitive in the early phase of cloud formation. Our study bridges the polarimetric structure and lightning activity within 15 isolated thunderstorms during the cloud life cycle. The results indicate that microphysical variations in supercooled liquid water and graupel yield better correlation coefficients for the lightning activity prediction at short warning times (e.g. 6 min) than dynamical variations in the ZDR column volume do; however, the trend of the ZDR column volume implies good performance at longer warning times (e.g. 12 min). The KDP column is probably absent in the early phase of convection development; however, it will occur in the later stage with heavily cold cloud processes, replacing the ZDR column to indicate updraughts within the reflectivity core when obvious graupels and hailstones occur. Our study improves the understanding of the polarimetric structure, which is related to dynamics and microphysics, and is also associated with lightning activity."
10.5194/acp-25-13299-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注对流层臭氧的辐射强迫估算，利用IAGOS飞机观测数据和离线辐射模型，评估了不同时间段（1994-2004年作为基准，对比2011-2016年、2017-2019年和2020-2023年）的对流层臭氧趋势和气候影响。研究发现，对流层臭氧水平的增长趋势逐渐停止，甚至在高层对流层有所下降，相应的，年代际臭氧辐射强迫也在逐渐减小。该研究强调了臭氧垂直分布对对流层臭氧辐射强迫的重要性。由于涉及大气成分（臭氧）的监测和分析，以及气候变化这一环境应用，因此与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['tropospheric ozone', 'radiative forcing', 'IAGOS aircraft observations', 'tropospheric ozone column', 'ozone vertical profiles', 'climate change', 'air quality']",Pasquale Sellitto;Audrey Gaudel;Bastien Sauvage,Decadal tropospheric ozone radiative forcing estimations with offline radiative modelling and IAGOS aircraft observations,"Tropospheric ozone is a potent greenhouse gas: its anthropogenic levels rise contributes to climate change. We evaluate tropospheric ozone trends and climate impacts with aircraft data and a radiative model, comparing a baseline period (1994–2004) to different recent time periods (2011–2016 to 2020-2023). Tropospheric ozone levels increasing trends progressively stopped and even decreased in the upper troposphere. Correspondingly, the decadal ozone radiative forcing is progressively decreasing. 
 We use an offline radiative transfer model driven by IAGOS aircraft observations to estimate the tropospheric ozone radiative forcing (RF) at decadal time scale (three time intervals with a common starting period in 1994–2004 and ending periods: 2011–2016, 2017–2019 and 2020–2023), over 11 selected Northern Hemispheric regions. We found a positive trend in the tropospheric ozone column (TOC) for the three time intervals, even if decadal trends are progressively reduced from 2011–2016 (ΔTOC +3.6 ± 2.0 DU, +14.8 ± 11.5 %, 2.5 ± 1.4 DU per decade) to 2017–2019 (ΔTOC +3.9 ± 3.9 DU, +17.5 ± 22.1 %, 2.0 ± 2.0 DU per decade) to 2020–2023 (ΔTOC +3.5 ± 2.8 DU, +13.8 ± 12.1 %, 1.5 ± 1.2 DU per decade). The progressively reduced average TOC decadal trends in 2020–2023 and 2017–2019, with respect to 2011–2016, originate from stagnation in ΔTOC in more recent time intervals (especially in the COVID and post-COVID crisis periods) and decreases of trends of the more radiative efficient upper tropospheric ozone. These average trend reductions are accompanied with reductions of the tropospheric ozone RF, from 2011–2016 (41.6 ± 24.0 mW m−2 per decade) to 2017–2019 (27.6 ± 36.7 mW m−2 per decade) to 2020–2023 (14.6 ± 25.6 mW m−2 per decade). The total tropospheric ozone RF sensitivity varies between 18.4 ± 7.4 mW m−2 DU−1, in 2011–2016, and 11.1 ± 10.4 mW m−2 DU−1, in 2020–2023. Our decadal RF estimates vary from being ∼ 25 %–90 % larger (2011–2016 and 2017–2019 ending periods) to ∼ 30 % smaller (2020–2023 ending period) than the most recent global average RF estimates with online modelling. Our study underlines the importance of the evolution of ozone vertical profiles for the tropospheric ozone RF."
10.5194/acp-25-13393-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了气候模型在多大程度上能够准确模拟气溶胶与云之间的相互作用，特别是通过分析2014-2015年Holuhraun火山爆发后气溶胶对云的影响。研究利用卫星遥感观测数据，评估了八个先进的全球气候模型（GCMs）对火山气溶胶影响下云变化的模拟效果。论文重点关注气溶胶的直接和间接效应对云微观物理特性（如云滴大小和数量）以及宏观特性（如云液态水含量）的影响，并探讨了模型在模拟这些效应时的差异。最终，研究估计了Holuhraun火山爆发对全球辐射强迫的影响。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，涉及空气质量监测（通过SO2排放），卫星观测（用于云特性分析）和大气成分分析（气溶胶和云）。,"['aerosol-cloud interactions', 'climate models', 'satellite remote sensing', 'aerosol radiative forcing', 'cloud microphysics', 'cloud liquid water content', 'sulfur dioxide', 'volcanic eruption', 'AeroCom', 'GCMs']",George Jordan;Florent Malavelle;Jim Haywood;Ying Chen;Ben Johnson;Daniel Partridge;Amy Peace;Eliza Duncan;Duncan Watson-Parris;David Neubauer;Anton Laakso;Martine Michou;Pierre Nabat,How well are aerosol–cloud interactions represented in climate models? – Part 2: Isolating the aerosol impact on clouds following the 2014–2015 Holuhraun eruption,"The 2014–15 Holuhraun eruption created a vast aerosol plume that acted as a natural experiment to assess how well climate models capture changes in cloud properties due to increased aerosol. We find that climate models represent the observed shift to smaller, more numerous cloud droplets well. However, climate models diverge in their aerosol-induced changes to large-scale cloud properties, particularly cloud liquid water content. Our study shows that Holuhraun had a cooling effect on the Earth. 
 Aerosols significantly influence Earth's radiative balance, yet considerable uncertainty exists in the underpinning mechanisms, particularly those involving clouds. Aerosol–cloud interactions (ACIs) are the most uncertain element in anthropogenic radiative forcing, hampering our ability to constrain Earth's climate sensitivity and understand future climate change. The 2014–2015 Holuhraun volcanic eruption in Iceland released sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the lower troposphere on a level comparable to continental-scale emissions. The resultant volcanic plume across an often near-pristine region of the northern North Atlantic Ocean presents an ideal opportunistic experiment to explore ACI representation within general circulation models (GCMs). We present Part 2 of a two-part AeroCom (Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models) Phase III inter-model comparison study that utilises satellite remote sensing observations to assess modelled cloud responses to the Holuhraun attributed volcanic aerosol within eight state-of-the-art GCMs during September and October 2014. We isolate the aerosol effect from meteorological variability and find that the GCMs – particularly their multi-model ensemble response – adeptly capture the observed cloud microphysical changes associated with the ACI first indirect effect (i.e. Twomey effect). Meanwhile, a clear divergence exists in the GCM responses of large-scale cloud properties, namely cloud liquid water content, expected from the precipitation suppression mechanism of the ACI second indirect effect (i.e. rapid adjustments). We attribute this to limitations and differences in their autoconversion schemes under high aerosol loading, specifically in sub-grid-variability  representations. Finally, our multi-model ensemble estimates that Holuhraun had a global radiative forcing of −0.11 ± 0.04 Wm−2 across September and October 2014."

Davis;Klaus Keller;Sha Feng,Application of PRIM for understanding patterns in carbon dioxide model-observation differences,"We apply the Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM) technique to airborne CO2 and meteorological data to better understand atmospheric conditions and implications for carbon dioxide model-observation-mismatches. We found PRIM is capable of separating observations from different seasons and levels based on atmospheric conditions. Large magnitude carbon dioxide model-observation-differences were associated with non-typical atmospheric conditions, with implications for transport model evaluation. 
 Reducing uncertainties in regional carbon balances requires a better understanding of CO2 transport in synoptic weather systems. Here, we apply the Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM), a data-mining method to identify high-density regions for a target-class within an input parameter space, to airborne observations of potential temperature, wind speed, water vapor mixing ratio, and CO2 dry mol fraction gathered during the Atmospheric Carbon and Transport (ACT)-America Summer 2016 and Winter 2017 campaigns. ACT observations were targeted at expert-designated cases of fair weather and near-frontal warm and cold sector air at atmospheric boundary-layer, lower-, and higher free tropospheric levels (ABL, LFT, and HFT, respectively).We investigate atmospheric characteristics of these pre-defined cases and associated CO2 model-observation-differences in the mesoscale WRF-Chem model. PRIM results separate winter- and summertime observations as well as observations from ABL, LFT, and HFT with enrichment factors of 4.0–20.5 inside the PRIM box compared to the entire dataset but cannot distinguish between near-frontal warm and cold sector observations in the higher free troposphere. Analyzing of the parameter space constrained by PRIM, we find that large magnitude model observation differences preferentially associated with times when atmospheric conditions are less typical. This association suggests that PRIM could provide a useful tool for isolating atmospheric conditions with large-magnitude and non-Gaussian CO2-residuals for targeted transport model evaluation and to potentially improve inversion results during synoptically active periods."
10.5194/acp-25-13343-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了平流层准两年振荡(QBO)对厄尔尼诺-南方涛动(ENSO)与华北平原PM2.5浓度之间关系的非线性影响。研究发现，在东风QBO期间，ENSO对PM2.5的影响更强。厄尔尼诺和东风QBO年份，PM2.5浓度因不利气象条件而上升；反之，拉尼娜和东风QBO年份，PM2.5水平下降。研究将这些变化归因于行星波动力学。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术，但其研究的PM2.5浓度、大气环流、气象因素等都与大气环境遥感监测密切相关，例如可以通过卫星观测PM2.5浓度，分析大气成分和气象条件。,"['PM2.5', 'Air Quality Monitoring', 'Atmospheric Circulation', 'ENSO', 'QBO', 'Planetary Waves', 'Meteorological Factors']",Xiadong An;Wen Chen;Tianjiao Ma;Lifang Sheng,Nonlinear effects of the stratospheric Quasi-Biennial Oscillation on ENSO modulating PM2.5 over the North China Plain in early winter,"Air pollution in the North China Plain is tends to be influenced by El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and stratospheric Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO). During El Niño and easterly QBO, pollution rises, while La Niña and easterly QBO improve air quality through changes in atmospheric circulation and weather conditions. 
 The North China Plain (NCP) experiences severe air pollution, with PM2.5 (fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 µm) as the primary pollutant, especially in early winter (November to December). The PM2.5 concentrations in this period are significantly modulated by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In this study, we have found that the stratospheric Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) exerts a nonlinear impact on the relationship between ENSO and PM2.5 concentrations over the NCP in early winter. During the easterly QBO (EQBO) phase, ENSO's influence on PM2.5 concentration is stronger compared to the westerly QBO (WQBO) phase. In El Niño and EQBO years, PM2.5 concentrations rise due to meteorological factors like a shallower boundary layer, higher relative humidity, and intensified southerly wind anomalies. Conversely, during La Niña and EQBO years, PM2.5 levels decrease due to opposite meteorological conditions. The study attributes these changes to planetary wave dynamics. During El Niño and EQBO years, upward-propagating planetary waves in mid-latitudes enhance upper-level divergence over Eurasia, strengthening westerlies. These westerlies guide Rossby wave trains into Northeast Asia, forming a strong anomalous anticyclone that worsens air pollution over the NCP. In La Niña and EQBO years, downward-propagating planetary waves induce divergence in sub-polar regions, strengthening westerlies that facilitate La Niña-related wave trains. These wave trains trigger cyclonic circulation over Northeast Asia, improving air quality in the NCP. These findings underscore the complex interplay between ENSO, QBO, and atmospheric dynamics in shaping regional air pollution."

Both the lidar ratio (LR) and the depolarization ratio (DPR) exhibit an asymptotic trend with dust particle size. Two parameterization schemes were developed: one to estimate the DPR of a single dust particle given its size and the other to estimate the DPR of dust particles with a lognormal particle size distribution given the effective radius. 
 The lidar backscattering properties of Asian dust particles, namely the lidar ratio (S) and backscattering depolarization ratio (δ), were studied using a discrete dipole approximation (DDA) model. The three-dimensional morphology of the dust particles was reconstructed in fine detail using the focused ion beam (FIB) tomography technique. An index based on the symmetry of the scattering matrix was developed to assess the convergence of random orientation computation using DDA. Both S and δ exhibit an asymptotic trend with dust particle size: the S initially decreases, while the δ increases with size, before both approach their asymptotic values. The lidar properties were found to have statistically insignificant dependence on effective sphericity. The presence of strongly absorbing minerals, such as magnetite, can greatly reduce the dust's single-scattering albedo and δ. Utilizing the robust asymptotic trend behavior, two parameterization schemes were developed: one to estimate the δ of a single dust particle given its size and the other to estimate the δ of dust particles with a lognormal particle size distribution given the effective radius. The parameterization scheme was compared with results based on the TAMUdust2020 database, showing hexahedrons to reasonably represent realistic geometries with similar physical properties."

It achieves mean squared error = 0.299 and R² = 0.941 for log10ki , overcoming single-oxidant model limits. Vreact advances pollutant formation insights and supports emission control strategies, aiding global air quality and public health efforts. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) significantly influence global atmospheric chemistry through oxidative reactions with oxidants.  These reactions produce key precursors to the formation of atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3), which in turn play a crucial role in regulating O3 pollution and reducing PM2.5 concentrations. With the increasing diversity of VOCs, the need for advanced modeling techniques to accurately estimate the atmospheric oxidation reaction rate constants (ki, where i∈{OH,Cl,NO3, or O3}) has become more urgent. Here we introduce Vreact, a Siamese message passing neural network (MPNN) architecture that jointly models VOC–oxidant reactivity. The model simultaneously predicts log 10ki values and achieves a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.299 and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.941 on the internal test set. This framework overcomes the single-oxidant constraint of traditional models, enabling unified and scalable prediction of VOC oxidation kinetics across multiple oxidants. An interactive web tool (http://vreact.envwind.site:8001/, last access: 17 September 2025) is provided to facilitate non-expert access to reactivity screening. Vreact offers valuable insights into the formation and evolution of atmospheric pollutants and serves as a critical resource for developing effective control and emission strategies, ultimately supporting global efforts to mitigate air pollution and improve public health."

We studied oxygenated organic molecules, key intermediates, in a complex urban environment in China. Using an advanced analytical method, we identified major chemical pathways and how environmental factors influence them. Our findings enhance the understanding of atmospheric chemistry, offering insights for better environmental and climate policies. 
 Oxygenated organic molecules (OOMs), which are low-volatility intermediates produced via volatile organic compound (VOC) oxidation, play a critical role in secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation through gas-to-particle conversion. Despite recent advancements in OOM characterization, the high complexity of OOM spectra poses a significant challenge in the interpretation of their sources. This study investigates OOM formation in a Chinese megacity using an improved analytical strategy that integrates binned positive matrix factorization (PMF) on multiple subrange mass spectral analysis. Unlike traditional approaches that handle mass spectral peak identification and chemical interpretation sequentially, our method simultaneously optimizes both, reducing uncertainties associated with peak assignment and chemical analysis. The method successfully identified 2571 OOM molecules and systematically revealed major OOM formation pathways through 11 distinct factors: five daytime photochemical processes, four nighttime NO3-driven oxidation processes and two regional mixed sources. Notably, this approach enabled the successful separation of sesquiterpene oxidation products in ambient measurements – compounds previously unidentified by traditional full-mass-range analysis owing to their weak signals. The method captured dynamic changes in OOM composition under varying environmental conditions, demonstrating the influence of temperature and NOx levels on OOM formation, as well as the volatility-dependent patterns influenced by condensation sink (CS). This improved analytical strategy provides new insights into atmospheric OOM chemistry and establishes a robust foundation for future studies of VOC–OOM–SOA conversion mechanisms."

The emission factors, chemical composition characteristics and source profiles of volatile organic compounds were determined. The hydroxyl radical total reactivity and compositions of evaporative emissions were quantified, and identified key volatile organic compounds reactive species contributing to atmospheric photochemical processes. 
 Vehicle evaporation emission is one of the important sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the atmosphere. Research on its emission factors and chemical composition, especially the emissions from in-use vehicles under the new regulatory standards, is still scarce and affects the understanding of evaporation emissions. In this work, evaporative emission measurement for in-use gasoline vehicles was carried out for the China VI and China V vehicles, and their emission factors, chemical compositions and hydroxyl radical total reactivity (kOH) were measured. These three evaporative emission processes, hot soak loss (HSL), diurnal breathing loss (DBL) 24 h, and DBL 48 h emission factors, China V vehicles can reach 3.2, 4.6 and 7.6 times that of China VI vehicles, and high mileage vehicle aging and abnormal evaporative emission control systems can significantly increase emissions. In the HSL process, aromatics dominate, with contributions from China VI and China V reaching 44.1 % and 42.8 %, followed by light carbon alkanes (LC-alkanes, ≤ C6). In the DBL process, the chemical components were dominated by LC-alkanes, contributing 40.7 %–50.5 %. The source profiles of evaporative emissions have been established, with n-butane (3.2 %–26.1 %), isopentane (6.2 %–13.5 %), toluene (6.1 %– 16.0 %) being the more important components. It was also discovered that n-pentane/ethane and methyl tert-butyl ether/benzene with can be used to discriminate the sources of evaporative emissions and exhaust. The kOH analysis revealed that branched chain alkenes (BC-alkenes), linear alkenes and aromatics were the most reactive components, such as mainly 2-methyl-2-butene, 2-methyl-1-butene, trans-2-pentene and toluene etc. The measurement of BC-alkenes has expanded our understanding of highly reactive components. It is necessary to strengthen the measurement of high reactivity alkenes, especially BC-alkenes, in future research."

This study tested downwind models using point sensors. A non-standard eddy covariance (EC) failed due to instrumentation issues, while the Gaussian plume inverse model (GPIM) and backward Lagrangian stochastic (bLs) model gave more reliable results. The bLs was the most accurate for single sources, with the best performance at 15 min averaging and 5° wind sectors. 
 The dependable reporting of methane (CH4) emissions from point sources, such as fugitive leaks from oil and gas infrastructure, is important for profit maximization (retaining more hydrocarbons), evaluating climate impacts, assessing CH4 fees for regulatory programs, and validating CH4 intensity in differentiated gas programs. Currently, there are disagreements between emissions reported by different quantification techniques for the same sources. It has been suggested that downwind CH4 quantification methods using CH4 measurements on the fence line of production facilities could be used to generate emission estimates from oil and gas operations at the site level, but it is currently unclear how accurate the quantified emissions are. To investigate the accuracy of downwind methods, this study uses fence-line simulated data collected during controlled-release experiments as input for a non-standard closed-path eddy covariance (EC), the Gaussian plume inverse model (GPIM), and the backward Lagrangian stochastic (bLs) model in a range of atmospheric conditions. This study's EC attempt was unsuccessful due to data collection and instrumentation issues, resulting in invalid results characterized by underestimated emissions, large negative fluxes, and cospectra/ogives that deviated from their ideal shapes. Consequently, the EC results could not be compared with the GPIM and bLS model. The bLs model demonstrated the highest accuracy for single-release single-point emissions, though it exhibited greater uncertainty than GPIM under multi-release conditions. Across the GPIM and bLs model, the most reliable quantification was achieved with 15 min averaging and a narrow 5° wind sector range. Although EC was limited in this context, future studies should consider employing a standard EC system and further optimizing GPIM and bLs approaches – particularly for complex multi-source scenarios – to enhance quantification accuracy and reduce uncertainty."

Franco;Kyle J. Gorkowski;Katherine B. Benedict,Developing A Custom-Built Metal Aerosol Processing Chamber: Analysis of Aerosol Coagulation at Low Humidities,"We introduce a new, medium-sized metal chamber to observe how tiny aerosol particles behave in very dry conditions. We used the chamber to track how particles clump together over time. We found that although the particles behave differently at first, they eventually settle into similar patterns, with smoke clumping a bit more due to its unique shape. Overall, our work demonstrates that the chamber produces reliable results and can be adapted for future studies under more humid conditions. 
 We have developed an intermediate size (906 L) aerosol processing chamber, and this work reports on the design and initial characterization of dry aerosol experiments. Specifically, we are determining wall-loss and coagulation correction factors using the observed size distribution measurements for surrogates of common aerosol classes: sodium chloride, sucrose, and biomass burning aerosol smoke. Results show that, on average, sodium chloride, sucrose, and smoke wall-loss rates converge to similar values on relatively short time scales (< 1 h). The fitted coagulation correction factor, WC-1, for smoke particles (1.23 ± 0.312), indicates that on average they adhere to each other more than sodium chloride (0.969 ± 0.524) and sucrose (1.16 ± 1.38). The relative uncertainty is high for the coagulation correction, but it is consistent with our Monte Carlo error analysis. This study lays the foundation for future experiments at elevated humidity and supersaturation conditions to characterize the influence of particle shape on coagulation and cloud parameters."

This open-access dataset has diverse potential applications in paleoecological and paleoclimatic research. It provides a scientific basis for reconstructing temporal changes in climate and vegetation, and enables the assessment of pollen assemblages' reliability in representing the dynamics of vegetation cover, plant diversity, and functional traits. 
 Modern pollen datasets can provide invaluable data for interpreting temporal variations in climate, vegetation, land cover, and plant diversity from fossil pollen. Here we present 555 pollen count data, identified from topsoil collected within plant plots across a vast area of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and along the southern margin of Xinjiang that borders the TP. This dataset fills a geographical gap in the published datasets that offer pollen count data for this area. Ordination analysis and multiple regression reveal that precipitation is the primary factor influencing the spatial distribution of pollen assemblages across the entire study area. Furthermore, ordination analysis indicates that pollen assemblages can be used to distinguish vegetation types in the southeastern TP, such as coniferous forest, alpine shrubland, and alpine meadow, from vegetation types found in other regions of TP. Additionally, it is possible to distinguish vegetation types that have low precipitation or moisture requirements based on pollen assemblages. Generalized additive models demonstrate that six commonly used pollen ratios, involving taxa such as Artemisia, Amaranthaceae, Cyperaceae, and Poaceae, are not sufficiently reliable for reflecting changes in annual precipitation. Nevertheless, they can provide some indication of changes in vegetation or landscape. This dataset holds various potential applications in paleoecological and paleoclimatic research. It not only offers a scientific foundation for reconstructing changes in climate and vegetation over time, but also enables the assessment of the reliability of pollen assemblages in representing the dynamics of vegetation cover, functional traits, and plant diversity, by integrating data on simultaneously measured plot-level plant communities and functional traits.

 FAOSTAT forest emissions and removals statistics were updated for the period 1990–2025 for 234 countries and territories, using new country data collected via the Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) 2025. The new FAOSTAT estimates align with the published literature, indicating that the world forests were net carbon sinks, storing an additional 140 Gt CO2 in their standing living biomass over the 1990–2025 period, while losing 100 Mha and 17 Gt C through net forest conversion—a proxy used in FAOSTAT for deforestation. For the most recent period available in this release, 2021–2025, the FRA 2025 FAOSTAT estimates of mean annual forest removals were -3.6 Gt CO2 yr-1, only partially offset by net forest conversion losses averaging 2.8 Gt CO2 yr-1, resulting in mean annual net removals of −0.8 Gt CO2 yr-1 during 2021–2025. This net flux had decreased nearly 80 % from mean annual values of −1.4 Gt CO2 yr-1 a decade earlier, during 2011–2015.

Unlike earlier methods, ours can detect turbulence not only in unstable air but also in stable layers with strong wind changes. This approach better matches aircraft turbulence reports and reveals global patterns, such as seasonal shifts linked to jet streams and convection, helping improve flight safety and our understanding of extreme weather. 
 This study proposes a new method for estimating atmospheric turbulence from high vertical-resolution radiosonde data (HVRRD) using the minimum Richardson number (Rimin). While previous studies using HVRRD have primarily been based on the Thorpe method, which detects turbulence only in regions of local potential temperature overturning (Ri < 0) and does not explicitly account for wind shear, the proposed approach overcomes these limitations. By incorporating the effects of gravity waves on the static stability and vertical wind shear, this method enables the detection of turbulence not only in regions of Ri < 0 but also within statically stable layers characterized by strong shear (0 < Ri < 0.25), where Kelvin–Helmholtz instability is likely to occur. Additionally, comparison with turbulence observations from commercial flights demonstrates that the time series of turbulence derived from the Rimin method exhibits a significantly higher positive correlation with flight observations than that derived from the Thorpe method. Utilizing 10 years of global operational HVRRD, this study further analyzed the climatological distributions of turbulence derived from the Rimin method. Results show that turbulence under positive Ri conditions occurs most frequently in winter and less frequently in summer, reflecting the seasonal variability of the jet stream. In contrast, negative Ri cases exhibit a summertime maximum and wintertime minimum in the troposphere, and the opposite seasonal variation in the stratosphere. Regionally, turbulence is most pronounced over Asia, South America, and Antarctica for both positive and negative Ri cases.

We focused on a probabilistic approach, inverting the model with its respective uncertainty. Considering future applications to big data, we explored a neural-network-based method, retrieving computationally efficient estimates with an accuracy comparable to existing state-of-the-art algorithms. 
 Within the New Copernicus Capability for Trophic Ocean Networks (NECCTON) project, we aim to improve the current data assimilation system by developing a method for accurately estimating marine optical constituents from satellite-derived remote sensing reflectance. We compared two frameworks based on the implicit inversion of a semi-analytical model derived from the classical radiative transfer equation. The first approach employed an iterative Bayesian inversion with a Gaussian approximation, which provides maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of the optical constituents along with their associated uncertainties. To improve the model performance, we optimized the model parameters using historical in situ measurements from the BOUSSOLE buoy and a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, which reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) between the retrieved and observed values. The second approach employed the stochastic gradient variational Bayes (SGVB) estimator, which is designed to approximate the MAP estimates of the optical constituents while simultaneously optimizing the model parameters through maximum likelihood. This method resulted in faster computations than the iterative Bayesian inversion while maintaining comparable RMSE values. While the iterative Bayesian inversion provided reliable uncertainty estimates, the SGVB estimator offered faster computations of the optical constituents. Moreover, using a dataset of in situ sea surface chlorophyll a concentrations across a broad region of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, we compared the inversion techniques with a state-of-the-art algorithm used within the Copernicus Marine Service, finding comparable performances across methods. Notably, the SGVB estimator showed the highest correlation between in situ measurements and retrievals throughout the analyzed region. We conclude that both inversion methods achieve a performance comparable to existing state-of-the-art algorithms. The Gaussian approximation offers robust uncertainty quantification, while the SGVB estimator provides a reliable and computationally efficient alternative."

The model effectively captures observed carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus pools and fluxes, and significantly improves carbon flux estimates through data assimilation. TECO-CNP provides enhanced biogeochemical cycle representations, enabling more reliable predictions of ecosystem carbon cycle responses to global change through efficient parameter optimization. 
 Subtropical forests play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, yet their carbon sink capacity is significantly constrained by phosphorus availability. Models that omit phosphorus dynamics risk overestimating carbon sinks, potentially undermining the scientific basis for carbon neutrality strategies. In this study, we developed TECO-CNP Sv1.0, a coupled carbon-nitrogen-phosphorus model based on the Terrestrial ECOsystem (TECO) model, which explicitly captures key biogeochemical interactions and nutrient-regulated carbon cycling. The model simulates how plant growth and carbon partitioning respond to both external soil nutrient availability and internal physiological constraints, enabling plant acclimation to varying nutrient conditions. Using observations from a phosphorus-limited subtropical forest in East China, we first evaluated the model's performance in estimating state variables with empirically calibrated parameters. Compared to the C-only and coupled C-N configurations, the CNP model more accurately reproduced the observed pools of plant and soil C, N, and P. To systematically optimize model parameters and reduce uncertainties in predictions, we further incorporated a built-in data assimilation framework for parameter optimization. The CNP model with optimized parameters significantly improved carbon flux estimates, reducing root mean square errors and enhancing concordance correlation coefficients for gross primary productivity, ecosystem respiration, and net ecosystem exchange. By explicitly incorporating phosphorus dynamics and data assimilation, this study provides a more accurate and robust framework for predicting carbon sequestration in phosphorus-limited subtropical forests."

Validated across European forests, PHOREAU simulates how tree communities function under drought and warming. Our findings support the use of trait-based modeling to guide forest adaptation strategies under future climate scenarios. 
 Climate change impacts forest functioning and dynamics, but large uncertainties remain regarding the interactions between species composition, demographic processes and environmental drivers. While the effects of changing climates on individual plant processes are well studied, few tools dynamically integrate them, which precludes accurate projections and recommendations for long-term sustainable forest management. Forest gap models present a balance between complexity and generality and are widely used in predictive forest ecology, but their lack of explicit representation of some of the processes most sensitive to climate changes, like plant phenology and water use, puts into question the relevance of their predictions. Therefore, integrating trait- and process-based representations of climate-sensitive processes is key to improving predictions of forest dynamics under climate change.In this study, we describe the PHOREAU model, a new semi-empirical forest dynamic model resulting from the coupling of a gap model (FORCEEPS), with two process-based models: a phenology-based species distribution model (PHENOFIT) and a plant hydraulics model (SurEAU), each parametrized for the main European species. The performance of the resulting PHOREAU model was then evaluated over many processes, metrics and time-scales, from the ecophysiology of individuals to the biogeography of species.PHOREAU reliably predicted fine hydraulic processes at both the forest and stand scale for a variety of species and forest types. This, alongside an improved capacity to predict stand leaf areas from inventories, resulted in better annual growth compared to ForCEEPS, and a strong ability to predict potential community compositions.By integrating recent advancements in plant hydraulic, phenology, and competition for light and water into a dynamic, individual-based framework, the PHOREAU model, developed on the Capsis platform, can be used to understand complex emergent properties and trade-offs linked to diversity-effects effects under extreme climatic events, with implications for sustainable forest management strategies."

 Humans and other animals use powerful reinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms that have been discovered by evolution over many generations of trial and error. By contrast, artificial agents typically learn using hand-crafted learning rules. Despite decades of interest, the goal of autonomously discovering powerful RL algorithms has proven elusive7-12. In this work, we show that it is possible for machines to discover a state-of-the-art RL rule that outperforms manually-designed rules. This was achieved by meta-learning from the cumulative experiences of a population of agents across a large number of complex environments. Specifically, our method discovers the RL rule by which the agent's policy and predictions are updated. In our large-scale experiments, the discovered rule surpassed all existing rules on the well-established Atari benchmark and outperformed a number of state-of-the-art RL algorithms on challenging benchmarks that it had not seen during discovery. Our findings suggest that the RL algorithms required for advanced artificial intelligence may soon be automatically discovered from the experiences of agents, rather than manually designed."

 The unification of gravity and quantum mechanics remains one of the most profound open questions in science. With recent advances in quantum technology, an experimental idea first proposed by Richard Feynman1 is now regarded as a promising route to testing this unification for the first time. The experiment involves placing a massive object in a quantum superposition of two locations and letting it gravitationally interact with another mass. If the two objects subsequently become entangled, this is considered unambiguous evidence that gravity obeys the laws of quantum mechanics. This conclusion derives from theorems that treat a classical gravitational interaction as a local interaction capable of transmitting only classical, not quantum, information2–8. Here we extend the description of matter used in these theorems to the full framework of quantum field theory, finding that theories with classical gravity can then transmit quantum information and, thus, generate entanglement through physical, local processes. The effect scales differently to that predicted by theories of quantum gravity, and so it gives information on the parameters and form of the experiment required to robustly provide evidence for the quantum nature of gravity. By applying the full framework of quantum field theory, it is shown that local classical theories of gravity can transmit quantum information and, thus, generate entanglement through physical, local processes."

 Achieving superpolynomial speed-ups for optimization has long been a central goal for quantum algorithms1. Here we introduce decoded quantum interferometry (DQI), a quantum algorithm that uses the quantum Fourier transform to reduce optimization problems to decoding problems. When approximating optimal polynomial fits over finite fields, DQI achieves a superpolynomial speed-up over known classical algorithms. The speed-up arises because the algebraic structure of the problem is reflected in the decoding problem, which can be solved efficiently. We then investigate whether this approach can achieve a speed-up for optimization problems that lack an algebraic structure but have sparse clauses. These problems reduce to decoding low-density parity-check codes, for which powerful decoders are known2,3. To test this, we construct a max-XORSAT instance for which DQI finds an approximate optimum substantially faster than general-purpose classical heuristics, such as simulated annealing. Although a tailored classical solver can outperform DQI on this instance, our results establish that combining quantum Fourier transforms with powerful decoding primitives provides a promising new path towards quantum speed-ups for hard optimization problems.

 Diverse pathogen-encoded virulence factors disable apoptosis, pyroptosis or necroptosis, the host cell death programs that remove infected cells1. In the intestine, the extrusion of infected cells into the lumen for elimination provides an additional layer of host defence, but no virulence mechanisms that target the cytoskeletal changes required are known2. Here we show that the Escherichia coli ubiquitin ligase NleL is an inhibitor of intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) extrusion, targeting caspase-4, ROCK1 and ROCK2 for proteasomal degradation. Genetic deletion of Rock1 and Rock2 from cultured IECs diminished inflammasome-induced IEC extrusion. Moreover, mice with Rock1- and Rock2-deficient IECs were less effective than wild-type mice at constraining the numbers of Citrobacter rodentium in the colon. Notably, NleL-deficient C. rodentium triggered more IEC extrusion than did wild-type C. rodentium, resulting in diminished colonization of the colon in infected mice. Our work highlights a host–pathogen arms race focused on dynamic regulation of the host epithelial barrier.

 Chip-scale optical frequency combs based on microresonators (microcombs) have provided access to optical combs with GHz-to-THz repetition rates, broad bandwidth, compact form factors and compatibility with wafer-scale manufacturing1. Si3N4 photonic integrated circuits emerged as a leading platform and have been used in nearly all system-level demonstrations so far, ranging from optical communications2, parallel lidar3, optical frequency synthesis4, low-noise microwave generation5 to parallel convolutional processing6. Yet, transitioning to real-world deployment outside laboratories has been compounded by the difficulty of deterministic soliton microcomb generation, primarily due to strong thermal instabilities. Although a variety of techniques have been developed to initiate soliton generation, including pulsed pumping, fast scanning and auxiliary-laser pumping7–11, these techniques do not eliminate thermal effects and often compromise microcomb performance, either by adding additional complexity or by reducing the accessible soliton existence range. Here we overcome thermal effects and demonstrate deterministic soliton generation in Si3N4 photonic integrated circuits. We trace thermal effects to unexpected copper impurities within the waveguides, which originate from residual contaminants in CMOS-grade Si wafers and are gettered into Si3N4 during fabrication. By developing copper removal techniques, we substantially reduce copper concentration and thereby mitigate thermal effects. We demonstrate successful dissipative Kerr soliton generation with arbitrary laser scanning profiles and slow laser scanning. Our techniques can be readily applied to front-end-of-line processing of Si3N4 devices in foundries, removing a key obstacle to the deployment of soliton microcomb technology.

 Antiferromagnetic states with a spin-split electronic structure give rise to spintronic, magnonic and electronic phenomena despite (near-)zero net magnetization1–7. The simplest odd-parity spin splitting—p wave—was originally proposed to emerge from a collective instability in interacting electron systems8–12. Recent theory has identified a distinct route to realize p-wave spin-split electronic bands without strong correlations13,14, termed p-wave magnetism. Here we demonstrate an experimental realization of a metallic p-wave magnet. The odd-parity spin splitting of delocalized conduction electrons arises from their coupling to an antiferromagnetic texture of localized magnetic moments: a coplanar spin helix whose magnetic period is an even multiple of the chemical unit cell, as revealed by X-ray scattering experiments. This texture breaks space-inversion symmetry but approximately preserves time-reversal symmetry up to a half-unit-cell translation—thereby fulfilling the symmetry conditions for p-wave magnetism. Consistent with theoretical predictions, our p-wave magnet shows a characteristic anisotropy in the electronic conductivity13–15. Relativistic spin–orbit coupling and a tiny spontaneous net magnetization further break time-reversal symmetry, resulting in a giant anomalous Hall effect (Hall conductivity >600 S cm−1, Hall angle >3%), for an antiferromagnet. Our model calculations show that the spin-nodal planes found in the electronic structure of p-wave magnets are readily gapped by a small perturbation to induce the anomalous Hall effect. We establish metallic p-wave magnets as an ideal platform to explore the functionality of spin-split electronic states in magnets, superconductors, and in spintronic devices.

 Atmospheric particulate matter (PM), a public health concern worldwide, is at present regulated according to its mass concentration1. However, it is increasingly thought that mass concentration may not fully capture the physicochemical properties of PM linked to its health impact2. Consequently, it has been suggested to further investigate the adequacy of this metric as an unequivocal indicator of PM health effects3–5. The new European regulation on air quality introduced oxidative potential (OP) as a recommended parameter to be monitored at supersites1, to explore further deciphering information about PM reactivity and health impacts6,7. Here we use a database of almost 11,500 OP measurements from 43 locations across parts of Europe that were analysed with the two most commonly used OP assays8, OPAA and OPDTT, with a standardized protocol9,10. We find high spatial variability of OP across Europe, strongly influenced by site type, such as urban or rural. Accounting for OP alongside PM mass suggests that further improvements in urban air quality may require consideration, particularly near roads, where volumetric OP of PM10 exceeds background levels by a factor of 2.4 to 3.1, depending on the assay used. Analysis of mitigation strategies shows that traffic is a key source to target for effectively reducing OP in cities, whereas comprehensive reductions in PM from both traffic and biomass burning are required to also meet World Health Organization mass guidelines. Although the epidemiological evidence for OP health impacts is still evolving2,8, our findings may help inform the interpretation of future work.

 Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most common developmental abnormalities, affecting around 1% of live births1. Aneuploidy causes around 15% of CHDs, with trisomy 21 (also known as Down syndrome) being the most frequent form2. CHDs occur in around 50% of cases of Down syndrome, with an approximately 1,000-fold enrichment of atrioventricular canal (AVC) defects that disrupt the junction between the atria and ventricles3,4. The AVC contains unique myocardial cells that are essential for valvuloseptal development; however, the specific combination of dosage-sensitive genes on chromosome 21 that are responsible for Down syndrome-associated CHDs have remained unknown. Here, using human pluripotent stem cell and mouse models of Down syndrome, we identify HMGN1, a nucleosome-binding epigenetic regulator encoded on chromosome 21, as a key contributor to these defects. Single-cell transcriptomics showed that trisomy 21 shifts human AVC cardiomyocytes towards a ventricular cardiomyocyte state. A CRISPR-activation single-cell RNA droplet sequencing (CROP-seq) screen of chromosome 21 genes expressed during heart development revealed that HMGN1 upregulation mimics this shift, whereas deletion of one HMGN1 allele in trisomic cells restored normal gene expression. In a mouse model of trisomy 21, a similar transcriptional shift of AVC cardiomyocytes was restored by a reduction in Hmgn1 dosage, leading to rescue of valvuloseptal defects. These findings identify HMGN1 as a dosage-sensitive modulator of AVC development and cardiac septation in Down syndrome. This study offers a paradigm for dissecting aneuploidy-associated pathogenesis using isogenic systems to map causal genes in complex genetic syndromes. Studies using human pluripotent stem cells and a mouse model of Down syndrome identify HMGN1 as a key contributor to congenital heart defects in individuals with Down syndrome."

 The lithium-ion battery supply chain is critical for global decarbonization1,2, yet its geographically dispersed production stages pose substantial challenges for carbon management3,4. Here we developed a lithium cycle computable general equilibrium (LCCGE) model, integrating life-cycle thinking with global economic dynamics to systematically assess decarbonization pathways. Our analysis reveals a notable ‘value–emission paradox’ across the supply chain: downstream cathode production generates 42.56% of economic value from 34.82% of emissions, whereas upstream mining accounts for 38.52% of total emissions from only 18.78% of the value. A comprehensive scenario analysis shows that, although consumer-oriented recycling can reduce global emission intensity by 16.30% in 2060, it is far surpassed by integrated strategies. The highest global emission reduction (35.87%) is achieved by combining cross-regional cooperation on technology and trade with regionally tailored domestic circular economy policies. This synergistic approach proves highly effective in key manufacturing economies, yielding potential emission reductions of 39.14% in the USA, 37.28% in the European Union and 42.35% in China. By revealing the synergy of combining environmental, technological and trade levers through both global collaboration and local adaptation, our work provides a blueprint for decarbonizing complex global supply chains and establishes a framework for analysing their sustainability analysis.

 To ensure specificity, sensory neurons must select and express a single receptor from often vast gene families, adhering to the rule of ‘one receptor per neuron’. For example, each olfactory sensory neuron in mammals expresses only one odorant receptor (Or) gene1,2. In Drosophila, which has about 60 Or genes, this selection is deterministic3. By contrast, mice face the challenge of choosing one Or gene from over 1,000 options4. They solve this through a complex system of stochastic choices5–9. Ants also possess many Or genes, most of which are organized into tandem arrays similar to those in mammals, but their regulatory mechanisms have evolved independently. Here we show that, in the ant Harpegnathos saltator, each olfactory sensory neuron activates a single promoter within an Or gene array, producing a mature capped and polyadenylated mRNA. While the promoters of downstream genes in the array are inactive, all downstream genes are nonetheless transcribed due to transcriptional readthrough from the active promoter, probably caused by inefficient RNA polymerase II termination. This readthrough appears to suppress downstream promoters through transcriptional interference, resulting in aberrant non-capped transcripts that are not translated, ensuring that only the active gene is expressed. Simultaneously, long antisense transcription originating from the chosen Or promoter covers upstream genes, presumably silencing them. Ants therefore appear to have evolved a unique transcriptional-interference-based mechanism to express a single OR protein from an array of Or genes with functionally similar promoters.

 G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) convert extracellular signals into intracellular responses by signalling through 16 subtypes of Gα proteins and two β-arrestin proteins. Biased compounds—molecules that preferentially activate a subset of these proteins—engage therapy-relevant pathways more selectively1 and promise to be safer, more effective medications than compounds that uniformly activate all pathways2. However, the determinants of bias are poorly understood, and we lack rationally designed molecules that select for specific G proteins. Here, using the prototypical class A GPCR neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1), we show that small molecules that bind to the intracellular GPCR–transducer interface change G protein coupling by subtype-specific and predictable mechanisms, enabling structure-guided drug design. We find that the intracellular, core-binding compound SBI-553 switches the G protein preference of NTSR1 through direct intermolecular interactions3–5, promoting or preventing association with specific G protein subtypes. Modifications to the SBI-553 scaffold produce allosteric modulators with distinct G protein selectivity profiles. Selectivity profiles are probe independent, conserved across species and translate to differences in activity in vivo. Our studies show that G protein selectivity can be tailored with small changes to a single chemical scaffold targeting the receptor–transducer interface. Moreover, given that this pocket is broadly conserved, our findings could provide a strategy for pathway-selective drug discovery that is applicable to the diverse GPCR superfamily.

 Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) extend survival in many patients with cancer but are ineffective in patients without pre-existing immunity1–9. Although personalized mRNA cancer vaccines sensitize tumours to ICIs by directing immune attacks against preselected antigens, personalized vaccines are limited by complex and time-intensive manufacturing processes10–14. Here we show that mRNA vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2 also sensitize tumours to ICIs. In preclinical models, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines led to a substantial increase in type I interferon, enabling innate immune cells to prime CD8+ T cells that target tumour-associated antigens. Concomitant ICI treatment is required for maximal efficacy in immunologically cold tumours, which respond by increasing PD-L1 expression. Similar correlates of vaccination response are found in humans, including increases in type I interferon, myeloid–lymphoid activation in healthy volunteers and PD-L1 expression on tumours. Moreover, receipt of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines within 100 days of initiating ICI is associated with significantly improved median and three-year overall survival in multiple large retrospective cohorts. This benefit is similar among patients with immunologically cold tumours. Together, these results demonstrate that clinically available mRNA vaccines targeting non-tumour-related antigens are potent immune modulators capable of sensitizing tumours to ICIs. mRNA vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2 also sensitize tumours to immune checkpoint inhibitors."

 Global climate change and its consequences for the symbiosis between corals and microalgae are impacting coral reefs worldwide—ecosystems that support more than one-quarter of marine species and sustain nearly one billion people1–3. Understanding how stony corals, the primary architects of both shallow and deep reef ecosystems, responded to past environmental challenges is key to predicting their future4. Here we describe a time-calibrated molecular phylogenetic analysis that includes hundreds of newly sequenced coral taxa, and sheds light on the deep-time evolution of scleractinian corals. We date the emergence of the most recent common ancestor of Scleractinia to about 460 million years ago and infer that it was probably a solitary, heterotrophic and free-living organism—or one that could reproduce through transverse division—thriving in both shallow and deep waters. Our analyses suggest that symbiosis with photosynthetic dinoflagellates was established around 300 million years ago and spurred coral diversification. However, only a few photosymbiotic lineages survived major environmental disruptions in the Mesozoic era. By contrast, solitary, heterotrophic corals with flexible depth and substrate preferences appear to have thrived in the deep sea despite these environmental disturbance events. Even though ongoing environmental changes are expected to severely affect shallow reefs5, our finding that stony corals have shown resilience throughout geological history offers hope for the persistence of some lineages in the face of climate and other environmental changes. The most recent common ancestor of the stony coral Scleractinia dates to about 460 million years ago and was probably a solitary, heterotrophic and free-living organism."

Zsoldos,Joint neutrino oscillation analysis from the T2K and NOvA experiments,"The joint analysis of datasets from NOvA and T2K, the two currently operating long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, provides new constraints related to neutrino masses and fundamental symmetries. 
 The landmark discovery that neutrinos have mass and can change type (or flavour) as they propagate—a process called neutrino oscillation1–6—has opened up a rich array of theoretical and experimental questions being actively pursued today. Neutrino oscillation remains the most powerful experimental tool for addressing many of these questions, including whether neutrinos violate charge-parity (CP) symmetry, which has possible connections to the unexplained preponderance of matter over antimatter in the Universe7–11. Oscillation measurements also probe the mass-squared differences between the different neutrino mass states (Δm2), whether there are two light states and a heavier one (normal ordering) or vice versa (inverted ordering), and the structure of neutrino mass and flavour mixing12. Here we carry out the first joint analysis of datasets from NOvA13 and T2K14, the two currently operating long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments (hundreds of kilometres of neutrino travel distance), taking advantage of our complementary experimental designs and setting new constraints on several neutrino sector parameters. This analysis provides new precision on the

The data show no strong preference for either mass ordering, but notably, if inverted ordering were assumed true within the three-flavour mixing model, then our results would provide evidence of CP symmetry violation in the lepton sector.

 The human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, relies exclusively on Anopheles mosquitoes for transmission. Once ingested during blood feeding, most parasites die in the mosquito midgut lumen or during epithelium traversal1. How surviving ookinetes interact with midgut cells and form oocysts remains poorly understood, yet these steps are essential to initiate a remarkable growth process culminating in the production of thousands of infectious sporozoites2. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing of both parasites and mosquito cells across different developmental stages and metabolic conditions, we unveil key transitions and mosquito–parasite interactions that occur in the midgut. Functional analyses uncover processes that regulate oocyst growth and identify the Plasmodium transcription factor PfSIP2 as essential for sporozoite infection of human hepatocytes. Combining shared mosquito–parasite barcode analysis with confocal microscopy, we reveal that parasites preferentially interact with midgut progenitor cells during epithelial crossing, potentially using their basal location as an exit landmark. Additionally, we show tight connections between extracellular late oocysts and surrounding muscle cells that may ensure parasite adherence to the midgut. We confirm our major findings in several mosquito–parasite combinations, including field-derived parasites. Our study provides fundamental insight into the molecular events that characterize previously inaccessible biological transitions and mosquito–parasite interactions, and identifies candidates for transmission-blocking strategies. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses of Plasmodium falciparum and Anopheles gambiae reveal key developmental stages, processes and factors in parasite–mosquito interactions and identify potential targets for blocking malaria transmission."

Bent,Cryogenic X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for battery interfaces,"Cryogenic X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, combined with immediate plunge freezing, can be used to probe the pristine solid electrolyte interphase in lithium metal batteries. 
 Understanding the chemical environment of pristine interfaces is a long-sought goal in electrochemistry, materials science and surface science. A substantial understanding of one such interface, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in lithium anodes, originates from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)1,2. However, room temperature (RT) combined with ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) can induce major SEI evolution from reactions and volatilization during XPS1,2. Thus, a technique is necessary for SEI stabilization. Here we develop cryogenic (cryo)-XPS with immediate plunge freezing and demonstrate SEI preservation. We discover substantially different SEI speciation and a thicker pristine SEI with cryo-XPS, free from RT-associated thickness reduction and alterations to important species, including LiF and Li2O, in UHV. This new access to pristine SEI composition enables performance correlations across diverse electrolyte chemistries. Primarily, we highlight the necessity of studying sensitive interfaces under cryogenic conditions.

 Native ion channels play key roles in biological systems, and engineered versions are widely used as chemogenetic tools and in sensing devices1,2. Protein design has been harnessed to generate pore-containing transmembrane proteins, but the design of selectivity filters with precise arrangements of amino acid side chains specific for a target ion, a crucial feature of native ion channels3, has been constrained by the lack of methods for placing the metal-coordinating residues with atomic-level precision. Here we describe a bottom-up RFdiffusion-based approach to construct Ca2+ channels from defined selectivity filter residue geometries, and use this approach to design symmetric oligomeric channels with Ca2+ selectivity filters having different coordination numbers and different geometries at the entrance of a wider pore buttressed by multiple transmembrane helices. The designed channel proteins assemble into homogeneous pore-containing particles and, for both tetrameric and hexameric ion-coordinating configurations, patch-clamp experiments show that the designed channels have higher conductances for Ca2+ than for Na+ and other divalent ions (Sr2+ and Mg2+) that are eliminated after mutation of selectivity filter residues. Cryogenic electron microscopy indicates that the design method has high accuracy: the structure of the hexameric Ca2+ channel is nearly identical to that of the design model. Our bottom-up design approach now enables the testing of hypotheses relating filter geometry to ion selectivity by direct construction, and provides a roadmap for creating selective ion channels for a wide range of applications. De novo design of Ca2+ channels with ion selectivity that can assemble appropriately and mediate Ca2+ conductance when expressed in cells is described."

In dynamics with fast entanglement generation, however, quantum observables generally become insensitive to the details of the underlying dynamics at long times due to the effects of scrambling. To circumvent this limitation and enable access to relevant dynamics in experimental systems, repeated time-reversal protocols have been successfully implemented4. Here we experimentally measure the second-order out-of-time-order correlators (OTOC(2))5–18 on a superconducting quantum processor and find that they remain sensitive to the underlying dynamics at long timescales. Furthermore, OTOC(2) manifests quantum correlations in a highly entangled quantum many-body system that are inaccessible without time-reversal techniques. This is demonstrated through an experimental protocol that randomizes the phases of Pauli strings in the Heisenberg picture by inserting Pauli operators during quantum evolution. The measured values of OTOC(2) are substantially changed by the protocol, thereby revealing constructive interference between Pauli strings that form large loops in the configuration space. The observed interference mechanism also endows OTOC(2) with high degrees of classical simulation complexity. These results, combined with the capability of OTOC(2) in unravelling useful details of quantum dynamics, as shown through an example of Hamiltonian learning, indicate a viable path to practical quantum advantage. Experimental measurements of high-order out-of-time-order correlators on a superconducting quantum processor show that these correlators remain highly sensitive to the quantum many-body dynamics in quantum computers at long timescales."

 Artificial superlattices, constructed from atomic layers such as graphene using layer-by-layer periodic stacking or sequential epitaxial growth, have emerged as a versatile platform for developing new materials with properties surpassing the existing materials1–3. However, the explored superlattices are predominantly van der Waals (vdW) superlattices, constrained by weak interface coupling4,5. Here we present an efficient synthetic protocol that achieves a family of non-vdW superlattices of carbides and carbonitrides, featuring hydrogen bonding between layers through a stiffness-mediated rolling-up strategy. The crucial step involves customizing the bending stiffness of the atomic layers derived from MAX phases by creating metal vacancies in MX slabs, triggering their ordered rolling-up under rapid flexural deformation. Unlike vdW superlattices, our non-vdW superlattices with hydrogen bonding afford robust interlayer electronic coupling with highly concentrated charge carriers (1022 cm−3). Consequently, our superlattices exhibit a notable electrical conductivity of about 30,000 S cm−1, which is around 22 times that of the counterparts. When used in electromagnetic interference shielding, the optimal non-vdW superlattice film demonstrates a remarkable shielding effectiveness of 124 dB, surpassing that of any known synthetic materials with comparable thickness. The non-vdW superlattices are anticipated to markedly broaden the material platform, offering variable compositions and crystal structures for new developments in artificially stacked systems.  A method to make a big family of non-van der Waals superlattices of carbides and carbonitrides based on the delamination and rolling-up of multilayer MXenes is presented. "

 Social behaviour is substantially shaped by internal physiological states. Although progress has been made in understanding how individual states such as hunger, stress or arousal modulate behaviour1–9, animals experience multiple states at any given time10. The neural mechanisms that integrate such orthogonal states—and how this integration affects behaviour—remain poorly understood. Here we report how hunger and oestrous state converge on neurons in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) to shape infant-directed behaviour. We find that hunger promotes pup-directed aggression in normally non-aggressive virgin female mice. This behavioural switch occurs through the inhibition of MPOA neurons, driven by the release of neuropeptide Y from Agouti-related peptide-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ArcAgRP neurons). The propensity for hunger-induced aggression is set by reproductive state, with MPOA neurons detecting changes in the progesterone to oestradiol ratio across the oestrous cycle. Hunger and oestrous state converge on hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, which sets the baseline activity and excitability of MPOA neurons. Using microendoscopy imaging, we confirm these findings in vivo, revealing that MPOA neurons encode a state for pup-directed aggression. This work provides a mechanistic understanding of how multiple physiological states are integrated to flexibly control social behaviour. Combined behavioural, circuit-level and cellular approaches are used to demonstrate how hypothalamic neurons integrate hunger and oestrous state to drive a switch in how female mice interact with pups."

 As demand for immersive experiences grows, displays with smaller sizes and higher resolutions are being viewed increasingly closer to the human eye1. As the size of emitting pixels shrinks, the intensity and uniformity of their emission are degraded while colour cross-talk and fabrication complexity increase, making ultra-high-resolution imaging challenging2–4. By contrast, electronic paper, which uses ambient light for visibility, can maintain high optical contrast regardless of pixel size, but cannot achieve high resolution5,6. Here we demonstrate electronic paper with electrically tunable metapixels down to ~560 nm in size (>25,000 pixels per inch) consisting of WO3 nanodisks, which undergo a reversible insulator-to-metal transition on electrochemical reduction. This transition enables dynamic modulation of the refractive index and optical absorption, allowing precise control over reflectance and contrast at the nanoscale. By using this effect, the metapixels can achieve pixel densities approaching the visual resolution limit when the display size matches the pupil diameter, which we refer to as retina electronic paper. Our technology also demonstrates full-colour video capability (>25 Hz), high reflectance (~80%), strong optical contrast (~50%), low energy consumption (~0.5–1.7 mW cm–2) and support for anaglyph 3D display, highlighting its potential as a next-generation solution for immersive virtual reality systems.

 Calcium (Ca2+) is an essential mineral that must be strictly regulated to support numerous physiological activities1,2. Extracellular fluid Ca2+ is regulated in vertebrates through endocrine systems that manage the vast Ca2+ reservoir in the bones3–6, but the Ca2+ regulatory mechanisms used by invertebrates, which lack bones, remain largely unclear. Here we identified a potent peptide hormone, Capa, which is responsible for regulating extracellular fluid Ca2+ levels in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Capa-deficient larvae exhibit low haemolymph Ca2+ levels, resulting in reduced locomotion and induced elongated pupae that mimic those of animals reared on a Ca2+-free diet. Capa secreted from specific neurosecretory cells acts on specialized Ca2+ storage compartments in the anterior Malpighian tubules, elevating haemolymph Ca2+.

Here the authors identify genetic variants with African ancestry-specific risks for developing pediatric B-cell ALL that are also linked to greater 5-year mortality risk. 
 B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is the most common pediatric malignancy. Given racial/ethnic differences in incidence and outcomes, B-ALL genome-wide association studies among children of African ancestry are needed. Leveraging multi-institutional datasets with 840 African American children with B-ALL and 3360 controls, nine loci achieved genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10−8) after meta-analysis. Two loci were established trans-ancestral susceptibility regions (IKZF1, ARID5B), while the remaining novel loci were specific to African populations. Five-year overall survival among children carrying novel risk alleles was significantly worse (83% versus 96% in non-carriers, P = 4.8 × 10−3). Novel risk variants were also associated with subtype-specific disease (P < 0.05), including higher susceptibility for a subtype overrepresented in African American children (TCF3-PBX1) and lower susceptibility for a subtype with excellent prognosis (ETV6-RUNX1). Functional experiments revealed novel B-ALL risk variants had allele-specific differences in transcriptional activity (P < 0.05) in B-cell and leukemia cell lines. These findings shed insights into ancestry-related differences in leukemogenesis and prognosis.

Improving irrigation efficiency and cutting emissions are key to reducing water stress and climate impacts. 
 Irrigation has been investigated as an important historical climate forcing, but there is no study exploring its future climatic impacts considering possible changes in both extent and efficiency. Here, we address these issues via developing irrigation efficiency scenarios in line with the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), implementing these in the Community Earth System Model, and applying them to generate projections over the period 2015–2074. We project that annual irrigation water withdrawal decreases under SSP1-2.6 (from  ~2100 to  ~1700 km3 yr−1) but increases under SSP3-7.0 (to  ~2400 km3 yr−1), with some new irrigation hot spots emerging, especially in Africa. Irrigation is projected to reduce the occurrence of dry-heat stress under both scenarios, but cannot reverse the warming trend due to greenhouse gas emission (e.g., increasing from  ~90 to around 600 and 1200 hours yr−1 in intensely irrigated areas, under two scenarios). Moreover, moist-heat extreme event frequency increases more substantially (by ≥1600 hours yr−1 under SSP3-7.0 in tropical regions), and irrigation further amplifies the hours of exposure (for example, by ≥100 hours yr−1 in South Asia), thereby raising the risk of moist-heat-related illnesses and mortality for exposed communities. Our results underscore the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting irrigation expansion and improving irrigation efficiency to preserve water resources and decelerate escalating exposure to dry- and moist-heat stress. This study shows that future exposures to moist-heat increase more rapidly than those to dry-heat, and irrigation can further amplify moist-heat-related health risks.

 Many prosocial and antisocial behaviors simultaneously impact both ourselves and others, requiring us to learn from their joint outcomes to guide future choices. However, the neurocomputational processes supporting such social learning remain unclear. Across three pre-registered studies, participants learned how choices affected both themselves and others. Computational modeling tested whether people simulate how other people value their choices or integrate self- and other-relevant information to guide choices. An integrated value framework, rather than simulation, characterizes multi-outcome social learning. People update the expected value of choices using different types of prediction errors related to the target (e.g., self, other) and valence (e.g., positive, negative). This asymmetric value update is represented in brain regions that include ventral striatum, subgenual and pregenual anterior cingulate, insula, and amygdala. These results demonstrate that distinct encoding of self- and other-relevant information guides future social behaviors across mutually beneficial, mutually costly, altruistic, and instrumentally harmful scenarios.

Here, authors elucidate the multi-scale effects of the SEI on lithium deposition behavior based on the established SEI-omics framework. 
 Accurately understanding the impact of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on lithium deposition is critical for high-energy lithium metal batteries. Yet traditional strategies, focusing solely on isolated components, fail to capture multi-constituent synergies and underlying mechanisms. To address this challenge, we introduce the concept of SEI omics and establish a dataset of cryogenic transmission electron microscopy images combined with co-localized component information. By integrating interpretable machine learning and physics-based feature selection, we decoupled the roles of SEI constituents, revealing that higher N/S/P/F content and reduced O in the SEI improve lithium deposition. Combined density functional theory and electrochemical phase-field modeling uncovered multi-scale effects of SEI components on Li growth. Results confirm that designing an inner SEI layer with high surface energy and migration ability significantly refines deposition morphology. Guided by machine learning-optimized composition, a highly disordered SEI was engineered, achieving high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.35% over 800 cycles for Li||Cu cell at 1 mA cm−2 and 1 mAh cm−2. This work establishes a universal framework for understanding SEI-coupled effects on lithium growth, offering transformative strategies for electrolyte and interface design.

 Bacteria have evolved a diverse array of mechanisms to inhibit and kill competitors. However, why some bacteria carry such weapons while others do not remains poorly understood. Here we explore this question using the genomics of the bacteriocins of E. coli as a model system, which have large well-annotated bioinformatic resources. While bacteriocins occur widely, we find that carriage is particularly associated with pathogenic extra-intestinal (ExPEC) strains. These pathogens commonly carry large plasmids encoding bacteriocins alongside virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. Across all strains, we find many orphan immunity proteins, which protect against bacteriocins and suggest that these bacterial weapons are important in nature. We also present evidence that bacteriocin toxins readily move between strains via plasmid transfer and even between plasmids via transposons. Finally, we show that several E. coli bacteriocins are widely shared with the pathogen Salmonella enterica, further cementing the link to virulence. Our work suggests that the bacteriocins of E. coli are important antibacterial weapons for dangerous antimicrobial-resistant strains.

 Tuberculosis (TB) remains the foremost cause of death from infectious diseases globally, prompting ongoing efforts to improve treatment options. This includes developing compounds with novel modes of action and identifying optimal treatment regimens that allow for treatment shortening. One promising strategy involves targeting cytochrome bc1 oxidase in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a key enzyme in the respiratory chain. In this study, we evaluate the potential of cytochrome bc1 inhibitors as partner drugs in TB combination regimens. Using a relapsing mouse model, we demonstrate that these inhibitors enhance regimen sterilisation and significantly reduce the time required for effective treatment. We also propose several novel combination strategies for both multidrug-resistant and drug-sensitive TB, where cytochrome bc1 inhibitors contribute to sterilisation and improved treatment outcomes. Furthermore, M. tuberculosis clinical isolates exhibited heightened susceptibility to cytochrome bc1 inhibitors compared to laboratory-adapted strains, highlighting the importance of using clinical isolates in TB drug discovery to better reflect the diversity of TB populations. These findings emphasise the potential of cytochrome bc1 inhibition in the development of more effective and shorter treatment regimens for TB, supporting the need for further clinical investigation.

 Mosquitoes are major vectors of human diseases, and their geographic expansion is primarily driven by the unintentional, human mediated introduction beyond their native ranges. Despite the substantial public health implications and rising numbers of disease outbreaks, a global picture of the introduction trends and the resulting range expansions of mosquitoes is missing. Here, we present a comprehensive and up-to-date compilation and analysis of reported first records of human disease vector mosquitoes worldwide. We show that 45 mosquito species (~25% of those known to transmit human pathogens) have been introduced worldwide, with 28 species having established in at least one region. From the 1950’s onwards, the introduction of new species has increased sharply, with 12 species recorded for the first time outside their native range since 2000 alone. Initially, most introduced species were native to Africa, but over time, Asian species have become more dominant. North America, Australia and Europe remain the main recipients.

 Climate change will reshape global demand and supply for water. Surface water supplies will become more variable, and warming temperatures may increase demand for water. These changes could impose substantial economic costs. Well-functioning water markets can mitigate some of these costs by allocating water to those who value it most. However, storage constraints limit the ability of markets to transfer water over time. Here we use transactions data from 2010 to 2022 to evaluate how water prices in California’s surface and groundwater markets respond to precipitation shocks, and how this response varies with inventory levels and water storage capacity. In groundwater markets, with high inventories, prices are unresponsive to precipitation shocks. In surface water markets, with limited inventories, prices increase strongly when precipitation declines. A 50-inch decrease in annual precipitation, typical when comparing deluge with drought in California, increases the price by US$487 per acre-foot, more than tripling compared with the average wet year. This effect is less pronounced when inventory levels are higher. Increasing storage through the joint management of groundwater and surface water supplies could provide a pathway to reduce the adverse consequences of climate-induced precipitation volatility.

 Integration of efficient value-added electrochemical oxidation with hydrogen evolution reaction presents a promising sustainable route for both hydrogen energy and the electrochemical refinery industry. However, the serious competition of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with targeted oxidation reactions at high current densities forms a substantial hurdle for industrial application. Here we report a straightforward approach to inhibit OER side reaction by introducing a trace amount of Cu2+ into the electrolyte for efficient glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR). Such a strategy enables improved Faradaic efficiency of glycerol to the target product formic acid from 62.2% (without Cu2+ addition) to 99.3% at a high current density of 800 mA cm−2. The underlying mechanism is that a reversible redox process of Cu2+/Cu+ fully suppresses the formation of OER-active-phase hydroxy peroxide on the surface of GOR-active Co3O4 catalyst. The current strategy also applies to other important electrochemical oxidation reactions, paving the way for developing efficient non-OER electrochemical oxidation reactions for various chemical conversion processes.

 The Eurasian winter cooling observed in the early 21st century, which contrasted with ongoing global warming, was initially attributed to Arctic warming until atmospheric internal variability became the prevailing explanation when the cooling ceased despite unabated Arctic warming. Yet the atmospheric variability responsible for it remains elusive. Here, three comparable cooling episodes, including the early 21st-century one, are identified in reanalysis since 1901. By synthesizing them with cooling episodes in large-ensemble simulations, we demonstrate two intrinsic atmospheric regimes as modulators: the Scandinavian pattern (SCAND) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The substantial positive SCAND trend strongly favors Eurasian cooling, with the NAO trend modifying cooling magnitude. Our logistic regression model indicates that the likelihood of at least one analogous cooling episode before 2050 is approximately 30% due to internal variability, with only half potentially overriding the anthropogenic warming.

 The Hadley circulation (HC) is an important atmospheric circulation system connecting the tropics and subtropics, and variabilities of regional HC exhibit significant impacts on tropical cyclones (TC). However, the potential feedback of TC on the regional HC remains unclear. Here, we reveal that western North Pacific TC (WNPTC) activity exerts a significant 1-month lagged negative effect on the western Pacific HC intensity (WPHCI), and this relationship is independent of the influence of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). We show that WNPTC activity can influence variations in environmental fields through modulating the variations of sea surface temperature over WP, thereby altering the thermal conditions and energy conversion, ultimately contributing to the weakening of the WPHC.

 Future climate confronts major challenges due to ongoing Arctic sea-ice retreat. Notably, eventful sea-ice loss in the Holocene appears comparable circumstance, but associated physics remians poorly understood. Here we present a high-resolution and semi-quantitative reconstruction of sea-ice conditions over the East Siberian Arctic Shelf. A compilation of sea-ice reconstructions across the circum-Arctic characterizes a Pacific-side Arctic sea-ice melting event between 4.5 and 2.2 ka BP. Together with basin-wide paleoclimate records, satellite-derived and numerical modeling datasets, we attribute this sea-ice melting event to enhanced Bering Sea Inflow with stronger poleward transport of Pacific oceanic heat, which overcame long-term Holocene cooling trend likely linked to concurrently slowing Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Such Holocene-scale competition effect of ‘Pacificization v.s. Atlantification’ may conceptually explain the modern dipole pattern in Arctic sea-ice variation. In the warming future, projected more frequent La Niña circumstance could indicate enhanced Pacificization effect, leading to aggravated Pacific-side Arctic sea-ice retreat.

 Antarctic sea ice exhibits considerable interannual variability and has experienced unprecedented decline over the past decade. Here we provide observational insights into the role of the Southern Annular Mode in driving such variations in Antarctic sea-ice area. The influence of the Southern Annular Mode on Antarctic sea-ice area exhibits more pronounced seasonality than indicated in previous work. Positive anomalies in the Southern Annular Mode lead to decreases in sea-ice area during the seasonal sea-ice maximum, but vice versa during the sea-ice minimum. Variations in Southern Annular Mode during the sea-ice maximum also have an outsized influence on annual-mean changes in sea-ice area, since the seasonally-varying persistence and shortwave effects of sea-ice anomalies peak during the following months. It is argued that a notable fraction of the dramatic losses in annual-mean sea-ice area over the past decade can be traced to variations in the Southern Annular Mode during the sea-ice maximum.

 Subglacial geology plays a key role in determining the rate of ice flow and sensitivity of the glacial system to atmospheric or ocean warming. However, bedrock geology is often poorly known because direct information from subglacial samples is extremely challenging to obtain. Here, we combine the distribution, petrology, crystallisation age and thermochronology of glacial erratics with geophysical analyses to provide evidence for Middle Jurassic (~175 Ma) granitic bedrock extending beneath Pine Island Glacier, West Antarctica. Our results constrain the range of past ice flow pathways across the adjacent Hudson Mountains, providing information needed to improve models of ice sheet evolution in this vulnerable region. This work demonstrates the utility of integrating erratic geochemistry, geochronology and aerogeophysics for the study of subglacial environments and confirms erratics as a valuable, but largely untapped, source of evidence for what lies beneath the world’s ice sheets.

 Large amounts of spaceborne hyperspectral imagery with high spectral and spatial resolution have been acquired in recent years, enabling extensive applications across various fields. Accurate spectral and radiometric calibration is the foundation for the quantitative use of these data. However, most existing approaches conduct spectral and radiometric calibrations independently, allowing errors in one process to propagate into the other and degrade overall accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a novel algorithm for the simultaneous calibration of spectral and radiometric parameters in spaceborne hyperspectral imagers. The method jointly estimates both sets of parameters by modeling the relationship between measured and simulated top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance. Validation using MODTRAN-based synthetic datasets demonstrated high calibration accuracy, with mean absolute errors (MAEs) below 0.24 nm and 0.33 nm for the center wavelength and full width at half maximum (FWHM) in the visible–near-infrared (VNIR) band, and below 0.34 nm and 0.35 nm in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) band. The derived radiometric calibration coefficients yielded mean relative errors (MREs) within 0.25 % for VNIR and 2.80 % for SWIR. Application to the Chinese ZY1E/AHSI hyperspectral sensor confirmed stable on-orbit performance, with minimal wavelength drift and bandwidth variation. Cross-comparison with Landsat-8/OLI TOA radiance indicated that the proposed method improved radiometric accuracy, reducing relative errors to within 10 %. The derived surface reflectance showed excellent agreement with in-situ measurements, with average relative errors below 3 % and 1 % in the VNIR and SWIR bands, respectively. Sensitivity analyses under varying observation geometry, aerosol optical depth (AOD), and water vapor content (WVC) further verified the robustness and reliability of the proposed simultaneous calibration framework for operational hyperspectral applications."

 Plasticulture, a widespread practice using plastic covers (PCs) to enhance crop yields, has raised environmental concerns. Existing studies capture static PC distributions, leaving temporal dynamics uncharacterized and often missing seasonal PCs applied outside the mapping window. To address this gap, this study proposes Plastic Cover Tracker (PCT), a rule-based approach that utilizes dense Sentinel-2 time series to track the intra-annual covering cycle of PCs. PCT extracts key temporal metrics, including the start date, end date, and duration of PC coverage, and classifies each pixel as permanent, seasonal or non-PC. Specifically, PCT first applies a Hue–Saturation–Lightness (HSL) transformation to improve spectral separability between PCs and the background. A single-date PC classification is then performed using the low-saturation and high-lightness of PCs, followed by temporal filtering to remove noise and ensure temporal continuity. An NDVI-based confirmation is subsequently applied to retain only agricultural PC applications. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of PCT: the HSL transformation significantly improved feature separability between PCs and non-PCs, with the Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance increasing from ≤ 0.50 using a single RGB band to 1.50 using the saturation-lightness combination. For temporal metrics, PCT achieved accuracies of ± 1.83 days for start dates, ±1.74 days for end dates, and ± 3.27 days for durations using Sentinel-2 imagery. For pixel categorization into permanent, seasonal, and non-PC types, PCT achieved F1 scores of 0.79, 0.93, and 0.98, respectively. Comparison with existing PC datasets showed high consistency in permanent PC identification, supporting the reliability of PCT. Moreover, PCT successfully detected seasonal PCs that were overlooked in these datasets. In conclusion, PCT fills a critical methodological gap in tracking PC temporal dynamics and detecting seasonal PCs, with strong potential to support environmental risk assessments and promote sustainable plasticulture management."

 Semantic segmentation of urban point clouds captured by Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) is essential for understanding complex 3D environments, serving as a robust underlying data foundation for digital twin applications. The fusion of multimodal data has been proven to significantly improve the performance of ALS semantic segmentation by fully mining rich complementary information in each modality. However, existing fusion-based ALS semantic segmentation methods face critical limitations due to the reliance on multiple sensors, which constrains their applicability. To this end, we propose a novel multimodal framework Elevation Guidance Adaptive Fused Network, termed EGAFNet, that integrates naturally formed top-view projection images from ALS to enhance the information perception of the point cloud. The framework focuses on utilizing projection images, structured around two key components: input representation and feature representation. Specifically, to generate highly discriminative input representation, we propose a novel projection method that accurately preserves the relative height relationships between objects and develop a Height Adaptive Scaling Module (HASM) to adaptively adjust object heights, enhancing the expressive capability of elevation information in the projection images. As for feature representation, we design a dual-branch network that effectively captures local and global context from the projection images within a large receptive field. Meanwhile, we propose an Elevation Guidance Adaptive Fusion Module (EGAFM) that adaptively fuses 2D and 3D features based on occlusion relationships to reduce feature confusion caused by occlusion in elevation projection, ensuring meaningful fusion between multimodal features. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our EGAFNet outperforms current state-of-the-art methods."

 Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas with complex urban sources and environmental sensitivities.

The results reveal significant overestimations in EDGAR inventories, especially in the energy and waste sectors. Temporal disaggregation shows strong associations between methane enhancements and environmental drivers, including PM2.5, NO2, CO, OH concentrations, temperature, and NDVI. Fossil fuel–related emissions increase with pollutant accumulation and low OH availability, while waste-related emissions exhibit temperature sensitivity and weak vegetation coupling.

 In this study, 12-h quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) by a cloud-resolving model for six heavy-rainfall events selected from the Mei-yu seasons (May–June) of 2016–2019 in Taiwan are examined. For each case, 30 forecasts from five experiments were made at six lead times 12 h apart (up to 60 h) using different initial fields, some with data assimilation (DA) of those on the Global Telecommunication System (GTS data) and GTS data plus sounding retrievals from polar-orbiting satellite (SAT data) to study their impacts on QPFs.Among these six cases, three occurred when strong prefrontal southwesterly flow at low levels impinged on the island (SWF cases), with rainfall maxima of 193–307 mm in mountain interiors in southern Taiwan. For these SWF cases, the predictability was relatively high, and the QPFs also benefited from initial fields produced using a finer grid. Around 70 % of instances, the DA of additional data also exhibited positive impacts on QPFs, both over the entire Taiwan and at local rainfall centers. In the other three cases, Mei-yu fronts were present near Taiwan and heavy rainfall (peaking at 227–635 mm) from organized convective systems occurred over low-lying plains as well. Due to the high nonlinearity of deep convection, the predictability of such events was much lower with less-ideal overall performance. While the overall gain was only minimal, better QPFs for the frontal cases were still achievable at roughly 1/3 of times through DA, particularly when key information near Taiwan was ingested, typically immediately upstream from the heavy rainfall region."

 Understanding the evolutionary characteristics of regional droughts is essential for ecological and socioeconomic sustainability, especially in water-scarce regions. The propagation from meteorological drought (MD) to agricultural drought (AD) in the Loess Plateau (LP), shaped by climate change and large-scale vegetation restoration, has not yet been fully elucidated. This study investigates the dynamic propagation from MD to AD in the LP, employing cumulative precipitation anomaly and the standardized soil moisture index to characterize MD and AD, respectively. A mutation detection algorithm was applied to divide the study period into pre- and post-mutation phases, allowing for a systematic examination of changes in drought propagation characteristics and their controlling factors. The results indicate that, following the mutation, the mean drought propagation time from MD to AD across the LP decreased from 5.0 to 4.5 months. With increasing severity of MD, the drought propagation risk exhibits a nonlinear rise, and this risk further intensifies after the mutation. The required to trigger mild AD declined from 62.2 to 45.5 mm, suggesting reduced resilience of the agricultural system to MD. Dynamic attribution analysis further revealed that the normalized difference vegetation index was the dominant driver of both the shortened propagation time and the reduced thresholds, suggesting that vegetation restoration has, to some extent, exacerbated the propagation from MD to AD. These results not only contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamic propagation mechanism from MD to AD under changing environmental conditions in the LP but also offer scientific guidance for developing targeted drought-resistance strategies and mitigating the risk of AD."

 Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have significantly advanced applications in climate science and physical oceanography, yet concerns over reproducibility and rigorous evaluation remain paramount. In this study, we reproduce a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) prediction, providing a fully documented, from-scratch methodology, from anomaly map generation to model implementation on Google Colaboratory, that ensures transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility while establishing a benchmark framework for evaluating performance metrics. Our analysis across six metrics demonstrates that different measures capture distinct aspects of model performance, revealing a sharp decline in CNN accuracy from the 20th to the 21st century, likely due to overfitting, for which we recommend generalization strategies. We further identify methodological issues, including the inadvertent use of overlapping CMIP5 training and validation datasets, which may inflate skill estimates by up to 6 %, and latent climatological signals within input data that could artificially enhance predictive skill. Comparative evaluation with the advanced 3D-Geoformer model shows that, despite similar correlation skill, the CNN exhibits substantially higher error levels, with RMSE values five times greater, underscoring the necessity of employing diverse metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that the use of ensemble averaging and L2 norm cost functions biases predictions toward neutral ENSO conditions, limiting the model's ability to capture event intensity and posing risks for decision-making applications. Collectively, these findings emphasize the critical role of methodological rigor, diverse evaluation metrics, and careful data handling in advancing the robustness and practical utility of ML-based approaches in physical oceanography."

 The study of characteristic parameters of lightning current-carrying channels is crucial for a deeper understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying lightning discharge processes. The present study investigated the radial distributions and temporal evolution of temperature, electron density, and conductivity in the lightning core current-carrying channel. The calculations employed a one-dimensional radial Fourier heat conduction equation, accounting for Joule heating generated by the return-stroke current and the effects of radiative energy loss. The study found that the peak temperature is positively correlated with the current but does not follow a simple functional relationship. The decay rate of both temperature and conductivity accelerates toward the channel edge. Their peak values lag behind the current peak, reaching maxima near the half-peak point of the return-stroke current. With the presence of the return-stroke current, the calculated channel temperature matches well with the values diagnosed from ionic lines in experimental spectra. In the late stage of the return-stroke discharge, the channel temperature aligns with that derived from atomic lines. This finding further confirms that ionic lines originate primarily from radiation in the current-carrying core channel, providing a basis for deeper understanding of the light radiation mechanism within the channel. With the presence of the return-stroke current, the channel maintains a relatively high electron density and conductivity. The radial decay of electron density in the core channel does not exhibit orders-of-magnitude changes; it shows a slight increase at the edge during 30-100 μs. The regions of high temperature, electron density, and conductivity expand radially outward with time, resulting in a gradually rising of temperature, electron density, and conductivity around the perimeter of the core channel, this feature effectively enlarging the radius of the high-temperature, high-conductivity range, which is a critical factor influencing current transmission."

 Cloud water, as a key component of clouds, plays a critical role in cloud-related processes such as precipitation and radiation. However, some early satellite observation datasets exhibit some inaccuracies in distinguishing cloud water phases. This paper aims to obtain more accurate cloud water data for earlier years. To achieve this, machine learning schemes are developed to predict the global monthly mean ice water fraction (IWF). These predictions are based on CloudSat-CALIPSO satellite observations, International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) dataset and the fifth-generation Earth Reanalysis Atmospheric (ERA5) reanalysis data. Four machine learning algorithms are used: Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGB), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The results show that all four schemes achieve high predictive accuracy on the test set. However, LGB outperforms in computational efficiency, and is selected for the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis and final long-term reconstruction. A new metric is defined by integrating coefficient of determination (R2) and training time to comprehensively evaluate the performance of machine learning schemes called R2-Time score (RTS). SHAP analysis indicates that specific humidity, latitude, and relative humidity are the main factors influencing IWF prediction, and the LGB scheme's prediction mechanism aligns with physical expectation. The prediction mechanisms of the scheme do not exhibit strong temporal or spatial dependency. Ultimately, the study uses the LGB scheme to reconstruct global monthly mean IWF data from July 1983 to December 2009. The reconstructed IWF dataset successfully captures distinct annual cycles and reproduces the climatic variability observed in ISCCP and CloudSat-CALIPSO records, while simultaneously correcting the systematic biases in cloud-phase classification present in ISCCP. This study offers both improved historical datasets and methodological advances for investigations of cloud–climate interactions.Plain language summaryClouds have an important impact on radiation, precipitation, and the water cycle in the Earth-atmosphere system. As a key component of clouds, cloud water plays a decisive role in cloud formation and dissipation, precipitation, and radiation processes. However, early passive remote sensing satellite observations have errors in distinguishing cloud water phases. To obtain more accurate cloud water phase data, this study trains four machine learning schemes using multi-source data from CloudSat-CALIPSO, International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) and the fifth-generation Earth Reanalysis Atmospheric (ERA5) reanalysis data to predict ice water fraction (IWF): Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGB), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).

Additionally, we verify the generalization ability of the machine learning schemes and evaluate the interpretability of the LGB scheme using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method.

 Collision-coalescence and cloud-rain auto-conversion are key factors affecting cloud microphysical properties and the evolution of cloud droplet spectra. However, there are still gaps in understanding the relationship between collision-coalescence and gamma spectral parameters, which introduces significant uncertainty into cloud model development and climate prediction. In this study, aircraft observations of warm shallow cumulus clouds from the Holistic Interactions of Shallow clouds, Aerosols, and Land-Ecosystems (HISCALE) were analyzed. In addition, auto-conversion threshold functions were utilized to indicate collision-coalescence intensity, which subsequently served as the basis for investigating its potential impact on the cloud droplet size distribution. The results reveal that the strengthening of collision-coalescence is accompanied by a nonlinear increase in relative dispersion and a notable broadening of its distribution.The correlation between relative dispersion and skewness/kurtosis is positive when collision-coalescence is strong, but becomes negative as it weakens. This transition depends on the shifting dominance from collision-coalescence to condensation. Simultaneously, according to the difference in gamma distribution under different strengths of collision-coalescence, a fourth parameter is suggested to have a larger value when collision-coalescence is stronger, and the analytical relation between skewness (kurtosis) and this parameter are deviated. The possibility of the alternative use of volume-mean radius is discussed, and it is found that with the increase in the volume-mean radius, the spectral parameters gradually decrease and converge. However, when volume-mean radius is in the range of 4-6 μm, the relationship of spectral parameters is more complex, and the reasons need to be further explored."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108584,False,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文主要关注中国北方内陆城市群的大气环境承载力评估与预测，侧重于气象条件和排放对雾霾事件的影响。研究使用了WRF/CMAQ模型来模拟和分析空气质量，并评估了二氧化硫、氮氧化物、颗粒物等污染物的大气环境承载力。虽然涉及空气质量监测和大气成分分析，但并未明确提及或使用大气环境遥感技术，如卫星观测或特定遥感传感器的应用。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术的关联性较弱。,"['air quality', 'emission', 'air pollution', 'meteorological conditions', 'WRF/CMAQ model', 'SO2', 'NOx', 'PM2.5', 'PM10']",Zhongxiu Zhen;Linhao Guo;Fei Xie;Liang Li;Xingjun Zhou;Chunyu Wu;Frank Yonghong Li;Jinyuan Xin;Changwei Lü,Evaluation and prediction of atmospheric environmental carrying capacity in an Inland urban agglomeration in northern China,"•Meteorological conditions contributed significantly on haze by WRF-CMAQ method. •Energy mix and city position played decisive role in adjusting haze events. •Coal-fueled energy mix resulted in air pollutants overloading during 2016–2020. •Future AECC for NOxremains critical in Chinese northwest urban agglomeration. •Policy should be tilted to clean energy in future energy reshaping and air manage. 
 Evaluating the atmospheric environmental carrying capacity (AECC) accurately and reasonably is crucial to coordinate the relationships between economic development and environmental protection. In this study, several unexpected severe haze episodes that occurred in January 2020 in two representative coal-fueled cities in northern China was investigated using the Weather Research and Forecasting/Community Multiscale Air Quality (WRF/CMAQ) model, with a focus on the roles of meteorological conditions and emissions. Additionally, the AECC for Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), Coarse Particulate Matter (PM10), and Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5) during the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016–2020), as well as projections for 2025 and 2030, was comprehensively evaluated by integrating box model inferred method with carrying capacity index method. The Atmospheric Self-Purification Index (ASI) results indicated that unfavorable meteorological conditions coupled with enhanced secondary generations were the main drivers of these haze periods. Further source apportionment results indicated that residential, industrial, and dust emissions were the major contributors in this region. The AECC exhibited similar patterns during both the 13th Five-Year Plan period and future scenarios, with values in Baotou significantly lower than those in Hohhot. Furthermore, comparable seasonal variations were observed in both cities, with the overloaded situations predominantly occurring in winter, even under more stringent future scenarios. These results suggested more stricter policy should be carried out in coal-fueled resource-oriented cities, particularly those with a significant industrial profile. Moreover, NOx and SO2 were identified as the main overloaded pollutants in both 2016–2020 and future scenarios, highlighting the urgency in introducing policies to deal with these reactive gaseous pollutants or alternatively introducing cleaner energy. Considering the substantial potential of both wind farm and photovoltaic foundation in Inner Mongolia, future policies should prioritize the development of photovoltaic and wind farm to mitigate the overloaded situations of NOx and SO2. This study provides valuable scientific insights for improving air quality in these cities and other coal-fueled cities in northern China, and offers important support for the development of effective strategies to reduce urban atmospheric pollution in China."
