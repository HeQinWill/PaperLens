10.5194/acp-25-1883-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了挥发性化学产品（VCP）苄醇在大气中的化学反应，特别是其与氢氧自由基（OH）的反应，以及这些反应如何影响城市雾霾的形成。论文通过实验测量了苄醇氧化产生的主要气相产物（如羟基苄醇和苯甲醛）的比例，并进一步研究了这些产物如何形成二次有机气溶胶（SOA）。由于SOA是空气质量的重要影响因素，并且该研究涉及大气成分的分析，因此与大气环境遥感技术具有一定的相关性，尤其是在空气质量监测和大气成分分析方面。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术或卫星观测，但其研究结果可以为相关遥感数据的解释和模型验证提供参考。,"['air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'secondary organic aerosol', 'volatile chemical products', 'gas-phase oxidation', 'urban smog']",Reina S. Buenconsejo;Sophia M. Charan;John H. Seinfeld;Paul O. Wennberg,Quantifying primary oxidation products in the OH-initiated reaction of benzyl alcohol,"We look at the atmospheric chemistry of a volatile chemical product (VCP), benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol and other VCPs may play a significant role in the formation of urban smog. By better understanding the chemistry of VCPs like benzyl alcohol, we may better understand observed data and how VCPs affect air quality. We identify products formed from benzyl alcohol chemistry and use this chemistry to understand how benzyl alcohol forms a key component of smog, secondary organic aerosol. 
 Benzyl alcohol is found in many volatile chemical products (VCPs) including a number of personal care products and industrial solvents. We report here on  the products of the gas-phase oxidation of benzyl alcohol by OH and its dependence on nitric oxide (NO) levels. Using a gas chromatography in tandem with a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) and gas chromatographer with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID), we measure the branching fractions to the major gas-phase oxidation products: hydroxybenzyl alcohol (HBA) and benzaldehyde. Later-generation oxidation products from both HBA and benzaldehyde pathways are also observed. In particular, catechol is a major gas-phase product of HBA. The fraction of H abstraction from benzyl alcohol leading to benzaldehyde formation is unaffected by [NO], with an average branching fraction of (21±10) %. The fraction of OH addition leading to HBA formation (36±18) % also does not appear to vary with [NO]. Consistent with the known high SOA yields of catechol, we find that HBA has a very high secondary organic aerosol (SOA) yield. Thus, benzyl alcohol and its oxidation products efficiently produce secondary organic aerosol –  under some conditions approaching unity. Insights from the present study can help elucidate the chemistry of other atmospherically relevant aromatic compounds, especially those found in VCPs."
10.5194/acp-25-1899-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要探讨了羰基化合物在成渝平原城市群臭氧污染中的作用。通过在九个地点的现场观测和模型分析，发现羰基化合物的浓度与臭氧污染程度密切相关，尤其是在涉及烯烃和生物源挥发性有机化合物的二次化学过程中。研究强调了区域合作对于有效控制臭氧污染的重要性。虽然论文没有直接涉及卫星观测或遥感技术，但其对大气成分的分析和空气质量监测具有重要意义，可以为相关遥感技术的应用提供地面验证数据和研究方向。,"['carbonyl compounds', 'ozone pollution', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'VOC-limited regime', 'photochemical reactions']",Jiemeng Bao;Xin Zhang;Zhenhai Wu;Li Zhou;Jun Qian;Qinwen Tan;Fumo Yang;Junhui Chen;Yunfeng Li;Hefan Liu;Liqun Deng;Hong Li,"Atmospheric carbonyl compounds are crucial in regional ozone heavy pollution: insights from the Chengdu Plain Urban Agglomeration, China","We studied carbonyl compounds' role in ozone pollution in the Chengdu Plain Urban Agglomeration, China. During heavy pollution in August 2019, we measured carbonyls at nine sites and analyzed their impact. Areas with higher carbonyl levels, like Chengdu, had worse ozone pollution. While their abundance matters, chemical reactions with other pollutants are the main drivers. Our findings show regional cooperation is vital to reducing ozone pollution effectively. 
 Gaseous carbonyl compounds serve as crucial precursors and intermediates in atmospheric photochemical reactions, significantly contributing to ambient ozone formation. To determine whether the impact of carbonyl compounds on regional ozone pollution is driven by their abundance or by specific secondary chemical processes, simultaneous field observations and observation-based modeling of ambient carbonyls were conducted at nine sites within the Chengdu Plain Urban Agglomeration (CPUA), China, during 4–18 August 2019, when three episodes of regional heavy ozone pollution occurred across eight cities within CPUA. Throughout the study, the total mixing ratios of 15 carbonyls ranged from 10.7 ± 4.2 to 35.2 ± 13.4 ppbv. The spatial distribution reveals that regions with higher concentrations of carbonyl compounds, such as around Chengdu, are also areas with more severe ozone pollution. Both the abundance and the chemical reactivity of carbonyl compounds, especially formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, play crucial roles in ozone formation in the CPUA. On ozone pollution days, carbonyl concentrations significantly increased by 22.8 % to 66.2 %. While the abundance of carbonyls is an important factor, their significant role in heavy ozone pollution within the CPUA is primarily driven by secondary chemical processes, particularly those involving alkenes and biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). Sites with higher average ozone concentrations during observations were mainly in the VOC-limited regime, while others were in the transitional regime. Additionally, the mutual transport of carbonyl compounds between cities in the CPUA suggests that regional collaboration is essential to address ozone pollution effectively. These findings offer valuable insights for developing effective strategies to control regional ozone pollution."

BrC in the gas phase was mainly controlled by secondary formation and particle-to-gas partitioning. BrC in the particle phase was mainly from secondary formation. This work helps to get a better understanding of diurnal variations and the sources of brown carbon aerosol at a rural location in central Europe. 
 Brown carbon aerosol (BrC) is a major contributor to atmospheric air pollution in Europe, especially in winter. Therefore, we studied the chemical composition, diurnal variation, and sources of BrC from  17 February to 16 March 2021 at a rural location in southwest Germany. In total, 178 potential BrC molecules (including 7 nitro aromatic compounds, NACs) were identified in the particle phase comprising on average 83 ± 44 ng m−3, and 31 potential BrC (including 4 NACs) molecules were identified in the gas phase contributing on average 8.5 ± 6.7 ng m−3 during the whole campaign. The average light absorption of seven NACs in the particle phase was 0.2 ± 0.2 Mm−1, contributing to 2.2 ± 2.1 % of total BrC absorption at 370 nm. In addition, diurnal variations show that gas-phase BrC was higher in the daytime and lower at night. It was mainly controlled by secondary formation (e.g. photooxidation) and particle-to-gas partitioning. Correspondingly, the particle-phase BrC was lower in the daytime and higher at night. Secondary formation dominates the particle-phase BrC with 61 ± 21 %, while 39 ± 21 % originated from biomass burning. Furthermore, the particle-phase BrC showed decreasing light absorption due to photochemical ageing. This study extends the current understanding of real-time behaviours of brown carbon aerosol in the gas and particle phase at a location characteristic of central Europe."

This dataset effectively combines the distinct advantages of two long-term SSM datasets, which is also the first hour-level 1-km soil moisture dataset at the continental US scale. The new dataset could provide new insight into the fast changes in soil moisture along with drought and wet spell occurrences. 
 Surface soil moisture (SSM) is a critical variable for understanding the terrestrial hydrologic cycle, and it influences ecosystem dynamics, agriculture productivity, and water resource management. Although SSM information is widely estimated through satellite-derived and model-assimilated methods, datasets with fine spatio-temporal resolutions remain unavailable at the continental scale, yet are essential for improving weather forecasting, optimizing precision irrigation, and enhancing fire risk assessment. In this study, we developed a new 3-hour, 1-km spatially seamless SSM dataset spanning 2015 to 2023, covering the entire contiguous United States (CONUS), using a spatio-temporal fusion model. This approach effectively combines the distinct advantages of two long-term SSM datasets, namely, the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) L4 SSM product and the Crop Condition and Soil Moisture Analytics (Crop-CASMA) dataset. The SMAP product provides spatially seamless SSM observations with a 3-hour temporal resolution but at a 9-km spatial resolution, while the Crop-CASMA SSM dataset offers a finer spatial resolution of 1 km but has a daily temporal resolution and contains spatial gaps. To overcome the spatio-temporal mismatch between the two products, we developed a time-series data mining approach known as the highly comparative time-series analysis (HCTSA) method to extract multiple spatially seamless characteristics (e.g., maximum and mean) from the two inter-annual SSM datasets (i.e., SMAP and Crop-CASMA). Then the fusion model was constructed using the extracted 9-km and 1-km characteristics and each scene of the SMAP, in turn. Finally, the 3-hour, 1-km SSM data (named as STF_SSM) were predicted from 2015 to 2023. The comparison with in-situ data from multiple SSM observation networks showed that the performance of our STF_SSM dataset is better than the Crop-CASMA and is close to the SMAP L4 product, with mean correlation coefficients (CC) of 0.716 at the daily scale and 0.689 at the 3-hour scale. The STF_SSM dataset in this study is the first long time-series, spatially seamless SSM dataset to realize continuous intra-day 1-km SSM observations every 3 hours across the CONUS, which provides a new insight into the fast changes in soil moisture along with drought and wet spell occurrences, and ecosystem responses. Additionally, this dataset provides a valuable data source for the calibration and validation of land surface models.

Compatible with FLUXNET, it fosters global collaboration and advances research in environmental science and regional climate dynamics. 
 Eddy covariance observations play a pivotal role in understanding the land–atmosphere exchange of energy, water, carbon dioxide (CO2), and other trace gases, as well as the global carbon cycle and earth system. To promote the networking of individual measurements and the sharing of data, FLUXNET links regional networks of researchers studying land–atmosphere processes. JapanFlux was established in 2006 as a country branch of AsiaFlux. Despite the growing number of shared data globally, the availability in Asia is currently limited. In this study, we developed an open dataset of the eddy covariance observations for Japan and East Asia, called JapanFlux2024, that was conducted by researchers affiliated with Japanese research institutions. The dataset consists of data collected at 79 sites with 652 site-years from 1990 to 2023. The data format is fully compatible with the recent FLUXNET data product, FLUXNET2015. Here, we present the data description and data processing and show the value of processed fluxes of sensible heat, latent heat, and CO2. The dataset will facilitate important studies for Japan and East Asia, such as land-atmosphere interactions, improvement of process models, and upscaling fluxes using machine learning and remote sensing technology as well as bridge collaborations between Asia and FLUXNET."
10.5194/essd-2025-20,False,Earth System Science Data Discussions,该研究论文主要关注中国大陆地区高精度格点降水数据集的开发。它利用3476个雨量计的数据，结合多种降水相关变量和机器学习方法，创建了一个1960-2023年的日降水数据集（CHM_PRE V2）。该数据集旨在提高降水测量的准确性，减少降水事件的过度估计，并为水文建模和气候评估提供可靠的基础。虽然该研究与气候变化相关，但它主要侧重于降水数据的改进和应用，而不是大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['Precipitation', 'Rain gauges', 'Water resources', 'Climate change', 'Hydrological modeling']",Jinlong Hu;Chiyuan Miao;Jiajia Su;Qi Zhang;Jiaojiao Gou;Qiaohong Sun,A new upgraded high-precision gridded precipitation dataset considering spatiotemporal and physical correlations for mainland China,"We developed a high-precision daily precipitation dataset for mainland China called CHM_PRE V2. Using data from 3,476 rain gauges, 11 related precipitation variables and advanced machine learning methods, we created a daily precipitation dataset spanning 1960–2023 with unprecedented accuracy. Compared to existing datasets, it better captures rainfall events while reducing false alarms. This work provides a reliable tool for studying water resources, climate change, and disaster management. 
 Precipitation is a critical driver of the water cycle, profoundly influencing water resources, agricultural productivity, and natural disasters. However, existing gridded precipitation datasets exhibit markable deficiencies in capturing the spatiotemporal and physical correlations of precipitation, which limits their accuracy, particularly in regions with sparse meteorological stations. Therefore, this study proposes a completely new gridded precipitation generation scheme to address these issues. The long-term daily observation from 3,476 gauges and incorporated 11 related precipitation variables were utilized to characterize the correlations of precipitation. By employing an improved inverse distance weighting method combined with the machine learning-based light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) algorithm, a new high-precision, long-term, daily gridded precipitation dataset for mainland China (CHM_PRE V2) was developed, which aims to improve upon and surpass the CHM_PRE V1 dataset, developed in our previous work. Validation against 63,397 high-density gauges demonstrated that CHM_PRE V2 significantly outperforms existing datasets, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.48 mm/day and a Kling-Gupta efficiency of 0.88, representing improvements of 12.84 % and 12.86 %, respectively, compared to the previously optimal dataset. Regarding precipitation event detection, CHM_PRE V2 achieved a Heidke skill score of 0.68 and a false alarm ratio of 0.24, surpassing other datasets by 17.24 % and 29.17 %, respectively. Feature importance analysis revealed that spatiotemporal and physical correlations contributed 37.10 %, 34.11 %, and 28.78 % to precipitation retrieval, underscoring the necessity of incorporating temporal and physical correlations. CHM_PRE V2 markedly enhances precipitation measurement accuracy, reduces overestimation of precipitation events, and provides a reliable foundation for hydrological modelling and climate assessments. This dataset features a resolution of 0.1°, spans from 1960 to 2023, and will be updated annually.

This dataset offers improved accuracy and detail compared to earlier versions, meeting high international standards for climate data. By refining how measurement errors are calculated and reduced over time and space, we provide clearer insights into pollution patterns. This work supports better air quality monitoring and informs actions to address pollution globally. 
 We introduce the new ESA Climate Change Initiative TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) global monthly Level 3 (L3) dataset of tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) for May 2018 to December 2021. The dataset provides spatiotemporally averaged tropospheric NO2 columns, associated averaging kernels and L3 uncertainties at spatial resolutions of 0.2°, 0.5°, and 1.0° on a monthly timescale (https://doi.org/10.21944/CCI-NO2-TROPOMI-L3). To improve our understanding of what fraction of the L2 uncertainty cancels when averaging over space or time (i.e. the random component of the L2 uncertainty) and what fraction persists despite the averaging (systematic component), we first determine spatial and temporal error correlations for all sources of uncertainty in the L2 retrieval. Spatial error correlations arise from the stratosphere-troposphere correction, and from coarse-gridded albedo climatologies used in the L2 air mass factor calculation. We find the temporal error correlation in both the stratospheric uncertainty and the air-mass factor uncertainty to be 30 %. Using these estimates, the L3 uncertainty budget has been established for every grid cell based on input L2 uncertainties and new methods to estimate spatial and temporal representativeness uncertainties and to propagate measurement uncertainties through space and time. The total relative uncertainty in the resulting Level 3 dataset is in the range of 15–20 % in polluted areas, which is significantly lower than in separate Level 2 orbit retrievals, and brings the tropospheric NO2 data to within the GCOS ""goal"" and ""breakthrough"" requirements. Validation of the (sub-)columns confirms better correlation and reduced dispersion in the differences between satellite and ground-based reference data for the L3 data w.r.t. the underlying L2, albeit with a more pronounced negative bias in the tropospheric columns at pollution hot spots, most probably related to stronger spatial smearing."

Harbeck;Andy Aschwanden,A revised and expanded deep radiostratigraphy of the Greenland Ice Sheet from airborne radar sounding surveys between 1993–2019,"This manuscript describes the second version of a radiostratigraphic database for the Greenland Ice Sheet. It includes numerous improvements to original database from 2015, and includes more and more high-quality radar-sounding data in its assessment. It represents a unique and widespread potential constraint on the history of the ice sheet that could be targeted by ice-sheet models. 
 Between 1993 and 2019, NASA and NSF sponsored 26 separate airborne campaigns that surveyed the thickness and radiostratigraphy of the Greenland Ice Sheet using successive generations of coherent VHF radar sounders developed and operated by The University of Kansas. Most of the ice-sheet’s internal VHF radiostratigraphy is composed of isochronal reflections that record its integrated response to past centennial-to-multi-millennial-scale climatic and dynamic events. We previously generated the first comprehensive dated radiostratigraphy of the Greenland Ice Sheet using the first 20 of these campaigns (1993–2013) and investigated its value for constraining the ice sheet’s history and modern boundary conditions. Here we describe the second major version of this radiostratigraphic dataset using all 26 campaigns, which includes substantial improvements in survey coverage and was mostly acquired with higher-fidelity systems. We incorporated several lessons learned from our previous efforts for improved quality control and accelerated tracing, including an automatic test for stratigraphic conformability, a cutoff length for semi-automatic tracing propagation, a thickness-normalized reprojection for radargrams, and automatic inter-segment reflection matching. We reviewed and augmented the 1993–2013 radiostratigraphy and applied an existing independently developed method for predicting radiostratigraphy to the previously untraced campaigns (2014–2019) to accelerate their semi-automatic tracing. The result is a more robust radiostratigraphy of the ice sheet that can validate the sensitivity of ice-sheet models to past major climate changes and constrain long-term boundary conditions (e.g., accumulation rate). Based on these results, we make several recommendations for how radiostratigraphy may be traced more efficiently and reliably in the future. This dataset is freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14531734 (MacGregor et al., 2024). It includes all traced reflections at the spatial resolution of the radargrams and grids (5 km horizontal resolution) of the depths of isochrones between 3–115 ka and ages between 10–80 % of the ice thickness; associated codes are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14183061 (MacGregor, 2024a)."

 During the Atlantic References and Convection (ARC) ship campaign with the reference MSM114/2, which took place in early 2023, the German research vessel Maria S. Merian travelled from Mindelo, Cape Verde, to Punta Arenas, Chile. One of the main objectives of ARC was to obtain vertically resolved cross sections of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). To this end, we crossed the ITCZ three times in the meridional direction. We present the atmospheric and oceanographic measurements collected during ARC in a standardised way to facilitate working with data from different instruments and to make the data easily accessible. This approach is not limited to ARC but could serve as a prototype for future (and past) ship campaigns.

 In geosciences, including hydrology and geomorphology, the reliance on numerical models necessitates the precise calibration of their parameters to effectively translate information from observed to unobserved settings. Traditional calibration techniques, however, are marked by poor generalizability, demanding significant manual labor for data preparation and the calibration process itself. Moreover, the utility of machine-learning-based and data-driven approaches is curtailed by the requirement for the numerical model to be differentiable for optimization purposes, which challenges their generalizability across different models. Furthermore, the potential of freely available geomorphological data remains underexploited in existing methodologies. In response to these challenges, we introduce a generalizable framework for calibrating numerical models, with a particular focus on geomorphological models, named Iterative Model Calibration (IMC). This approach efficiently identifies the optimal set of parameters for a given numerical model through a strategy based on a Gaussian neighborhood algorithm. Through experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of IMC in calibrating the widely used landscape evolution model CAESAR-Lisflood (CL). The IMC process substantially improves the agreement between CL predictions and observed data (in the context of gully catchment landscape evolution), surpassing both uncalibrated and manual approaches."

Their validation is generally hindered by not knowing the truth. We propose a virtual framework in which this truth is fully known and the sensor observations for cosmic ray neutron sensing, remote sensing, and hydrogravimetry are simulated. This allows for the rigorous testing of these virtual sensors to understand their effectiveness and limitations. 
 Various methods are available to measure water storage across different landscape compartments, e.g. cosmic-ray neutron sensing, remote sensing, or hydrogravimetry. All these methods provide integral estimates that are representative of their corresponding measurement volume.However, we typically do not know the true value of water storage in these measurement volumes, which makes it difficult to assess the accuracy of such methods.In this study we suggest a synthetic virtual landscape that allows for an exact definition of all variables of interest and, consequently, constitutes the so-called “virtual truth” free of knowledge gaps. Such a landscape can be explored in various “virtual field campaigns” using “virtual sensors” that mimic the response and characteristics of actual devices. We use dedicated physically based models to simulate the signal a sensor would receive. These model outputs, termed “virtual observations”, can be explored and also allow for the reconstruction of water storage, which can then readily be compared to the virtual truth. Insights from this comparison could help to better understand real measurements and their uncertainties and to challenge accepted knowledge about signal processing and data interpretation.The Virtual Joint Field Campaign is an open collaborative framework for constructing such landscapes. It comprises data and methods to create and combine different compartments of the landscape (e.g. atmosphere, soil, vegetation). The present study demonstrates virtual observations of water storage with cosmic-ray neutron sensing, hydrogravimetry, and remote sensing in three exemplary landscapes. It enables unprecedented opportunities for the systematic assessment of the sensor's strengths and weaknesses and even their combined use."

One of the most prominent right-to-know laws, California’s Proposition 65, has been in force since 1986, yet there is scant literature on its systemic impacts. We conducted 32 semi-structured interviews with business leaders representing some of the largest actors in their sectors to investigate Proposition 65’s impacts. We found that Proposition 65 prompts changes to consumer product ingredients and improves supply chain transparency. Businesses (re)formulated products for national and even international markets based on this state law, highlighting the leverage of environmental regulations in a large state like California. Information-forcing laws can thus protect public health in ways that transcend the immediate impacts of transparency with the public about product ingredients. Where Proposition 65 has prompted reformulation, however, there is no check on the safety of alternatives, aside from the incentive to avoid other Proposition 65-listed chemicals. In this study, semi-structured interviews gave insights into the less visible health benefits of a law that lacks built-in methods for quantifying impact and is often publicly disparaged by the businesses it governs."

Following an optimization-based approach, we determine the cost-optimal design and operation of a system producing hydrogen from surplus electricity, including the option of battery and hydrogen storage. Two potential applications are analyzed: (1) a fuel-saving scenario, where electrolytic hydrogen substitutes fossil-fuel-derived hydrogen, whenever surplus electricity is available, and (2) a fuel-replacing scenario, where hydrogen from surplus electricity fully replaces a subset of fossil-fueled hydrogen production facilities. Our findings suggest that hydrogen from surplus electricity could substitute 30% (1.9 MtH2/y) of fossil hydrogen, reducing ammonia and refinery emissions by 18% (20 MtCO2/y). However, fully replacing fossil-fueled hydrogen production facilities increases hydrogen production costs substantially as it requires costly battery and/or hydrogen storage capacity to balance hydrogen production and supply.

During wet weather, the total chemical concentrations and bioactivities in the water increased, but the concentrations in SPM did not change. As SPM levels increased, the SPM-bound chemicals contributed 6–16% to the overall concentrations in the water column during wet weather but only 0.1–0.9% during dry weather. The mixture effects were more strongly associated with SPM under wet conditions, particularly for AhR activity, where SPM accounted for over 90% of the observed effects. The AhR activity may therefore serve as an indicator for assessing the risks of SPM-related pollution in rivers.

The average uptake coefficient of NO2 on organics during 1 h (γa) varied in the range of (1.1–8.0) × 10–6. Light led to an increase in γa by a factor of 2.2–11.5 times. HONO was generated by electron transfer from excited organics to NO2, as shown by the linear correlation of NO2 uptake and HONO formation with electron (e–) production from organics. Especially, the temporal variation of NO2 and HONO concentrations from the NO2 uptake on 9-methyl acridine (MA-N) showed a unique trend, where the NO2 uptake and HONO formation increased with time. The photochemical reaction of NO2 with MA-N generated nitrogen-/oxygen-containing species as well as demethylation species. The coexistence of oxygen-containing species, including acridone and hydroxy-methylacridine, had a synergistic effect on the photochemical conversion of NO2 to HONO.

Translating concentrations that cause bioactivity into real-world exposures, in other words, in vitro–in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE), requires chemical-specific parameters and mathematical models. An administered (for example, oral) equivalent dose rate (milligrams per kilogram per day) that causes steady-state human plasma concentrations (micromolar) equivalent to bioactive in vitro concentrations can be derived using a simple IVIVE equation. Herein, we explain how this IVIVE equation approximates a physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) model. Through the derivation of the steady-state solution of the PBTK model, we show how the simple IVIVE equation approximates relevant flows and tissues. We then extend the simple IVIVE equation by modifying the oral exposure PBTK model to include gas inhalation and exhalation. Gas exhalation increases clearance, potentially allowing more accurate prediction of the oral equivalent dose for semivolatile organic chemicals. The revised IVIVE equations also allow prediction of inhalation equivalent doses, in other words, the parts per million concentration that would cause steady-state human plasma concentrations equivalent to bioactive in vitro concentrations. Through comparison to an inhalation PBTK model, new simple IVIVE equations for plasma concentration have been developed, describing exhaled oral and inhalation doses."

Despite reductions in PM2.5 since the 2013 Clean Air Act, the level of the O3 concentration has continued to rise in China, underscoring the need for targeted pollution control measures. This study examined the seasonal and spatial variations of pollutants and meteorological variables in a major industrial city in Eastern China. Three widely used approaches, including the ozone formation potential (OFP) calculation, an observation-based model (OBM), and a random forest algorithm, were employed to investigate O3 formation in urban environments. Results show that oxygenated volatile organic compounds were the most significant contributors to summer urban O3, whereas their impact was significantly reduced during the winter. Each O3 formation evaluation model provided unique insights, with OFP offering rapid estimates, the OBM revealing detailed chemistry, and random forest capturing nonlinear interactions. However, the study also identified limitations in these models. OFP failed to account for seasonal variations in the level of O3 formation, and the random forest model struggled to distinguish causal relationships from correlations. These findings highlight the need for caution when relying on a single model and underscore the importance of integrating multiple methods to gain an accurate understanding of urban O3 formation dynamics, which is crucial to developing effective control strategies."

As a substitute for PFOS, sodium p-perfluorous nonenoxybenzenesulfonate (OBS) is extensively utilized in various applications and detected in human blood. However, its potential health risk in AS remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the comparative impacts of PFOS and OBS on endothelial dysfunction and atherogenesis. In the in vivo study, Apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE–/–) mice were exposed to 0.4 or 4 mg/L PFOS/OBS for 12 weeks. We found that dyslipidemia developed more rapidly in the OBS-exposed mice than in the PFOS-exposed mice. PFOS exhibited a higher enrichment capacity in both blood and aortic tissues than OBS. Remarkably, OBS induced a more pronounced inflammatory response and caused a more significant disruption of the endothelial barrier in the aorta of ApoE–/– mice compared to PFOS. In vitro experiments showed that OBS, at the same exposure concentrations and durations as PFOS (0.1–20 μmol/L, 48 h), more effectively inhibited cell viability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), caused higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and enhanced cell adhesion between HUVECs and monocytes. Both PFOS and OBS were found to activate the NF-κB signaling pathway and upregulate the expression of inflammatory factors. Notably, the use of OBS, but not PFOS, was shown to disrupt cell junctions and increase endothelial permeability by activating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that OBS may lead to endothelial dysfunction and have a greater impact on AS compared to PFOS, presenting significant health risks in cardiovascular diseases."

We analyze deformation over both short (decadal) timescales, captured by GNSS, and long (millennial to million‐year) timescales, observed through trench‐parallel active forearc faults. The results reveal a strong link between subduction obliquity and both the sense and amount of forearc rotation detected by GNSS, as well as the sense and rate of deformation along trench‐parallel strike‐slip faults. Unlike previous studies indicating that subduction obliquity affects forearc deformation only beyond a certain threshold, we demonstrate that even low to moderate obliquity significantly influences the observed deformation."

The fidelity of these VR‐CESM simulations is evaluated considering the near‐surface air temperature and precipitation fields for the 2000–2014 period in comparison to available observation‐based data sets and those of a coarse resolution (quasi‐uniform 1°) control simulation. Our analysis shows that, as a global model, VR‐CESM can be employed as an alternative to regional climate models to advance our understanding of the Euro‐Mediterranean climate. The improvements obtained are mainly related to a better representation of the complex topography of the region with higher resolution. Increasing the regional resolution to 0.25° generally yields considerable improvements over the control simulation; however, some persistent biases remain.

Above the ocean, the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is in a convective regime and its turbulence levels and structure are altered by the SST variations. Using large eddy simulations, we investigate an ABL flowing above a 1D oceanic submesoscale SST front. The organization of atmospheric turbulence evolves from rolls to a cell‐roll transition state but with a 3.5 km delay due to the strong advection. The SST gradient imprints on the atmosphere, creating a pressure gradient that accelerates the flow at all altitudes. On warm water, horizontal wind in the lower half of the ABL increases mainly due to turbulent mixing. Most of the flow is resolved, and we relate statistical quantities to coherent structures using a conditional sampling. The SST increase strengthens updrafts, whereas a downward motion develops in response, transporting high wind from the upper to the lower layers of the ABL. We show that this descending flow is not a downdraft but rather a less turbulent object similar to an enhanced compensating subsidence, which could be parametrized by a mass‐flux term.

This study aims to disentangle these two contributions in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) by analyzing the timescales of the tropical upwelling response to an abrupt quadrupling of CO2. Transient atmosphere‐ocean climate model simulations of 100 years under 4xCO2 conditions are compared to preindustrial control simulations and to simulations with an atmosphere‐only version of WACCM that uses preindustrial SSTs. We find that most of the response in both shallow and deep branches of the BDC occurs on fast timescales (first 2‐3 decades). In the shallow branch of the BDC, the response is mainly driven by changes in SSTs in the well‐mixed shallow ocean, which cause tropospheric warming and an intensification and upward displacement of the subtropical jets, and alter wave forcing in their vicinity. The contribution from stratospheric radiative cooling is almost negligible. In the upper stratosphere, the response of tropical upwelling begins earlier and develops faster than in the shallow branch, owing to the larger contribution from the rapid adjustments. At 1 hPa, 70% of the fast response relates to stratospheric radiative cooling and 30% to warmer SSTs. The modulation of the filtering of non‐orographic gravity waves (mainly of frontal origin) in the subtropics explain most of the response in tropical upwelling in the deep branch, on both fast and slow timescales."

In order to reduce instrumental baseline artifacts, the retrieval makes use of the difference of daytime and nighttime spectra (the nighttime ClO spectra are much smaller) to produce a day‐minus‐night ClO mixing ratio, which is the fundamental quantity analyzed throughout this study. Upper stratospheric ClO values peaked in ∼1997, and the trend in the upper stratospheric ChlOE measurements from 1997 to 2023 was found to be −0.4 ± 0.3%/yr (2σ). Comparisons of ChlOE measurements with a combined coincident Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) and Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) data set showed a relative trend of +0.3% ± 0.3%/yr (2σ) over 1992–2023, where a positive trend indicates that the ChlOE ClO measurements are increasing relative to those from MLS. Restricting the comparisons to ChlOE and Aura MLS over 2004–2023, resulted in relative trends that varied by pressure level, from +0.15%/yr to +0.42%/yr, all agreeing to within the 2σ uncertainty. Over the period 2004–2021, the average ChlOE trend for the three levels was −0.3 ± 0.4%/yr, but, with the addition of the unusually high ClO measured in 2022 and 2023 the trend from 2004 to 2023 became 0.0 ± 0.4%/yr. The increase in ClO during 2022 is, at least in part, caused by dynamical variations. The higher ClO in 2023 is closely correlated with the presence of increased H2O from the Hunga eruption, which affects the ClO chemistry."

Microwave radiometric observations are sensitive to integrated cloud water path but lack skill in distinguishing precipitation onset from cloud water and cloud ice due to radiation scattering. Precipitation radars to date have lacked sensitivity to drizzle and cloud radars have suffered from both the uncertainties inherent in Z‐R relations and poor sampling due to nadir‐only scans. This study optimally combines coincident active and passive microwave observations from CloudSat's Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) and the Advanced Scanning Microwave Radiometer (AMSR2) to resolve cloud and hydrometeor distribution parameters and to force consistency between the two independent sets of coincident observations.

 Water is the third most abundant molecule in the universe and a key component in the interiors of icy moons, giant planets, and Uranus- and Neptune-like exoplanets1–3. Owing to its distinct molecular structure and flexible hydrogen bonds that readily adapt to a wide range of pressures and temperatures, water forms numerous crystalline and amorphous phases4–6. Most relevant for the high pressures and temperatures of planetary interiors is ice VII4, and simulations have identified along its melting curve the existence of a so-called plastic phase7–12 where individual molecules occupy fixed positions as in a solid yet are able to rotate as in a liquid. Such plastic ice has not yet been directly observed in experiments. Here, we present quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements, conducted at temperatures between 450 and 600 K and pressures up to 6 GPa, that reveal the existence of a body centered cubic (bcc) structure, as found in ice VII, with water molecules exhibiting picosecond rotational dynamics typical for liquid water. Comparison with molecular dynamics simulations indicates that this plastic ice VII does not conform to a free rotor phase but rather exhibits rapid orientational jumps, as observed in jump-rotor plastic crystals13,14. We anticipate that our observation of plastic ice VII will impact our understanding of the geodynamics of icy planets and the differentiation processes of large icy moons."

Zywucka,Observation of an ultra-high-energy cosmic neutrino with KM3NeT,"A very high-energy muon observed by the KM3NeT experiment in the Mediterranean Sea is evidence for the interaction of an exceptionally high-energy neutrino of cosmic origin. 
 The detection of cosmic neutrinos with energies above a teraelectronvolt (TeV) offers a unique exploration into astrophysical phenomena1–3. Electrically neutral and interacting only by means of the weak interaction, neutrinos are not deflected by magnetic fields and are rarely absorbed by interstellar matter: their direction indicates that their cosmic origin might be from the farthest reaches of the Universe. High-energy neutrinos can be produced when ultra-relativistic cosmic-ray protons or nuclei interact with other matter or photons, and their observation could be a signature of these processes. Here we report an exceptionally high-energy event observed by KM3NeT, the deep-sea neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea4, which we associate with a cosmic neutrino detection. We detect a muon with an estimated energy of

               petaelectronvolts (PeV). In light of its enormous energy and near-horizontal direction, the muon most probably originated from the interaction of a neutrino of even higher energy in the vicinity of the detector. The cosmic neutrino energy spectrum measured up to now5–7 falls steeply with energy. However, the energy of this event is much larger than that of any neutrino detected so far. This suggests that the neutrino may have originated in a different cosmic accelerator than the lower-energy neutrinos, or this may be the first detection of a cosmogenic neutrino8, resulting from the interactions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with background photons in the Universe. A very high-energy muon observed by the KM3NeT experiment in the Mediterranean Sea is evidence for the interaction of an exceptionally high-energy neutrino of cosmic origin.  "

 Cognitive maps confer animals with flexible intelligence by representing spatial, temporal and abstract relationships that can be used to shape thought, planning and behaviour. Cognitive maps have been observed in the hippocampus1, but their algorithmic form and learning mechanisms remain obscure. Here we used large-scale, longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging to record activity from thousands of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus while mice learned to efficiently collect rewards from two subtly different linear tracks in virtual reality. Throughout learning, both animal behaviour and hippocampal neural activity progressed through multiple stages, gradually revealing improved task representation that mirrored improved behavioural efficiency. The learning process involved progressive decorrelations in initially similar hippocampal neural activity within and across tracks, ultimately resulting in orthogonalized representations resembling a state machine capturing the inherent structure of the task. This decorrelation process was driven by individual neurons acquiring task-state-specific responses (that is, ‘state cells’). Although various standard artificial neural networks did not naturally capture these dynamics, the clone-structured causal graph, a hidden Markov model variant, uniquely reproduced both the final orthogonalized states and the learning trajectory seen in animals. The observed cellular and population dynamics constrain the mechanisms underlying cognitive map formation in the hippocampus, pointing to hidden state inference as a fundamental computational principle, with implications for both biological and artificial intelligence. Insight into the algorithmic form and learning principles underlying cognitive maps in the hippocampus is provided."

 Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a muscle-degenerating disease caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which encodes the dystrophin protein1,2. Utrophin (UTRN), the genetic and functional paralogue of DMD, is upregulated in some DMD patients3–5. To further investigate this UTRN upregulation, we first developed an inducible messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation system for DMD by introducing a premature termination codon (PTC) in one of its alternatively spliced exons. Inclusion of the PTC-containing exon triggers DMD mutant mRNA decay and UTRN upregulation. Notably, blocking nonsense-mediated mRNA decay results in the reversal of UTRN upregulation, whereas overexpressing DMD does not. Furthermore, overexpressing DMDPTC minigenes in wild-type cells causes UTRN upregulation, as does a wild-type DMD minigene containing a self-cleaving ribozyme. To place these findings in a therapeutic context, we used splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to induce the skipping of out-of-frame exons of DMD, aiming to introduce PTCs. We found that these ASOs cause UTRN upregulation. In addition, when using an ASO to restore the DMD reading frame in myotubes derived from a DMDΔE52 patient, an actual DMD treatment, UTRN upregulation was reduced. Altogether, these results indicate that an mRNA decay-based mechanism called transcriptional adaptation6–8 plays a key role in UTRN upregulation in DMDPTC patients, and they highlight an unexplored therapeutic application of ASOs, as well as ribozymes, in inducing genetic compensation via transcriptional adaptation.  Transcriptional adaptation upregulates UTRN in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients, as supported by several lines of evidence, including the use of splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides to induce the skipping of out-of-frame exons of the DMD gene."

 Neuronal phenotypic traits such as morphology, connectivity and function are dictated, to a large extent, by a specific combination of differentially expressed genes. Clusters of neurons in transcriptomic space correspond to distinct cell types and in some cases—for example, Caenorhabditis elegans neurons1 and retinal ganglion cells2–4—have been shown to share morphology and function. The zebrafish optic tectum is composed of a spatial array of neurons that transforms visual inputs into motor outputs. Although the visuotopic map is continuous, subregions of the tectum are functionally specialized5,6. Here, to uncover the cell-type architecture of the tectum, we transcriptionally profiled its neurons, revealing more than 60 cell types that are organized in distinct anatomical layers. We measured the visual responses of thousands of tectal neurons by two-photon calcium imaging and matched them with their transcriptional profiles. Furthermore, we characterized the morphologies of transcriptionally identified neurons using specific transgenic lines. Notably, we found that neurons that are transcriptionally similar can diverge in shape, connectivity and visual responses. Incorporating the spatial coordinates of neurons within the tectal volume revealed functionally and morphologically defined anatomical subclusters within individual transcriptomic clusters. Our findings demonstrate that extrinsic, position-dependent factors expand the phenotypic repertoire of genetically similar neurons.

 The crypt–villus structure of the small intestine serves as an essential protective barrier. The integrity of this barrier is monitored by the complex sensory system of the gut, in which serotonergic enterochromaffin (EC) cells play an important part1,2. These rare sensory epithelial cells surveil the mucosal environment for luminal stimuli and transmit signals both within and outside the gut3–6. However, whether EC cells in crypts and villi detect different stimuli or produce distinct physiological responses is unknown. Here we address these questions by developing a reporter mouse model to quantitatively measure the release and propagation of serotonin from EC cells in live intestines. Crypt EC cells exhibit a tonic low-level mode that activates epithelial serotonin 5-HT4 receptors to modulate basal ion secretion and a stimulus-induced high-level mode that activates 5-HT3 receptors on sensory nerve fibres. Both these modes can be initiated by the irritant receptor TRPA1, which is confined to crypt EC cells. The activation of TRPA1 by luminal irritants is enhanced when the protective mucus layer is compromised. Villus EC cells also signal damage through a distinct mechanism, whereby oxidative stress activates TRPM2 channels, which leads to the release of both serotonin and ATP and consequent excitation of sensory nerve fibres. This topological segregation of EC cell functionality along the mucosal architecture constitutes a mechanism for the surveillance, maintenance and protection of gut integrity under diverse physiological conditions. Serotonergic enterochromaffin cells of the intestine exhibit distinct sensory, secretory and physiological properties depending on their location within the complex crypt–villus architecture of the gut."

 The breakdown of cellulose is one of the most important reactions in nature1,2 and is central to biomass conversion to fuels and chemicals3. However, the microfibrillar organization of cellulose and its complex interactions with other components of the plant cell wall poses a major challenge for enzymatic conversion4. Here, by mining the metagenomic ‘dark matter’ (unclassified DNA with unknown function) of a microbial community specialized in lignocellulose degradation, we discovered a metalloenzyme that oxidatively cleaves cellulose. This metalloenzyme acts on cellulose through an exo-type mechanism with C1 regioselectivity, resulting exclusively in cellobionic acid as a product. The crystal structure reveals a catalytic copper buried in a compact jelly-roll scaffold that features a flattened cellulose binding site. This metalloenzyme exhibits a homodimeric configuration that enables in situ hydrogen peroxide generation by one subunit while the other is productively interacting with cellulose. The secretome of an engineered strain of the fungus Trichoderma reesei expressing this metalloenzyme boosted the glucose release from pretreated lignocellulosic biomass under industrially relevant conditions, demonstrating its biotechnological potential. This discovery modifies the current understanding of bacterial redox enzymatic systems devoted to overcoming biomass recalcitrance5–7. Furthermore, it enables the conversion of agro-industrial residues into value-added bioproducts, thereby contributing to the transition to a sustainable and bio-based economy.

 UM171 is a potent agonist of ex vivo human haematopoietic stem cell self-renewal1. By co-opting KBTBD4, a substrate receptor of the CUL3–RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL3) complex, UM171 promotes the degradation of the LSD1–CoREST corepressor complex, thereby limiting haematopoietic stem cell attrition2,3. However, the direct target and mechanism of action of UM171 remain unclear. Here we show that UM171 acts as a molecular glue to induce high-affinity interactions between KBTBD4 and HDAC1/2 to promote corepressor degradation. Through proteomics and chemical inhibitor studies, we identify the principal target of UM171 as HDAC1/2. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of dimeric KBTBD4 bound to UM171 and the LSD1–HDAC1–CoREST complex identifies an asymmetric assembly in which a single UM171 molecule enables a pair of KELCH-repeat propeller domains to recruit the HDAC1 catalytic domain. One KBTBD4 propeller partially masks the rim of the HDAC1 active site, which is exploited by UM171 to extend the E3–neosubstrate interface. The other propeller cooperatively strengthens HDAC1 binding through a distinct interface. The overall CoREST–HDAC1/2–KBTBD4 interaction is further buttressed by the endogenous cofactor inositol hexakisphosphate, which acts as a second molecular glue. The functional relevance of the quaternary complex interaction surfaces is demonstrated by base editor scanning of KBTBD4 and HDAC1. By delineating the direct target of UM171 and its mechanism of action, we reveal how the cooperativity offered by a dimeric CRL3 E3 can be leveraged by a small molecule degrader.

 The biogenic structures produced by termites, ants and earthworms provide key functions across global ecosystems1,2. However, little is known about the drivers of the soil engineering effects caused by these small but important invertebrates3 at the global scale. Here we show, on the basis of a meta-analysis of 12,975 observations from 1,047 studies on six continents, that all three taxa increase soil macronutrient content, soil respiration and soil microbial and plant biomass compared with reference soils. The effect of termites on soil respiration and plant biomass, and the effect of earthworms on soil nitrogen and phosphorus content, increase with mean annual temperature and peak in the tropics. By contrast, the effects of ants on soil nitrogen, soil phosphorus, plant biomass and survival rate peak at mid-latitude ecosystems that have the lowest primary productivity. Notably, termites and ants increase plant growth by alleviating plant phosphorus limitation in the tropics and nitrogen limitation in temperate regions, respectively. Our study highlights the important roles of these invertebrate taxa in global biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem functions. Given the importance of these soil-engineering invertebrates, biogeochemical models should better integrate their effects, especially on carbon fluxes and nutrient cycles.

 Greenlandic Inuit and other indigenous populations are underrepresented in genetic research1,2, leading to inequity in healthcare opportunities. To address this, we performed analyses of sequenced or imputed genomes of 5,996 Greenlanders with extensive phenotypes. We quantified their historical population bottleneck and how it has shaped their genetic architecture to have fewer, but more common, variable sites. Consequently, we find twice as many high-impact genome-wide associations to metabolic traits in Greenland compared with Europe. We infer that the high-impact variants arose after the population split from Native Americans and thus are Arctic-specific, and show that some of them are common due to not only genetic drift but also selection. We also find that European-derived polygenic scores for metabolic traits are only half as accurate in Greenlanders as in Europeans, and that adding Arctic-specific variants improves the overall accuracy to the same level as in Europeans. Similarly, lack of representation in public genetic databases makes genetic clinical screening harder in Greenlandic Inuit, but inclusion of Greenlandic data remedies this by reducing the number of non-causal candidate variants by sixfold. Finally, we identify pronounced genetic fine structure that explains differences in prevalence of monogenic diseases in Greenland and, together with recent changes in mobility, leads to a predicted future reduction in risk for certain recessive diseases. These results illustrate how including data from Greenlanders can greatly reduce inequity in genomic-based healthcare.

 Peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of type 2 diabetes, which is strongly associated with obesity1, causing sensory loss and, in some patients, neuropathic pain2,3. Although the onset and progression of diabetic peripheral neuropathy is linked with dyslipidaemia and hyperglycaemia4, the contribution of inflammation to peripheral neuropathy pathogenesis has not been investigated. Here we used a high-fat, high-fructose diet (HFHFD), which induces obesity and prediabetic metabolic changes, to study the onset of peripheral neuropathy. Mice fed the HFHFD developed persistent heat hypoalgesia after 3 months, but a reduction in epidermal skin nerve fibre density manifested only at 6 months. Using single-cell sequencing, we found that CCR2+ macrophages infiltrate the sciatic nerves of HFHFD-fed mice well before axonal degeneration is detectable. These infiltrating macrophages share gene expression similarities with nerve-crush-induced macrophages5 and express neurodegeneration-associated microglial marker genes6, although there is no axon loss or demyelination. Inhibiting the macrophage recruitment by genetically or pharmacologically blocking CCR2 signalling resulted in more severe heat hypoalgesia and accelerated skin denervation, as did deletion of Lgals3, a gene expressed in recruited macrophages. Recruitment of macrophages into the peripheral nerves of obese prediabetic mice is, therefore, neuroprotective, delaying terminal sensory axon degeneration by means of galectin 3. Potentiating and sustaining early neuroprotective immune responses in patients could slow or prevent peripheral neuropathy.

The unique crystal symmetry connecting magnetic sublattices not only distinguishes altermagnetism1–6 from ferromagnetism and conventional antiferromagnetism but also enables it to combine the advantages of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism4,5. Altermagnetic order is essentially a magnetic crystal order7, determined by the magnetic-order (Néel) vector and crystal symmetry. Previous experimental studies have concentrated on manipulating the altermagnetic symmetry by tuning the Néel vector orientations8–12. However, manipulation of the crystal symmetry, which holds great promise for manipulating the altermagnetic order, remains challenging. Here we realize the manipulation of altermagnetic order in chromium antimonide (CrSb) films via crystal symmetry. The locking between the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya vector and the magnetic space symmetry helps to reconstruct the altermagnetic order, from a collinear Néel vector to a canted one. It generates a room-temperature spontaneous anomalous Hall effect in an altermagnet. The relative direction between the current-induced spin polarization and the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya vector determines the switching modes of altermagnetic order, that is, parallel for the field-assisted mode in CrSb

            . The Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya vector induces an asymmetric energy barrier in the field-assisted mode and generates an asymmetric driving force in the field-free mode. In particular, the latter is guaranteed by the emerging Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya torque in altermagnets. Reconstructing crystal symmetry adds a new twist to the manipulation of altermagnetic order. It not only underpins the magnetic-memory and nano-oscillator technology4,5 but also inspires crossover studies between altermagnetism and other research topics.

 The use of reactive supports to disperse metal species is crucial for constructing highly efficient interfacial catalysts, by tuning the competitive reactant adsorption–activation pattern in supported metal catalysts into a non-competitive mechanism1–3. However, these reactive supports are prone to deterioration during catalysis, limiting the lifespan of the catalyst and their potential practical applications4. New strategies are needed to simultaneously protect reactive supports and surface metal species without compromising the inherent catalytic performance. Here we report a new strategy to augment the structural stability of highly active interfacial catalysts by using inert nano-overlays to partially shield and partition the surface of the reactive support. Specifically, we demonstrate that atomically dispersed inert oxide nano-overlays on a highly active Pt/γ-Mo2N catalyst can block the redundant surface sites of γ-Mo2N responsible for surface oxidation of this reactive support and the resulting deactivation. This strategy yields an efficient and highly durable catalyst for hydrogen production by methanol-reforming reaction with a mere 0.26 wt% Pt loading, exhibiting a record-high turnover number, to our knowledge, of 15,300,000 and a notable apparent turnover frequency of

 Elevated or ectopic expression of neuronal receptors promotes tumour progression in many cancer types1,2; neuroendocrine (NE) transformation of adenocarcinomas has also been associated with increased aggressiveness3. Whether the defining neuronal feature, namely electrical excitability, exists in cancer cells and impacts cancer progression remains mostly unexplored. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an archetypal example of a highly aggressive NE cancer and comprises two major distinct subpopulations: NE cells and non-NE cells4,5. Here we show that NE cells, but not non-NE cells, are excitable, and their action potential firing directly promotes SCLC malignancy. However, the resultant high ATP demand leads to an unusual dependency on oxidative phosphorylation in NE cells. This finding contrasts with the properties of most cancer cells reported in the literature, which are non-excitable and rely heavily on aerobic glycolysis. Additionally, we found that non-NE cells metabolically support NE cells, a process akin to the astrocyte–neuron metabolite shuttle6. Finally, we observed drastic changes in the innervation landscape during SCLC progression, which coincided with increased intratumoural heterogeneity and elevated neuronal features in SCLC cells, suggesting an induction of a tumour-autonomous vicious cycle, driven by cancer cell-intrinsic electrical activity, which confers long-term tumorigenic capability and metastatic potential.

 Cumulative silicon photovoltaic (PV) waste highlights the importance of considering waste recycling before the commercialization of emerging PV technologies1,2. Perovskite PVs are a promising next-generation technology3, in which recycling their end-of-life waste can reduce the toxic waste and retain resources4,5. Here we report a low-cost, green-solvent-based holistic recycling strategy to restore all valuable components from perovskite PV waste. We develop an efficient aqueous-based perovskite recycling approach that can also rejuvenate degraded perovskites. We further extend the scope of recycling to charge-transport layers, substrates, cover glasses and metal electrodes. After repeated degradation–recycling processes, the recycled devices show similar efficiency and stability compared with the fresh devices. Our holistic recycling strategy reduces by 96.6% resource depletion and by 68.8% human toxicity (cancer effects) impacts associated with perovskite PVs compared with the landfill treatment. With recycling, the levelized cost of electricity also decreases for both utility-scale and residential systems. This study highlights unique opportunities of perovskite PVs for holistic recycling and paves the way for a sustainable perovskite solar economy.

 Growing evidence indicates that migratory animals exploit the magnetic field of the Earth for navigation, both as a compass to determine direction and as a map to determine geographical position1. It has long been proposed that, to navigate using a magnetic map, animals must learn the magnetic coordinates of the destination2,3, yet the pivotal hypothesis that animals can learn magnetic signatures of geographical areas has, to our knowledge, yet to be tested. Here we report that an iconic navigating species, the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta), can learn such information. When fed repeatedly in magnetic fields replicating those that exist in particular oceanic locations, juvenile turtles learned to distinguish magnetic fields in which they encountered food from magnetic fields that exist elsewhere, an ability that might underlie foraging site fidelity. Conditioned responses in this new magnetic map assay were unaffected by radiofrequency oscillating magnetic fields, a treatment expected to disrupt radical-pair-based chemical magnetoreception4–6, suggesting that the magnetic map sense of the turtle does not rely on this mechanism. By contrast, orientation behaviour that required use of the magnetic compass was disrupted by radiofrequency oscillating magnetic fields. The findings provide evidence that two different mechanisms of magnetoreception underlie the magnetic map and magnetic compass in sea turtles. Loggerhead sea turtles, which undergo long-distance migrations, can learn magnetic signatures associated with different geographic areas and have two different magnetic senses, each based on a different underlying mechanism."

 Recent advances in functional genomics and human cellular models have substantially enhanced our understanding of the structure and regulation of the human genome. However, our grasp of the molecular functions of human genes remains incomplete and biased towards specific gene classes. The Molecular Phenotypes of Null Alleles in Cells (MorPhiC) Consortium aims to address this gap by creating a comprehensive catalogue of the molecular and cellular phenotypes associated with null alleles of all human genes using in vitro multicellular systems. In this Perspective, we present the strategic vision of the MorPhiC Consortium and discuss various strategies for generating null alleles, as well as the challenges involved. We describe the cellular models and scalable phenotypic readouts that will be used in the consortium’s initial phase, focusing on 1,000 protein-coding genes. The resulting molecular and cellular data will be compiled into a catalogue of null-allele phenotypes. The methodologies developed in this phase will establish best practices for extending these approaches to all human protein-coding genes. The resources generated—including engineered cell lines, plasmids, phenotypic data, genomic information and computational tools—will be made available to the broader research community to facilitate deeper insights into human gene functions.

 The nervous and immune systems have complementary roles in the adaptation of organisms to environmental changes. However, the mechanisms that mediate cross-talk between the nervous and immune systems, called neuroimmune interactions, are poorly understood. In this Review, we summarize advances in the understanding of neuroimmune communication, with a principal focus on the central nervous system (CNS): its response to immune signals and the immunological consequences of CNS activity. We highlight these themes primarily as they relate to neurological diseases, the control of immunity, and the regulation of complex behaviours. We also consider the importance and challenges linked to the study of the neuroimmune connectome, which is defined as the totality of neuroimmune interactions in the body, because this provides a conceptual framework to identify mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic approaches. Finally, we discuss how the latest techniques can advance our understanding of the neuroimmune connectome, and highlight the outstanding questions in the field.

 Despite their high relative abundance in our Universe, neutrinos are the least understood fundamental particles of nature. In fact, the quantum properties of neutrinos emitted in experimentally relevant sources are theoretically contested1–4 and the spatial extent of the neutrino wavepacket is only loosely constrained by reactor neutrino oscillation data with a spread of 13 orders of magnitude5,6. Here we present a method to directly access this quantity by precisely measuring the energy width of the recoil daughter nucleus emitted in the radioactive decay of beryllium-7. The final state in the decay process contains a recoiling lithium-7 nucleus, which is entangled with an electron neutrino at creation. The lithium-7 energy spectrum is measured to high precision by directly embedding beryllium-7 radioisotopes into a high-resolution superconducting tunnel junction that is operated as a cryogenic sensor. Under this approach, we set a lower limit on the Heisenberg spatial uncertainty of the recoil daughter of 6.2 pm, which implies that the final-state system is localized at a scale more than a thousand times larger than the nucleus itself. From this measurement, the first, to our knowledge, direct lower limit on the spatial extent of a neutrino wavepacket is extracted. These results may have implications in several areas including the theoretical understanding of neutrino properties, the nature of localization in weak nuclear decays and the interpretation of neutrino physics data.

 Recent macroevolutionary studies predict a diversification of early birds during the Jurassic period1–4, but the unquestionable Jurassic bird fossil record is limited to Archaeopteryx1,5,6, which has also been referred to deinonychosaurian dinosaurs by some analyses7,8. Although they have feathered wings, the known Jurassic birds are more similar to non-avialan theropods in having the ancestral long reptilian tail9–11. This is in stark contrast to most Cretaceous and crownward taxa, which have a short tail that terminates in a compound bone called the pygostyle12–14. Here we report on the oldest short-tailed avialan, Baminornis zhenghensis gen. et sp. nov., from the recently discovered Late Jurassic Zhenghe Fauna15, which fills a noticeable spatio-temporal gap in the earliest branching avialan fossil record. B. zhenghensis exhibits a unique combination of derived ornithothoracine-like pectoral and pelvic girdles and plesiomorphic non-avialan maniraptoran hand, demonstrating mosaic evolution along stem avialan line. An avialan furcula collected from the same locality is referrable to ornithuromorphs on the basis of our morphometric and phylogenetic analyses. These newly discovered fossils demonstrate the early appearance of highly derived bird features, and together with an anchiornithine fossil from the same locality, they suggest an earlier origin of birds and a radiation of early birds in the Jurassic.

 Zinc is emerging as a key material for next-generation biodegradable implants1–5. However, its inherent softness limits its use in load-bearing orthopaedic implants. Although reducing the grain size of zinc can make it stronger, it also destabilizes its mechanical properties and thus makes it less durable at body temperature6. Here we show that extruded Zn alloys of dilute compositions can achieve ultrahigh strength and excellent durability when their micron-scale grain size is increased while maintaining a basal texture. In this inverse Hall–Petch effect, the dominant deformation mode changes from inter-granular grain boundary sliding and dynamic recrystallization at the original grain size to intra-granular pyramidal slip and unusual twinning at the increased grain size. The role of the anomalous twins, termed ‘accommodation twins’ in this work, is to accommodate the altered grain shape in the plane lying perpendicular to the external loading direction, in contrast to the well-known ‘mechanical twins’ whose role is to deliver plasticity along the external loading direction7,8. The strength level achieved in these dilute zinc alloys is nearly double those of biodegradable implants made of magnesium alloys—making them the strongest and most stable biodegradable alloys available, to our knowledge, for fabricating bone fixation implants.

 Cancer mutations can create neomorphic protein–protein interactions to drive aberrant function1,2. As a substrate receptor of the CULLIN3-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, KBTBD4 is recurrently mutated in medulloblastoma3, the most common embryonal brain tumour in children4. These mutations impart gain-of-function to KBTBD4 to induce aberrant degradation of the transcriptional corepressor CoREST5. However, their mechanism remains unresolved. Here we establish that KBTBD4 mutations promote CoREST degradation through engaging HDAC1/2 as the direct target of the mutant substrate receptor. Using deep mutational scanning, we chart the mutational landscape of the KBTBD4 cancer hotspot, revealing distinct preferences by which insertions and substitutions can promote gain-of-function and the critical residues involved in the hotspot interaction. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of two distinct KBTBD4 cancer mutants bound to LSD1–HDAC1–CoREST reveals that a KBTBD4 homodimer asymmetrically engages HDAC1 with two KELCH-repeat β-propeller domains. The interface between HDAC1 and one of the KBTBD4 β-propellers is stabilized by the medulloblastoma mutations, which insert a bulky side chain into the HDAC1 active site pocket. Our structural and mutational analyses inform how this hotspot E3–neosubstrate interface can be chemically modulated. First, we unveil a converging shape-complementarity-based mechanism between gain-of-function E3 mutations and a molecular glue degrader, UM171. Second, we demonstrate that HDAC1/2 inhibitors can block the mutant KBTBD4–HDAC1 interface and proliferation of KBTBD4-mutant medulloblastoma cells. Altogether, our work reveals the structural and mechanistic basis of cancer mutation-driven neomorphic protein–protein interactions. We show that gain-of-function cancer mutations in the KBTBD4 E3 ligase promote neodegradation of substrates via a shape-complementarity-based mechanism, which converges with the mechanism of action of the UM171 molecular glue degrader and can be blocked by HDAC1/2 inhibitors."

 Galaxy clusters contain vast amounts of hot ionized gas known as the intracluster medium (ICM). In relaxed cluster cores, the radiative cooling time of the ICM is shorter than the age of the cluster. However, the absence of line emission associated with cooling suggests heating mechanisms that offset the cooling, with feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) being the most likely source1,2. Turbulence and bulk motions, such as the oscillating (‘sloshing’) motion of the core gas in the cluster potential well, have also been proposed as mechanisms for heat distribution from the outside of the core3,4. Here we present X-ray spectroscopic observations of the Centaurus galaxy cluster with the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission satellite. We find that the hot gas flows along the line of sight relative to the central galaxy, with velocities from 130 km s−1 to 310 km s−1 within about 30 kpc of the centre. This indicates bulk flow consistent with core gas sloshing. Although the bulk flow may prevent excessive accumulation of cooled gas at the centre, it could distribute the heat injected by the AGN and bring in thermal energy from the surrounding ICM. The velocity dispersion of the gas is found to be only ≲120 km s−1 in the core, even within about 10 kpc of the AGN. This suggests that the influence of the AGN on the surrounding ICM motion is limited in the cluster. X-ray spectroscopic observations of the Centaurus galaxy cluster with the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission satellite show that the hot gas flows along the line of sight relative to the central galaxy."

 Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors play crucial roles in plant immunity by sensing pathogen effectors1. In Arabidopsis, certain sensor NLRs function as NADases to catalyse the production of second messengers2,3, which can be recognized by enhanced disease susceptibility 1 (EDS1) with its partner senescence-associated gene 101 (SAG101), to activate helper NLR N requirement gene 1 (NRG1)4. A cryoelectron microscopy structure shows that second-messenger-activated EDS1–SAG101 mainly contacts the leucine-rich repeat domain of NRG1A to mediate the formation of an induced EDS1–SAG101–NRG1A complex. Structural comparisons show that binding of a second messenger induces conformational changes in EDS1–SAG101, which are recognized by NRG1A, leading to its allosteric activation. We further show that an inhibitory NRG1 family member, NRG1C, efficiently outcompetes NRG1A for binding to second-messenger-activated EDS1–SAG101. These findings uncover mechanisms for NRG1A activation through its recognition of a modified host EDS1–SAG101 complex, and NRG1A inhibition by NRG1C through sequestration of the activated EDS1–SAG101, thus shedding light on the activation and constraint of a central plant immune response system.

Russo,A crucial role for the cortical amygdala in shaping social encounters,"The posterolateral cortical amygdala and other connected brain regions have a key role in mediating the transition from investigative to aggressive behaviour in male mice. 
 Aggression is an evolutionarily conserved behaviour that controls social hierarchies and protects valuable resources. In mice, aggressive behaviour can be broken down into an appetitive phase, which involves approach and investigation, and a consummatory phase, which involves biting, kicking and wrestling1. Here, by performing an unsupervised weighted correlation network analysis on whole-brain FOS expression in mice, we identify a cluster of brain regions, including hypothalamic and amygdalar subregions and olfactory cortical regions, that are highly co-activated in male but not in female aggressors. The posterolateral cortical amygdala (COApl)—an extended olfactory structure—was found to be a hub region, on the basis of the number and strength of correlations with other regions in the cluster. Our data also show that oestrogen receptor 1 (Esr1)-expressing cells in the COApl (COAplEsr1) exhibit increased activity during attack behaviour and during bouts of investigation that precede an attack, in male mice only. Chemogenetic or optogenetic inhibition of COAplEsr1 cells in male aggressors reduces aggression and increases pro-social investigation without affecting social reward and reinforcement behaviour. We further show that COAplEsr1 projections to the ventromedial hypothalamus and central amygdala are necessary for these behaviours. Collectively, these data suggest that, in aggressive males, COAplEsr1 cells respond specifically to social stimuli, thereby enhancing their salience and promoting attack behaviour. The posterolateral cortical amygdala and other connected brain regions have a key role in mediating the transition from investigative to aggressive behaviour in male mice."

 Plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors sense pathogen effectors and form resistosomes to confer immunity1. Some sensor NLR resistosomes produce small molecules to induce formation of a heterotrimer complex with two lipase-like proteins, EDS1 and SAG101, and a helper NLR called NRG1 (refs. 2,3). Activation of sensor NLR resistosomes also triggers NRG1 oligomerization and resistosome formation at the plasma membrane4,5. We demonstrate that the Arabidopsis AtEDS1–AtSAG101–AtNRG1A heterotrimer formation is stabilized by the AtNRG1A loss-of-oligomerization mutant L134E5,6. We report structures of AtEDS1–AtSAG101–AtNRG1A L134E and AtEDS1–AtSAG101–AtNRG1C heterotrimers with similar assembly mechanisms. AtNRG1A signalling is activated by the interaction with the AtEDS1–AtSAG101 heterodimer in complex with their small-molecule ligand. The truncated AtNRG1C maintains core interacting domains of AtNRG1A but develops further interactions with AtEDS1–AtSAG101 to outcompete AtNRG1A. Moreover, AtNRG1C lacks an N-terminal signalling domain and shows nucleocytoplasmic localization, facilitating its sequestration of AtEDS1–AtSAG101, which is also nucleocytoplasmic. Our study shows the activation and inhibition mechanisms of a plant helper NLR. In plant immunity, sensor NLR resistosomes can generate heterotrimer complexes comprising the helper NLR NRG1, and investigation of cryo-EM structures shows the mechanisms of these heterotrimers in immune activation and suppression."

 Educational disparities remain a key contributor to increasing social and wealth inequalities. To address this, researchers and policymakers have focused on average differences between racial groups or differences among students who are falling behind1. This focus potentially leads to educational triage, diverting resources away from high-achieving students, including those from racial minorities2,3. Here we focus on the ‘racial excellence gap’—the difference in the likelihood that students from racial minorities (Black and Hispanic) reach the highest levels of academic achievement compared with their non-minority (white and Asian) peers. There is a shortage of evidence that systematically measures the magnitude of the excellence gap and how it evolves4,5. Using longitudinal, statewide, administrative data, we document eight facts regarding the excellence gap from third grade (typically ages 8–9) to high school (typically ages 14–18), link the stability of excellence gaps and student backgrounds, and assess the efficacy of public policies. We show that excellence gaps in maths and reading are evident by the third grade and grow slightly over time, especially for female students. About one third of the gap is explained by a student’s socioeconomic status, and about one tenth is explained by the school environment. Top-achieving racial minority students are also less likely to persist in excellence as they progress through school. Moreover, state accountability policies that direct additional resources to reduce non-race-based inequality6 had minimal effects on the racial excellence gaps. Documenting these patterns is an important step towards eliminating excellence gaps and removing the ‘racial glass ceiling’. Data from Michigan, USA, systematically document that comparatively fewer students from racial minorities excel in maths and reading, and that this gap grows as students progress through school."

 Lithium (Li) ions are central to the energy storing functionality of rechargeable batteries1. Present technology relies on sophisticated Li-inclusive electrode materials to provide Li ions and exactingly protect them to ensure a decent lifetime2. Li-deficient materials are thus excluded from battery design, and the battery fails when active Li ions are consumed3. Our study breaks this limit by means of a cell-level Li supply strategy. This involves externally adding an organic Li salt into an assembled cell, which decomposes during cell formation, liberating Li ions and expelling organic ligands as gases. This non-invasive and rapid process preserves cell integrity without necessitating disassembly. We leveraged machine learning to discover such functional salts and identified lithium trifluoromethanesulfinate (LiSO2CF3) with optimal electrochemical activity, potential, product formation, electrolyte solubility and specific capacity. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrated a 3.0 V, 1,192 Wh kg−1 Li-free cathode, chromium oxide, in the anode-less cell, as well as an organic sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode incorporated in a 388 Wh kg−1 pouch cell with a 440-cycle life. These systems exhibit improved energy density, enhanced sustainability and reduced cost compared with conventional Li-ion batteries. Furthermore, the lifetime of commercial LiFePO4 batteries was extended by at least an order of magnitude. With repeated external Li supplies, a commercial graphite|LiFePO4 cell displayed a capacity retention of 96.0% after 11,818 cycles. A strategy is reported that improves the performance and lifetime of lithium-ion batteries by adding organic Li salt after assembly, which decomposes during cell formation, liberating Li ions and expelling organic ligands as gases."

 Globalization increasingly allows countries to externalize the environmental costs of land use, including biodiversity loss1. So far, we have a very incomplete understanding of how countries cause biodiversity loss outside their own borders through their demand for agricultural and forestry products grown in other countries2. Here we quantify the global range losses to forest vertebrates from 2001 to 2015 caused by deforestation attributable to 24 developed countries by means of their consumption of products obtained through global supply chains. We show that these driver countries are responsible for much greater cumulative range loss to species outside their own borders than within them. These international impacts were concentrated geographically, allowing us to map global hotspots of outsourced losses of biodiversity. Countries had the greatest external impacts on species occurring in nearby regions. However, in a few cases, developed countries also inflicted disproportionate harm on vertebrates in distant countries. An analysis of global deforestation linked to consumption of products in the supply chains of large economies finds greater losses for vertebrate species’ ranges outside these countries than in them."

Here, the authors show that negative media portrayals of being alone may inadvertently make matters worse by shaping people’s beliefs, which in turn exacerbate loneliness. 
 Loneliness is a widespread issue routinely targeted by the media and public health campaigns. We propose that these efforts, though well-intentioned, may exacerbate this problem by negatively influencing a potential driver of loneliness: people’s beliefs about being alone. Supporting this thesis, we show that contemporary U.S. news articles are 10 times more likely to describe being alone as harmful than beneficial (Study 1, N = 144 articles) and that exposure to such articles causally impacts people’s beliefs about being alone (Study 2, N = 456). Further, a 2-week experience-sampling study (Study 3, N = 161) demonstrates that people with negative beliefs about being alone experience a steep increase in loneliness after spending time alone in daily life, whereas those with positive beliefs feel less lonely after spending time alone. Finally, multi-national studies demonstrate the generalizability of these results across nine countries spanning six continents (Studies 4 and 5, N = 2930). Together, these findings reveal the critical role of beliefs about being alone in shaping loneliness. Loneliness is a widespread problem that the media and public health campaigns frequently address.

 Prime editing systems (PEs) hold great promise in modern biotechnology. However, their editing range is limited as PEs can only modify the downstream sequences of the pegRNA nick. Here, we report the development of the extended prime editor system (EXPERT) to overcome this limitation by using an extended pegRNA (ext-pegRNA) with modified 3’ extension, and an additional sgRNA (ups-sgRNA) targeting the upstream region of the ext-pegRNA. We demonstrate that EXPERT can efficiently perform editing on both sides of the ext-pegRNA nick, a task that is unattainable by canonical PEs. EXPERT exhibits prominent capacity in replacing sequences up to 88 base pairs and inserting sequences up to 100 base pairs within the upstream region of the ext-pegRNA nick. Compared to canonical PEs such as PE2, the utilization of the EXPERT strategy significantly enhances the editing efficiency for large fragment edits with an average improvement of 3.12-fold, up to 122.1 times higher. Safety wise, the use of ups-sgRNA does not increase the rates of undesirable insertions and deletions (indels), as the two nicks are on the same strand. Moreover, we do not observe increased off-target editing rates genome-wide. Our work introduces EXPERT as a PE tool with significant potential in life sciences.

Here, Khadka et al. show that a long-assumed sensor in the complex is dispensable for sensing, while a protein formerly considered a mere messenger is crucial. 
 Bacillus subtilis uses cytoplasmic complexes called stressosomes to initiate the σB-mediated general stress response to environmental stress. Each stressosome comprises two types of proteins — RsbS and four paralogous RsbR proteins — that are thought to sequester the RsbT protein until stress causes RsbT release and subsequent σB activation. RsbR proteins have been assumed to sense stress, but evidence for their sensing function has been elusive, and the identity of the true sensor has remained unknown. Here, we conduct an alanine-scanning analysis of the putative sensing domain of one of the RsbR paralogs, RsbRA. We find that single substitutions impact but do not abolish the σB response, suggesting that RsbRA has a key role in σB response dynamics and is “tunable” and robust to substitution, but not directly supporting a sensing function. Surprisingly, deletion of the stressosome does not abolish environmental stress-inducible σB activity and instead leads to a stronger and longer-lived response than in strains with stressosomes. Finally, we show that RsbT is necessary for the stressosome-independent response and that its kinase activity is also important. RsbT thus has a previously unappreciated role in initiating stress responses and may itself be a stress sensor in the general stress response. Some bacteria use a large protein complex, the stressosome, to sense and respond to environmental stress.

 Studying how single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) crosstalk with non-autologous factors to cause complex autoimmune diseases is challenging. An amino acid replacement in the neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 (NCF1-339/NCF1R90H) leading to lower reactive oxygen species induction has been reported as the major SNP for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Here we show that infection with the murine norovirus (MNV) contributes to the induction of lupus in Ncf190H mice. Mutant NCF190H upregulates the IFN-α/JAK1/STAT1 pathway in macrophages and anti-MNV-antibody production. In parallel, the MNV infection of NCF190H mice upregulates Toll-like receptor 7 in macrophages, plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B220+ splenocytes, thereby promoting germinal center formation and lupus-associated autoantibodies production. These compounded effects lead to protection against MNV infection but also glomeruloneph	ritis with proteinuria and lupus arthritis in the absence of chemical inducers such as pristane. Our data thus suggest that this SLE-associated SNP, NCF190H, synergizes with MNV infection to induce the development of mouse lupus.

 The diurnal temperature range (DTR), the difference between daily maximum and minimum temperature, is important for the impact of extreme temperatures, but despite physical links to aerosol forcing previous studies have struggled to attribute observed DTR changes to aerosols. Using causal inference, we can clearly identify aerosols as a driver of European DTR change since 1940. Following a decrease from the 1940s, since the 1980s the European DTR has increased by about 0.5K due to a reduction in European aerosol emissions leading to cooler nights relative to days. Agreement between causal effects estimated from observations with those estimated for two CMIP6 models evaluates the models’ microphysical and radiative parameterizations. From causal effects, we also derive effective radiative forcing estimates of aerosols on surface shortwave during European summer, which amount to [−1.7; −1.5] Wm−2 in observations and one model, while it is less negative in the other model ([−0.9; −0.8] Wm−2)."

Here, we uncover bivariate emergent constraint relationships between projected global ET trends (2015–2100) and historical vapour pressure deficit (VPD) trends (1980–2014) under the low emission scenario of SSP126 when water supply is sufficient, and with historical precipitation trends under the high emission scenarios of SSP370 and SSP585 when water availability is limited, across 28 CMIP6 models. Combining multiple observational datasets into a Hierarchical Emergent Constraint framework, we find the raw CMIP6 models overestimate future annual ET growth rates.

 As air traffic rebounds from its large drop during the Covid-19 crisis, civil aviation needs to continue addressing its climate impact. Knowledge of aircraft trajectories is essential for an accurate assessment of the CO2 (and non-CO2) climate impact of aviation. Here we combine an aircraft trajectory optimization algorithm and a global database of aircraft movements to quantify the impact of airspace restrictions due to conflict zones on CO2 emissions. Among current restrictions, we show that the Russian ban of its airspace to Western airlines following the invasion of Ukraine has the largest impact. Our analysis reveals an initial reduction of flights to and from East Asia that would have crossed the Russian territory. Routes then gradually reopened by making a detour, which led to an average increase in fuel consumption of 13% on the affected routes, with a greater impact for flights to and from Europe (14.8%) compared to flights to and from North America (9.8%). Although these flights represent only a small fraction of the daily flights, the large detours have increased global aviation CO2 emissions by 1% in 2023, equivalent to a quarter of the yet-to-be-achieved efficiency gain potential from improved air traffic management.

Here, we analysed the stable isotopes of fluid inclusions in a stalagmite to investigate hydroclimate responses to the forcings in the Northwest Pacific region. Our stalagmite data, covering the active volcanism period in the mid-Holocene, showed that the start of large volcanic eruption clusters tends to coincide with an onset or an ongoing cooling phase. The impact of one of the largest volcanic eruptions during the Holocene, likely at Kikai caldera, is recorded as an amplified multi-decadal scale variation, including a noticeable cold-wet climate anomaly. Excluding this anomalous period, the solar forcing record negatively correlated with stalagmite-derived precipitation but not with stalagmite-derived temperature.

The elongated earthquake ruptures in flat slabs with few aftershocks and the narrow, sparse seismicity bands are attributed to flexure from along-dip slab steepening and limited dehydration reactions within relatively dry flat-slab segments.

 While severe hurricanes continue to challenge the resilience of local communities, fine-scale knowledge of post-hurricane recovery remains scarce. Existing recovery tracking approaches mainly rely on aggregated metrics that would disguise the spatial heterogeneity in recovery patterns. Here, we present a spatiotemporally explicit investigation into the recovery of human activity after 10 recent severe hurricanes in the U.S., with daily nighttime light (NTL) time series images from NASA's Black Marble VIIRS NTL product suite. We utilized a Bayesian-based time series change detection model and temporal clustering algorithm to analyze the post-hurricane recovery of each built-up area pixel within 446 counties severely affected by the hurricanes. To investigate the potential inaccuracies stemming from assessments using aggregated statistics, we further compared the recovery pattern estimated at pixel scale with that estimated by aggregated NTL radiance at county and census tract scales. Last, we examined the inequality in post-hurricane recovery and how it related to socioeconomic factors and current hurricane assistance programs. Our analysis shows a 7-fold difference in the recovery duration of hurricane-affected built-up areas within a county, with one-third of the areas experiencing a prolonged recovery lasting over 200 days. We emphasize the necessity of fine-scale knowledge in recovery assessments as aggregated statistics tend to largely underestimate the severity of hurricane impact and spatial heterogeneity of recovery. More importantly, we identify a prevailing recovery inequality across minority and disadvantaged populations, as well as a continued disproportionate allocation of hurricane assistance served as a key driver of exacerbating recovery inequality. Our study offers nuanced insights into the spatial heterogeneity of post-hurricane recovery that can inform strategic and equitable recovery efforts, as well as more effective hurricane relief programs and protocols."
10.1016/j.rse.2025.114619,True,Remote Sensing of Environment,该论文提出了一种新的混合算法（AIRTrans），用于从多光谱卫星观测数据中同时反演气溶胶光学厚度（AOT）和细模态比例（FMF）。该算法结合了辐射传输（RT）和迁移学习（TL）方法，利用Himawari-8/AHI卫星数据进行验证。结果表明，AIRTrans算法在AOT和FMF的反演精度上优于官方AHI产品，尤其是在细模态比例的估计方面有显著改善。该算法在沙尘暴和雾霾等气溶胶污染事件中的表现也证明了其捕捉AOT和FMF时空变化的能力。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析密切相关。,"['aerosol optical thickness', 'fine-mode fraction', 'multispectral satellite observation', 'radiative transfer', 'transfer learning', 'Himawari-8/AHI', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'aerosol retrieval']",Chenqian Tang;Chong Shi;Husi Letu;Shuai Yin;Teruyuki Nakajima;Miho Sekiguchi;Jian Xu;Mengjie Zhao;Run Ma;Wenwu Wang,Development of a hybrid algorithm for the simultaneous retrieval of aerosol optical thickness and fine-mode fraction from multispectral satellite observation combining radiative transfer and transfer learning approaches,"•Novel hybrid algorithm combining radiative transfer and transfer learning for aerosol retrieval. •Improved simultaneous retrieval accuracy for AOT and FMF from Himawari-8/AHI. •Dynamic aerosol model configuration covering multiple aerosol types. •Captures aerosol spatial and temporal variations in haze and dust events. 
 The aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and fine-mode fraction (FMF) are crucial to understanding the radiative and environmental effects of aerosols. However, accurately retrieving these properties simultaneously from monodirectional multispectral satellite data remains challenging. Inversion algorithms based on lookup tables typically leverage information from only two or three channels, resulting in limited retrieval parameters. Although optimal estimation methods can enhance the utilization of multispectral information, they are mostly constrained by fixed aerosol types and have higher computational overhead due to the multiple iterations. To achieve real-time, high-precision, and simultaneous retrieval of the AOT and FMF for geostationary satellites with high-frequency observation, we propose a novel hybrid algorithm, AIRTrans, for the Himawari-8/AHI by integrating radiative transfer (RT) and transfer learning (TL) approaches. Specifically, RT is used to construct a simulation dataset that covers multiple aerosol types and surface conditions corresponding to the simulated multispectral observation, which pre-trains an artificial neural network model. The TL strategy is then employed to fine-tune this model using in situ data, enhancing its representativeness in real scenarios. AIRTrans performs direct retrieval using satellite observations and surface reflectance constructed via the second minimum reflectance method but considering background AOT. Results indicate that the AIRTrans-retrieved AOT and FMF are generally more consistent with ground-based observations from AERONET than official AHI products, through three years of independent validation across the full-disk region. Specifically, AIRTrans achieves retrieval with RMSEs of 0.132 and 0.146 for AOT and FMF, respectively, compared to 0.216 and 0.284 for AHI products. AIRTrans shows a remarkable improvement on FMF, particularly in addressing the significant underestimation of the AHI products at over 90 % of individual sites. The performance of AIRTrans during two severe aerosol pollution events (intense dust storms and haze) further demonstrates its robust ability to capture spatiotemporal variations of AOT and FMF simultaneously."

 Mapping tree crops is essential for resource management and supporting local livelihoods and ecosystem services. However, tree crops are often overlooked or misclassified in regional and global cropland maps. Employing multi-sensor imagery presents new opportunities for mapping tree crops by providing additional observations and distinct characteristics. Nevertheless, challenges regarding the scarcity of ground references and the lack of robust approaches to integrating multi-sensor imagery pose obstacles to the production of reliable tree crop maps. Herein, we evaluate the integration of the Global Ecosystem Dynamic Investigation (GEDI) LiDAR with Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 to facilitate tree crops mapping in the eastern Mediterranean region (including Syria, part of Turkey, and Jordan) and southern France. First, we systematically filtered the GEDI relative heights (RH) metrics and above-ground biomass density (AGBD) using ancillary data (e.g., cloud, topography, land cover) and applied spatial constraints to combine the high-quality GEDI shots with Sentinel-2 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and Sentinel-1 VV and VH backscatter. Second, we used Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (TW-DTW) and random forest (RF) models to test the classification performance using different combinations of input features at the GEDI footprint level. Finally, we used GEDI footprint level classification as training samples to train RF classifiers to generate wall-to-wall tree crops maps using a combined Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 imagery composite. We found that, at the GEDI footprint level, using GEDI variables only, we achieved an F1 score of 73–78 % for tree crops, approximately 4–10 % higher compared to that using Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 imagery for classification. However, by combining GEDI with Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 imagery, we achieved the highest accuracy (F1 score: 73–86 %) at the GEDI footprint level classification. The mapping accuracy of our wall-to-wall map varied across different agroclimatic zones with higher accuracy in dryer regions reaching up to 91 % and lowest at 69 %. Our finding demonstrates the value of using structural information from the GEDI data to map tree crops across different agroclimatic zones. Our study emphasizes the importance of tree crops in regional maps and offers insights to support the efforts to integrate data from multiple remote sensing platforms."

 Soil surface evaporation (E) is an important component of evapotranspiration from barren or sparsely vegetated (BSV) areas, and accurately estimating E in areas with limited water resources remains challenging due to the complexity of influencing factors. In this study, a large number of global ground-based measurements from bare soil conditions were collected, and a transformer-based model based on transformer architecture was developed to estimate E. The estimated instantaneous E achieved an R value of 0.73–0.96 and an RMSE of 0.03–0.05 mm/h, outperforming the process-based model, in which the surface evaporation resistance is considered as a function of soil moisture in exponential form or power form. The RMSE value of estimated E was low when the soil was relatively dry, indicating that the model is suited for water-limited regions. Furthermore, the transformer-based model was applied to BSV regions in Northwestern China, producing spatial patterns that were not only reasonable but also more detailed and consistent with river distributions. Compared to the other two products (GLEAM and BESS), the spatial annual mean E from our model and BESS were similar, while GLEAM's result was significantly lower, particularly in summer. Our findings suggest that applying deep learning to E simulation can greatly improve the accuracy and help overcome current challenges related to unclear mechanisms and the lack of universal modeling approaches."

 Under global warming, the occurrence of compound extreme weather and climate events has increased, resulting in profound ecological and societal damages. Understanding the forming mechanisms of these events is imperative for formulating effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. This research focuses on causality of the compound extreme heat and precipitation events (CEHPEs) in northeastern China. From 1961 to 2018, a total of 55 heatwave events occurred in this region, with 18 identified as the CEHPEs.The formation of CEHPEs in northeastern China is closely related to the southeastward propagating quasi-barotropic anomalous anticyclone. As the center of the anomalous anticyclone approaches northeastern China, the associated descent reduces the cloud cover and increases downward shortwave radiation. The thus-heated ground increases the upward longwave radiation and sensible heat, predominantly warming the surface air and causing the heatwave. During the development of the heatwave, the increased lower-level moisture due to the enhanced surface evaporation and the increased column moist static energy due to the warming air temperature destabilize the atmosphere. When the anomalous anticyclone moves out of northeastern China after the heatwave, intense convection rapidly develops, resulting in extreme precipitation and completing the CEHPEs.Comparison between the CEHPEs and the mere heatwave events is also conducted. The major difference resides in the zonal scale of the anomalous anticyclone. In the CEHPEs, the anomalous anticyclone has a small zonal scale and decays locally due to the advection by the climatological westerly acting on the zonal gradient of anomalous vorticity. In contrast, the zonal scale of the anomalous anticyclone in the mere heatwave events is much larger, which slowers the decaying due to the weaker zonal advection and thus impedes the convection development and extreme precipitation."

 Global climate models (GCMs) have significantly advanced in simulating mean cloud properties, yet challenges persist in accurately capturing cloud diurnal variations (CDVs), especially over land. This study explores the underlying causes of CDV biases by leveraging the Taiwan Earth System Model version 1 (TaiESM1), satellite observations, and reanalysis data. An assessment of CMIP6 models, including TaiESM1, indicates that these models perform well in simulating high and middle clouds over land and ocean. However, low clouds exhibit the weakest correlation, highlighting ongoing difficulties in their representation. Our analysis shows that TaiESM1 underestimates the diurnal amplitude of cloud fraction over land and predicts peak cloud coverage earlier than observed. While the simulated convective cloud fractions from shallow and deep convection schemes align well with observations, the stratiform cloud fractions produced by macrophysical schemes show a phase misalignment with observed CDVs. Moreover, the diurnal variations of stratiform clouds and their associated moisture tendencies deviate notably from observations, revealing limitations in the current parameterizations for stratiform clouds.We recommend enhancing the macrophysical and microphysical parameterization schemes to address these biases. Specifically, integrating stratiform cloud macrophysics, microphysics, and turbulent boundary layer processes within GCMs, such as incorporating the Cloud Layers Unified By Binormals framework, might improve the simulation of diurnal variations in cloud fraction over land. Moreover, shifting from bulk moisture budget approaches to models emphasizing variations in convective detrainment and subgrid vertical velocities associated with turbulent mixing will enhance the realism of stratiform cloud simulations. Implementing these adjustments is anticipated to improve the accuracy of CDV simulations in TaiESM1 and other GCMs, leading to better climate simulations."

 Atmospheric reactive nitrogen (Nr) deposition plays a crucial role in linking air pollution to ecosystem risks. As the primary source region of air pollutants in southwestern China, the Sichuan Basin (SCB) consistently experiences high Nr deposition, while the impact of its complex terrain on Nr deposition remains unclear. This study applied a basin-filling experiment in WRF-CMAQ modeling to investigate the effect of special topography on Nr deposition and exceedance of critical loads in SCB. We find that the basin terrain enhanced Nr deposition in SCB, particularly for oxidized nitrogen (OXN), with its annual dry and wet deposition elevated by 28 % and 25 %, respectively. These topography-induced changes in Nr deposition further deteriorated the ecosystem. The basin topography increased the Nr exceedance of critical load from 0.14 to 0.65 keq ha−1 yr−1. The southwest-to-northeast gradient of Nr deposition in SCB was primarily influenced by topography-induced changes in planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) and accumulated precipitation (PREP). The vertical circulation structure in the lower troposphere and weak winds inhibited the outflow of Nr pollutants, while the leeward eddy from the surface to around 3 km due to the Tibetan Plateau blocking effect promoted the accumulation of near-surface pollutants on the western side. Additionally, the western updrafts transported sufficient moisture to higher, cooler layers, enhancing convective activities and precipitation, and thereby wet deposition. These findings improve the scientific understanding on how topography modulates regional Nr deposition and provide insights for Nr pollution control strategies for areas with complex terrain and abundant air pollutant emissions."

Here, we investigate changes in permafrost under net-zero and negative emissions, based on idealized emission-driven simulations using a state-of-the-art Earth system model. While acting as a net ecosystem carbon sink during most of the positive emission phase, permafrost becomes a net ecosystem carbon source just before reaching net-zero and negative emissions. Permafrost slowly recovers, especially in regions with high organic carbon content, and net ecosystem carbon loss persists until the end of simulations, resulting in a cumulative net ecosystem carbon loss of approximately 14 petagrams of carbon (PgC) in both scenarios. In addition, methane emissions increase under net-zero and negative emissions, due to the irreversibility of the inundated areas. We conclude that the permafrost ecosystem carbon loss may continue under net-zero and negative emissions, which could hinder climate change mitigation efforts."

We show that inArabidopsis mur1mutant, CWI defects from compromising dimerization of RG-II pectin, a key component of cell wall, attenuate the expression of auxin response factorsARF7-ARF19. As a result, polar auxin transport components are misexpressed, disrupting auxin response asymmetry, leading to defective apical hook development. Accordingly,mur1hook defects are suppressed by enhancingARF7expression. In addition, expression of brassinosteroid biosynthesis genes is down-regulated inmur1mutant, and supplementing brassinosteroid or enhancing brassinosteroid signaling suppressesmur1hook defects. Intriguingly, brassinosteroid enhances RG-II dimerization, showing hormonal feedback to the cell wall. Our results thus reveal a previously unrecognized link between cell wall defects from reduced RG-II dimerization and growth regulation mediated via modulation of auxin-brassinosteroid pathways in early seedling development."

Retromer (VPS26/VPS35/VPS29) binds multiple sorting nexin (SNX) proteins on endosomal membranes, but assembly mechanisms of metazoan SNX/Retromer complexes remain elusive. We combine biochemical and biophysical approaches with AlphaFold modeling to identify a previously unidentified direct interaction between SNX27 and VARP. A full biochemical reconstitution system using purified proteins systematically tests how and when coats are recruited to membranes to generate tubules. We demonstrate and measure how specific combinations of Retromer with SNX27, ESCPE-1 (SNX2/SNX6), or both complexes, remodel membranes containing physiological cargo and phospholipids. SNX27, alone and with Retromer, remodels membranes with PI(3)P and PDZbm cargo. ESCPE-1 deforms membranes with bis-phosphoinositides and CI-MPR cargo but surprisingly does not recruit Retromer. VARP co-immunoprecipitates all coat components in cells and is required to reconstitute a proposed endosomal “supercomplex” (SNX27, ESCPE-1, and Retromer) in vitro. These data suggest VARP regulates metazoan endosomal coat assembly to promote cargo sorting out of endosomes."

Despite excessive accumulation of α-syn being key to the pathogenesis of PD, the mechanisms governing its clearance remain elusive. In this study, we found that the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) system plays a crucial role in capturing and facilitating the degradation of ubiquitinated α-syn. The E3 ubiquitin ligase Listerin was found to promote K27-linked polyubiquitination of α-syn, directing it to the endosome for subsequent degradation. We showed that the deletion of the Listerin gene exacerbates the neurodegenerative progression in a mouse model of PD, whereas the overexpression of Listerin effectively mitigates disease progression in PD mice. Consequently, our study reveals a mechanism for α-syn degradation and identifies Listerin as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of PD."

We show that serum antibody neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron descendants was largely absent post-doses 1 and 2 in individuals with vasculitis treated with rituximab. Detectable and increasing neutralizing titers were observed post-doses 3 and 4, except for XBB. Rituximab in vasculitis exacerbates neutralization deficits over standard immunosuppressive therapy, although impairment resolves over time since dosing. We observed discordance between detectable IgG binding and neutralizing activity specifically in the context of rituximab use, with high proportions of individuals showing reasonable IgG titer but no neutralization. ADCC response was more frequently detectable compared to neutralization in the context of rituximab, indicating that a notable proportion of binding antibodies are non-neutralizing. Therefore, use of rituximab is associated with severe impairment in neutralization against Omicron descendants despite repeated vaccinations, with better preservation of non-neutralizing antibody activity."

Understanding and controlling this phenomenon at the atomic scale, in particular in nanoscale systems, is crucial. In this study, we used scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) combined with a nickelocene molecule to sense the spin of a hydrogen-loaded nanoscale Co island grown on Cu(111). Magnetic exchange maps obtained from the molecular tip revealed the presence of a hydrogen superstructure and a 90° rotation of the magnetization compared to the pristine island. Ab initio calculations corroborate these observations, indicating that hydrogen hybridization with Co atoms on the island surface drives the spin reorientation of the island. This reorientation is further reinforced by hydrogen penetration into the island that locates at the Co/Cu interface. However, the subsurface sensitivity of the magnetic exchange maps indicates that this effect is limited.

Yet, the consequences of such repeated evolutionary experiments remain obscure, especially regarding fundamental regulatory behaviors like circadian rhythms. We studied circadian clocks of blind cave spiders and their sighted relatives. In the field, cave spiders exhibit lowperexpression and maintain constant activity levels. Curiously, their clocks are not permanently lost; exposure to monochromatic blue light restores both circadian gene expression and behavioral rhythms. Conversely, blocking blue light in sighted relatives induces an arrhythmic “cave phenotype.” Our RNA interference experiments suggest that clock genes regulate the rhythmicity of the huddle response, establishing a link between circadian gene networks and this behavioral rhythm. We demonstrate that circadian regulation is readily toggled and may play a latent role, even in constant darkness. Overall, our study expands understanding of circadian clock variations and paves the way for future research on the maintenance of silent phenotypes."

Phylogenetics identified the fungus as a previously undescribed species,Serendipita cyanobacteriicola, closely related to endophytes, and the cyanobacterium belongs to the family Coleofasciculaceae, representing a genus and species not yet classified,Symbiothallus taiwanensis. These thalli exhibit nitrogen-fixing activity similar to mosses but lower than cyanolichens.

To facilitate systematic studies, we here present a targeted approach to determine the impact of cancer-associated protease variants (TACAP). Starting with the semiautomated identification of potential specificity-modulating SNVs, our workflow comprises mass spectrometry–based cleavage specificity profiling and substrate identification, localization, and inhibitor studies, followed by functional analyses investigating cancer cell properties. To demonstrate the feasibility of TACAP, we analyzed the meprin β R238Q variant.

Microtubule reorganization supports plant survival in saline-rich soils, but the underlying molecular mechanism in tree species remains unclear. In this study, we identified a salinity stress response mechanism in hybrid poplar seedlings. This mechanism involves regulation of microtubule dynamics by the microtubule-associated protein PLASMA MEMBRANE–ASSOCIATED CATION BINDING PROTEIN 1a (PagPCaP1a). Salinity stress inducedPagPCaP1aexpression and phase separation of PagPCaP1a protein to form PagPCaP1a condensates in a calcium-dependent manner. The formation of PagPCaP1a condensates was partially driven by the VEEEKK motif within the carboxyl terminus of the protein, which rapidly depolymerizes microtubules under salinity stress. Our study reveals that the liquid-liquid phase separation of PagPCaP1a represents an additional regulatory layer for microtubule depolymerization, and we propose an effective strategy to manipulate the phase separation of PagPCaP1a to improve plant stress tolerance."

We experimentally validated this methodology using a heterogeneous computing system. We performed simulations of multiple scientific problems on these circuits, including solving the diffusion equation and modeling equilibration in silicon P-N junctions. Notably, our memristive solver, combined with digital refinement, achieved software-equivalent precision (with an error of 10−12).

Melanoma antigen-A4 (MAGE-A4), a cancer-testis antigen, is expressed in solid tumors and correlates with poor survival, but its role in tumorigenesis and antitumor immunity remains unclear. We found that expression of MAGE-A4 was highly associated with the loss ofPTEN, a tumor suppressor, in human non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Here, we show that constitutive expression of humanMAGE-A4withPtenloss in mouse airway epithelia results in metastatic adenocarcinoma. Tumors showed distinct enrichment in IgA+CD138+CXCR4+plasma cells (PCs) and increased expression of CXCL12 in endothelial cells. Consistently, human NSCLC expressing MAGE-A4 showed increased CD138+IgA+PCs surrounding tumors. Abrogation of PCs decreased tumor burden, increased activated T cell infiltration, and reduced CD163+CD206+macrophages in the MAGE-A4–induced lung tumors.

That IgA may amplify postimmune IgG production is suggested by the impaired IgG response to pneumococcal vaccines in some IgA-deficient patients. Here, we found that antipneumococcal but not total IgG production was impaired in mice with IgA deficiency. The positive effect of gut IgA on antipneumococcal IgG responses started very early in life and could implicate gut bacteria, as these responses were attenuated in germ-free mice recolonized with gut microbes from IgA-deficient donors. IgA could exert this effect by constraining the systemic translocation of gut antigens, which was associated with chronic immune activation, including T cell overexpression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). This inhibitory receptor may attenuate antipneumococcal IgG production by causing B cell hyporesponsiveness, which improved upon anti–PD-1 treatment.

The capacity to induce regeneration exogenously is limited and usually confined to meristematic-like tissues. We show that bacterial cellulose (BC), but not other structurally similar matrixes, induces postwounding regeneration in nonmeristematic plant tissues via a distinctive route to callus-mediated regenerative programs. The BC-specific program involves cytokinin operating concurrently with strongly activated plant biotic response genes to induce plant regeneration. A reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst, normally associated with defense responses, is sustained upon BC application, involving a network of tightly interconnected transcription factors, where WRKY8, known for regulating stress responses, shows a clustering and hierarchical prevalence. WRKY8 regulates BC-mediated plant regeneration and ROS homeostasis, including superoxide anion accumulation, to potentially promote cell proliferation after wounding. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the cytokinin- and ROS-associated defense responses can be targeted by BC application to promote plant wound regeneration through alternative regenerative programs."
