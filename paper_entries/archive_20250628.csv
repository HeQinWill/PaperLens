10.5194/acp-25-5355-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文通过对上海市PM2.5中碳气溶胶的长期测量和分析，评估了中国清洁空气行动对有机气溶胶的影响。重点关注了初级有机碳（POC）和次级有机碳（SOC）的时空变化、来源和形成机制。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术，但其对大气成分（特别是碳气溶胶）的监测和分析，与大气环境遥感技术在空气质量监测和大气成分分析方面的应用密切相关。该研究的结果可以用于验证和改进基于遥感数据的空气质量模型，并为制定更有效的空气污染控制策略提供科学依据。,"['organic aerosols', 'carbonaceous aerosols', 'PM2.5', 'primary organic carbon (POC)', 'secondary organic carbon (SOC)', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis']",Haifeng Yu;Yunhua Chang;Lin Cheng;Yusen Duan;Jianlin Hu,Measurement report: Long-term assessment of primary and secondary organic aerosols in the Shanghai megacity throughout China's Clean Air actions since 2010,"This study presents long-term measurements and comprehensive analysis of carbonaceous aerosols in fine particles in Shanghai. We further estimated primary and secondary carbon levels, examining their temporal variations on interannual, monthly, seasonal, and diurnal scales. Through rigorous statistical analysis and correlation studies with meteorological parameters and pollutant concentrations, the origins, formation mechanisms, and spatial distribution patterns of secondary organic carbon were elucidated. 
 A growing body of research has demonstrated the effectiveness of China's Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan in controlling PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 µm), pollution. However, there is a lack of long-term studies investigating the impact of these abatement policies on carbonaceous aerosols in PM2.5, particularly secondary organic carbon (SOC). Shanghai, as China's largest megacity and a prominent industrial hub, serves as a crucial gateway to the nation's rapid development, with a population exceeding 20 million. In this study, we conducted hourly online measurements of organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) in PM2.5 in Shanghai from July 2010 to July 2017. The results revealed that the annual concentrations (mean ± 1σ) of OC and EC reached their peaks in 2013 (9.5 ± 6.4 and 2.7 ± 2.6 to 3.0 ± 2.3 and 2.7 ± 2.1 µg m−3). Subsequently, a consistent year-to-year decrease in both OC and EC concentrations was observed, mirroring the trend observed for PM2.5. Primary organic carbon (POC), the primary component of OC, accounted for an average of 65.6 %, displaying similar trends to OC. This finding indicates the effectiveness of primary emission control measures. However, the concentration of secondary organic carbon (SOC) did not decrease from 2013 to 2017, remaining relatively stable within the range of 2.7 ± 2.6 to 3.0 ± 2.3 µg m−3. When considering data from previous studies in Shanghai, concentrations of SOC did not exhibit a noticeable decline until 2018, coinciding with the implementation of measures targeting volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. Seasonally, with the exception of 2011, OC and EC concentrations were highest during winter, likely influenced by unfavorable meteorological conditions and long-range transport. SOC displayed no distinct seasonal fluctuations, as its formation is influenced by both photochemical reactions and meteorological conditions. POC and SOC exhibited different diurnal patterns, but neither showed a significant weekend effect, suggesting limited reduction in anthropogenic activities during weekends. Furthermore, SOC concentrations exhibited simultaneous increases in summer, particularly when O3 concentrations exceeded 50 µg m−3, indicating that stronger oxidation reactions contribute to higher SOC concentrations. Our findings also revealed concentration gradients of SOC dependent on wind direction (WD) and wind speed (WS), with higher concentrations typically observed for winds originating from the southwest and northwest. Potential sources from distant regions were analyzed using the potential source contribution function (PSCF), indicating that the geographical potential source area is concentrated near the middle and lower Yangtze River."
10.5194/acp-25-5331-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了如何追踪极地地区大气中短寿命物质的来源，重点关注气溶胶粒子和痕量气体。论文评估了传统的后向模拟方法在识别这些物质来源方面的准确性，并提出了一种改进的分析方法。通过结合FLEXPART模型和WRF-Chem模型，研究发现传统方法常常误判排放源区域。改进后的方法在识别甲烷磺酸和黑碳等物质的来源方面表现出更好的性能。虽然论文没有直接涉及卫星观测或特定的遥感技术，但它与大气成分分析和空气质量监测密切相关，因为准确识别大气污染物的来源对于理解和改善空气质量至关重要。该研究的结果可以间接应用于利用遥感数据进行大气成分反演和源解析的研究。,"['aerosol particles', 'trace gases', 'backward modeling', 'source identification', 'atmospheric composition', 'air quality monitoring (indirectly)', 'methane sulfonic acid', 'black carbon']",Anderson Da Silva;Louis Marelle;Jean-Christophe Raut;Yvette Gramlich;Karolina Siegel;Sophie L. Haslett;Claudia Mohr;Jennie L. Thomas,How to trace the origins of short-lived atmospheric species: an Arctic example,"Particle sources in polar climates are unclear, affecting climate representation in models. This study introduces an evaluated method for tracking particles with backward modeling. Tests on simulated particles allowed us to show that traditional detection methods often misidentify sources. An improved method that accurately traces the origins of aerosol particles in the Arctic is presented. The study recommends using this enhanced method for better source identification of atmospheric species. 
 The origins of particles and trace gases involved in the rapidly changing polar climates remain unclear, limiting the reliability of climate models. This is especially true for particles involved in aerosol–cloud interactions with polar clouds. As detailed chemical fingerprinting measurements are difficult and expensive in polar regions, backward modeling is often used to identify the sources of observed atmospheric compounds. However, the accuracy of these methods is not well quantified. This study provides an evaluation of these analysis protocols by combining backward trajectories from the FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model (FLEXPART) with simulations of tracers from the Weather Research and Forecast model including Chemistry (WRF-Chem). Knowing the exact modeled tracer emission sources in WRF-Chem enables a precise quantification of the source detection accuracy. The results show that direct interpretation of backward model outputs or more advanced analyses like potential source contribution functions (PSCFs) are often unreliable in identifying emission sources. After exploring parameter sensitivities thanks to our simulation framework, we present an updated and rigorously evaluated backward-modeling analysis protocol for tracing the origins of atmospheric species from measurement data. Two tests of the improved protocol on actual aerosol data from Arctic campaigns demonstrate its ability to correctly identify known sources of methane sulfonic acid and black carbon. Our results reveal that traditional back-trajectory methods often misidentify emission source regions. Therefore, we recommend using the method described in this study for future efforts to trace the origins of measured atmospheric species."
10.5194/acp-25-5371-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文的标题和摘要表明，它与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。该研究利用航空遥感技术监测罗马尼亚石油和天然气生产区的甲烷排放情况，并发现2019年至2021年间甲烷排放量显著降低。研究强调了基于测量的排放监测的重要性，并展示了多尺度评估的价值，包括地面观测和大规模航空遥感相结合，以捕捉主要的排放源和罕见但重要的超级排放源。因此，该研究涉及大气成分分析（甲烷）、遥感技术（航空遥感）以及环境监测应用（油气行业甲烷减排）。,"['methane emissions', 'airborne remote sensing', 'oil and gas sector', 'emission monitoring', 'atmospheric composition', 'super-emitters']",Gerrit Kuhlmann;Foteini Stavropoulou;Stefan Schwietzke;Daniel Zavala-Araiza;Andrew Thorpe;Andreas Hueni;Lukas Emmenegger;Andreea Calcan;Thomas Röckmann;Dominik Brunner,Evidence of successful methane mitigation in one of Europe's most important oil production region,"A measurement campaign in 2019 found that methane emissions from oil and gas in Romania were significantly higher than reported. In 2021, our follow-up campaign using airborne remote sensing showed a marked decreases in emissions by 20 %–60 % due to improved infrastructure. The study highlights the importance of measurement-based emission monitoring and illustrates the value of a multi-scale assessment integrating ground-based observations with large-scale airborne remote sensing campaigns. 
 Reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas production infrastructure is a cost-effective way for limiting global warming. In 2019, a measurement campaign in southern Romania found emission rates from the oil and gas sector substantially higher than the nationally reported emissions, with a few high-emitting sources (“super-emitters”) contributing disproportionately to total emissions. In 2021, our follow-up airborne remote sensing campaign, covering over 80 % of production sites, revealed a marked decrease in super-emitters. The observed change in the number of emitters is consistent with an emission reduction by 20 %–60 % from 2019 to 2021. This reduction is likely due to improvements in production infrastructure following the first campaign in 2019. This is further supported by additional site visits, which showed that many of the leaks identified in 2019 had indeed been mitigated. However, our top-down quantification remains higher than the bottom-up emission reports. Our study highlights the importance of measurement-based emission monitoring of climate change mitigation measures and illustrates the value of a multi-scale assessment integrating ground-based observations with large-scale airborne mapping to capture both the primary mode of emission sources and the rare, but significant, super-emitters."
10.5194/amt-18-2295-2025,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,该论文主要研究星载雷达对地表反射信号（杂波）的特性，特别是在存在地形起伏的情况下。研究背景是欧空局的WIVERN任务，该任务旨在利用星载W波段多普勒雷达观测云内风。论文通过模拟意大利皮埃蒙特地区的扫描，分析了地表杂波对速度观测的影响。虽然主要目标是研究雷达信号和地表特性，但由于WIVERN任务与云内风观测有关，而云是大气环境的重要组成部分，并且提到了EarthCARE、CloudSat和GPM等卫星任务，这些任务都与大气观测有关，因此可以认为该论文与大气环境遥感技术有一定关联，尤其是在卫星观测和大气成分（云）分析方面。,"['Spaceborne radar', 'Doppler radar', 'W-band radar', 'Conical scanning', 'Ground clutter', 'Orography', 'Wind velocity', 'In-cloud winds', 'Satellite observations', 'EarthCARE', 'CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR)', 'Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM)']",Francesco Manconi;Alessandro Battaglia;Pavlos Kollias,Characterization of surface clutter signal in the presence of orography for a spaceborne conically scanning W-band Doppler radar,"The paper aims to study the ground reflection, or clutter, of the signal from a spaceborne radar in the context of ESA's WIVERN (WInd VElocity Radar Nephoscop) mission, which will observe in-cloud winds. Using topography and land type data, with a model of the satellite orbit and rotating antenna, simulations of scans have been run over the Piedmont region of Italy. These measurements cover the full range of the ground clutter over land for WIVERN and have allowed for analyses of the precision and accuracy of velocity observations. 
 The Earth's surface radar reflection is one of the most important signals received by spaceborne radar systems. It is used in several scientific applications, including geolocation, terrain classification, and path-integrated attenuation estimation. A simulator based on the ray-tracing approach has been developed to reproduce the clutter reflectivity and the Doppler velocity signal for a conically scanning spaceborne Doppler radar system. The simulator exploits topographic information through a raster digital elevation model, land types from a regional classification database, and a normalized radar surface cross-section look-up table. The simulator is applied to the WInd VElocity Radar Nephoscop (WIVERN) mission, which proposes a conically scanning W-band Doppler radar to study in-cloud winds. Using an orbital model, detailed simulations for conical scans over the Piedmont region of Italy, which offers a variety of landscape conditions, are presented. The results highlight the strong departure of the reflectivity and Doppler velocity profiles in the presence of marked orography and the significant gradient in the surface radar backscattering properties. The simulations demonstrate the limitations and advantages of using the surface Doppler velocity over land as an antenna-pointing characterization technique. They represent the full strength range of the surface radar clutter over land surfaces for the WIVERN radar. The surface clutter tool applies to other spaceborne radar missions, such as the nadir-pointing EarthCARE and CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR), or the cross-track scanning Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM)  precipitation radars."
10.1021/acs.est.5c03079,True,Environmental Science & Technology,该研究论文关注的是华北地区夏季边界层顶部硝酸盐化学的长期变化。论文发现，尽管氮氧化物排放有所减少，但硝酸盐浓度在2007年至2021年期间有所增加。这主要是由于硫酸盐减少导致的气溶胶酸度降低所致。研究还表明，垂直输送是近地面硝酸盐的重要来源。论文预测，未来氮氧化物排放的进一步减少将有助于降低高空硝酸盐浓度，并通过垂直输送进一步降低近地面PM2.5浓度。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是空气质量监测和大气成分分析。,"['nitrate', 'PM2.5', 'aerosol acidity', 'vertical transport', 'NOx emission reduction', 'air quality monitoring']",Liang Wen;Jian Gao;Likun Xue;Yang Li;Rui Gao;Wei Tang;Jiaqi Wang;Xiaohui Du;Yujie Zhang;Xinfeng Wang;Yujiao Zhu;Fahe Chai;Jingnan Hu;Guigang Tang;Jianmin Chen;Tao Wang;Aijun Ding;Hartmut Herrmann;Abdelwahid Mellouki;Can Dong;Haisheng Li;Zhaoxin Guo;Yong Zhao,Long-Term Changes in Summertime Nitrate Chemistry in the Top Boundary Layer of North China,"Reducing fine particulate nitrate (pNO3–) is critical for further mitigating PM2.5 pollution in China. However, previous NOx emission reductions have failed to achieve the expected pNO3– decreases. The present study reports that pNO3– concentration in summer increased by 55.8% and 5.6% at North China Peak (1534 m a.s.l.) from 2007 to 2014 and 2014 to 2021, respectively. pNO3– formation enhancement was caused mainly by decreased aerosol acidity due to notable SO42– reduction. pNO3– formation changed from a process limited by NH4+ to one colimited by NO2 and NH4+, suggesting an increased effect of NOx reduction on decreasing pNO3– production. Vertical transport represents a significant source of pNO3– near the surface, illustrating a percentage as high as 98% recorded during daytime hours and a proportion of 34% in the dark over North China in the simulation scenario during summer 2020. The scheme to reduce NOx emissions by 10% from 2020 to 2025 is predicted to slowly decrease aloft pNO3– over North China, which may facilitate further reductions in pNO3– concentrations near the surface via vertical transport. The inflection of nitrate chemistry in the top boundary layer suggests an opportunity to accelerate PM2.5 reduction under projected further emission reductions."

Hegglin;Shengmin Lu;Yifan Li;Philippe Bousquet,Air pollution modulates trends and variability of the global methane budget,"An integrated observation-driven and model-driven approach demonstrates that, from 2005 to 2021, periods of high atmospheric methane growth were linked to trends and variations in OH levels driven by fluctuations in air pollutants, especially during extreme events. 
 Air pollution affects climate through various complex interactions1. It perturbs the Earth’s radiative energy balance and alters the atmospheric oxidation capacity, which determines the lifetimes of short-lived climate forcers, such as methane1. A key mechanism in this dynamic is the impact of air pollutants on the hydroxyl radical (OH), the most important oxidant in the troposphere, which accounts for approximately 90% of the methane chemical sink2. However, a comprehensive quantification of the interactions between air pollutants, OH and methane over decadal timescales remains incomplete2. Here we develop an integrated observation-driven and model-driven approach to quantify how variations in key air pollutants influence the methane chemical sink and alter the methane budget. Our results indicate that, from 2005 to 2021, enhanced tropospheric ozone, increased water vapour and decreased carbon monoxide levels collectively contributed to a 1.3–2.0 Tg year−1 increase per year in the global methane sink, thereby buffering atmospheric methane growth rates. This increase in the methane sink was primarily concentrated in tropical regions and exhibited a north–south asymmetry. Periods of high methane growth were typically linked to abrupt OH level declines driven by fluctuations in air pollutants, especially during extreme events such as mega wildfires and the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study suggests a trade-off between O3 pollution control and methane removal mediated by OH and highlights the risk of increasing carbon monoxide emissions from widespread wildfires. An integrated observation-driven and model-driven approach demonstrates that, from 2005 to 2021, periods of high atmospheric methane growth were linked to trends and variations in OH levels driven by fluctuations in air pollutants, especially during extreme events."

 Elemental carbon (EC), predominantly produced by solid fuel combustion, significantly influences both climate and public health. However, the physicochemical properties of EC-containing particles immediately after emission remain inadequately understood. This study investigates the chemical composition, size distribution, and mixing state of EC-containing particles from five solid fuels: wheat, corn, rice straw, bituminous coal, and anthracite. Using a single-particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SPAMS), we identified seven distinct EC-containing particle types. Our results show that biomass burning primarily produces EC-containing particles obviously coated with organic carbon (EC-OC) and organic nitrogen (EC-CN), with sizes concentrated between 0.4 and 1.0 μm. In contrast, bituminous coal emissions are dominated by sodium-rich EC-containing particles (EC-Na), while anthracite combustion predominantly produces particles coated with sulfate or nitrate (EC-NS). Bituminous coal particles are generally smaller ( < 0.4 μm), likely due to higher volatile content and rapid pyrolysis. The mixing states of EC-containing particles varied markedly. Sulfate (97HSO4−) was strongly associated with EC-OC and EC-Na particles, resulting in a highly mixing state. Levoglucosan (59C2H3O2−) showed distinct patterns between biomass and coal emissions. These findings provide critical insights into the physicochemical properties of freshly emitted EC-containing aerosols, offering valuable references for atmospheric particle analysis and emission characterization."

 This study presents the first attempt to observe wildfire enhancements of carbon monoxide (CO) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) around sunrise and sunset from a hyperspectral infrared sounder in a dawn-dusk sun-synchronous orbit. The 2nd generation of High Spectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (HIRAS-II) on board FengYun-3E (FY-3E), the world's first civilian dawn-dusk orbit meteorological satellite, provides global observations in the thermal infrared spectral range with equatorial overpass times of 5:30 am/pm local solar time (LST). The spectral observations are used to retrieve CO, formic acid (HCOOH) and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) emitted from three major Canadian wildfire events from June to August 2023. Extreme enhancements of CO, HCOOH and PAN were detected in the 2023 Canadian wildfires which are unprecedented in time and spatial scales and intensity. The HIRAS-II successfully captured the strong signals of CO, HCOOH, and PAN. The averaging kernel (AK) matrix, indicative of detection vertical sensitivity, peaks mostly in the free troposphere where extensive transport typically takes place. Comparison with the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) and the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) reveals that the spatial distribution patterns of the total columns extracted from HIRAS-II are in good agreement. Validation with the CAMS model and ground-based observations from TCCON and NDACC confirms that HIRAS-II retrievals are consistent. The HCOOH-to-CO and the PAN-to-CO column enhancement ratios derived from HIRAS-II are close to those derived from IASI. This paper exhibits the capability of FY-3E/HIRAS-II in observing wildfire emissions during dawn and dusk hours, which will potentially enhance the climate-monitoring capability of low-orbit meteorological satellites."

 Vertical mixing of pollutants and secondary inorganic aerosol formations over Beijing, China are investigated based on an unique observational platform on the roof of a high building (528 m above ground) and stations near ground. The contrary trends in diurnal variations of pollutants (SO2, NOx etc.) between the 528 m layer and near ground confirm that pollutants are well mixed in the daytime, but strongly suppressed at night due to the decoupling of the residual layer (RL) and nocturnal stable boundary layer (SBL). The decoupling also results in differences of aerosol formations between the two layers due to the differences in gaseous precursors, atmospheric oxidation capacity, and meteorological variables. Observations indicate that sulfate formation is more efficient near ground than in the 528 m layer due to higher relative humidity (RH) near ground, while nocturnal nitrate formation is more efficient in the 528 m layer due to higher O3 in this layer. The formed nitrate in the RL is downwards transported to ground in next morning, highlighting the potential importance of vertical pollutants mixing and residual layer chemistry in air quality near ground."

 Elucidating the effects of anthropogenic pollutants on the formation mechanism of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is crucial for the improvement of atmospheric models toward the development of effective control strategies. It is extremely challenging to precisely clarify the impacts of concentrations of anthropogenic pollutants on the molecular compositions and particle number/mass concentrations of SOA under complicated conditions. Here, we report a series of the studies on the effects of anthropogenic pollutants (NO2 and SO2) on the photooxidation of a representative monoterpene, Δ3-carene, by using the scanning mobility particle sizer spectrometer, recently-developed vacuum ultraviolet free electron laser (VUV-FEL) photoionization aerosol mass spectrometry, and quantum chemical calculations. The results indicated that with the increase of NO2 concentration, the SOA yields increased under low-NO2 conditions but decreased under high-NO2 conditions. The OH radical was found to be the primary oxidant under low-NO2 conditions, whereas O3 became the dominant oxidant under high-NO2 conditions. SO2 substantially enhanced the formation of highly oxidized molecules via the acid-catalyzed pathway. A series of new compounds (i.e., organic peroxides, organic nitrates, and organosulfates) were observed and their formation mechanisms were proposed. The present findings highlight the critical role of anthropogenic pollutants in the photooxidation of monoterpene under low and high pollution environments and also open new avenues toward systematic studies of a broader class of volatile organic compounds."

 This study investigated the spatiotemporal variation and long-range transport characteristics of atmospheric speciated mercury (ASM) along the West and East Channels surrounding Taiwan Island toward the South China Sea (SCS) in East Asia. Field sampling was conducted at three remote island sites, and potential sources of ASM were examined using backward trajectory clustering and regional fire maps. Seasonally, ASM concentrations followed the order: spring > winter > fall > summer, with higher ASM levels observed in the western waters of Taiwan Island than those in the eastern waters. Among the mercury species, gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) was predominant, and followed by particulate-bound mercury (PBM) and gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM), with total gaseous mercury (TGM = GEM+GOM) accounting for 92.1–98.4 % of ASM. Clustered trajectory analysis indicated that Asian Northeastern Monsoons (ANMs) may transport ASMs originating from continental sources in North and East Asia to the island sites via long-range transport. Slash-and-burn activities in the Indochina Peninsula and mainland China during spring and winter contributed to elevated ASM levels. The West Channel exhibited a pronounced “channel effect,” amplifying industrial emissions across the Taiwan Strait and resulting in higher ASM levels at the Penghu Islands. Conversely, the East Channel received diluted air masses through long-range transport from the Korean Peninsula and North China via Green Island and the Bashi Channel, leading to relatively lower ASM levels at the Dongsha Island. Overall, this study highlights the importance of seasonal circulation patterns and regional combustion sources in shaping mercury distribution in the marine boundary layer of East Asia."

This study examines how such wastewater influences coastal aerosols by tracking spatial gradients from near the border northward. Using benzoylecgonine (a nonvolatile cocaine metabolite) as a sewage tracer, we find that wastewater compounds—including a mixture of illicit drugs, drug metabolites, and chemicals from tires and personal care products—become aerosolized and are detectable in both water and air. Spatial analyses confirm that most measured chemicals concentrate in aerosols near the Tijuana River, potentially exposing local populations to tens of nanograms per hour (e.g., octinoxate and methamphetamine) via inhalation. This airborne pathway highlights a largely overlooked source of atmospheric pollution, emphasizing the need to reassess health risks in coastal regions as global water contamination continues to escalate."

Using multiple sets of reanalysis data, this study identifies a systematic co-occurrence of cold extremes and intense surface ultraviolet (UV) radiation in winter over this region, forming compound cold-UV extreme events (cold-UV CEEs). The cold extremes are primarily driven by the East Atlantic blocking which disrupts the typical westerly flow, causing meridional transport of Arctic cold air masses into the East European Plain. Concurrently, the blocking high, which induces subsidence and stabilizes the atmosphere, suppresses cloud formation. The resultant cloud reduction elevates surface UV radiation intensity by about 20% relative to the climatology. In addition, our analysis identifies a significant 9 year cycle in the frequency of cold-UV CEEs, providing a critical foundation for predicting these cascading hazards."

Pollutant enhancements are measured at multiple sites, and the ensemble of observations are fit to a 2-D Gaussian model to characterize the extent of dilution prior to observation and derive emissions at the location of the fire. Distinct approaches are used for calibration of the CO2, air quality gases, and PM2.5 instruments.

This study presents the first two vertically measured CO2 profiles from the ground to 25 km in the economically developed regions of southeast China using a balloon‐borne AirCore system. From higher to lower altitudes, the two CO2 profiles revealed distinct characteristics, showing an initial increase, followed by a decrease, and then another increase with fluctuations up to 13.1 ppm. Notable peaks were observed in the stratosphere, contrasting with findings from northwestern China, likely due to strong aircraft emissions in economically active southern regions. Additionally, air mass transport from urban areas elevated upper‐atmosphere CO2 levels. After 2‐hr storage, the CO2 profile achieved a vertical resolution of 260 m at 10 km with the segmented design and narrow tube diameter enhancing high‐altitude resolution. Although CarbonTracker simulations and Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) prior profiles matched the overall trends, significant differences in concentrations and key altitude fluctuations highlight limited prior profile information and uncertainties in remote sensing inversions. Observations from OCO‐3, TCCON, and GOSAT‐2 likely overestimate column‐averaged CO2 concentration by 1–7 ppm due to limitations in spatial resolution, prior information, and inherent method constraints. The CO2 profiles in the same regions remain variable, influenced by terrain, meteorology, and sampling season.

However, there still exist significant knowledge gaps in understanding optical characteristics and molecular composition of chromophores of brown carbon (BrC) in PM emitted from agricultural machinery. Therefore, BrC in PM from six typical agricultural machines in China were measured to investigate the light absorption, chromophore characteristics, and influencing factors. Results showed that the average emission factors of methanol‐soluble organic carbon (MSOC) and water‐soluble organic carbon (WSOC) were 0.96 and 0.21 g (kg fuel)−1, respectively, exhibiting clear decreasing trends with increasing engine power and improving emission standards. Despite the light absorption coefficient of methanol‐extracted BrC (Abs365,M) being approximately 2.2 times higher than that of water (Abs365,W), mass absorption efficiency of water‐extracted BrC (MAE365,W) exhibited significantly greater values than MAE365,M. Among the detected chromophores, nitro‐aromatic compounds (NACs) exhibited the highest contribution to light absorption that was about 14.5 times more than to total light absorption compared to their mass contributions to MSOC (0.04%), followed by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and oxygenated PAHs (OPAHs). Besides, the average integrated simple forcing efficiency values were estimated to be 1.5 W g−1 for MSOC and 3.7 W g−1 for WSOC, indicating significant radiative forcing absorption of agricultural machinery.

 Atmospheric ice nucleation plays a crucial role in cloud formation, precipitation, and climate dynamics. However, the physicochemical properties of submicron ice nucleating particles (INPs) remain poorly understood, and distinguishing between nano- to micron-sized ice crystals and supercooled droplets in cloud microphysical processes remains a significant challenge. Here, we present the first detection of nano-sized ice crystals (390 nm) along with their physical properties using a portable platform for ice nucleation that integrates the McGill Real-time Ice Nucleation Chamber (MRINC) with advanced holographic microscopy and aerosol sizers. This platform enables real-time detection and differentiation of ice crystals and supercooled droplets, providing microphysical information into their spherical or non-spherical morphology, surface roughness, and phase characteristics, particularly for ice particles smaller than 500 nm. Automated algorithms facilitate the differentiation of individual and aggregated ice crystals within a size range of 390 nm to 100 µm, supporting time-resolved analyses of ice nucleation processes. Surface roughness (Rt, Ra) measurements and 3D structural data offer critical insights into light scattering and radiation interactions, with smaller ice crystals (<1 µm) exhibiting higher roughness and enhanced multidirectional scattering. Validation through computational fluid dynamics simulations and experiments demonstrates platform ability to differentiate silver iodide-nucleated ice crystals from supercooled droplets and to monitor aerosol growth, advancing our understanding of aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions."

 To characterize the distribution characteristics of PM2.5 pollution within a small scale within the city, PM2.5 concentration estimation data with high spatial resolution is required. However, the existing PM2.5 data mostly have a resolution of more than 1 km, and the spatial scale is relatively coarse, which makes it difficult to meet the actual needs of fine pollution monitoring and governance in cities. To address this limitation, this study based on the deep neural network (DNN) model, used multi-source auxiliary data such as the top atmospheric reflectance (TOAR) data and meteorological data of the Gaofen-1 (GF-1) satellite to achieve near-ground PM2.5 concentration retrieval with a spatial resolution of 30 m in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region. The model's performance was evaluated by a cross-validation (CV) method based on samples and sites. The results showed that the sample-based R2 was 0.912 with an RMSE of 10.326 μg/m3, while the site-based R2 was 0.780 with an RMSE of 16.375 μg/m3. The high-resolution PM2.5 data retrieved in this study can reveal the spatial differences in pollution at the urban block and even building scale. Combined with the analysis of a typical pollution event, the practical application potential of this high-resolution data in identifying local pollution sources and analyzing pollution changes within the city was verified. This study provides a new technical path for high-resolution PM2.5 retrieval and provides important data support for refined urban air quality monitoring and scientific governance."

 Using a methodology for the estimation of coarse particle exchanges via Doppler lidar, based on the eddy covariance technique, profiles of vertical transport velocities were derived and analyzed. The methodology was tested across diverse atmospheric conditions in two different Mediterranean dryland landscapes in Southeastern Spain, namely Guadiana-UGR (extensive, inland olive grove), and Aguamarga (shrubland with maritime influence). Firstly, study cases were analyzed and the main atmospheric mechanisms impacting particle transport were identified. Convective mixing within the boundary layer was found to be the primary driver of the upward particle transport. However, cloud cover was observed to attenuate the transport velocity, while significant deposition events were observed during a Saharan dust outbreak. Secondly, positive transport velocities were found during convective periods and lower, yet positive, values during non-convective periods. Higher transport velocities were observed during a drier period at Guadiana-UGR, likely due to drier soil conditions. Aguamarga exhibited notably lower transport velocities. Considering only the lowermost observational level (105 m above the ground), net emission of particles was observed. Footprint analysis supported the representativeness of the fluxes. Our findings provide novel insights into particle exchanges over Mediterranean drylands, quantifying the turbulent transport and identifying its atmospheric drivers. Additionally, the considered ecosystems were found to be net sources of particles during the study periods. These results highlight the role of drylands as emerging contributors to global dust emissions in the context of climate change."

Elevated pollution sources and long-distance transport have important effects on the distribution of NH4+in Beijing. •The contribution of NH4+to PM2.5remains at a relatively stable level in two years, and increases slightly during the pollution period, which is related to the increase in hygroscopic growth of NH4+particles. •Most of the NH4+over Beijing during the study period is in the form of NH4NO3. 
 Atmospheric ammonium (NH₄+), a key component formed through complex chemical reactions and particulate transformations involving nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) and ammonia (NH₃), plays a critical role in climate dynamics, ecological balance, and human health. Understanding the vertical distribution of NH₄+ is essential for comprehensively characterizing regional aerosol patterns. However, the lack of systematic and spatiotemporally resolved studies has hindered the development of accurate NH₄+ distribution models and predictive capabilities. In this study, we present an innovative algorithm based on the GRASP model to retrieve hourly NH₄+ mass concentration data from 2021 to 2022, enabling a detailed investigation of NH₄+ vertical distribution characteristics in Asia super megacity-Beijing. Our findings reveal that transportation emissions are a primary source of NH₄+ in Beijing, while elevated pollution sources and long-range transport also significantly influence local NH₄+ distribution. The vertical profiles exhibit strong seasonal consistency over the two-year study period, with higher concentrations typically observed in upper atmospheric layers compared to near-surface layers, and distinct peaks at 1 km and 300 m above ground level. NH₄+ concentrations are highest in spring and lowest in winter. In spring, the influence of northern dust leads to elevated NH₄+ levels, particularly on moderately polluted days, with more pronounced vertical gradients. During autumn, a significant peak in NH₄+ concentration at 1 km altitude is attributed to long-range transport from southern urban centers. The contribution of NH₄+ to PM₂.₅ remains relatively stable over the two years, with a slight increase during polluted hours due to enhanced hygroscopicity of NH₄+ particles driven by higher atmospheric humidity. Strong correlations among chemical components across various altitudes indicate a high degree of homogeneity. Additionally, ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) is identified as the predominant form of NH₄+ in Beijing during the study period. These insights advance our understanding of NH₄+ dynamics and its role in urban air quality, providing a foundation for improved aerosol modeling and pollution mitigation strategies."

This study presents a long-term (2011–2021), high spatiotemporal resolution aerosol optical depth dataset retrieved from a geostationary satellite over East Asia. The high-resolution data capture subtle aerosol gradients and land-ocean boundaries, providing valuable input for various fields such as aerosol-cloud interaction, climate change, ocean optics, and air quality studies. 
 Formerly known as one of the most polluted regions of the globe, East Asia underwent a dramatic improvement of air quality, especially for aerosols, starting in the 2010s. Numerous satellites have observed East Asia for a long time duration, but often with a low spatial or temporal resolution, limiting their ability to capture small-scale variabilities or provide continuous observations of long-range transport of aerosols. In this study, we provide an hourly aerosol optical property (AOP) dataset retrieved from the Korean Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), with a high spatial resolution of 2 km at nadir, covering the entire operational period from March 2011–March 2021. The dataset is retrieved using the Yonsei Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm, providing aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm as the primary product, along with fine mode fraction, single scattering albedo, Ångström exponent, and aerosol type as ancillary products. Seasonal validation of AOD against the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) showed that the fraction of data points within the expected error range of 0.05 + 15 % varied from 56.4 % in June-July-August to 64.5 % in September-October-December, with the mean bias generally within ±0.05. Compared to the operational version, the high-resolution product demonstrated improved retrieval capability in the presence of broken clouds, along complex coastlines, and in capturing AOD variability at the sub-district level. The decadal AOD exhibited a decreasing trend over four major cities within the observation domain. We expect this data to be widely used in climate modelling, reanalysis, atmospheric chemistry, marine optics, environmental health studies, variability and trend analysis, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the interactions between climate change, trace gases, human health, and AOPs.

However, the limited spatiotemporal coverage of current satellite-derived XCO2 data poses significant challenges to tracking CO2 variations on a large scale and over extended periods. In view of this, this study uses satellite-derived NO2 data as a suitable proxy and tracks CO2 emissions from 38 selected power plants globally by integrating near-synchronously observed TROPOMI NO2 data and OCO-2 XCO2 data. The results show that our method significantly increases the effective observation frequency by almost 200 times compared to using OCO-2 data alone. Compared to the emissions reported by the power plants, the correlation coefficient of the method used in this study (0.78) is higher than that of the emission inventory estimates (0.43–0.62), resulting in an accuracy improvement of approximately 1.8–2.3 Mt/yr per power plant. The use of satellite-derived NO2 data significantly enhances the ability to remotely estimate CO2 emissions from power plants, which gives us confidence in studying anthropogenic point-source CO2 emissions across different spatial and temporal scales. This enhances the understanding of their variability and mitigation potential, supporting the development of refined carbon inventories and advanced carbon cycle assimilation systems."

This study addresses three key machine learning tasks using the dataset: (1) flame detection, achieved through a feature-based multi-modal image fusion model (FF-YOLOv5n) reaching a mAP50-95 of 0.5764; (2) flame segmentation, which delineates fire boundaries using the real-time lightweight BiSeNetV2 model, achieving a high mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) score exceeding 0.88; and (3) flame tracking, which monitors the real-time progression of straw burning with a precision of 0.9065 and a success rate of 0.6593 using the Aba-ViTrack algorithm, suitable for on-board processing on UAVs at 50 frames per second (FPS). These experiments provide efficient baseline models for UAV-based straw-burning monitoring with edge computing capabilities. The UAV-StrawFire dataset enables the detection and monitoring of flame regions with varying sizes, textures, and opacities, thereby supporting potential straw-burning control efforts. The dataset is publicly available on IEEE Dataport, offering a valuable resource for researchers in the remote sensing and machine learning communities to advance the development of effective straw-burning monitoring systems."

 Long-term monitoring of atmospheric aerosols is essential for understanding the interaction between natural processes and anthropogenic activities. This study analyzes a 20-year (2002–2022) dataset of water-soluble ions (WSIs) in aerosols collected at Urumqi Glacier No. 1 (UG1) in the eastern Tianshan Mountains, China. Significant increases in calcium ions (Ca2+) and aerosol pH were observed, indicating enhanced dust deposition and a shift toward an alkaline atmospheric environment. Mann-Kendall trend analysis revealed a notable annual increase in Ca2+ concentration (0.053 μg m−3, p < 0.001), with Ca2+ contributing up to 73 % of the total ion content during dust-heavy periods (2013–2015 and 2020–2022). Backward trajectory analysis and ion balance calculations identified Central Asian deserts as primary dust sources, while other WSIs (e.g., SO42−, NO3−, NH4+) reflect contributions from anthropogenic emissions. These findings highlight the growing influence of transboundary dust transport and its implications for air quality, glacier dynamics, and environmental changes in high-altitude regions."

 The Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) is one of essential atmospheric parameters, its prediction accuracy and completeness are significant for meteorological researches and climate applications. The nonlinearity and instability of PWV time series are not considered in the most PWV prediction models. In the paper, a new PWV prediction model was proposed combining the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Multihead-Attention. Firstly, based on the PWV of 7 radiosondes (RS) and ERA5 in the Yangtze River Delta region, China, an ERA5-PWV calibration model was constructed using Support Vector Machine (SVM). Then, the wavelet transform was used to remove the high-frequency noise of the ERA5-PWV and maintain its main features. Finally, the PWV prediction models in prediction range of 1–24 h were constructed based on the single and fusion algorithms of WOA, RNN, BiLSTM, and Multihead-Attention. The results show that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of SVM-calibrated ERA5-PWV are 3.17 mm and 2.21 mm compared to the RS-PWV, with reductions of 0.12 mm and 0.17 mm compared to the ERA5-PWV itself. As for the 1-h and 3-h WOA-RNN-BiLSTM-Multihead-Attention (WRBMA) PWV prediction models, their RMSEs are 1.13 mm and 1.10 mm, their MAEs are 0.84 mm and 0.81 mm, and both of their Normalized Square Errors (NSE) are 0.99. Their accuracy improves about 14 %–67 % compared to the other PWV prediction models. As for the 12-h and 24-h WRBMA-PWV prediction models, their RMSEs are 1.86 mm and 3.61 mm, their MAEs are 1.36 mm and 2.69 mm, and their NSEs are 0.99 and 0.96. Compared to the Global Forecast System (GFS), the 3 h and 12 h WRBMA PWV prediction model demonstrate better prediction accuracy, with its RMSE reduced by 0.28 mm and 0.22 mm, and its MAE 0.17 mm and 0.17 mm, respectively. However, the GFS model performed better than WRBMA PWV prediction model in the 24 h PWV prediction, with its RMSE and MAE reduced by 1.23 mm and 1.02 mm."

With the original goal of constraining natural CO2 $\mathrm{C}{\mathrm{O}}_{\mathrm{2}}$ fluxes at regional to global scales, these instruments have now become popular tools for studying anthropogenic emissions from cities around the world. As signatories of the Paris Climate Agreement are expected to produce nationally determined contributions (NDC) to global carbon emissions, continued monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) of these estimates will be essential. While the use of OCO‐2 and OCO‐3 missions for MRV purposes is increasing, several physical and environmental factors limit data collection. Using the continental United States as a test case, the influences of orbital mechanics and environmental factors on local‐ and national‐level emissions estimates are explored through a series of linear and multi‐linear regressions to predict each instrument's effective revisit time. Results suggest that, due to environmental factors, western regions of the U.S. are more likely to be constrained at a sub‐annual scale than eastern regions, with effective instrument revisit times <30 ${< } 30$ days. East coast cities have effective revisit times >30 ${ >} 30$ days; however, this varies seasonally. The characteristics of the instruments' orbits also vary the frequency of urban observations in both space and time.

Leveraging unique radar wind profiler network measurements across three Beijing during the record‐breaking 2023 summer (16 HW days), we quantify the turbulence dissipation rate (ε) variations under anticyclone driven HWs (hereafter called Type AC, 40% dominance). The mean ε in the PBL during HWs is elevated by ∼55%, demonstrating heat‐amplified turbulence. Divergent forcing regimes emerges–surface‐air temperature difference (Ts−Ta) governs PBL turbulence generation while vertical wind shear (VWS) dominates mechanical mixing aloft. Intriguingly, clouds play a dual role: they enhance VWS‐induced turbulence under normal conditions but reduce heat driven turbulence. These findings establish the first observational evidence of synoptic‐scale thermal‐dynamic decoupling in urban PBLs during extreme heat, providing mechanistic insights for improving megacity air quality forecasting and heat‐stress resilience strategies."

While previous studies have explored static (pixel‐based/spatial‐context‐based) environmental variables at discrete satellite observation times, their temporal dynamic information remains underutilized. Building on our earlier finding that retrieval errors depend on storm progression (event stage), we propose a new, physically interpretable mechanism for improving retrievals, namely, leveraging environmental variables' temporal dynamics as proxies for event stages. Using IMERG satellite product and GV‐MRMS as ground‐truth over CONUS (2018–2020), we first demonstrate robust coevolution patterns of environmental variables and satellite errors throughout events, and show that these variables' temporal gradients reliably infer event stages.

 Forests are essential for climate stability, yet elevated ozone levels-exacerbated by poorly understood impacts of shipping-related nitrogen oxides, stress these ecosystems. Here we combine field sampling at a coastal site southeast of Hong Kong and numerical air quality modelling to analyze nitrogen oxides dynamics in marine and forested environments. Results show that marine air masses influenced by shipping emissions have a higher formation potential for isoprene nitrate (a nitrogen oxides reservoir) than high- nitrogen oxides urban areas like Beijing and Hong Kong. Shipping-derived nitrogen oxides is transported and recycled deep into forests, triggering a cascade that enhances ozone formation. Shipping-linked isoprene nitrate accounts for ~20% of total recycled nitrogen oxides and increases ozone by up to 1 part per billion. The study reveals that nitrogen oxides distribution is more spatially uniform than previously recognized due to these processes, with implications for regional-scale ozone management.

This study uses large eddy simulation to examine the ε–Na relationship and derives an expression for ε from a minimal model to elucidate this relationship. Our findings indicate that as Na increases, ε initially decreases because aerosols weaken turbulence‐induced broadening more than condensational narrowing. However, as Na continues to rise, ε increases as aerosols weaken condensational narrowing more significantly than turbulence‐induced broadening.

 Biomass burning (BB) has a major impact on air quality and population health, with the brown carbon (BrC) of special concern as an important source of pollution and absorbing incoming radiation. The impact of BB was quantified in an urban area of Moscow, the northern gas-fuel heated European megacity, during warm and cold seasons. Real-time measurements of aerosol optical properties were performed by an aethalometer. Heating and non-heating periods are marked by Absorption Angstrom exponent (AAE) equal 1.1 and 1.2, spring agricultural and summer wildfires by 1.3 and 1.4, respectively. Light absorption babs of 10 ± 9 Mm−1 at 880 nm and 29 ± 27 Mm−1 at 370 nm was independent on heating activity. No significant seasonal difference was revealed by mass absorption coefficient for black carbon (BC) of 13.5 m2 g−1 and BrC of 0.9 m2 g−1. BC contribution to total absorption dominated in all wavelength ranges and seasons. During heating period, BrC contribution to total absorption at 370 nm (%babsBrC) was 16 ± 21 %, lower than in other European and Asian megacities where populations widely burn biomass and coal. It was 24 ± 31 % in spring due to agricultural fire impact and increased BB activity because of the population migration out of the city during the May holiday. Ryazan wildfire plumes affected Moscow, with babs(880) and babs(370) increase 1.7 and 2.4 times, respectively, with a high %babsBrC of 37 ± 59 %, and strong BrC absorption capacity in both day and nighttime. The relative absorption forcing of BrC compared to BC was estimated to range between 36.2 ± 1.1 % and 29.8 ± 2.7 % in ultraviolet and visible radiation range, respectively. Backward trajectory cluster and concentration weighted trajectory analyses revealed the regional origin of BB sources, coinciding with areas of observed wildfires. Collocated 12 h sampling and chemical composition analyses of BB tracers (levoglucosan and K+) identified the emission sources by significant correlations with BrC absorption. Four factors of BrC apportionment were identified via positive matrix factorization, showing contributions from fossil fuel combustion and secondary organic (82 %), and BB (18 %). As a result, regional population activity and spring and summer wildfires highlighted the uniqueness of Moscow as the northern gas-fuel heated megacity for BB impact studies in Europe and Asia."

 The eruption of the underwater volcano Hunga Tonga – Hunga Ha'apai (20.54° S, 178.3° W) on January 15, 2022, resulted in the first significant increase in the stratospheric water vapor content in the entire satellite observation era. This affects the radiation balance of the atmosphere, as well as its composition, including the ozone layer. In particular, in the winter stratospheric polar vortex, an increase in the water vapor concentration can lead to an increase in the threshold temperatures for the formation and surface area of polar stratospheric clouds (PSC), and, as a result, to stronger ozone destruction. Based on the M2-SCREAM reanalysis data, variations in ozone and ozone-active components were calculated for an ensemble of trajectories inside the polar vortex at altitudes of 17–22 km in the austral winter of 2023 and in the northern winter of 2023–2024 under conditions of increased water vapor content, as well as some previous winter seasons. Our calculations showed that ozone losses in Antarctica in 2023 did not increase compared to the winter of 2020 with the similar strong stratospheric polar vortex. One of the possible reasons could be the removal of excess water vapor due to condensation and subsequent sedimentation of large ice particles formed at the beginning of winter. In addition, in the Antarctic polar vortex for the considered winter seasons, chlorine reservoirs were almost completely transformed into the active form, and the increase in the surface area of the polar stratospheric clouds would not lead to additional release of active halogens and an increase in ozone depletion. In the Arctic increased water vapor in the early winter of 2023–2024 did not lead to significant ozone losses due to temperature increases caused by the minor sudden stratospheric warmings (SSW) in early January and two major SSWs in mid-January and early March 2024, and, as a result, to the continued warm polar stratosphere until the late winter season."

Using data from the satellite instruments IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer), AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder) and TROPOMI (Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument), along with the IMERG (Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM) precipitation product, we analyse the variability of H2O and HDO (given as δD) over West Africa at convective and seasonal scales. Key findings include the following: (1) monsoon convection over the Sahel induces an anti-correlation between H2O and δD in the mid-troposphere. This is due to dry intrusions from the Saharan upper troposphere into Sahelian squall lines, fostering rain evaporation and mid-tropospheric δD depletion. (2) Over the Guinea coast, convective precipitation is associated with moist and enriched signals, with surface evaporation from the tropical Atlantic reducing rain evaporation and δD depletion. (3) During the Sahelian monsoon peak, an anti-correlation between precipitation and δD forms year to year, indicating the amount effect in tropospheric water vapour. (4) In the Sahelian winter, when precipitation is minimal, {H2O, δD} signals point to mixing of dry air masses of different origins.This study is the first to apply comprehensive isotopic datasets from IASI, TROPOMI and AIRS to the WAM, demonstrating the utility of satellite-based {H2O, δD} pairs in detecting impacts of microphysical and dynamical processes on water vapour isotopic composition."

10.1029/2025GL115026,True,Geophysical Research Letters,该研究论文提出了一种新的热力学预测指标，即估计的砧状云外流稳定性（EAS），用于预测热带地区高云的覆盖范围。论文发现，传统的基于对流层顶的稳定性指标（UTS和SUT）可能低估了高空云层的稳定性控制作用。EAS通过寻找对流层上部的最小稳定性来更好地反映对流外流对高空云层的影响。研究表明，EAS与高空云覆盖率（HCC）呈强负相关，并且能更好地解释HCC的地理分布和时间变化。由于高空云的覆盖范围可以通过卫星遥感技术进行观测，并且云层对大气辐射平衡和气候变化有重要影响，因此该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，尤其是在卫星观测和大气成分分析方面。,"['high-level cloud coverage', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric stability', 'tropical convection', 'anvil outflow', 'lapse-rate tropopause', 'upper-tropospheric stability', 'geographic distribution of clouds', 'temporal variations of clouds']",Zhenquan Wang;Jian Yuan,A Novel Thermodynamical Predictor of Tropical High‐Cloud Area Coverage: Estimated Anvil‐Outflow Stability,"The stability at the lapse‐rate tropopause (LRT) was previously defined as the upper‐tropospheric stability (UTS and SUT) but might underestimate the stability control on high‐level clouds, since there is little direct connection between convective processes and the thermal stratification at the LRT. Here, a novel estimated anvil‐outflow stability (EAS) based on the minimum stability in the upper troposphere is proposed. At the Manus site, the results show that small and large values of the LRT‐based UTS and SUT both correspond to strong divergence and frequent occurrence of high‐level ice clouds. In contrast, smaller EAS corresponds to stronger convective outflows to produce likely more high‐level ice clouds, with a strong negative correlation. In tropics, EAS better explains the geographic distribution of high‐level cloud coverage (HCC) and its temporal variations than UTS and SUT. With a strong linear correlation, EAS is likely a simple useful predictor of HCC."

However, our understanding of atmospheric INPs, particularly their sources, emissions, and spatiotemporal variability, is incomplete. While the enhancement of atmospheric INP concentrations with rainfall has been previously shown, a mechanistic understanding of the process is lacking. Here, we link detailed precipitation observations with near‐surface atmospheric INP concentrations at a semiarid grassland site in Colorado. Considering the during‐precipitation air samples, INP concentrations positively correlate with cumulative rainfall kinetic energy and amount, suggesting that INP aerosolization is induced by raindrop and hailstone impact. By additionally analyzing the INP content of precipitation water, terrestrial source samples, and heat‐treated samples, we demonstrate that local plants are the most plausible source of rain‐induced INPs during a precipitation event. Should INPs aerosolized by precipitation rise to cloud height, they could influence cloud ice fraction and initiate precipitation resulting in an aerosol‐cloud‐precipitation feedback."

Particularly, we compare the mean El Niño/La Niña radiance anomalies in the tropics to the mean normal state over 2001–2022. Modifications to the energy budget's components (absorbed solar power and emitted thermal power) exceed 10% within the western and central Pacific—up to 20% for net power. Principal component analysis results further suggest that ENSO contributes approximately 34.0%, 44.9%, and 21.3% of the total variance in absorbed power, emitted power, and net power, respectively. Finally, a comparative study between observational data and the numerical simulations suggests that current climate models cannot quantitatively capture the signals of ENSO in Earth's REB even though some of them can reproduce dominant features. Our investigations based on the comprehensive observational datasets for Earth can serve as a foundation for exploring the impacts of large‐scale atmospheric and climate processes on the REBs of other planets."

This UNIPAR was integrated into the comprehensive air quality model with extensions (CAMx) to predict SOA mass and species over the Korean Peninsula during the Korea‐US Air Quality (KORUS‐AQ) campaign in 2016. CAMx‐UNIPAR v1.4 included 10 aromatics, alkanes with different carbon lengths and branching ratios, naphthalene, isoprene, terpene, and sesquiterpene. Simulations indicated that nearly 70% of the organic aerosol mass in Seoul was associated with SOA, and more than 50% of SOA was anthropogenic. Alkane SOA was the most prominent (35%–40%), followed by terpene SOA (15%–16%) and aromatic SOA (13%). During the haze event, a large concentration of SOA formed at both ground sites and high altitudes as measured from aircraft. Aromatic SOA was somewhat sensitive to humidity. Isoprene SOA was susceptible to humidity, but its contribution was small in South Korea. In Seoul, where the NOx was rich, the simulated terpene SOA increased with increasing NOx levels, but the anthropogenic SOA formation declined slightly. A clear diurnal pattern appeared for terpene SOA, showing high SOA formation at nighttime owing to the terpene reaction with nitrate radicals to form low‐volatile organonitrates. The reduced mixing height at nighttime limited concentrations of precursors and radicals in the high altitude, and this condition suppressed the biogenic SOA formation. Anthropogenic SOA was produced mainly in the daytime when OH radicals were abundant."

This study examines the spatiotemporal distribution, origin, and environmental impact of Cl− across China via compiling a comprehensive data set of submicron aerosol (PM1) detected by the aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS). In addition, we integrated high‐time resolution aerosol composition data from AMS at six representative sites in China for more detailed insights. The mass concentration of Cl− across China is notably high (1.9 ± 2.7 μg m−3) in comparison to the global average (0.3 ± 1.0 μg m−3), with a distinguished N–S pattern (North > South) and a distinct seasonality (winter > other seasons). Three categories of Cl− diurnal variations were classified, suggesting the primary combustion emission and gas/particle partitioning are the main drivers for the dynamic variation of Cl−. The good correlation between Cl− and combustion tracers corroborates the assertion that coal and biomass combustion are the main anthropogenic sources of Cl− based on emission inventory. Furthermore, the quantified environmental impacts of Cl− on ammonium balances, aerosol liquid water content, and hygroscopicity were systematically explored. In extreme cases, the Cl− can enhance 100% ALWC during polluted periods, signifying its key role in impacting the physiochemistry of aerosols. The mutual promotion between Cl− and other environment effects was also found. In summary, this study enhances our understanding of the distribution, sources, and environmental effects of Cl− across China, indicating that Cl− should be systematically considered in elucidating environment effect of fine particles."

After the eruption, the WV mixing ratio within the plume exceeds 30 ppmV and gradually reduces thereafter. Within 3 weeks, SO2 is converted to SO4 with a 1.0 μm global stratospheric aerosol optical depth (SAOD) of 0.0025. The SO2 mass should be scaled to 0.73–1.46 Mt to fit the observed SAOD. The 6‐month average global mean net instantaneous RF (IRF) of volcanic SAs at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) reaches −0.381 W/m2 for a 1.46‐Mt SO2 emission. The negative WV net IRF at TOA is at least one order of magnitude in absolute value smaller than that from SAs. The WV IRF at the bottom of the atmosphere is negligibly small and cannot cause discernible long‐term effects on ocean temperature on its own. Cooling in the lower stratosphere within the WV plume exceeds −1 K, and the WV adjusted (to stratospheric temperature) RF (ARF) is positive at TOA and the tropopause but is overwhelmed by negative SA forcing.

We also run individual areas-level Granger causality tests to determine the geographical distribution of the local causal links between the CO2 concentration and temperature. We find evidence of both causality directions at the global level, suggesting potential feedback between CO2 concentration and temperature. We also find that the global phenomenon results from a very fragmented geographical distribution of mostly unidirectional causality links at the local level. Considering the two results jointly, this work potentially provides insights into the connection between average trends of human-induced global warming and particular local conditions experiencing extreme meteorological conditions."

Organic carbon from smoke decreases hygroscopicity to levels more like those in continental than in polluted marine regions. Hygroscopicity changes at cloud level demonstrate how surface particles impact clouds in the region, affecting model representation of aerosol and cloud interactions in similar polluted marine regions with high organic carbon emissions. 
 This study characterizes the spatial and vertical nature of aerosol hygroscopicity in Southeast Asia and relates it to aerosol composition and sources. Aerosol hygroscopicity via the light scattering hygroscopic growth factor, f(RH), is calculated from the amplification of PM5 (particulate matter with a particle diameter, Dp, <5 µm) scattering measurements from <40 % to 82 % relative humidity during the Cloud, Aerosol, and Monsoon Processes Philippines Experiment (CAMP2Ex) between August and October 2019 over the northwest tropical Pacific. Median f(RH) is low (1.26 with lower to upper quartiles of 1.05 to 1.43) like polluted environments, due to the dominance of the mixture of organic carbon and elemental carbon. The f(RH) is lowest due to smoke from the Maritime Continent (MC) during its peak biomass burning season, coincident with high carbon monoxide concentrations (>0.25 ppm) and pronounced levels of accumulation-mode particles and organic mass fractions. The highest f(RH) values are linked to coarser particles from the West Pacific and aged biomass burning particles in the region farthest away from the MC, where f(RH) values are lower than typical polluted marine environments. Convective transport and associated cloud processing in these regions decrease and increase hygroscopicity aloft in cases with transported air masses exhibiting increased organic and sulfate mass fractions, respectively. An evaluation of the Community Atmosphere Model with Chemistry (CAM-chem) for cases of vertical transport showed the underrepresentation of organics, resulting in overestimated modeled aerosol hygroscopicity. These findings on aerosol hygroscopicity can help to improve aerosol representation in models and the understanding of cloud formation."

However, they can contribute to the formation of tropospheric O3 and secondary organic aerosols affecting our health. 
 3,3-dimethylbutanal (33DMbutanal, (CH3)3CCH2C(O)H) and 3,3-dimethylbutanone (33DMbutanone, (CH3)3CC(O)CH3) are carbonyl compounds that could play a key role in tropospheric chemistry. To better understand the effects of carbonyl compounds in the atmosphere, a kinetic and mechanistic study was conducted on the degradation of 33DMbutanal and 33DMbutanone with atmospheric oxidants (Cl atoms, OH and NO3 radicals). The kinetic experiments were performed at 710 ± 30 Torr and at room temperature (298 ± 5 K) using a relative method and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to monitor the reactions. The rate coefficients (k in units of cm3molec.-1s-1) obtained were kCl+33DMbutanal = (1.27 ± 0.08) × 10−10, kCl+33DMbutanone = (4.22 ± 0.27) × 10−11, and kOH+33DMbutanone = (1.26 ± 0.05) × 10−12.

The experiments are designed with the goal of answering science policy questions related to fires. The options for the multi-model approach, including inputs, outputs, and model setup, are discussed, and the official recommendations for the project are presented. 
 Open biomass burning has major impacts globally and regionally on atmospheric composition. Fire emissions include particulate matter, tropospheric ozone precursors, and greenhouse gases, as well as persistent organic pollutants, mercury, and other metals. Fire frequency, intensity, duration, and location are changing as the climate warms, and modelling these fires and their impacts is becoming more and more critical to inform climate adaptation and mitigation, as well as land management. Indeed, the air pollution from fires can reverse the progress made by emission controls on industry and transportation. At the same time, nearly all aspects of fire modelling – such as emissions, plume injection height, long-range transport, and plume chemistry – are highly uncertain. This paper outlines a multi-model, multi-pollutant, multi-regional study to improve the understanding of the uncertainties and variability in fire atmospheric science, models, and fires' impacts, in addition to providing quantitative estimates of the air pollution and radiative impacts of biomass burning. Coordinated under the auspices of the Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution, the international atmospheric modelling and fire science communities are working towards the common goal of improving global fire modelling and using this multi-model experiment to provide estimates of fire pollution for impact studies. This paper outlines the research needs, opportunities, and options for the fire-focused multi-model experiments and provides guidance for these modelling experiments, outputs, and analyses that are to be pursued over the next 3 to 5 years.

Over the past two decades, the lake's water levels have steadily dropped. Water conditions in the Sea, characterized by low oxygen and high nutrient levels, favor the production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S). This study investigates the connection between the Sea's changing conditions, particularly the worsening water quality, and H2S emissions using air quality and water quality data collected since 2013 and 2004, respectively. H2S concentrations often exceed California's air quality standards, particularly in areas near the Sea during summer months. Wind patterns substantially impact detection of H2S. When wind is blowing from the Sea toward communities with sensors, located to the northwest of the Sea, H2S is detected significantly more often. Current monitoring efforts underestimate the frequency and distribution of H2S that exceeds air quality standards. An air sensor deployed in shallow water over the Salton Sea by a community science program detected substantially higher concentrations of H2S, particularly when wind was blowing over exposed sediment and shallow water, suggesting that these are a significant and overlooked H2S source at the Salton Sea. These findings highlight the need for improved air quality monitoring and more effective environmental management policies to protect public health in the region.

 In order to enhance the forecasting of tropical cyclone (TC) precipitation, it is essential to gain a comprehensive understanding of the precipitation microphysics and kinematics occurring within the TC. This study elucidates a novel pathway of dynamic-thermodynamic-microphysics interaction between the eye and eyewall of TC by examining the distinctive raindrop distribution pattern in the eyewall of Super Typhoon Yagi (2024), as well as several other TCs. The variability of precipitation microphysics across different regions of Yagi is demonstrated by utilizing FY-3G satellite observations. While the statistical results are consistent with previous findings, for the first time, we have observed a distinctive circular morphology of numerous small raindrops, designated the “Nw ring”, on the inner side of the eyewall. In contrast to the previously documented azimuthal size sorting signature driven by cyclonic wind shear, the “Nw ring” feature is formed by the enhanced warm rain autoconversion and accretion processes occurring below the 0 °C isotherm in the eyewall. This primary pathway results in the efficient production of heavy/extreme precipitation within the eyewall. This study contributes to our understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for heavy/extreme precipitation in these powerful TC storms. It is recommended that numerical weather prediction model parameterization be improved to accurately simulate these unique microphysical features, with the aim of improving TC predictions and reducing the risk of TC-related disasters."

 A novel drone-based aerosol sampling system, integrated with a rotating cascade impactor, was developed to enable size-selective sampling of atmospheric particles at upper altitudes. The system features rotating impaction stages that enable particle deposition suitable for single-particle analysis. For the first time, this platform was combined with Raman microspectroscopy (RMS) and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to perform detailed physicochemical characterization of airborne particles, including submicron aerosols, across ground level and aloft. Applied during a high-pollution event, the methodology enabled the characterization of particle mixing states, chemical functional groups, and size-dependent features that may be associated with aerosol transformation mechanisms. Single-particle analysis showed that internally mixed particles in the coarse-mode size range (1.35–5.5 μm) accounted for 53 % of the total in the upper-level sample, exceeding single-component particles by 20 %, which suggests multiphase processing and aging. Among sulfate-containing coarse particles, CaSO4 was the dominant species (38 %), indicating secondary formation through heterogeneous reactions during long-range transport In the submicron range (<1 μm), nitrate particles dominated (77 %), attributed to freshly formed aerosols resulting from coastal air masses with limited aging. These results highlight the significance of integrating high-resolution vertical aerosol profiling into atmospheric observations, revealing differences not captured by ground-based measurements. Beyond the field findings, this study also demonstrates the utility of a lightweight, drone-mounted rotating cascade impactor system, which enables scalable, size-selective, and altitude-resolved single-particle sampling under atmospheric conditions. This integrated approach offers a novel and practical framework for advancing both aerosol instrumentation and our understanding of atmospheric particle dynamics."

Christopher,"An investigation of the impact of Canadian wildfires on US air quality using model, satellite, and ground measurements","Canadian wildfires in August 2018 significantly increased surface air pollution across the United States (US) – by up to 69 % in some areas. Using model, satellite, and ground measurements, the study highlights how weather patterns and long-range smoke transport drive pollution. The northwestern US was most affected by Canadian wildfire smoke, while the northeastern US experienced the least impact. These findings indicate the growing concern that wildfire smoke poses to air quality across the US. 
 Canadian wildfires transport large concentrations of particulate matter into the US, leading to various effects on the surface temperature, the radiation balance, and visibility and exacerbating pollution-related respiratory conditions. Using a combination of surface, satellite, and numerical models, this study quantifies the increase in surface fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the continental US due to long-range transported smoke from Canadian wildfires during a wildfire episode from 9–25 August 2018. As a widely used indicator of surface pollution levels, satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) can provide crucial information on columnar pollution mass. However, the daily spatial coverage of satellite AOD is restricted due to cloud cover. In order to quantify the daily changes in surface pollution, we fill in the AOD gaps by utilizing simulated 10 km spatial resolution AOD from a chemistry transport model (CTM). Meteorological variables influencing smoke transport were also integrated alongside the gap-filled AOD product to estimate surface PM2.5 using geographically weighted regression (GWR) and random forest (RF) models. The model with better performance was subsequently applied to quantify PM2.5 changes due to Canadian wildfires. To isolate the impact of Canadian wildfires, we calculate the surface PM2.5 ratio with and without Canadian fire sources by conducting two CTM simulations: one with Canadian wildfire emissions enabled and another with these emissions turned off. Our results show that Canadian wildfires caused a significant increase in surface PM2.5, contributing up to 28 µg m−3 (a 69 % increase) across different US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regions during the August 2018 wildfire event."

Bucsela,Sensitivity of climate–chemistry model simulated atmospheric composition to the application of an inverse relationship between NOx emission and lightning flash frequency,"Lightning plays a significant role in tropospheric chemistry by producing substantial amounts of nitrogen oxides. According to recent estimates, thunderstorms that produce a higher lightning frequency rate also produce less nitrogen oxide per flash. We implemented the dependency of nitrogen oxide production per flash on lightning flash frequency in a chemical atmospheric model. 
 Lightning-produced nitrogen oxides (LNOx = LNO + LNO2) are an important source of upper-tropospheric ozone. Typical parameterizations of LNOx in climate–chemistry models introduce a constant amount of NOx per flash or per flash type. However, recent satellite-based NO2 measurements suggest that the production of LNOx per flash depends on the lightning flash frequency. In this study, we implement a new parameterization of LNOx production per flash based on the lightning flash frequency in a climate–chemistry model to investigate the upper-limit implications for the chemical composition of the atmosphere. We find that a larger production of LNOx in weak thunderstorms leads to a larger mixing ratio of NOx in the lower and middle troposphere, as well as to a lower mixing ratio of NOx in the upper troposphere. The mixing ratios of O3, CO, HOx, HNO3, and HNO4 in the troposphere are influenced by the simulated changes in LNOx. Our findings indicate a larger release of nitrogen oxides from lightning in the lower and middle atmosphere, producing a slightly better agreement with the measurements of tropospheric ozone at a global scale. In turn, we obtain a small decrease in the lifetime of methane and carbon monoxide, ranging between 0.7 % and 3.4 %."

The paper also discusses the importance of combining in situ and remote sensing measurements for a comprehensive understanding of atmospheric processes. 
 This paper describes the aerosol in situ laboratory at the CNR-IMAA (Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche – Istituto di Metodologie per l'Analisi Ambientale) Atmospheric Observatory (CIAO) in southern Italy, outlining its configuration and detailing each instrument and sampling line. CIAO has been collecting observations of atmospheric components since 2000.

In 2018, a significant upgrade was started to enhance the observational capability of the observatory by adding aerosol in situ instruments, with the objective to push new research boundaries for aerosol particle characterization and multi-instrument combined approaches. Here, we describe each technical implementation step for building up an extensive aerosol in situ laboratory compliant with ACTRIS (Aerosol, Clouds and Trace gases Research Infrastructure) standard operating procedures. Starting from scratch, the long path was initiated in 2018 with the design of the laboratory in terms of instruments, container layout, inlets, and sampling lines, as well as required time and interactions with experts in the field.

This methodology considers the interference of atmospheric temperature, humidity, and surface temperature with sulfur dioxide detection and retrieval, laying the groundwork for developing a more accurate and flexible volcanic sulfur dioxide retrieval algorithm under different atmospheric conditions. 
 The Hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder Type II (HIRAS-II) aboard the Fengyun 3E (FY-3E) satellite provides valuable data on the vertical distribution of atmospheric states. However, effectively extracting quantitative atmospheric information from the observations is challenging due to the large number of hyperspectral sensor channels, inter-channel correlations, associated observational errors, and susceptibility of the results to influence by trace gases. This study explores the potential of FY-3E/HIRAS-II in atmospheric loadings of SO2 from volcanic eruptions. A methodology for selecting SO2-sensitive channels from the large number of hyperspectral channels recorded by FY-3E/HIRAS-II is presented. The methodology allows for the selection of SO2-sensitive channels that contain similar information on variations in atmospheric temperature and water vapor for minimizing the influence of atmospheric water vapor and temperature on SO2. A sensitivity study shows that the difference in brightness temperature between the experimentally selected SO2-sensitive channels and the background channels' efficiency removes interference signals from surface temperature, atmospheric temperature, and water vapor during SO2 detection and inversion. A positive difference between near-surface atmospheric temperature and surface temperature enables the infrared band to capture more SO2 information in the lower and middle layers. The efficiency of FY-3E/HIRAS-II SO2-sensitive channels in quantitatively monitoring volcanic SO2 is demonstrated using data from the 29 April 2024 eruption of Mount Ruang in Indonesia. Using FY-3E/HIRAS-II measurements, the spatial distribution and qualitative information of volcanic SO2 is easily observed. The channel selection can significantly enhance the computational efficiency while maintaining the accuracy of SO2 detection and retrieval, despite the large volume of data."

By comparing results with independent AirCore and aircraft in situ measurements, the analysis validates retrieval accuracy and quantifies uncertainties. The findings highlight the benefits of updated spectroscopy and improved a priori profiles and highlight consistent agreement with in situ data. 
 Atmospheric methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are potent greenhouse gases with significant impacts on climate change. Accurate measurement of their atmospheric abundance is essential for understanding their sources, sinks, and the impact of human activities on the atmosphere. Ground-based high-resolution Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) observations, employed by collaborative international initiatives like the Infrared Working Group (IRWG) within the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC), play a vital role in retrieving the atmospheric amounts of these gases. Network-wide consistent data products rely on consistent observations and retrievals. Recent developments in spectroscopy, a priori data, and retrieval software and techniques underscore the necessity to revisit the current retrieval strategies for all NDACC/IRWG species. This study investigates various retrieval strategies of CH4 and N2O utilizing high-resolution FTIR observations in Boulder, Colorado, and compares them with unique airborne in situ measurements. The initial focus is on characterizing retrieval differences across spectroscopy databases. While it is challenging to identify the best retrievals purely based on spectroscopy, as they produce similar outcomes, notable differences in profile shapes and magnitudes underscore the importance of independent validation. Specifically, when multiyear independent nearby AirCore and aircraft in situ profile measurements are used to evaluate vertical distributions and biases in partial columns, they reveal excellent agreement in relative differences with FTIR retrievals and thereby strengthen confidence in the assessment. The final optimized retrievals for CH4 and N2O are presented, incorporating quantitative fitting results and comparisons of vertical profiles as well as partial and total columns. We find that employing a priori profiles using the latest simulations of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) enhances accuracy relative to in situ profiles. While the HITRAN 2020 spectroscopic database is effective for N2O, ATM 2020 provides better results for CH4, with a slight improvement observed when paired with the water vapor line list from the German Aerospace Center (DLR); however, this improvement may be site-dependent. Regarding regularization, both first-order Tikhonov and optimal estimation produce comparable outcomes, as long as the fitted profile degrees of freedom remain between 2 and 2.5. Correspondingly, profile result comparisons yield biases of −0.08 ± 0.38 % and 0.89 ± 0.28 % for tropospheric and stratospheric layers of CH4 relative to AirCore, respectively, whereas they yield a bias of 0.39 ± 0.42 % for aircraft comparisons in the troposphere. For N2O, the bias in the troposphere using aircraft measurements  is approximately 0.18 ± 0.2 %. Uncertainty budgets combining random and systematic sources are provided. Random errors, mainly stemming from temperature profile uncertainties and measurement noise,  dominate in the troposphere for both gases, with a retrieval random error of 0.5 %. Systematic errors primarily arise from HITRAN-based spectral line parameters, predominantly the line intensity and air-broadened half-width. These findings contribute to advancing our understanding of atmospheric composition and will support the improvement of a harmonized approach for all IRWG/NDACC sites."

Jacob,Integrated Methane Inversion (IMI) 2.0: an improved research and stakeholder tool for monitoring total methane emissions with high resolution worldwide using TROPOMI satellite observations,"Reducing emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, is a top policy concern for mitigating anthropogenic climate change. The Integrated Methane Inversion (IMI) is an advanced, cloud-based software that translates satellite observations into actionable emissions data. Here we present IMI version 2.0 with vastly expanded capabilities. These updates enable a wider range of scientific and stakeholder applications from individual basin to global scales with continuous emissions monitoring. 
 Satellite observations of atmospheric methane are a powerful resource for quantifying methane emissions over any region worldwide. The inverse methods needed to infer emissions from these observations require a high level of scientific and technical expertise as well as access to large computational and data processing resources. The Integrated Methane Inversion (IMI) is an open-access cloud computing tool designed for researchers and non-expert users to obtain total sector-resolved methane emissions worldwide at up to 0.25°×0.3125° (≈25×25km2) resolution by analytical inversion of TROPOMI satellite observations with closed-form error characterization. Here we describe IMI version 2.0 with vastly expanded capabilities relative to the original version. Major developments include (i) a new blended TROPOMI+GOSAT dataset for higher data quality, (ii) order-of-magnitude speed-up in Jacobian matrix construction, (iii) improved error characterization through use of super-observations, (iv) improved methods for initial and boundary conditions, (v) adaptive spatial resolution linked to observational information content, (vi) incorporation of point source observations in state vector construction, (vii) option to optimize tropospheric OH (main methane sink), (viii) global inversion capability, (ix) Kalman filter option for continuous monitoring of emissions, (x) updated default prior emission inventories, (xi) option for lognormal error probability density functions to characterize emissions, (xii) additional output visualization (sectoral emissions, temporal variability), and (xiii) containerization to facilitate download to local computing facilities and operation as part of the US GHG Center. A 2023 annual inversion with 28 d temporal resolution for the contiguous US (CONUS) is presented as a demonstration of IMI 2.0 capabilities."

Carslaw,Highly Disaggregated Particulate and Gaseous Vehicle Emission Factors and Ambient Concentration Apportionment Using a Plume Regression Technique,"In this study, vehicle plume measurements from over 27,500 vehicles were made using continuous fast-response instruments located at the curbside for nitrogen oxides (NOx), particle number (PN), and black carbon (BC) in the city of Milan, Italy. A recently developed plume regression technique is further enhanced to calculate highly disaggregated emission factors for a wide range of vehicle classes. The data reveal a strong improvement in the emissions performance for NOx from passenger cars on going from laboratory to on-road testing. However, for emissions of PN and BC, disaggregation by vehicle manufacturers for diesel passenger cars highlights anomalously high emissions from some manufacturers. Emissions from one manufacturer, which predate on-road testing, are up to a factor of 4 higher than the average of other manufacturers and are among those being scrutinized in several European countries through enhanced periodic technical inspections (PTI) that for the first time considered PN. Near-road concentration source apportionment reveals a broader range of vehicle types contributing to PN and BC compared to NOx. The top three contributors to NOx concentrations account for 57% of total NOx but only 28–29% of total PN and BC. These findings have implications for policies such as low-emission zones of the type adopted in Milan and elsewhere in the world. The combination of curbside measurements and plume regression allows for both high-resolution emission measurements and ambient concentration source apportionment."

Chan,Evidence on Interfacial Reaction Governing NO2 Hydrolysis in Deliquesced Aerosol Particles,"Heterogeneous NO2 hydrolysis forms nitrate and nitrous acid but is believed to proceed slowly in the atmosphere. Accelerated reactions in microdroplets have gained significant attention, but whether or not NO2 hydrolysis is accelerated in deliquesced particles remains unclear. We address the gap by measuring size-dependent NO2 hydrolysis rates in sulfate- or halide-containing droplets. Results show that the reaction rates in Na2SO4 droplets increased by 25-fold as the particle radius decreased from ∼40 to ∼4 μm. An even higher enhancement of ∼100 times was observed in NaCl and NaI particles, likely due to the NO2–halide interactions. The enhancement in NaBr particles, however, was comparable to that in Na2SO4 particles. Kinetic modeling results illustrate that the accelerated reactions are due to ∼6 orders of magnitude enhancement factor (EF) of surface reaction rates over bulk-phase reaction rates. Compared to Na2SO4 particles, the surface reaction rates increase by factors of 2.3, 1.5, and 4.4 in NaCl, NaBr, and NaI particles, respectively. Under ambient conditions, EFs can increase by up to 108, corresponding to the ambient nitrate production rates of >1 μg m–3 h–1. The rates are comparable to those of N2O5 hydrolysis and OH + NO2 reaction pathways, making NO2 hydrolysis a crucial source of reactive nitrogen species."

Prather,Calibrating the Tropospheric Air and Ozone Mass,"We divide the atmosphere into distinct spheres based on their physical, chemical, and dynamical traits. In deriving chemical budgets and climate trends, which differ across spheres, we need clearly defined boundaries. Our primary spheres are the troposphere and stratosphere (∼99.9% by mass), and the boundary between them is the tropopause. Every global climate‐weather model has one or more methods to calculate the lapse rate tropopause, but these involve subjective choices and are known to fail near the sub‐tropical jets and polar regions. Age‐of‐air tracers clock the effective time‐distance from the tropopause, allowing unambiguous separation of stratosphere from troposphere in the chaotic jet regions. We apply a global model with synthetic tracer e90 (90‐day e‐folding), focusing on ozone and temperature structures about the tropopause using ozone sonde and satellite observations. We calibrate an observation‐consistent tropopause for e90 using tropics‐plus‐midlatitudes and then apply it globally to calculate total tropospheric air‐mass and tropopause ozone values. The tropopause mixing barrier for the current UCI CTM is identified by a transition in the vertical transport gradient to stratospheric values of 15 days km−1, corresponding to an e90 tropopause at 81 ± 2 ppb with a global tropospheric air mass of 82.2 ± 0.3%. The best e90 tropopause based on sonde pressures is 70–80 ppb; but that for ozone is 80–90 ppb, implying that the CTM tropopause ozone values are too large. This approach of calibrating an age‐of‐air tropopause can be readily applied to other models and possibly used with observed age‐of‐air tracers like sulfur hexafluoride."

In total, 196 methane ventilation days were recorded, contributing to atmospheric methane increases by 15.7 ppb d−1. Methane ventilation is dominated by sea ice opening and is greatly enhanced by coastal upwelling‐induced mixing. The methane concentration increases by 5.5[3.3, 7.8] ppb d−1 with every 10% decrease in ice concentration. The average contribution of upwelling is 0.84[−1.1, 2.7] ppb d−1, with the greatest contribution from warm Atlantic Water (AW). One such AW event can lead to an increase of methane up to 10[−2, 22] ppb. With further ice retreat, upwelling‐induced oceanic methane emissions may occur widely and should be fully considered."

The emission factors (EFs) of NACs primary emissions are much higher from biomass burning (BB) than coal combustion (CC). The EFs of measured NACs species mostly increased during the aging process except some species in CC. Photochemical aging significantly enhanced the absorbance of ∑NACs, but through different mechanisms between BB and CC. In BB, increasing production of 4‐nitrocatechol (4NC), 4‐nitroguaiacol (4NG), and 4‐methyl‐5‐nitrocatechol (4M5NC) through nitrogen addition reactions during aging process enhanced the NACs light absorption. In CC, increasing 4NC and 4‐methyl‐2,6‐dinitrophenol from nitrogen addition reactions as well as indirect photolysis of 4NG and 4M5NC with ·OH to form organic intermediates both increase light absorption.

 Childhood respiratory diseases remain a major global health concern, with school-centered exposures to air pollution and extreme temperatures posing significant risks. We conducted a spatiotemporal stratified multi-city, school-based design to evaluate underexplored risk patterns of fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤1 µm, nitrate, sulfate, ammonium, chloride, black carbon, and temperature exposures including daily mean, extremes, and short-term variability. The analysis included 265,076 pneumonia and/or tracheitis cases among schoolchildren in Jiangsu Province, China. We observed significant urban–rural disparities and spatial clustering in air pollution and temperature variation. Cumulative exposure to all pollutants was positively associated with increased risk of illness-related absences, with stronger effects observed in urban schools and during low-temperature conditions overall. Boys showed higher initial sensitivity to air pollution, while girls exhibited greater vulnerability after 10–14 days. Notably, urban children were most affected by combined exposures to low temperature-high pollution, whereas rural children experienced greater combined risks under high-temperature conditions. In contrast, short-term temperature variability contributed minimally to the observed health effects. These findings support the development of early warning systems for composite exposures, informed by exposure–risk profiles, to enable timely school intervention and protect schoolchildren’s respiratory health. Non-optimal temperatures are associated with higher risk of air pollution related illnesses in schoolchildren in Jiangsu Province, China, according to a school-centered analysis of classroom attendance, air pollution, and temperature."

 Trans-boundary black carbon aerosols from South Asia profoundly affects the climate and cryosphere of the Tibetan Plateau. However, the integration effects of black carbon on radiative forcing and precipitation, as well as on solid water storage remain to a large extent unknow. This study presents the systematic assessment of both direct melting and indirect precipitation mass supply effects on glaciers for the 2007-2016 period. Key findings reveal that South Asian black carbon deposition reduced glacial albedo, increasing melt by 7.5%, while black carbon-induced precipitation reduction caused an additional 6.1% mass loss. Combined, these effects drove 33.7% solid water storage decreases in the Himalayas. The excess ice-loss poses a critical threat to water resource for downstream population centers in Indus and Ganges-Brahmaputra exorheic basins, with reductions of approximately 18.9% and 25.7%, respectively. This evidence highlights the urgent need for regional black carbon mitigation strategies to safeguard water security and ecosystem stability.

Arellano,Source contribution to ozone pollution during June 2021 fire events in Arizona: insights from WRF-Chem-tagged O3 and CO,"We assess the contributions of fire and anthropogenic emissions to O3 levels in Phoenix, Arizona, during a period of intense heat and drought conditions. We find that fire exacerbates O3 pollution and that interactions between weather, climate, and air chemistry are important to consider. This has implications for activities related to formulating emission reduction strategies in areas that are currently understudied yet becoming relevant due to reports of increasing global aridity. 
 This study quantifies wildfire contributions to O3 pollution in Arizona, relative to local and regional emissions. Using WRF-Chem with O3 and CO tags, we analyzed emissions during June 2021, a period of drought, extreme heat, and wildfires. Our results show that background O3 accounted for ∼50 % of total O3, while local anthropogenic emissions contributed 24 %–40 %, consistent with recent estimates for Phoenix. During peak smoke conditions, fire-related O3 ranged from 5 to 23 ppb (5 %–21 % of total O3), averaging 15 ppb (15 %). These estimates were compared with model sensitivity tests excluding fire emissions, which confirmed the spatiotemporal pattern of fire-driven O3, though the model underestimated the magnitude by a factor of 1.4. The results further demonstrate that wildfires exacerbate O3 exceedances over urban areas. Our analysis reveals key differences in O3 sources: Phoenix's O3 was mainly driven by local emissions, while Yuma's was heavily influenced by transboundary transport from California and Mexico. Wildfires not only boosted O3 formation but also altered winds and atmospheric chemistry in Phoenix and downwind areas. O3 increases along the smoke plume resulted from NOX and volatile organic compound (VOC) interactions, with fire-driven O3 forming in NOX-limited zones near the urban interface. Downwind, O3 chemistry shifted, shaped by higher NOX in central Phoenix and more VOCs in suburban and rural areas. Winds weakened and turned westerly near fire-affected areas. This study highlights the value of high-resolution modeling with tagging to disentangle wildfire and regional O3 sources, particularly in arid regions, where extreme heat intensifies O3 pollution, making accurate source attribution essential."

The CO2 lasers required are bulky and maintenance-intensive, limiting their use in the field. We have developed a compact solid-state IR laser that is easily aligned with the particle beam. Mass spectra and hit rates are similar to those of the CO2 laser. For combined characterization of organic and inorganic particle compositions, both lasers are superior to conventional single UV pulses. 
 Recent advancements in single-particle mass spectrometry (SPMS) have enabled the detection of aromatic hydrocarbons at the individual particle level in conjunction with inorganic/refractory particle components. However, the laser desorption (LD) of organic material from particles prior to their ionization in a two-step process necessitates pulsed infrared lasers with adequate pulse energy that can be irregularly triggered on detected particles. Pulsed CO2 lasers with a 10.6 µm wavelength have been traditionally utilized, yet these lasers are bulky and costly and require regular maintenance, including gas exchange or a continuous laser gas supply. In this study, we present the application of a prototype solid-state laser based on an erbium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Er:YAG) crystal, emitting long pulses of 200 µs at 3 µm wavelength as a compact, cost-effective, and user-friendly alternative for LD. We directly compared the new laser with a commonly used CO2 laser and found similar performance in LD for both laboratory particles and ambient air experiments. With the exception of slightly increased fragmentation observed with the CO2 laser due to its beam profile, no qualitative differences were noted in the resulting mass spectra. Additionally, we compared a novel two-step ionization (LD-REMPI–LDI) with the conventional single-step LDI regarding the potential to detect polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and inorganics in laboratory and field experiments. The combined methods demonstrated superior performance in the detection of PAHs, for both the CO2 and the new Er:YAG laser. In addition to its higher sensitivity and lower fragmentation for PAHs when compared to single-step LDI, it is less dependent on the particle matrix, sharing the benefits of traditional two-step methods but extending its capability to combine PAH measurements with the LDI-based detection of inorganic particle compounds."

We present a new 3-year dataset of NO2 vertical profiles in Toronto, Canada, and evaluate it using NO2 from satellite and surface monitoring networks and simulations by an air quality forecast model. We quantify and explain the differences among the datasets to provide information that can be used to understand NO2 variability. 
 The purpose of this work is to derive new nitrogen dioxide (NO2) vertical profiling data products from Pandora spectrometers and investigate the factors contributing to the bias of this dataset relative to established ground-based and spaceborne datasets. Possible applications of the NO2 vertical profile dataset include air quality monitoring and satellite validation studies. We explore the application of the optimal estimation method to Pandora multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements to retrieve vertical profile information for NO2. We use the Heidelberg Profile (HeiPro) retrieval algorithm to derive, for the first time, NO2 profiles and partial columns (0–4 km) from Pandora MAX-DOAS measurements from  2018–2020 from Downsview, a suburban neighbourhood in the northern end of Toronto, Canada, that is subject to local traffic emissions and urban influences. Validation of the new dataset was done via comparison with official Pandora direct-Sun measurements, in situ observations, satellite data, and an air quality forecasting model. We find that, for tropospheric partial column comparisons, the HeiPro dataset has a positive mean relative bias to Pandora direct-Sun (61 ± 9.7 %) and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI; 37 ± 51 %) observations, as well as the Global Environmental Multiscale–Modelling Air quality and Chemistry (GEM-MACH) model output (67 ± 7.1 %), with similar seasonal and diurnal cycles in the bias with Pandora direct-Sun and GEM-MACH data. Contributing factors to the large bias of HeiPro-to-Pandora direct-Sun measurements were investigated, and NO2 heterogeneity, combined with differences between direct-Sun and multi-axis viewing geometries, was found to contribute a maximum of 52 % of the total relative bias during morning measurement times. For surface NO2 comparisons, we find that HeiPro measurements capture the magnitude and diurnal variability in surface NO2 reasonably well (mean relative bias to in situ surface NO2 of −9.7 ± 7.5 %) but are biased low compared to GEM-MACH (mean relative bias of −37 ± 2.4 %). Compared to HeiPro, the GEM-MACH model profiles are biased high in the lower boundary layer and biased low in the free troposphere."

This study employed multiaxis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) technology with a coupled radiative transfer model-machine learning (RTM-ML) framework to retrieve high-resolution aerosol optical properties in Shanghai. Retrievals indicated vertically decreasing aerosols, peaking in the upper atmosphere in the summer and in the lower atmosphere in the winter. Aerosol hygroscopicity followed similar seasonal patterns but increased with the altitude. Multifactor driving ML models and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) were used to investigate the drivers to aerosol variation. Results indicated that emissions, east–west transport, and atmospheric oxidation were the main drivers of aerosols below 0.5 km. Above 0.5 km, humidity and atmospheric oxidation became dominant, suggesting that hygroscopic growth and secondary aerosol formation were more prominent. North–south transport also significantly influenced aerosol distribution within 0.5 to 1.6 km. Meteorological normalization emphasized that emission reduction can effectively lower aerosols in the lower atmosphere, while enhanced atmospheric oxidation promoted secondary aerosol formation, particularly in the upper atmosphere. These findings advance the understanding of multiple factors in shaping the vertical aerosol distributions and highlight that emission reduction strategies for addressing compound pollution should be conceived with a multidimensional and multifactorial understanding."

Styrene-like compounds are special aromatics, as they can react with the ozone to generate phenyl-substituted sCIs (C6H5CHOO), yet no prior study has directly characterized such sCIs. This study took styrene and trans-β-methylstyrene as proxies for styrene-like compounds. Matrix isolation combined with infrared spectroscopy technology was applied to capture anti- and syn-C6H5CHOO at 972 and 930 cm–1, respectively. Quantum chemical calculations enabled the identification of intermediates and verified the reactivity of sCIs’ unimolecular decomposition and bimolecular reactions with water vapor. Besides the reported organic peroxy radical (RO2) + sCIs + hydroperoxy radical (HO2) reactions, oligomers formed via RO2 + sCIs + R′O2, HO2 + sCIs + HO2/R′O2, and highly oxygenated RO2 + sCIs + HO2/R′O2 reactions were also proposed based on chamber experiments. At higher relative humidity, C6H5CHOO-related oligomers emerged as the most prominent aerosol components. The insertion of C6H5CHOO units was found to dramatically reduce oligomer volatility and enhance oligomer toxicity. The lower susceptibility to removal by water vapor suggests more competitive particle generation and even nucleation involving C6H5CHOO, providing insights into urban air pollution mechanisms and the identification of toxic compounds in particles."

It paves the globe with hexagons and 12 pentagons of similar surface areas rather than with regular longitude‐latitude rectangles. It is available in a complete, nonlinear version and in a linearized configuration for use in variational atmospheric inversions. It runs on graphics processing units like the previous version. The previous advection approach and physical parameterizations have been kept while the code has been restructured for better numerical efficiency. The change of mesh was made necessary by the evolution of the parent LMDz model, but the technical and scientific evaluation of the new version with a roughly constant number of cells shows some interesting advantages. This evaluation is based on an 11‐year simulation of sulfur hexafluoride and on a 10‐year atmospheric inversion assimilating column‐averaged dry air mole fractions of carbon dioxide (CO2) retrieved from measurements of NASA's second Orbiting Carbon Observatory. As it is used in variational inversion and at 90‐km resolution with 79 layers in the vertical, we find that the new offline model is twice as fast. Further, it shows improved interhemispheric transport, some small improvements in terms of inferred (posterior) atmospheric concentrations and small differences in terms of inferred surface fluxes compared to the previous version. These assets allowed it to be commissioned in its 90‐km configuration for the operational CO2 inversions of the European Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service."

This weakens its contribution to the HONO source and atmospheric oxidation capacity. 
 Heterogeneous reactions of NO2 on particulate matter have been considered an important source of HONO (Nitrous acid) in the troposphere, whereas its contribution is controversial due to the lack of uptake coefficient of NO2 (γNO2) on the surfaces of ambient particulate matter (PM). Here we investigate the the γNO2 to form HONO and its evolution based on long-term comprehensive field observations (2019–2023) in Beijing and a random forest model with Shapley additive explanations. The γNO2 on ambient PM is on the order of 10−6, decreasing markedly from 3.07 ± 5.99 × 10−6 in 2019 to 1.43 ± 3.22 × 10−6 in 2023. This decrease is driven by the increase in aerosol pH, linked to increased ratio of NH4NO3 to (NH4)2SO4, resulting from an unbalanced desulfurization and denitrification. This study implies that the role of the heterogeneous reaction of NO2 on aerosol surfaces in HONO production is declining in Beijing, providing valuable insights into the atmospheric chemistry in urban environments. Long-term observations show that a rising fraction of ammonium nitrate in PM2.5 reduces aerosol acidity, suppressing the heterogeneous conversion from NO2 to HONO. This weakens its contribution to the HONO source and atmospheric oxidation capacity."

 High ozone (O3) pollution has been found to rebound in China after 2020. Given its adverse impacts on human health, air quality, and climate, it is imperative to identify the underlying causes of this deteriorating O3 pollution. Here, a case study was conducted in Wuhu, an O3-polluted city in the Yangtze River Delta region, during 2020–2023. A marked increase in O3 concentration was observed, which could be partly due to insufficient reduction in nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO+NO2) emissions. Machine learning models revealed that meteorological condition contributed 27.3 % ± 4.2 % to high O3 concentration and that relative humidity (RH) and temperature exerted interactive effects on O3 formation. Elevated temperature could enhance the negative relationship between RH and O3, while high RH could weaken the positive effects of temperature on O3 formation. Utilizing an observation-based box model, we determined that O3 formation in Wuhu was mainly controlled by volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Alkenes, aromatics and oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) were identified as the primary precursors driving high O3 events. Notably, the relative incremental reactivities of OVOCs significantly increased during O3 pollution periods and became the largest contributor to O3 formation, highlighting their importance in forming high O3 concentration. Furthermore, O3 formation sensitivity changed dynamically with the evolution of O3 pollution, necessitating a phased-precursor-control strategy during periods of elevated O3 formation. This study underscores the crucial role of meteorological condition in driving high O3 events and provides a specific precursor control scheme to mitigate urban high O3 pollution."

 Measurements of absorption optical properties (σap,λ, AAE) and PM10 concentrations were conducted near the rice fields of L'Albufera Natural Park (Eastern Spain) with the aim of assessing light absorption by secondary BrC generated from the burning of rice straw residues. Sampling was performed in autumn 2023. The measurement period was divided into three sub-periods (P1, P2 and P3) depending on the number of burning spots and the prevailing weather conditions. P2 was the period most affected by biomass burning (BB) events. During this period, hourly values of σap,λ and AAE were above 100 Mm−1 and 2.0 and BrC absorption was higher than BC absorption in the UV spectral range. Secondary BrC concentrations were estimated using the EC-tracer method, and the R-squared (MRS) and 25 % percentile (P25) approaches were applied to the determination of (σap,λ/BC880)pri. Secondary BrC concentrations calculated by the P25 method were significantly higher than those obtained by the MRS approach for P2, which lead to σBrC-SEC values four times higher when the P25 method was used. The differences in the results obtained by both procedures were attributed to the formation of secondary BrC generated from the rapid oxidation of semi-volatile organic aerosols emitted by BB. The contribution of this secondary BrC to light absorption by BrC at 370 nm was 47 % for P2."

However, smoke management is often considered a barrier to prescribed fire. Additionally, climate change will likely affect the frequency of acceptable meteorological conditions for prescribed burning, potentially restricting the use of the practice. Here, we examine the air quality impacts from prescribed fire and wildfire in the Southeastern U.S., the populations affected by smoke in the region, and how these impacts may change under climate change. We rely on projections of wildfire burn area and climate-driven shifts in the frequency of meteorological conditions adequate for prescribed burning, as well as a survey of Southeastern land managers investigating their anticipated response to these changes. Based on this information, we use chemical transport modeling to assess the contributions of wildfire and prescribed fire to air pollution, and project how smoke impacts may vary due to climate change and different land manager responses. We find that prescribed fire is responsible for a significant fraction of regional particulate matter pollution. Populations exposed to the most smoke tend to have higher fractions of people of color and low income. Depending on how land managers respond to changes in atmospheric conditions under climate change, prescribed fire smoke may decrease slightly in the areas with the heaviest burning or increase across much of the Southeast. Projections also show that climate-driven changes in wildfire and prescribed burning may impact compliance with recently updated air quality standards. The analysis assesses the potential consequences of climate change on air pollution over a region in which wildland fire is extensively managed, providing insight into land management strategies that call for increased application of prescribed fire."

These cirrus clouds are found to have a warming effect on the atmosphere over their whole lifetime. Thin cirrus that originate from land origin convection warm more than those of ocean origin. Moreover, if the lifetime of these cirrus clouds increase, the warming they exert over their whole lifetime also increases. These results help us understand how these clouds might change in a future climate. 
 The lifetime of cirrus clouds from deep convection plays an important role in determining their overall cloud radiative effect (CRE). The net CRE of cirrus clouds from deep convection is close to zero over their whole lifetime. This CRE is the result of a near-cancellation of a large shortwave (SW) cooling and large longwave (LW) warming, such that small changes in cirrus properties have the potential to produce a significant net radiative effect. Changes in the atmospheric and sea surface temperature structure, along with changes in anthropogenic aerosol, have been hypothesised to impact the lifetime of detrained cirrus clouds, altering this radiative balance. Constraining the potential CRE response to changes in cirrus lifetime is therefore vital to understand the strength of these proposed climate forcings and feedbacks.This paper tracks the evolution of detrained cirrus clouds along trajectories from deep convection. The total cirrus CRE in the tropics is found to be warming, at 11.2 ± 0.4 W m−2. It is found that cirrus clouds along trajectories from oceanic origin convection have a warming CRE of 10.0 ± 0.4 W m−2. In contrast, cirrus clouds along trajectories from land convection have a warming of 15.9 ± 0.7 W m−2 throughout their lifetime. This contrast is predominantly due to differences in the diurnal cycle of the initial convection over land and ocean.A proposed extension to the lifetime of the detrained cirrus leads to changes in the total cirrus CRE in the tropics. In all cases, doubling the lifetime of the detrained cirrus leads to an increase in the total cirrus CRE of 0.6 ± 0.1 W m−2. Whilst there is uncertainty in the strength of mechanisms responsible for a change in cirrus lifetime, this work provides an important constraint on the impact that any potential lifetime extension may have."

A comparison of char and soot in fine particles in megacity Beijing and its southwest upwind rural site, Gucheng, during winter haze in 2018 was conducted, utilizing dual‐carbon isotope constrained positive matrix factorization for source apportionment. BC concentrations in Gucheng were twice those in Beijing, with char accounting for 90% of BC at both sites. Despite similar char/soot ratios, source contributions of char and soot differed significantly between the two sites. Fossil fuel combustion emerged as the major source of char in both Beijing (82.1%) and Gucheng (72.1%), with higher contributions to soot (96.3% and 86.2%, respectively). Heavy oil combustion (51.2%) was the predominant source of char in Beijing, the char/soot values from which had been previously underestimated. Traffic‐related sources were identified as the principal contributors to soot in Beijing (51.2%). Residential coal combustion was the largest contributor to both char (35.3%) and soot (47.6%) in Gucheng, whereas biomass burning contributions (∼10% higher than Beijing) were also non‐negligible. Our findings underscore the issue of elevated BC concentrations in the Beijing‐Tianjin‐Hebei region during winter haze and the complexity of char and soot sources in urban environments.

We developed a new method to create long-term cloud radiative kernels to improve the accuracy of measurements of sunlight reaching the surface, which significantly reduces errors. Findings suggest that prior estimates of cloud cooling effects may have been overstated, emphasizing the need for better strategies to manage climate change impacts in the Arctic. 
 The surface shortwave cloud radiative effect (CRE) plays a critical role in modulating the Earth's energy balance and climate change. However, accurately quantifying the CRE remains challenging due to significant uncertainties in downwelling surface shortwave radiation (DSSR) and cloud parameter estimates, especially in the Arctic. This paper introduces a novel approach that enhances the accuracy of CRE estimation by constructing computationally efficient, long-term gridded surface cloud fraction radiative kernels (GCF-CRKs) and integrating refined DSSR estimates and a high-precision cloud fraction (CF). By leveraging the correlation between the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) shortwave radiative parameters and surface radiation, combined with high-precision fused CF datasets from multiple satellite sources, we construct a CF-dependent model to refine DSSR estimates. Based on this model, we construct GCF-CRKs using the CF as the sole perturbation parameter to isolate the CF CRE. Our results indicate that this method significantly improves the accuracy of DSSR estimation under partially cloudy conditions (0 % < CF < 100 %), aligning more closely with ground-based observations. In Arctic-wide validation experiments, the root mean square error (RMSE) was decreased by approximately 2.5 W m−2, and the bias was reduced by 1.23 W m−2, which was an improvement of 8.7 % (reduction in RMSE) against the CERES EBAF (Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System Energy Balanced and Filled). Even greater improvements were achieved at stations in Greenland (RMSE was reduced by 4.53 W m−2, and bias was reduced by ∼ 6.89 W m−2, with an accuracy improvement of about 11.1 %). The GCF-CRKs exhibit similar signs and patterns and enhanced stability compared to existing kernels. The sensitivity analysis results reveal that seasonal and interannual variations introduce GCF-CRK uncertainties of approximately 1 and 0.1 W m−2 %−1, respectively, while spatial variations within the same latitude range can cause CRK uncertainties of 0.2–1.2 W m−2 %−1. These uncertainties can result in CRE biases ranging from 5 to 50 W m−2, which demonstrates the limitations of existing methods that utilize short-term, small-area parameter data to produce global CRKs. Using these GCF-CRKs, we estimated the spatiotemporal properties of the surface shortwave CRE in the Arctic over a 21-year period (2000–2020), and the trend result indicates that, despite the increasing influence of the CF on the Arctic DSSR, the smaller magnitude and interannual trend of the annual average surface shortwave CRE suggest that previous studies may have overestimated the magnitude and rate of the cooling effect of clouds on the Arctic DSSR by up to 4 and 0.5 W m−2 per decade, particularly in Greenland. This study provides a more accurate and efficient assessment of the CRE, and the results underscore the need for more effective measures to mitigate the impact of Arctic amplification on the surface radiative energy balance, which is crucial for understanding and addressing regional and global climate change.

Here, we present the data, covering over 60 years of daily observations conducted along the eastern Atlantic coast, spanning from the tropics to the northern extratropics. 
 Tropospheric ozone (O3) plays a key role in the climate system. Studying pre-industrial tropospheric O3 implies two important challenges: (i) the lack of observational records prior to the late 19th century, which hampers the understanding of long-term climate trends (given the crucial role of O3), and (ii) and the uncertainties in quantitative tropospheric O3 values in a non-polluted atmosphere across the planet. The ozonoscope was the first instrument used to measure ozone. It offered semi-quantitative estimates of surface O3 when no other measurements were available. Despite their potential value, the digitization, curation, and publication of ozonoscope data remain largely unexplored. In this work, we initiate an effort to rescue surface O3 ozonoscope records by compiling them in a new data collection. We include data from 23 observatories covering Portugal and the African Atlantic regions, providing a latitudinal span from the extratropics in the Northern Hemisphere to the tropics in the Southern Hemisphere.

However, quantifying the air photochemical age (PCA) in the boundary layer (BL) remains a challenge due to the limited vertical measurements and the difficulty in determining OH levels. Here, we explore the PCA across different heights and layers of the BL using the observed VOC ratios with varying reactivity and calculated OH levels using observation-based models. Results show that more reactive  species ratios of VOCs generally decrease with height across the BL, while less reactive species ratios show the opposite trend. Given the dominance by OH-exposure and OH levels, estimated PCA values exhibit significant seasonal and vertical variations, especially when differentiated by  thermal stratification. In the mixing layer (ML), the PCA is younger, with a minimal vertical gradient, whereas it becomes older in the stable BL and residual layer (RL). Specifically, in summer, the average PCA was 2.0 h in the ML and 2.65 h in the SBL and RL, much younger than in autumn, 6.8 h in the ML and 9.1–10.5 h in the SBL and RL. The PCA could serve as a metric of assessing vertical exchanges and holds significant potential for air quality assessment."

Establishing a chemical weather model is essential to more accurately and effectively account for these effects. The stratosphere serves as primary ozone reservoir, but the Chinese Unified Atmospheric Chemistry Environment (CUACE) model lacks a dedicated stratospheric module, limiting accurate simulation of stratospheric ozone variability. Therefore, a stratospheric module is developed within CUACE and coupled online to the global weather prediction model, forming a novel global chemical weather (GCW) model. Critical technical advancements in parallel computation acceleration, optimized array conversion, precision interpolation, stratospheric boundary definition, and standardized unit conversion collectively enhance forecasting timeliness and stability. Benchmarked against reanalysis data, the GCW model successfully captures stratospheric ozone spatial distribution (R2 = 0.64–0.90), with radiative feedback implementation reducing stratospheric temperature prediction biases by 1.8–5.4 K.

This study represents the first large‐scale investigation of these compounds across coastal and open‐ocean environments. Atmospheric CH3Cl and CH3Br concentrations were substantially elevated in the ECS and SCS, exceeding Northern Hemisphere background levels by 12%–28%, whereas concentration enhancements over the northwest Pacific were 3%–5%. Elevated CH3Cl and CH3Br concentrations were attributed to long‐range terrestrial atmospheric transport from China, Korea, Japan, and the Philippines, as well as localized phytoplankton‐driven production in nutrient‐rich coastal waters. In contrast, CH3I concentrations were primarily controlled by photochemical processes mediated by dissolved organic carbon (DOC), with elevated levels being observed in the oligotrophic subtropical northwest Pacific (10°–30°N). Multiple regression analyses revealed that CH3Cl and CH3Br distributions were mainly influenced by terrestrial transport in coastal areas, whereas oceanic processes dominated their distributions in the open ocean. CH3I distributions primarily reflected oceanic photochemical production, with marginal terrestrial influence limited to the ECS. The production rates of CH3Br and CH3Cl in the ECS and SCS, respectively, were 2–3 times higher than those in the northwest Pacific, consistent with enhanced biological activity. Sea‐to‐air flux estimates demonstrated that the northwest Pacific and its marginal seas acted as net sources of all three methyl halides, with fluxes generally exceeding global averages by approximately 1.5–48 times. These findings underscore the importance of the study area to the atmospheric methyl halides budget."

Results confirm that the impacts of O3 damage on CPLs become more and more serious during 2013–2018 in China, with the 6‐year mean losses of 12.2 Mt (8.5%) for wheat, 8.4 Mt (3.8%) of rice, 4.3 Mt (1.6%) of maize, and 0.7 Mt (4.8%) of soybean. The worsened O3 pollution under SSP3‐7.0 scenario during the late‐century will cause 283.6% (170.3%, 479.4%, 168.0%) increase in wheat (rice, maize, soybean) production losses relative to that in 2018, while the improved O3 air quality under SSP1‐2.6 scenario can decrease 73.8% (69.3%, 80.8%, 75.5%) wheat (rice, maize, soybean) yield losses during the late‐century relative to 2018. China has the largest population and food consumption worldwide, and the persistent O3 deterioration does have exacerbated the loss of agricultural productions.

This study examines the exposure distribution of compound wildfire smoke and extreme heat in California, 2011–2020, and characterizes disproportionate population vulnerabilities. We obtained fine resolution temperature data (4‐km) from GridMET and wildfire‐influenced fine particulate matter (PM2.5) estimates (3‐km) from a combined metric of geostatistical modeled total PM2.5 and satellite‐detected wildfire smoke plumes. Estimates were aggregated to the ZIP‐Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) level and population weighted. Exposure days to CH and single hazards were defined using a 2‐day exposure lag window with binary indicators for wildfire smoke and extreme heat. Daily exposure counts were summed by year and over the 10 years for descriptive mapping. Ten‐year exposures were characterized by community factors and differences were tested using ANOVA. Exposures to compound wildfire smoke and extreme heat varied temporally and geographically, primarily driven by wildfire smoke. On average, ZCTAs experienced 3–4 CH days annually, peaking in 2020 (9.85 days). From the early (2011–2015) to later period (2016–2020), ZCTAs experienced 2.77 more annual CH days (95% CI: 2.62, 2.92; p < 0.0001). The number of ZCTAs exposed annually also increased. ZCTAs with persistently higher CH days had significantly higher proportions of minority populations, lower median incomes, and more urban characteristics. Our results show increasing and unequal exposure to compound wildfire smoke and extreme heat. These risks should be considered in mitigation strategies for climate‐vulnerable populations."

This study estimates joint effects of extreme heat and wildfire smoke on hospitalizations in California, 2011–2020. We used a case crossover design with time‐stratified controls and conditional logistic regression to estimate these effects at multiplicative and additive scales. Exposures were assessed for 16 combinations of exposure lags (0–3 days) for extreme heat and wildfire influenced fine particulate matter. Among over 28 million cases of all‐natural cause morbidity, the majority were adults aged 65 and older (41.4%), English speakers (85.1%), and White, non‐Hispanic (49.7%), mostly residing in urban areas (97.2%). The study found roughly 8% of respiratory morbidities (95% CI, 2.4%–13.8%) were attributable to the interaction of wildfire smoke and extreme heat. Significant joint effects were also observed for cardiovascular (5.5%) and renal morbidities (6.2%). Subgroup analyses revealed stronger effects: Respiratory (19.2%, 95% CI 6.5%–32.1%) and cerebrovascular morbidities (15.7%, 95% CI 4%–27.4%) were most pronounced in Black individuals; older adults (50–64 years) showed strong effects for renal morbidities (15.4%, 95% CI −1.6%−32.6%); and cardiovascular effects were highest among females (9.8%, 95% CI 2.9%–16.7%). Effects on all‐natural cause morbidity were generally null. The interaction of wildfire smoke and extreme heat within a short exposure window (4 days) increases hospitalizations; highlighting the need for joint heat and wildfire smoke interventions that target populations at greater risk."

 Understanding anthropogenic CO2 emissions in megacities is important for mitigating climate change. In this study, we analyze tower-based carbon dioxide (CO2) mole fraction measurements at Beijing (BJ), Xianghe (XH), and Xinglong (XL) during two periods: November 2018 to March 2019 and November 2019 to March 2020. We compare the in-situ measurements with the simulated CO2 mole fractions from four emission inventories (ODIAC, EDGAR, MEIC, and CAMS) using the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport model (STILT). Our results show that the STILT model can generally simulate the daily anthropogenic fluctuations in CO2 mole fractions at all three sites (R > 0.6, P < 0.01), with consistent results across the two periods. At BJ, the ODIAC-based simulations have the smallest bias (−4.4 ppm) and RMSE (33.0 ppm) compared to the other three inventories. Emissions within a radius of 5–25 km around the BJ measurement site account for 33.45 %–82.99 % of the CO2 mole fractions enhancements. At XH and XL, the four inventories show a similar performance. The sensitivity of atmospheric CO2 background estimates is evaluated by comparing results from CarbonTracker and the XL background, and the two sets of background estimates differ in bias within 2.3 ppm. Moreover, we quantify the contribution of extremely strong emission sources (>3σ) in ODIAC, and find that they only contribute less than 5 % to CO2 mole fraction enhancements, depending on the distance between these extremely strong emissions and the measurement location."

 Glyoxal (CHOCHO) and formaldehyde (HCHO) are vital oxidization intermediates of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and play a significant role in studying VOC precursor sources. This research utilizes multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) to measure vertical column densities (VCDs) of CHOCHO, HCHO, and NO2 in Guangzhou, China, from June 2019 to June 2020. A sensitivity analysis for DOAS fitting was performed to accurately retrieve CHOCHO due to its low atmospheric concentration. Increased CHOCHO and HCHO levels from June to October 2019 were attributed to heightened photochemical oxidation, while higher CHOCHO levels in November and December 2019 were linked to increased anthropogenic emissions. CHOCHO and HCHO VCDs were lowest in the mornings, increasing with light intensity, whereas NO2 peaked in the mornings and evenings. Additionally, we utilized the CO-Ox trace pair to distinguish between primary and secondary HCHO sources, finding that 79.32 % of HCHO originated from secondary formation via photochemical processes. We employed four indicators (RGF, RGF-1, RGF-2, and RGF-3) to identify the sources of VOC precursors. RGF-1, RGF-2 and RGF-3, corresponding to different model scenarios with increased HCHOpri contributions, were greater than the traditional RGF, emphasizing the influence of AVOC while minimizing BVOC effects. These findings emphasize the importance of considering primary HCHO contributions for accurate VOC source identification and effective air pollution control strategies. Additionally, RGF values derived from MAX-DOAS were found to be 1.29 times higher than those from TROPOMI, suggesting a greater tendency of TROPOMI RGF to identify BVOC sources."

But such details are represented as sub‐grid processes that involve parameterizations and assumptions about the spatial coverage and thus depend on the GCM. In this research, we propose the use of a statistical method to generate sub‐grid precipitation for generic use. The sub‐grid variability is obtained from simulation with a global storm‐resolving model called NICAM (non‐hydrostatic icosahedral atmospheric model). The proposed method first generates sub‐grid precipitation masks based on probabilistic scenarios and then sub‐grid precipitation rates are generated from the generalized gamma distribution for the given cloud fraction and grid‐scale precipitation rates. Compared to the standard method (which neglects the probabilities) that overestimates the precipitation fraction, our method well reproduces the NICAM data set profiles of both the precipitation fraction and the radar‐based cloud fraction. The in‐cloud signal frequencies are also reproduced, although less accurately over a tropical region. Inclusion of sub‐grid variability in precipitation rates was particularly important for the tropical region to obtain agreement of the precipitation fraction. Application of the two methods to a GCM shows it to have a robust bias for low‐level liquid clouds. Furthermore, the sub‐grid variability of precipitation led to more occurrences of the small signals, particularly for a range of high precipitation rates. The proposed method was designed to produce geographically dependent sub‐grid variability in precipitation, indicating an effective way to use a global storm‐resolving model to evaluate conventional GCMs."

The contributions of clouds and atmospheric particles were calculated using a four‐stream microwave radiative transfer model and subtracted from the Tbs measured at the top of the atmosphere. To evaluate the MWRI MLSE, we compared it with four reference clear‐sky emissivity data sets retrieved from Global Precipitation Mission Microwave Imager, Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR‐E), and the Tool to Estimate Land Surface Emissivity at Microwaves and Millimeter waves (TELSEM) which is based on the measurements of Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I). We also assessed the sensitivity of seasonal variations of MLSE to surface conditions indicated by the normalized difference vegetation index and precipitation seasonal cycles. Results demonstrate that our retrieval achieves good consistencies with the four reference products, exhibiting similar surface characteristics and spectral dependencies. Based on the all‐weather retrievals, we studied the potential impacts of clouds on MLSE in tropical regions.

In the summer of 2022, several cities in China experienced prolonged regional O3 pollution, exacerbated by heat waves. As heat waves events become more frequent, the influence of meteorological factors on O3 pollution has gained greater attention. This study, based on observational data from summer campaigns (July and August) in 2021 and 2022 in Chengdu, a megacity in the Sichuan Basin, investigated O3 formation sensitivity to meteorological parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation (represented by the photolysis coefficient of NO2). In August 2022, the urban area of Chengdu experienced its hottest month in nearly 20 years, with maximum temperatures reaching 41.6°C. By calculating the photochemical initial concentrations (PICs) of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to assess O3 reactivity, we found that summer O3 formation in Chengdu operated under a transitional regime, colimited by both VOCs and NOx. An observation‐based box model, using PIC data, further demonstrated that during the heat waves of 2022, O3 peak values increased by 31.4% compared to 2021. Additionally, when solar radiation increased by 10% from average to maximum values, O3 peak levels rose by approximately 9%, highlighting the significant effect observed. Heat waves could increase the emission and reactivity of certain VOCs, particularly from solvent use and vehicular exhaust, such as m/p‐xylene, trans‐2‐butene, and trans‐2‐pentene. These findings enhance our understanding of how extreme weather influences O3 pollution and provide valuable insights for future control strategies."

Redensek;Sonali McDermid;Deepti Singh;Geeta Persad,Nonlinear Response of the Surface Energy Balance to Changes in Anthropogenic Aerosols and Irrigation Over South Asia,"The regional climate impacts of anthropogenic aerosol emissions and irrigation growth in South Asia have conventionally been studied separately. These forcings have overlapping influences on surface temperature and atmospheric stability, but detection and attribution simulations typically quantify the impact of individual time‐evolving climate forcings, which does not account for nonlinear interactions between forcings or their impacts, when forcings evolve in tandem. Using transient simulations in GISS ModelE 2.1‐G, we assess the summertime surface energy balance in five different sub‐regions of South Asia by comparing the linear addition of anthropogenic aerosol and land use single‐forcing historical simulations with novel dual‐forcing simulations. We find that the combination of aerosol emissions and irrigation changes between preindustrial and present‐day increases aerosol hydration and cloud cover more strongly than does the linear addition of the individual forcings. This results in a strong nonlinear decrease in downwelling shortwave radiation, which drives subsequent nonlinearities in the surface energy balance through a relative suppression of energy availability at the surface. While aerosols and irrigation are each credited with suppressing monsoon winds and delaying onset, combined simulations of both forcings suggest that surface pressure is nonlinearly reduced over the northern Indian Subcontinent. This results in a net increase in 850 mb winds from the Bay of Bengal toward northwest India and Pakistan in combined simulations, suppressing the weakening of summer monsoon winds from single forcing results. The nonlinearities identified in our study suggest that the current framework for detection and attribution may not adequately account for potential interactions between forcings."

This phenomenon makes the Arctic climate particularly sensitive to change if the conditions that support one of these states vanish. This study examines 25 years of in‐situ data from the North Slope of Alaska to investigate how these two states have changed over time. While November once had nearly equal occurrences of both states, the transmissive state has almost completely disappeared, resulting in an increase of over 30 W/m2 ${\text{W/m}}^{2}$ in surface downwelling longwave radiation since the turn of the century. This dramatic shift highlights a crucial climate feedback that any region prone to sea ice loss may experience—reducing the transmissive state enhances atmospheric warming and moistening, further promoting the opaque state. This feedback accelerates surface energy imbalances and could amplify Arctic change beyond current projections."

We find that Arctic cloud properties are largely controlled by meteorological properties, whereby a warmer, drier, and more stable environment acts to decrease cloud fraction, water path, and median volume particle size.

Present results show that direct stratospheric ionization caused by REP can enhance the NOx concentration by a factor of ∼2.58 at ∼37 km altitude, and the HOx concentration by a factor of ∼6.41 at ∼44 km altitude. As for the annual variation, REP causes an additional ozone loss of ∼16.2%–17.1% at ∼30–35 km altitude during winter. Moreover, REP's impact is not confined to winter since the resultant NOx and HOx production occurs in situ.

 Rocket emissions thin the stratospheric ozone layer. To understand if significant ozone losses could occur as the launch industry grows, we examine two scenarios. Our ‘ambitious’ scenario (2040 launches/year) yields a −0.29% depletion in annual-mean, near-global total column ozone in 2030. Antarctic springtime ozone decreases by 3.9%. Our ‘conservative’ scenario (884 launches/year) yields −0.17% annual, near-global depletion; current licensing rates suggest this scenario may be exceeded before 2030. Ozone losses are driven by the chlorine produced from solid rocket motor propellant, and black carbon which is emitted from most propellants. The ozone layer is slowly healing from the effects of CFCs, yet global-mean ozone abundances are still 2% lower than measured prior to the onset of CFC-induced ozone depletion. Our results demonstrate that ongoing and frequent rocket launches could delay ozone recovery. Action is needed now to ensure that future growth of the launch industry and ozone protection are mutually sustainable."

 In the 2023 summer, wildfires in Canada were exceptionally intense, producing the highest carbon emissions recorded since 2003 and affecting much of North America. However, the factors driving the 2023 wildfires and their interactions remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that the 2023 Canadian wildfires were primarily fueled by persistent, intense and widespread summer surface warming, along with pronounced reductions in precipitation and soil moisture. These conditions were closely linked to unusually frequent, wide, long-lasting and eastward-moving North American blocking events. We reveal that an unusually strong negative Pacific Decadal Oscillation and an Eastern Pacific El Niño in the 2023 summer play a crucial role in promoting these blocking patterns. Furthermore, we find that abnormally low precipitation and soil moisture during the preceding winter and spring served as critical precursors, compounding summer fire risk by preconditioning the landscape. Our findings offer new insights into the underlying causes of the 2023 Canadian wildfires.

 Aerosols and clouds significantly influence the climate system. This paper systematically reviews the microphysical processes of aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI), recent advances in precipitation studies, associated radiative effects, and the development of observational techniques. The primary mechanisms of the ACI process depend on the cloud type and evolutionary stage, with distinct interactions identified for liquid, ice, and mixed-phase clouds. Understanding the effects of aerosols on ice and mixed-phase clouds poses greater challenges than on liquid clouds. In terms of climate effects, we summarize recent advancements regarding how aerosols influence precipitation by affecting the characteristics and development of clouds, including their impacts on precipitation amount, distribution area, onset timing, and vertical structure. Statistical analyses reveal a weakening negative trend in global ACI-induced radiative forcing and effective radiative forcing, linked to declining aerosol concentrations in many regions, which accelerates climate change. Regarding observational techniques, the joint observation strategy, by integrating the advantages of different techniques, provides a multi-angle view and improves the temporal and spatial resolution and accuracy of the data. Finally, challenges to ACI research are discussed. By reporting the latest research results and methods, this review will help to provide the current state of knowledge on ACI and their impact on climate, providing valuable insights for those working on this research."

Core–shell mixing aligns well with observations, but partial internal mixing is a more realistic representation. We used a microphysics module to determine the fraction of embedded BC and coating aerosols, constraining the mixing state. This reduced absorption enhancement by 30 %–43 % in northern China, offering insights into BC's radiative effects. 
 The mixing state and aging characteristics of black carbon (BC) aerosols are the key factors in calculating their optical properties and quantifying their impacts on radiation balance and global climate change. Considerable uncertainty still exists in the absorption properties of BC-containing aerosols and the absorption enhancement (Eabs) due to the lensing effect. It is crucial to reasonably represent the mixing of BC with other aerosol components to reduce this uncertainty. In this study, the absorption properties of PM2.5 were investigated based on the Nested Air Quality Prediction Modeling System (NAQPMS) with different assumptions of the aerosol mixing state. The absorption coefficient (babs) is the highest under the assumption of uniform internal mixing, lower under core–shell mixing, and the lowest under external mixing. The result under core–shell mixing is closest to the observations. The aging process and coating thickness were well reproduced by an advanced particle microphysics (APM) module in NAQPMS. Following this, the fraction of embedded BC and secondary component coating on aerosols was used to constrain the mixing state. Eabs at 880 nm over the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region was 2.0–2.5 under core–shell mixing. When the fraction of coated BC and the coating layer are resolved, Eabs_880 – caused by the lensing effect – decreases by 30 %–43 % to 1.2–1.7, which is close to the range reported in previous studies. This study highlights the importance of representing the microphysical processes governing the mixing state and aging of BC and provides a reference for quantifying their radiative effects."

It is shown that the typical processing chain used to derive atmospheric gas columns can be sensitive to relatively small shortenings of the recorded interferograms. Low-resolution recordings, used in more recent years, are more sensitive to such adaptations. 
 This study examines the sensitivity of atmospheric trace gas column retrievals from ground-based Fourier transform interferometer measurements to variations in the number of points in the recorded interferograms. Shortening an interferogram can be part of standard FTIR data processing and typically occurs with a convolution operation on the interferogram. Shortening will alter the leakage pattern in the associated spectrum, and we demonstrate that the removal of a relatively small number of  points from the interferogram edges creates a beat pattern in the difference of the associated spectra obtained from the original and shortened interferograms. For low-spectral-resolution interferometers, the beat pattern may exceed the spectral noise level, and, if this occurs, the number of points in the interferogram can become a strong influence parameter for the retrieved trace gas. In a case study with formaldehyde retrievals obtained from low-resolution spectra in Sodankylä and Kolkata, we show that the retrieval software does not accurately model the leakage pattern and that interferogram shortening has a large effect  on atmospheric gas column retrievals that exceeds the estimated retrieval uncertainty of approximately 15 %–30 %. This sensitivity of the retrieval algorithm to the length of the underlying low-resolution interferogram can be reduced by applying a nontrivial apodization such as Norton–Beer apodization. For the Sodankylä case study the correlation between formaldehyde columns obtained from low- and high-resolution measurements increased from 0.72 (without apodization) to 0.93 (Norton–Beer strong apodization)."

The dataset reflects unique horizontal and height spatial characteristics and hourly temporal variations of aircraft emissions and the impact of COVID-19 on these emissions, providing essential information for environmental analysis and policy decisions. 
 The rapid growth of the aviation industry has resulted in aircraft emissions during landing and takeoff (LTO), which have direct and increasingly adverse impacts on air quality and human health. An accurate and high-resolution LTO emission inventory is crucial for investigating these adverse effects, with the LTO emission having unique three-dimensional (3D) spatial characteristics and typical hourly temporal variations. This study integrated the emission calculation and flight trajectory recognition methods to establish a four-dimensional (4D) aircraft emission inventory dataset of China's LTO cycle (4D-LTO emission inventory dataset) from 2019 to 2023. The dataset has a high spatial–temporal resolution (hourly, 0.03° × 0.03° × 34 height layers) and incorporates calculation emissions accurately. Moreover, the actual taxi-out/taxi-in time for each flight was determined by a statistical model of taxi time and some aircraft in schedule based on 38 million flights. Each flight's climb/approach time was also obtained based on mixing layer height (MLH) and the height–time nonlinear relationship. Additionally, we calculated the LTO emission for China's flight, establishing the hourly emission inventory based on each mode's running time, emission index, and fuel flow. We obtained the flight trajectory core of each airport based on measured flight trajectories and the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to depict the spatial distribution. Then, each flight's takeoff/landing direction and trajectory were identified from the wind direction and relative departure/arrival airport position. The findings indicate that during COVID-19, the LTO number in 2020–2022 was reduced to 73.1 %, 77.6 %, and 48.7 % of 2019 levels, respectively. However, by 2023, the LTO number has rapidly bounced back to 95.3 % of 2019 levels. The recovery rate during daytime (06:00–23:00 UTC+8) was 41.6 % higher than during nighttime (00:00–05:00 UTC+8).

LTO emissions' horizontal characteristic is the distance along the runway and spread. This elongated distribution will be hidden if a rough grid is used (e.g., 0.36° × 0.36°) and the emissions are evenly distributed. Moreover, LTO emission height characteristic decreases with height, and the maximum height varies with MLH. Emissions above the standard height set by the International Civil Aviation Organization standard height (∼ 915 m) are not estimated. For example, NOx emissions above 915 m during various months make up an average of 24.6 % (9.9 %–37.5 %) in the LTO cycle, indicating the emissions are significantly underestimated when using the ICAO method. Compared with conventional spatial allocation methods, our dataset provides a more accurate representation of the actual LTO situation in both the horizontal direction and height at different times. Our 4D-LTO emission inventory dataset and its adaptable methodology are valuable resources for researching temporal and spatial variations, air quality, and health impacts of aircraft emissions in the LTO cycle.

 Atmospheric inversions are widely used to evaluate and improve inventories of methane (CH4) emissions on scales ranging from global to national and beyond, combining observations with atmospheric transport models. This study uses the dense network of in situ stations of the Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) to explore how well in situ data can constrain European CH4 emissions. Following the concept of inter-comparison studies of the atmospheric tracer transport model inter-comparison Project (TransCom), a CH4 inverse inter-comparison modeling study has been performed, focusing on Europe for the period 2006–2018. The aim is to investigate the capability of inverse models to deliver consistent flux estimates at the national scale and evaluate trends in emission inventories."

Observational evidence has identified coal and biomass burning as an important source of RHS in polluted continental regions, including the North China Plain (NCP). Over the past ten years, the Chinese government has enacted various mitigation measures to control air pollutant emissions, including a clean energy initiative in the NCP. Here we report recent measurements of RHS at an NCP’s rural site where extraordinary levels of RHS were observed during the winter of 2017. We show that reactive bromines like BrCl and Br2 largely diminished after the implementation of the clean energy policy, but high levels of reactive chlorine persisted. A surprising finding in the recent field study is a potentially new chlorine source, likely from chlorine-based fertilizers. Moreover, the changes in aerosol acidity and the NO3 production rate led to a large increase in ClNO2 production with an inhibition of Cl2. The high ClNO2 levels (average: 150 pptv, peak: 3.8 ppbv) accounted for 43% of the oxidation of alkanes, increased conventional radicals (OH, HO2, RO2) by 4–8%, and net ozone production by 8–11%.

Tillandsia usneoides is an indicator plant for atmospheric Hg pollution; however, the uptake, transport modes, and redistribution mechanisms of Hg in T. usneoides are underexplored. Herein, we investigated these mechanisms and the influencing factors of Hg0 in T. usneoides at multiple levels. We found that Hg0 can be absorbed through both stomata and lipids, with higher Hg concentrations showing a greater tendency to be taken up by lipids. Hg passes through cell membranes via active transport, facilitated by Ca2+ ion channels and water channel proteins. Most Hg (50.1–97.9%) is retained in tissue cells in a low-toxicity and low-activity form (phosphate, pectinate, protein-bound and oxalate), with a small fraction located on leaf surfaces and in cuticular cells. After entering the cells, Hg was primarily retained in the cell wall (26.7–47.9%), with HC-2 demonstrating maximal retention (88.8–96.6%). As much as 61.3–91.5% of organelle-associated Hg was localized in chloroplasts. The −OH functional group in HC-2 might play an important role in Hg retention, closing a significant gap in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, we discovered that after the removal of Hg stress, T. usneoides did not release Hg for a month. However, there was a tendency for Hg in the tissue and surface to be transported toward the cuticle. Our findings expand the understanding of plant leaf-atmosphere Hg interactions and reveal the intrinsic mechanisms of Hg detoxification in T. usneoides."

This study examined air quality in three major East African cities─Kampala, Nairobi, and Dar es Salaam─by integrating low-cost air sensors with satellite data to produce 1 km × 1 km resolution daily PM2.5 (particulate matter smaller than 2.5 μm) maps from 2019 to 2023. Average PM2.5 concentrations were 31.4 ± 6.6 μg/m3 around Kampala, 21.7 ± 2.8 μg/m3 around Nairobi, and 33.1 ± 7.4 μg/m3 around Dar es Salaam, indicating moderate to unhealthy levels of air quality. Unexpectedly, urban centers exhibited lower PM2.5 levels than surrounding suburban area. This discrepancy is likely due to combustion-related activities that occur in the suburbs. Such results suggest that air quality mitigation efforts must extend beyond urban centers to suburban areas, where seasonal vegetation loss and combustion processes may drive pollution spikes. Beyond presenting a scalable approach for monitoring air quality in data-scarce regions, this study highlights the importance of localized strategies for urban air quality management."

The multiple RO missions include Formosa Satellite Mission 3/Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC‐1), SPIRE, and Meteorological Operational satellite (MetOp)‐A, ‐B, ‐C. We compare collocated profiles from multiple STAR‐processed RO missions to ensure the consistency of the data used in the construction of STAR MMC. Because the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate‐2 (COSMIC‐2) contains a noticeable temperature difference compared with other RO missions, we decided not to include it. We validate the robustness of the sampling error correction method through three reanalyses: ERA‐5, MERRA‐2, and JRA‐55. The result shows the uncertainty caused by using different reanalyses is negligible. This STAR MMC is then compared with the ROM SAF MMC and the MMC derived from these three reanalyses, exhibiting general consistency. Various climate signals, including quasi‐biennial oscillation (QBO) and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), can be identified from STAR MMC.

 Over recent decades, changes in atmospheric ozone and climate have substantially altered surface solar ultraviolet radiation, but the impacts of these changes on crop yields remain unclear. Here we analyze climate data and maize yields from 1992 to 2018 across China to quantify how extreme ultraviolet radiation events—periods of exceptionally high ultraviolet exposure—affect maize production. We show that maize yields decline by about 0.72% for each 1% increase in these events, especially during critical mid-growing stages, although higher soil moisture can reduce this damage. By the 2030 s, extreme ultraviolet radiation could reduce yields by 1.4% and 2.17%, with losses increasing substantially under moderate dry (by 51%) and severe heat stress (by 124%). These findings underscore the necessity of accounting for changes in ultraviolet radiation to improve the accuracy of yield projections.

 Atmospheric methane is rapidly increasing, and the role of tropical wetlands in the global methane budget raises concerns about a potential climate-wetland-methane feedback. Here we use Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System observations to map monthly inundation dynamics across the tropics (37.4°S to 37.4°N) at high resolution (0.01° × 0.01°) over five years (2018–2023), including cloud and vegetation-covered regions. Our results reveal large seasonal and interannual variations in wetland extent not captured in traditional inundation products, with strong El Niño-Southern Oscillation correlations. Tropical wetland models driven by these inundation observations, independent precipitation products, or constrained by total water observations do not show growth in wetland methane emissions from 2020–2022. This suggests the 2020–2022 growth in methane is best explained by other methane source or sink mechanisms, or that non-hydrological controls are more important in tropical wetland methane emissions than currently understood.

 The heterogeneous reaction of dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) is an important pathway for the nighttime formation of nitrate and its parameterization especially in the presence of organic coatings (considering phase changes) is complicated. In this study, an updated combination of inorganic core (Davis08) - organic shell (Gaston14 and Riemer09) parameterization schemes for N2O5 hydrolysis was embedded into the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry to discuss the simulated differences of and organic coating impacts on size-resolved N2O5 uptake coefficients and nitrate in North China, which have not been reported. All the three size-resolved N2O5 uptake coefficients had significant spatiotemporal variations, with a largest value in size bin 2 (156–625 nm). The values in the eastern coastal and relatively clean areas were generally larger than those in inland and polluted areas due to variations of relative humidity (RH), and were suppressed in nitrate dominated areas. Scheme Riemer09 is related to the thickness of SOA (secondary organic aerosol) package (l/Rp) and produced at least 2 μg/m3 of nitrate inhibition in regions where l/Rp ≥ 0.08 fit γD (the uptake coefficient of inorganic core) ≥ 1 × 10−2. Scheme Gaston14 considers the effects of ambient RH and SOA phase; in those areas where RH was greater than 70 %, the coating effect simulated by scheme Gaston14 was relatively small; when low RH (<40 %) and low O:C ratios (<0.48) coexisted, scheme Gaston14 had a significant coating effect, leading to its simulated nitrate being ∼4 μg/m3 lower than the simulation of scheme Riemer09. The two coating schemes showed a similar vertical trend, with a maximum difference of 15 % of the heterogeneous produced nitrate in size bin 2 in the polluted areas at the height of ∼240m.

It showed different characteristics of cloud residual and interstitial particles. Stronger particle hygroscopicity reduced liquid water content and smaller cloud droplet diameters. This investigation contributes to understanding aerosol–cloud interactions by assessing the impact of aerosol particles on cloud microphysics. 
 An automatic switched inlet system, incorporating a ground-based counterflow virtual impactor (GCVI) and a PM2.5 impactor, was developed and employed to investigate the particle number size distributions (PNSDs) and chemical composition for cloud-free (CF), cloud interstitial (CI), and cloud residual (CR) particles at Mt. Daming in the Yangtze River Delta, China, throughout a 1-month period in spring 2023. The PNSDs of CF particles were primarily characterized by a significant Aitken mode alongside a secondary accumulation mode. In contrast, CI and CR particles exhibited unimodal distribution with Aitken and accumulation modes, peaking at 56 and 220 nm, respectively. With the fast changes of PNSDs during the onset stage of the observed four typical cloud processes, it can be inferred that the critical diameters activated as cloud droplets ranging from 133–325 nm. Particularly noteworthy was the higher hygroscopicity parameter, κ value observed in CR particles (0.32±0.06), associated with a larger mass fraction of nitrate, compared to the lower κ value in CI particles (0.23±0.08), with higher fraction of black carbon. For a typical cloud process, the hygroscopicity of CI particles was found to influence cloud droplet properties, with higher κ values corresponding to lower droplet number concentration, reduced liquid water content, and smaller effective cloud droplet diameters. This suggests that these CI particles are capable of absorbing ambient water vapour, thereby restricting further droplet growth. This investigation contributes to understanding aerosol–cloud interactions by assessing the impact of aerosol particles on cloud microphysics, thus enhancing overall comprehension of these complex atmospheric dynamics. However, it is noted that long-term observations are necessary to capture more cloud processes and yield statistically significant findings."

Gaston,African dust transported to Barbados in the wintertime lacks indicators of chemical aging,"Saharan dust transported across the Atlantic to the Caribbean, South America, and North America is hypothesized to undergo chemical processing by acids that enhances cloud droplet formation and nutrient availability. In this study, chemical analysis performed on African dust deposited over Barbados shows that acid tracers are found mostly on sea salt and smoke particles, rather than dust, indicating that dust particles undergo minimal chemical processing. 
 The chemical processing (“aging”) of mineral dust is thought to increase dust light-scattering efficiency, cloud droplet activation, and nutrient solubility. However, the extent of African dust aging during long-range transport to the western Atlantic is poorly understood. Here, we explore African dust aging in wintertime samples collected from Barbados when dust is transported at lower altitudes. Ion chromatography (IC) analysis indicates that the mass concentrations of bulk nitrate, sulfate, and oxalate increase, relative to background conditions, when African dust reaches Barbados after transatlantic transport, indicating dust aging. However, aerosol mixing-state analysis from computer-controlled scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (CCSEM/EDX) indicates that approximately 67 % of dust particles are internally mixed with sea salt, while only about 26 % of dust particles contain no internally mixed components. SEM/EDX elemental mapping and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) reveals that within internally mixed dust and sea salt particles, only sea salt components contain signs of aging as indicated by the loss of chloride and acquisition of nitrate and/or sulfate. Our results suggest that chemical aging may only modestly increase the solubility of nutrients in African dust during long-range transport. Because most dust that we measured was internally mixed with sea salt, chemical aging is not necessarily required to increase the hygroscopicity of dust, at least in the lower boundary layer. Further, our findings have implications for understanding the release of halogens from sea salts, which may be enhanced in internally mixed dust and sea salt particles."

However, UV-driven postdepositional processes can alter nitrate in snow, making snow accumulation rates critical for preserving these records. This study examines nitrate isotopes in a southeastern Greenland ice core, where high snow accumulation minimizes these effects, providing a reliable archive of atmospheric nitrogen cycling. 
 Stable isotopes of atmospheric nitrate (NO3-) are valuable tools for tracing nitrogen sources and processes; however, their signals in ice core records are often disrupted by postdepositional processes. The ice core from the southeastern Dome (SE-Dome) in Greenland is a potential record of variations in atmospheric chemistry that has experienced a lower postdepositional effect owing to a high accumulation rate (∼1 m water equivalent per year). Herein, we report 60-year (1959–2014) δ15N(NO3-) and Δ17O(NO3-) records from the SE-Dome ice core. The δ15N(NO3-) decreased from 1960 to 1974 and exhibited clear seasonal changes (high in summer and low in winter). The Δ17O(NO3-) did not exhibit any significant long-term trends, but it did contain seasonal patterns. The mass-weighted annual average of δ15N(NO3-) values in the SE-Dome core were 4.2±2.8 ‰ lower than those in the Greenland Summit ice core between 1959 and 2006. The TRansfer of Atmospheric Nitrate Stable Isotopes To the Snow (TRANSITS) model under the SE-Dome condition estimated changes of only 0.9 ‰ for δ15N(NO3-) and −0.2 ‰ for Δ17O(NO3-) from the initial deposition. Although differences in the source of NO3- cannot be discounted, the lower δ15N(NO3-) values observed at SE-Dome compared to Summit were likely due to reduced postdepositional alteration. Therefore, the SE-Dome ice core NO3- record offers a precise reconstruction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from both North America and western Europe, as well as atmospheric oxidation chemistry and transport, thereby providing reliable insight into atmospheric nitrogen cycling."

This study employs an aerosol optical tweezer (AOT) system coupled with Mie scattering theory to precisely measure the RRI of sea spray aerosols at 650 nm across a range of RH levels. First, standard ammonium sulfate particles were used to validate the AOT measurements against thermodynamic models and previously established parameterizations, confirming the reliability of the optical tweezers' measurements. Measurements of SSA from offshore and open-sea samples show consistent RRI values, independent of seawater salinity, with artificial sea salt particles effectively representing the optical properties of real SSA at RH > 70 %. A least-squares linear regression scheme linking RRI and RH was developed, allowing for accurate RRI estimation under varying RH conditions. Additionally, our scheme's intercept at RH = 0 potentially represents the molten-state RRI for sea spray aerosols, validated against standard particles. Results highlight that traditional volume-weighted mixing rules underestimate RRI and aerosol optical depth (AOD), thus reinforcing the need for direct measurement-based parameterizations. This study underscores the importance of accurately representing sea spray aerosols' radiative properties in climate models. We suggest incorporating the proposed linear regression scheme into aerosol and radiative transfer models to improve model accuracy and enhance the understanding of the effects of sea spray aerosols on radiative processes."

McBride;Xiaoguang Xu;Anin Puthukkudy;Rachel Smith;Roberto Fernandez-Borda,HARP2 pre-launch calibration: dealing with polarization effects of a wide field of view,"HARP2 (Hyper-Angular Rainbow Polarimeter) is a satellite remote sensing camera which was launched on the NASA PACE (Plankton Aerosol Cloud and Ocean Ecosystem) mission in early 2024. HARP2 uses image data of the Earth to allow scientists to measure natural processes. There exists interest in accurate polarimeter measurements of clouds and aerosols to understand climate change. In 2022, HARP2 underwent lab calibration evaluating its wide field-of-view characteristics. In doing so it was shown that key HARP2 calibration parameters possessed significant field-of-view variability. 
 The Hyper-Angular Rainbow Polarimeter (HARP2) is a wide-field-of-view (FOV) polarimeter built for the NASA Plankton Aerosol Cloud and Ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission launched in early 2024. HARP2 measures the linear Stokes parameters across a 114° × 100° (along-track by cross-track) FOV. In the fall of 2022, HARP2 underwent calibration at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) Calibration Laboratory (Code 618). HARP2 was characterized for radiometric and polarimetric response across its FOV. We have used telecentric calibration methodology on prior iterations of HARP that involved the normalization of pixels across the FOV such that calibration parameters determined at the center of the charged coupled device (CCD) detector can be used across the entire scene. By using a dual-axis yaw–pitch motorized mount, we devised two scan patterns to evaluate this methodology for HARP2. The results show that pure intensity measurements do indeed vary minimally across the FOV and therefore can utilize the flat-field normalization (telecentric) technique. On the other hand, images of polarized targets change significantly across the FOV, and calibration parameters determined at the center of the detector used in the wide FOV perform significantly worse than calibration parameters determined at or near to the location of the test (up to 5 % mean absolute uncertainty in degree of linear polarization, DoLP). We evaluated the use of a paraboloid fit of the polarized calibration parameters, at discrete FOV locations, to determine those parameters at a pixel-level resolution. According to the wide-FOV results, this process shows a marked improvement for fully polarized (DoLP = 1) calibration data to less than 1 % uncertainty after using the paraboloid fit. These results are important for the development of any wide-FOV polarimeter, especially those like HARP2 which use a front lens which causes significant barrel distortion and a division of amplitude central optical element leveraging multiple reflections. Full characterization of the source of these optical effects remains a part of future work, but the improved methodology over the telecentric method is currently being implemented in the HARP2 L1B calibration pipeline pending internal review of the implementation in the HARP Image Processing Pipeline."

In the Eastern Mediterranean, we identify 10 distinct layering conditions characterized by specific vertical layering structures and aerosol mixing states. These configurations range from purely anthropogenic layers to complex multilayered mixtures, where marine aerosols, anthropogenic pollution, and dust occupy different altitudes, sometimes interacting or being further modified by rain. We conducted air mass back-trajectory clustering at 700 and 1700 m above ground level, linking pollution types to their transport origins. Satellite-derived aerosol optical depth biases were also systematically evaluated under various pollution scenarios, showing a strong satellite–ground correlations during dust events but poor accuracy under nondust conditions with marine–anthropogenic mixtures (35% of cases). Random Forest analyses demonstrated the potential to predict pollution layering types. Additionally, anthropogenic pollution content is increasing with altitude across all layering types, with evidence suggesting a growing prominence of anthropogenic pollution. These trends align with projections of a strengthening Persian Trough, the dominant summer synoptic system. This detailed categorization provides valuable insights into the complexity of pollution sources and atmospheric interactions in the region. The integration of vertical layering data holds significant potential, enhancing climate predictions, and pollution mitigation strategies on both local and global scales."

However, potential HONO sources from direct or secondary pathways remain unclear, especially in industrial environments where HONO may be formed accompanied by large industrial NOx emissions. Herein, by combining field observations in a densely industrial site during summertime of 2021 and modeling results, we found that besides the currently recommended HONO formation mechanisms, including photolysis of adsorbed nitric acid and particulate nitrate, (photoenhanced) NO2 heterogeneous conversions, and direct emissions, a considerable unidentified HONO source (i.e., Pmissing) emerged in the industrial area with an increasing significance at night, whereas it did not appear in the urban and rural areas although the same parametrization was considered. When the missing gap of HONO was incorporated into a positive matrix factorization model, a significant industrial-related source dominated by the tracers of Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu with Pmissing (ca. 76%) was first revealed, accounting for ca. 34% of HONO production in this industrial area. In addition, a good correlation (rs = 0.64, p < 0.1) between the industrial NOx emissions and atmospheric HONO abundance during the summertime of 2022–2023 also highlighted the significance of industrial HONO emissions. Therefore, it is anticipated that paying more attention to industrial-related HONO emissions would be a new perspective to further improve regional air quality."

An increasing trend in NAS winter phytoplankton blooms is observed over the past two decades. Scenarios of high‐blooms (HBS) and low‐blooms (LBS) during boreal winter in the NAS are identified, and the corresponding weekly chlorophyll‐a evolutions are analyzed in relation to mixed layer depth (MLD) and atmospheric processes. In the LBS scenario, the southward shift of the westerly subtropical jet (STJ) in winter leads to cyclonic and cold flows in the NAS, which induces a transient deepening of MLD and slow restratification, resulting in prolonged but subdued phytoplankton growth. Conversely, in the HBS scenario, the northward movement of the STJ generates anticyclonic and warm flows and consequent rapid MLD shoaling, promoting nutrient retention and vigorous phytoplankton growth. Climate change over the past two decades favors the latter scenario."

 We report an intensive aircraft study of regional air pollution over Northeast China during July and August 2018, unraveling the vertical distributions and regional transport of a variety of trace gases and aerosols. Major air pollutants, including sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitric oxide (NO), ozone (O3), black carbon (BC), aerosol scattering coefficient (Bsc), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), showed distinct vertical profiles influenced by planetary boundary layer (PBL) dynamics and regional transport processes. Near-surface concentrations of primary pollutants (SO2, NO, BC) generally decreased with altitude, whereas O3 levels increased. Notably, residual layers containing aged BC (300 m–1000 m altitude) were observed during early morning, with subsequent downward mixing to the surface following PBL development. A strong negative correlation between BC and O3 concentrations highlighted their antagonistic behavior in vertically stratified air masses. Vertical VOC distributions were dominated by light alkanes (C2-C4) and halocarbons, with profiles governed by their chemical lifetimes and transport mechanisms. A regional air pollution episode was observed in the high altitude atmosphere, characterized by elevated aerosol loading. WRF-Chem simulations revealed that episode was primarily driven by surface-level emissions from the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. These pollutants were uplifted to the convergence zone and subsequently transported over long distance to Northeast China. Our findings enhance the understanding of vertical pollution profiles and the complex interplay between regional transport and local air quality in Northeast China."

This study integrates ozone lidar observations, WRF-Chem modeling, and meteorological analyses to investigate the monthly and diurnal variations of ozone vertical profiles and its generation and transport mechanisms during a heatwave from July to September 2022 in Guangzhou. Results show that ozone concentrations were primarily confined below 2 km, with significantly higher levels in July compared to August and September, reaching a maximum of 420 μg m−3. WRF-Chem modeling identified photochemical reactions as the dominant driver of ozone formation, with average contributions of 5.9 ppb hr−1, 6.3 ppb hr−1, and 3.7 ppb hr−1 in July, August, and September, respectively. Vertical mixing and convective processes had minimal influence, while advective accumulation became increasingly significant with altitude. Meteorological analyses further indicated that the high temperature and low humidity caused by the subtropical high pressure system further intensified photochemical reactions and promoted ozone production. In addition, the south-westerly winds at the periphery of anticyclone drove ozone transport to downstream areas such as Fujian. This study advances our understanding of ozone vertical profiles and transport dynamics, providing critical insights for developing effective ozone pollution control strategies in the Pearl River Delta region."

We use the WRF-SMOKE-CMAQ modeling system to innovatively reconstruct the meteorologically-driven trends of PM2.5 pollution in Beijing from 2013 to 2023 by setting up fixed emission scenarios and minimize the interference of anthropogenic emissions. The results show that the heavy pollution frequency (HPF) in Beijing in winter is significantly correlated with the intensity of ENSO (r = 0.72, p < 0.05): the intensity of El Niño events is positively correlated with the HPF, and the intensity of La Niña events is negatively correlated with the HPF. Further analysis reveals that ENSO triggers anomalous 850 hPa southerly winds and 500 hPa northwesterly winds mainly through coupling with the East Asian Winter Monsoon, thus altering the low-level warm and humid transport and mid-level diffusion conditions. In addition, the ENSO-driven trans-regional transport also led to the formation of distinct spatial distribution patterns of pollution between Beijing and Tianjin–Tangshan areas."

The emissions computed are shown to be larger than known oil and gas sources, indicating that methane from coal mines may play a larger role in the global methane budget. The results are found to be slightly larger than or similar to satellite observational campaigns over the same region. 
 This work focuses on Changzhi, Shanxi, China, a city and surrounding rural region with one of the highest atmospheric concentrations of methane (CH4) worldwide (campaign-wide minimum, mean, standard deviation, and max observations: 2.0, 2.9, 1.3, and 16 ppm) due to a rapid increase in the mining, production, and use of coal over the past decade. An intensive 15 d surface observation campaign of CH4 concentration is used to drive a new analytical, mass-conserving method to compute and attribute CH4 emissions. Observations made in concentric circles at 1, 3, and 5 km around a high-production high gas coal mine yielded emissions of 0.73, 0.28, and 0.15 ppm min−1, respectively. For attribution a two-box mass-conserving model was used to identify the known mine's emissions from 0.042–5.3 ppm min−1 and a previously unidentified mine's emission from 0.22–7.9 ppm min−1. These results demonstrate the importance of simultaneously quantifying both the spatial and temporal distribution of CH4 emissions to better control regional-scale CH4 emissions. Results of the attribution are used in tandem with observations of boundary layer height to quantify policy-relevant emissions from the two coal mines as 6860 ± 3520 and 1010 ± 347 kg h−1, respectively. Both mines display a fat-tailed distribution, with respective 25th percentile, median, and 75th percentile values of [1600, 3070, 10 500]  and [755, 1090, 1420] kg h−1. These findings are demonstrated to be higher than CH4 emissions from equivalent oil and gas operations in the USA, with one about double and the other similar to day-to-day emissions inverted over 5 years using TROPOMI over the same region."

This study uses in situ data collected aboard passenger aircraft to assess the ability of four chemistry–climate models to reproduce (bi-)decadal climatologies of ozone, carbon monoxide, water vapour, and reactive nitrogen in this region. The models reproduce the very distinct ozone seasonality in the upper troposphere and in the lower stratosphere well. 
 Assessing global models in the upper troposphere (UT) and in the lowermost stratosphere (LS) is an important step toward a better understanding of the chemical composition near the tropopause. For this purpose, the current study focuses on an evaluation of long-term simulations from four chemistry–climate/transport models, based on In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS) measurements. Most simulations span the period from 1995 to 2017 and follow a common protocol among models. The assessment focuses on climatological averages of ozone (O3), water vapour (H2O), carbon monoxide (CO), and reactive nitrogen (NOy). In the extra-tropics, the models reproduce the seasonality of O3, H2O, and NOy in both the UT and LS, but none of them reproduce the CO springtime maximum in the UT. Tropospheric tracers (CO and H2O) tend to be underestimated in the UT, consistently with an overestimation of cross-tropopause exchanges. Most models systematically overestimate ozone in the UT, and the background of nitrogen oxides (NOx) appears to be the main contributor to ozone variability across the models. The partitioning between NOy species changes drastically across the models and acts as a source of uncertainty in the NOx mixing ratio and on the impact of these species on atmospheric composition. However, we highlight some well-reproduced geographical variations, such as the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) seasonal shifts above Africa and the correlation of extratropical ozone (H2O) in the LS (UT) with the observations. These features are encouraging with respect to the simulated dynamics in both layers. The current study confirms the importance of separating the UT and the LS with a dynamical tracer for the evaluation of model results and for model intercomparisons."

The model underestimates temperature, leading to an overprediction of contrail formation and larger ice-supersaturated regions. Adjusting the model improves temperature accuracy but adds uncertainties. Better predictions of contrail formation areas can help optimise flight tracks to reduce aviation's climate effect. 
 While carbon dioxide emissions from aviation often dominate climate change discussions, non-CO2 effects such as contrails and contrail cirrus must also be considered. Despite varying estimates of their radiative forcing, avoiding contrails is a reasonable strategy for reducing aviation’s climate effects. This study examines temperature and humidity, key atmospheric parameters for contrail formation, across different ECHAM/MESSy (European Centre Hamburg General Circulation Model/Modular Earth Submodel System) Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) model setups. EMAC, a general circulation model, is evaluated with various vertical resolutions and two nudging methods across seven specified dynamics setups. A higher vertical resolution aims to capture steep water vapour gradients near the tropopause, crucial for accurate contrail prediction. Comparisons with reanalysis data (March–April 2014) indicate a systematic cold bias (approximately 3–5 K in mid-latitudes), particularly in setups without mean temperature nudging. In the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, all simulations exhibit a wet bias, while lower altitudes display a dry bias, both affecting contrail formation estimates. Point-by-point comparisons along aircraft trajectories confirm similar biases. Sensitivity experiments with varying thresholds of relative humidity over ice illustrate trade-offs between achieving high hit rates and minimising false alarms in contrail detection. A single-day case study integrating aircraft and satellite observations demonstrates that EMAC’s predicted contrail coverage aligns well with the observed formation. These results suggest that, despite existing temperature and humidity biases, EMAC generally captures regions favourable for contrail formation across diverse atmospheric conditions. Addressing model biases by refining temperature and humidity representation could significantly improve contrail prediction accuracy, strengthening contrail-avoidance strategies and supporting climate-optimised flight routing to mitigate aviation's overall climate effect."

We estimated an average annual CH4 emission of 22.8 ± 2.4 Tg CH4 yr−1 (15.7–51.6 Tg CH4 yr−1). Emissions were intensified in 2016, 2020, and 2022, with the largest interannual variation coming from Western Siberia. Continued, all-season tower observations and improved soil moisture products are needed for future improvement of CH4 upscaling. 
 Wetlands are the largest natural source of methane (CH4) emissions globally. Northern wetlands (>45° N), accounting for 42 % of global wetland area, are increasingly vulnerable to carbon loss, especially as CH4 emissions may accelerate under intensified high-latitude warming. However, the magnitude and spatial patterns of high-latitude CH4 emissions remain relatively uncertain. Here, we present estimates of daily CH4 fluxes obtained using a new machine learning-based wetland CH4 upscaling framework (WetCH4) that combines the most complete database of eddy-covariance (EC) observations available to date with satellite remote-sensing-informed observations of environmental conditions at 10 km resolution. The most important predictor variables included near-surface soil temperatures (top 40 cm), vegetation spectral reflectance, and soil moisture. Our results, modeled from 138 site years across 26 sites, had relatively strong predictive skill, with a mean R2 of 0.51 and 0.70 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 30 and 27 nmol m−2 s−1 for daily and monthly fluxes, respectively. Based on the model results, we estimated an annual average of 22.8±2.4 Tg CH4 yr−1 for the northern wetland region (2016–2022), and total budgets ranged from 15.7 to 51.6 Tg CH4 yr−1, depending on wetland map extents. Although 88 % of the estimated CH4 budget occurred during the May–October period, a considerable amount (2.6±0.3 Tg CH4) occurred during winter. Regionally, the Western Siberian wetlands accounted for a majority (51 %) of the interannual variation in domain CH4 emissions. Overall, our results provide valuable new high-spatiotemporal-resolution information on the wetland emissions in the high-latitude carbon cycle. However, many key uncertainties remain, including those driven by wetland extent maps and soil moisture products and the incomplete spatial and temporal representativeness in the existing CH4 flux database; e.g., only 23 % of the sites operate outside of summer months, and flux towers do not exist or are greatly limited in many wetland regions.

Large uncertainties exist in the estimation of VOC emission intensities. Measurement- and calculation-based estimation methods have  limitations in representativeness and applicability, respectively. The inversion method based on downwind receptor monitoring was considered a more effective approach. In this research, a novel inverse dispersion method based on multiple fingerprint species for estimating the intensities of VOCs emissions from the chemical industry was developed. A coating production plant was selected as a case study for validation of this method, and the AERMOD model was utilized to establish the correlation coefficient matrix between the emission intensities of the source items and the concentrations at downwind receptor points. By leveraging the correlation coefficients for multiple fingerprint species and the source chemical profiles, the novel method exhibits good performance in the estimation accuracy. The overall source intensity of the target plant was estimated to be 91.3 mg/s with an overall uncertainty range of ±6.05% and equivalent contributions from aromatics, oxygenated, and halogenated VOCs, which are consistent with the measured intensity (82.6 mg/s) and chemical composition. The uncertainty ranges for the fingerprint species with an emission contribution of no less than 10% have been reduced to ±19.2%–71.7%.

 Methane is an important greenhouse gas contributing to global warming and climate change. The effective identification of atmospheric plumes in spatial images of methane concentration data retrieved from remote sensing is a critical step in quantifying emissions and ultimately helping to mitigate climate change by reducing large methane emission sources. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive efficient learning network (CELNet) for atmospheric plume detection, which is constructed with several deep neural modules and detects the shape of plumes in methane concentration images effectively. Specifically, to conduct an efficient plume identification, a generative module is constructed, which is tasked to generate feature maps for the characterisation of potential plumes in remotely sensed methane concentration data. This helps to reduce the search space in the detection implementation. Methane plumes in remotely sensed image data normally exhibit complex morphological structures with high background noise, which can interfere with the delineation of the shapes of plumes. Thus, the generative module alone cannot guarantee an accurate identification. To conduct high quality methane plume delineation, an extractor module is introduced to extract features that intrinsically characterise methane plumes in remotely sensed image data. The extracted intrinsic features are encoded using an encoder module for compact representation, which convey important information for implementing a better methane plume delineation. In particular, to enhance the capability of the generative module for generating accurate features, we structurally pair it with a discriminative module. In the training process, the discriminative module takes the generated features and the intrinsic features as inputs and improves its capability to discriminate the generated features from the intrinsic ones, whereas the generative module strives to generate accurate features that the discriminative module is unable to identify. They thus build an adversarial game which is beneficial for enhancing the feature generation capability of the generative module during the training process. The generated features along with the intrinsic features are then fed into the decoder module to produce accurate methane plume detection maps, where the intrinsic features incorporated provide additional supervision information that enables the CELNet to perform a more effective methane plume identification. We validate the proposed technique with different types of remote sensing image datasets (e.g., Landsat 5, AVIRIS-NG), and the accuracy achieved by CELNet outperforms the other comparison methods over 6%. This highlights its applicability for different sourced images with high performance, making it valuable for remote sensing community."

 Light-absorbing carbonaceous aerosols majorly contribute to regional air pollution over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP). This study examines a decade-long (2013−2023) measurement of in-situ Black Carbon (BC) concentrations, along with satellite-derived Absorbing Aerosol Index (AAI) and Fire Counts (FC), to analyse seasonal variations, trends and identify potential sources at a central IGP site. The analysis showed notable seasonal variations in BC, ranging from 0.11 to 62 μg m−3, with winter (W) peaking at 16 ± 10 μg m−3 and monsoon (M) at a low of 4 ± 2 μg m−3. Biomass burning (BB) contributed the most (32 ± 13 %) during the post-monsoon (PoM). The trend analysis showed a statistically significant (SS) decreasing trend in BC mass concentration of 0.57 μg m−3y−1 (6.7 % y−1). The SS decreasing rate observed in BC from fossil fuels (BCff) is 0.51 μg m−3y−1 and in BC from biomass burning (BCbb) is 0.06 μg m−3y−1. In comparison, the meteorological and satellite parameters show statistically insignificant change, pointing towards the effectiveness of policies such as Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), implications of Bharat Stage (BS) norms, emission control measures, and shifts towards cleaner fuels. A negligible fall in BCbb results in its increasing contribution (1.17 % y−1) towards BC, suggesting the need of aimed measures to deal with BB practices. During the PoM season, a peak in the high compensation parameter (K) of 0.00896 is observed, indicating freshly emitted BC aerosols typically associated with BB activities and fossil fuels. A high-frequency peak at a low K value (−0.00312) is observed during W only, indicating the presence of aged aerosols with enhanced scattering properties. Source apportionment analysis shows the dominant contribution to BC levels in the central IGP is mainly from the western part of the IGP."

This Earth energy imbalance has strengthened over the period 2001 to 2023 with satellite data. Here, we show that low climate sensitivity models fail to reproduce the trend in Earth energy imbalance, particularly in the individual longwave and shortwave contributions to the imbalance trend. The inability to produce a strong positive shortwave and strong negative longwave Earth energy imbalance trend is found to be a robust feature in the low climate sensitivity models, especially for models with a climate sensitivity below 2.5 kelvin. The negative longwave contribution to Earth energy imbalance is driven by surface temperature increases and is therefore most pronounced in high climate sensitivity models, whereas the shortwave contribution is generally positive and amplified by greater surface warming."

We developed an emission inversion system to assimilate satellite NO2 data to obtain daily kilometer-scale NOx emission inventories. Our results enhance inventory accuracy, allowing us to capture the effects of pollution control policies on daily emissions (e.g., during COVID-19 lockdowns) and improve fine-scale air quality modeling. 
 Accurate, timely, and high-resolution NOx emissions are essential for formulating pollution control strategies and improving the accuracy of air quality modeling at fine scales. Since late 2018, the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) aboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite has been providing daily monitoring of NO2 column concentrations with global coverage and a small footprint of 5.5 km × 3.5 km, offering great potential for tracking daily high-resolution NOx emissions. In this study, we develop a data assimilation and emission inversion framework that couples an ensemble Kalman filter with the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to estimate daily NOx emissions at 3 km scales in Beijing and surrounding areas in 2020. By assimilating the TROPOMI NO2 tropospheric vertical column densities (TVCDs) and taking the bottom-up inventory as prior emissions, we produce a posterior NOx emission dataset with a reasonable spatial distribution and daily variations at the 3 km scale. The proxy-based bottom-up emission mapping method at fine scales overestimates NOx emissions in densely populated urban areas, whereas our posterior emissions improve this mapping by reducing the overestimation of urban emissions and increasing emissions in rural areas. The posterior NOx emissions show considerable seasonal variations and provide a more timely insight into NOx emission fluctuations, such as those caused by the COVID-19 lockdown measures. Evaluations using the TROPOMI NO2 column retrievals and ground-based observations demonstrate that the posterior emissions substantially improve the accuracy of 3 km CMAQ simulations of the NO2 TVCDs as well as the daily surface NO2 and O3 concentrations in 2020. However, during summer, despite notable improvements in surface NO2 and O3 simulations, positive biases in the posterior model simulations persist, indicating weaker constraints on surface emissions from satellite NO2 column retrievals in summer. The posterior daily emissions on the 3 km scale estimated by our inversion system not only provide insights into the fine-scale emission dynamic patterns but also improve air quality modeling on the kilometer scale."

The present study demonstrates that lidars, which measure the backscattering behavior of aerosols over the entire visible wavelength range, can increase our knowledge of the spatial and temporal occurrence of aerosol layers, the type of aerosol, and their interaction with clouds. The focus of the publication is on wildfire aerosol and Saharan dust. 
 This study summarizes the results of the aerosol fluorescence measurements with the spectrometric fluorescence and Raman lidar RAMSES at the Lindenberg Meteorological Observatory, Germany, from 2020 to 2023. The focus is on findings that can only be obtained by spectrometric measurements and not with a single discrete fluorescence receiver channel. The measurement parameters that are useful in the spectral analysis are introduced. In particular, this includes the spectrum of the fluorescence capacity, which has proven to be instructive. A new method is described that has been employed to determine the aerosol source regions. It is based on the combination of ensemble back-trajectory calculations with satellite measurements of fires and aerosol plumes. A total of 14 RAMSES measurements are discussed, representing a selection of the most interesting measurement nights over the 4-year period. The emphasis is on biomass burning aerosol (BBA) in the free troposphere, but measurements of Saharan dust or boundary layer aerosol are also provided. Excited at a wavelength of 355 nm, the BBA fluorescence spectrum has a rounded shape with a maximum between about 500 and 550 nm. With height, it becomes increasingly Gaussian, and a shift towards longer wavelengths is generally observed (red shift). However, BBA layers which exhibit an opposite dependence (blue shift) can be found in specific cases as well. Overall, the spectral fluorescence capacity is high with values up to over 9×10-6 nm−1. Fluorescence spectra of Saharan dust, on the other hand, are skewed to short wavelengths. The fluorescence maxima are below 500 nm, and a linear decrease in the spectral backscatter coefficient can be seen at longer wavelengths; the spectral fluorescence capacity is low (<1×10-6 nm−1). Our statistical analyses show that the correlations between the characteristics of the fluorescence spectra and other parameters are relatively weak. Of the atmospheric state variables, the ambient temperature correlates best, and of the elastic-optical particle properties it is the particle depolarization ratio. In addition, indications are found for both BBA and Saharan dust that the spectral shape is influenced not only by the type but also by the source region of the aerosols, which would allow a more accurate aerosol typing if further substantiated. The importance of spectral fluorescence measurements for investigations of aerosol–cloud interaction is also highlighted. Measurement examples reveal cirrus nucleation at low supersaturation on contact with an optically extremely thin BBA filament at the tropopause and provide the clearest indication to date of interaction, rather than coexistence, between clouds with supercooled water droplets and BBA using lidar. This ground-breaking study opens up a new field in atmospheric and aerosol research with exciting prospects for future studies, some of which will be presented."

We developed a machine learning method to characterize aerosols using OMPS LP measurements about 60 times faster than the current approach. 
 Among aerosol characterization methods, limb scattering measurements provide both near-global coverage and information about how aerosol is vertically distributed through the atmosphere. Near-real-time retrievals of aerosols produced by volcanic eruptions are particularly important for aviation safety, but the radiative transfer modeling of scattering processes performed by traditional retrieval methods can be too computationally expensive for near-real-time applications without simplifying assumptions, depending on the instrument and available computational resources. Here we present a near-real-time approach based on neural networks (NNs) for aerosol retrievals from the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite's Limb Profiler (OMPS LP) instrument aboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite. We find it is at least 60 times faster than the current operational code and on average achieves agreement within 20 % at most altitudes and latitudes with sensitivity and non-negligible aerosol abundances. We also apply our trained NNs to measurements of the recent Shiveluch and Ruang eruptions from NOAA-21's OMPS LP and find results consistent with the operational retrieval algorithm, indicating our methodology generalizes to future iterations of the same instrument without retraining the NNs."

Specific humidity and integrated water vapor from the COSMIC Data Analysis and Archive Center (CDAAC) and the Wegener Center (WEGC) are compared with the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS), showing that GNSS-RO adds vertically resolved data. Despite a slight low bias, combining GNSS-RO and SSMIS improves AR analysis. 
 Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are comparatively narrow regions in the atmosphere that are responsible for most of the horizontal transport of water vapor in the extratropics, which are responsible for many extreme precipitation events and flooding at midlatitudes, including Europe and the US. The critical role of ARs in global moisture transport and precipitation dynamics necessitates accurate water vapor measurements for both understanding and forecasting these phenomena. While the integrated water vapor content (IWV) of ARs can be measured well with microwave and infrared sounders, the vertical structure is less well known. In this study, we analyzed whether specific humidity profiles and IWV values from Global Navigation Satellite System Radio Occultation (GNSS-RO) measurements provide additional information for the study of ARs, in particular regarding their vertical structure. The retrieval of water vapor from GNSS-RO data requires background information, which is usually incorporated by the one-dimensional variational method (1D-Var) that combines observations and background in an optimal manner. We compared data from the COSMIC Data Analysis and Archive Center (CDAAC), operated by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) in Boulder, Colorado, with data from the Wegener Center for Climate and Global Change (WEGC) at the University of Graz, Austria. We found that retrievals from both centers agree very well in the altitude range, where the 1D-Var weights the observations strongly, even if the employed background profiles are very different. This demonstrates that GNSS-RO data indeed provide additional vertically resolved information, which was not already contained in the background or in operational analyses. IWV values from CDAAC and WEGC generally agree very well; however, both tend to underestimate the values obtained by Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMI/S) data, since GNSS-RO profiles do not always reach the lowermost part of the atmosphere, leading to a systematic bias in the IWV data, which decreases with better penetration characteristics of the GNSS-RO data. The results suggest that it is promising to combine the GNSS-RO data – with very high vertical resolution with SSMI/S data – with high horizontal resolution to get a more compete view of the 3D structure of ARs."

 Our understanding of how rapid Arctic warming and permafrost thaw affect global climate dynamics is restricted by limited spatiotemporal data coverage due to logistical challenges and the complex landscape of Arctic regions. It is therefore crucial to make best use of the available observations, including the integrated data analysis across disciplines and observational platforms.

This innovative approach outperforms traditional models, which take hours to produce a forecast and use high-energy supercomputers. By making high-quality dust monitoring accessible and efficient, DustNet can improve weather, climate, and air quality forecasts. 
 Suspended in the atmosphere are millions of tonnes of mineral dust that interact with weather and climate. Accurate representation of mineral dust in weather models is vital, yet it remains challenging. Large-scale weather models use supercomputers and take hours to complete forecasts. Such computational burdens allow them to include only monthly climatological means of mineral dust as input states, inhibiting their forecasting accuracy. Here, we introduce DustNet, a simple, accurate, and fast forecasting model for predictions 24 h in advance of aerosol optical depth (AOD). DustNet is a custom-built 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) equipped with transposed convolution layers. The model is trained on selected ERA5 meteorology and past MODIS AOD observational data as inputs. Our design of DustNet ensures that the model trains in less than 8 min and creates predictions in 2.1 s on a desktop computer, without the need to utilise any graphics processing units (GPUs). Predictions created by DustNet outperform the state-of-the-art physics-based model at coarse 1°×1° resolution at 95 % of grid locations when compared to ground truth satellite data. The test results show that the daily mean AOD over the entire Saharan desert area is highly correlated with MODIS observational data, with Pearson's r2=0.91. Our results demonstrate DustNet's potential for fast and accurate AOD forecasting, which can easily be utilised by researchers without access to supercomputers or GPUs."

The emission rates of isoprene and monoterpenes, their synthesis capacities, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were determined to investigate how heat stress modulates O3 effects.

Isoprene (Hedges’g = 2.91) and monoterpene (Hedges’g = 2.52) emission rates were inhibited by short-term EH across the five O3 treatments. However, isoprene emission rates generally recovered during the post-EH period, except under the highest O3 exposure (NF80). EH also shifted isoprene’s response to O3 from being synthesis-driven to ROS-driven. Although the monoterpene emission rate response to O3 was driven by synthesis capacity in the pre-EH period, this response became less explainable by either factor post-EH. These findings emphasize the profound effects of EH on the BVOC response to O3, providing crucial insights for predicting regional BVOC emissions under future climate scenarios."

Fu;Kai Chen;Yang Liu,Fire Smoke Elevated the Carbonaceous PM2.5 Concentration and Mortality Burden in the Contiguous U.S. and Southern Canada,"Despite emerging evidence on the health impacts of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from wildland fire smoke, the specific effects of PM2.5 composition on health outcomes remain uncertain. We developed a three-level, chemical transport model-based framework to estimate daily full-coverage concentrations of smoke-derived carbonaceous PM2.5, specifically organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC), at a 1 × 1 km2 spatial resolution from 2002 to 2019 across the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) and Southern Canada (SC). A 10-fold random cross-validation confirmed robust performance, with daily R2 = 0.77 (OC) and 0.80 (EC) in the smoke-off scenario and 0.67 (OC) and 0.71 (EC) in the smoke-on scenario, and exceeded 0.90 at the monthly scale after residual adjustment. Modeling results indicated that increases in wildland fire smoke have offset approximately one-third of the improvements in background air quality. In recent years, wildland fire smoke has become more frequent and carbonaceous PM2.5 concentrations have intensified, especially in the Western CONUS and Southwestern Canada. Wildfire season is also starting earlier and lengthens throughout the year, leading to more population being exposed. We estimated that long-term exposure to fire smoke carbonaceous PM2.5 is responsible for approximately 7455 and 259 non-accidental deaths annually in the CONUS and SC, respectively, with associated annual monetized damage of 68.3 billion USD for the CONUS and 1.9 billion CAD for SC. The Southeastern CONUS, where prescribed fires are prevalent, contributed most to these health impacts and monetized damages. Our findings offer critical insights to inform policy development and assess future health burdens associated with fire smoke exposure."

However, pollution measurements are often sparse. Common methods to address this gap are chemistry transport models (CTMs) and air pollution interpolation models. Nonetheless, many of these models have poor performances and intrinsic systematic biases. Here, a machine education approach, which integrates a CTM and in situ measurements with Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, is proposed for generating dense pollution maps with enhanced accuracy. Specifically, the CHIMERE CTM is combined with  a Neural Network, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), or Random Forest AI methods. The results show that the educated machine models significantly improved predictions of air pollution levels compared to the standalone CTM. The machine education model combining a neural network with  CHIMERE performed best among all models, followed closely by the educated model with XGBoost, while the Random Forest model trailed. Relative to CHIMERE, the proposed models achieved reductions of up to 51.34% and 50.54% in the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), respectively, for NO2. For PM2.5, the models demonstrated relative reductions of up to 40.08% and 36.54%, respectively. CHIMERE exhibited an inherent systematic underestimation bias, characterized by mean fractional bias (MFB) values of 0.509 and 0.725 for NO2 and PM2.5, respectively. Our models successfully eliminated this bias. Furthermore, promising dense air pollution maps were generated using our models."

An In‐Depth Mechanism Analysis From the Underlying Code,"Parameterization schemes undergo continuous updates, with most refinements documented in code implementations, necessitating in‐depth code analysis for evaluation. Focusing on PM2.5‐O3 composite pollution in the Beijing‐Tianjin‐Hebei region, 10 planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes were evaluated for their simulation performance. The 2‐m temperature (T2) demonstrates daytime dependence on temperature gradient and transport coefficient, shifting to surface temperature dominance at night. Saturated mixing ratio predominantly governs 2‐m relative humidity (RH2) variations, while 10‐m wind speed (WS10) derives from the first‐level wind speed. Vertical profile comparisons reveal degraded simulation accuracy at lower levels, attributed to human activities’ influences within the PBL. The total energy‐mass flux scheme exhibited distinct deviations due to failure to recognize the existence of shallow cumulus, consequently suppressing vertical mixing. Turbulent diffusion coefficient (K) discrepancies in nonlocal closure schemes primarily stem from PBL height (PBLH) variations, whereas local closure schemes show mixing length dominance (∼63%). Dissipation rate considerations exert stronger impacts at lower levels. For hybrid schemes, K calculated by Monin‐Obukhov similarity theory shows enhanced magnitudes during daytime. Statistical analysis indicates the Mellor‐Yamada‐Janjić scheme's minor T2 deficiencies become insignificant when weighed against its superior vertical profiles of T, RH, and WS10. These insights offer critical references for PBL scheme optimization."

WRF‐Chem is one of the state‐of‐the‐art air quality models currently available, but challenges still exist in its simulation of ozone pollution, which are partly due to its strong dependence on the accuracy of initial conditions, boundary conditions, and emissions. To improve the accuracy of ozone predictions, this study assimilated ground‐based monitoring and satellite data to improve initial and boundary conditions during a typical ozone pollution episode in YRD region. As a result, compared with station observations, the R and RMSE of model simulation are greatly improved. Additionally, the emission inventory during this event was inverted and then used to drive the model to re‐simulate this event, and the simulation results are improved. Furthermore, based on the new emissions, we conducted three emission reduction scenario simulations to distinguish ozone sensitivity region. Ozone formation was in a VOC‐limited regime in south Jiangsu during the study period. For north Zhejiang, transitional and NOx‐limited regimes occurred alternately. It is worth noting that the ozone sensitivity regimes derived from the original emission inventory were not consistent with those obtained from the improved emission inventory. A comparison with satellite‐derived OMI HCHO/NO2 data confirmed that the conclusions based on the updated emission inventory were more consistent. This study highlights that relying on current emission data for policy formulation may result in strategic errors."

Their atmospheric behavior evolves during aging, necessitating chemical characterization to elucidate their environmental and climatic impacts. Despite this, detailed studies of BCc compositions and evolution under current atmospheric conditions remain scarce. In this study, we deployed a soot particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SP‐AMS) alongside advanced instrumentation during a month‐long field campaign in Beijing in autumn 2022 to examine the chemical compositions and evolution of BCc. Our results reveal a strong link between BCc coatings and air pollution levels, with organic compounds and nitrate as the predominant coating materials. Nitrate displayed pronounced temperature sensitivity and uneven distribution between BCc and other sub‐micron particles. During high‐ozone pollution episodes, secondary organic aerosols dominated the organic fraction of BCc coatings, whereas in lower‐ozone conditions, secondary contributions elevated with increasing air pollution, likely driven by aqueous‐phase reactions. Hygroscopicity estimates for BCc and bulk PM1, derived from the Zdanovskii−Stokes−Robinson mixing rule, consistently diverged, with differences diminishing as coatings thickened. These findings provide critical insights into the atmospheric fate of BCc, underscoring the pivotal role of chemical characterization in understanding their behavior and broader implications for climate and air quality."

Comparison of dust records from the northern and southern slopes of the Himalayas indicates that the ice core from the southern slopes has preserved higher dust concentrations and larger particle sizes than records from the northern slopes. Furthermore, the TB core record shows 50‐ to 70‐year multidecadal variability, positively correlated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO).

Here the authors estimate that climate-change-driven changes in fire emissions could increase iron deposition in ocean ecosystems, enhancing productivity particularly in the North Atlantic. 
 Rapid shifts in fire regimes affect the carbon cycle by releasing carbon and nutrients such as iron (Fe), potentially enhancing marine productivity and carbon export. Here we use fire emission projections and Earth system models to examine how climate-driven changes in fire emissions may alter soluble Fe (SFe) deposition and productivity. By century’s end, climate change could increase Fe emissions from fires by 1.7–1.8 times beyond projections considering only direct human influences. Model projections show rising SFe deposition in Northern Hemisphere high latitudes under increasing socio-economic activity, potentially boosting the impact of SFe deposition on productivity in the Fe-limited North Atlantic by up to 20% annually (40% in summer), assuming stable macronutrient levels. However, declining macronutrient availability may shrink Fe-limited areas, where climate-driven fires could offset productivity losses by 7–8%. In the Southern Ocean, fossil fuel emissions primarily control SFe deposition, as reductions in anthropogenic fires counterbalance climate-driven increases. Fire emissions can be an important source of nutrients such as iron, particularly for the oceans. Here the authors estimate that climate-change-driven changes in fire emissions could increase iron deposition in ocean ecosystems, enhancing productivity particularly in the North Atlantic."

 Anthropogenic fossil fuel CO2 emissions play a crucial role in the distribution of atmospheric CO2 concentrations, making the quantification of these emissions essential for global and regional carbon cycle research. In this study, we simulated global atmospheric CO2 concentrations by substituting anthropogenic emission inventories based on a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) to assess the impact of two widely used global CO2 emission inventories (ODIAC and EDGAR) on the simulations. The findings indicated that while the two emission inventories exhibited similar spatiotemporal distributions, discrepancies of up to 10 gC/m2/d were observed. The simulation results using the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) inventory were more closely aligned with ground-based station observations, with a correlation coefficient of 0.92 and an average bias of 0.09 ppm. Anthropogenic CO2 emissions contributed to an average global column-averaged dry air mole fraction of CO2 (XCO2) increase of 7.01 ppm from 2018 to 2020. High-emission regions correspond to areas of significant XCO2 growth, particularly in the industrialized northern extratropics, with XCO2 increases reaching up to 11.59 ppm. The sensitivity of simulated XCO2 to uncertainties in anthropogenic CO2 emission inventories was highest in western Europe and lower in Oceania and South America. This study highlights the impact of anthropogenic emissions on the spatiotemporal distribution of atmospheric CO2 and emphasizes the critical importance to improve the reliability of fossil fuel emission estimates in CO2 simulations."

The impact on stratiform precipitation differ in layers. •Aerosol pollution enhances the coalescence process and weakens the breakup process during the warm-rain process. •The impacts of RH and CAPE on aerosol-influenced precipitation microphysical processes are the opposite. 
 Aerosols influence precipitation processes through complex mechanisms, yet their effects on different precipitation types and regional characteristics remain insufficiently understood, particularly in coastal high-pollution areas such as the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). This study investigates the response characteristics of convective and stratiform precipitation to clean, coarse aerosol-polluted, and fine aerosol-polluted conditions using summer data from 2014 to 2023 from GPM DPR, MERRA-2, Himawari-8/9 AHI, and ERA-5 over the YRD, and further explores the sensitivity of aerosols to thermodynamic (RH) and dynamic (CAPE) meteorological conditions. Key findings include: (1) In convective precipitation, the suppression of precipitation and lowering of cloud-top height under coarse aerosol-polluted conditions result from moisture competition, whereas the enhancement of precipitation under fine aerosol-polluted conditions is attributed to the condensation nuclei enhancement and coalescence growth effect. (2) Stratiform precipitation exhibits a “lower-layer promotion-upper-layer inhibition” boomerang variation effect under polluted conditions. (3) Aerosol pollution enhances the coalescence process and weakens the breakup process (which was more significant under coarse aerosol-polluted conditions). (4) Under polluted conditions, the increase in RH leads to enhanced coalescence and suppressed breakup, whereas the elevation of CAPE results in the opposite effect on these processes. These findings highlight the critical role of aerosol type in modulating precipitation mechanisms, providing a foundation for refining parameterizations in weather and climate models."

 To study the distribution characteristics of aerosols and clouds in South China under the influence of typical weather systems such as the southern trough, this paper analyzed the distribution and sources of aerosols and cloud droplets based on six flight observations conducted in Guangdong during the spring of 2024. The results indicated that aerosol number concentrations often peak above cloud tops or in the regions between two cloud layers. The average aerosol number concentration outside the clouds at high altitudes (2000–4100 m) ranged from 501 to 1617 cm−3, while in the near-surface layer it was 970 to 2168 cm−3, with an effective diameter averaging 0.27 to 0.5 μm. The concentration inside the clouds significantly decreased, and the diameter increased. The aerosol particle spectrum displayed a bimodal distribution, with peaks at 0.15 μm and 0.29 μm. The number concentration of particles smaller than 0.3 μm within the clouds declined, while the proportion of particles larger than 0.5 μm increased. The cloud droplet spectrum displayed a multimodal distribution, with the main peak occurring at a diameter of around 5 μm and secondary peaks found at diameters in the range of 10 to 16 μm. As the cloud layer thickened, the droplet spectrum broadened, large droplet concentrations increased, and small droplet concentrations decreased. Under the influence of non-precipitating stratus clouds in South China, the average aerosol scavenging efficiency was 0.47. The mean cloud droplet number concentration, liquid water content, and effective diameter were 67.3 cm−3, 0.02 g·m−3, and 9.4 μm, respectively. Long-range transport originating from South Asia and Southeast Asia is suggested as a potential contributing factor to the elevated high-altitude aerosol concentrations. The research findings deepen the understanding of cloud and aerosol microphysical characteristics in the South China region. This contributes to the evaluation of climate models and provides guidance for artificial weather modification operations."

The fate of nascent particles is dependent on their ability to take up water, a process influenced by particle size, composition, and morphology. However, there is a lack of comprehensive characterization of the hygroscopic properties of sub-20 nm particles that are compositionally similar to those of atmospheric new particles, leading to uncertainties in predicting their growth and survival. In this study, we examine the hygroscopic properties of particles composed of both inorganic (NaCl and gas-phase reaction products of sulfuric acid and ammonia) and organic components (derived from α-pinene oxidation) by tandem differential mobility analysis. For NaCl-organic particles, we find that the organic coating reduces the particle deliquescence relative humidity (DRH), efflorescence relative humidity (ERH), and hygroscopic growth factor (GF). These reductions are size-dependent, but the Zdanovskii–Stokes–Robinson (ZSR) rule successfully predicts the particle GF once the Kelvin effect is considered. In contrast, particles containing sulfuric acid-ammonia reaction products exhibit no well-defined DRH or ERH. These particles, which are rich in acids, progressively approach the behavior of ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4) as their size increases. The ZSR rule underestimates the particle GF, possibly due to partial mixing of the organic and aqueous phases. Based on our experimental data, simulations of particle growth show that incorporating hygroscopic growth is essential for accurately estimating particle survival probabilities, even at moderate relative humidity. Our findings enhance the understanding of the factors governing water uptake by atmospheric new particles and contribute to the development of more accurate models for simulating new particle growth."

We investigates the radiative feature of high-altitude flying targets and finds that their thermal radiation peaks are primarily distributed in the 10.3–12.5 μm band. Additionally, a significant altitude-dependent difference in transmittance is observed at 11.72 μm, which helps suppress background interference and enhances the reliability of target detection. And an innovative detection method for wide-area flying target is developed, combined YOLOv11n-based deep learning algorithms with in-situ radiative characteristics including the top of atmosphere radiance, temperature contrast, SCR to enhance detection accuracy. This technology provides an effective and robust new approach for all-weather detection of maneuverable flight targets on a global scale, demonstrating the significant potential of intelligent technology in the field of thermal infrared remote sensing applications. Moreover the in situ data allows for quantitative measurement of the radiative feature of flight targets, providing essential data for research on infrared and atmospheric transmittance."

Levy,Smoke absorption retrieval algorithm using critical reflectance method with geostationary satellite over North America,"•First-ever smoke SSA retrieval at 3 km and 5–10 min resolution via remote sensing. •CR-retrieved SSA closely matches collocated AERONET SSA, mostly within ±0.01. •CR method can be effectively applied to smoke over diverse geographical regions. 
 In recent years, increasing wildfire activity in the western United States has led to significant emissions of smoke aerosols, impacting the atmospheric energy balance through their absorption and scattering properties. Single scattering albedo (SSA) is a key parameter that governs these radiative effects, but accurately retrieving SSA from satellites remains challenging due to limitations in sensor resolution, low sensitivity of traditional remote sensing methods, and uncertainties in radiative transfer modeling, particularly from surface reflectance and aerosol characterization. Smoke optical properties evolve rapidly after emission, influenced by fuel type, combustion conditions, and chemical aging. Accurate SSA retrieval near the source thus requires high-temporal-resolution satellite observations. Critical Reflectance (CR) method provides this capability by identifying a unique reflectance value at which top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance becomes insensitive to aerosol loading and primarily reflects aerosol absorption. SSA can be retrieved from this critical reflectance. This study presents a geostationary-based CR method using the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) on GOES-R satellites. The approach leverages ABI’s high temporal (5–10 min) and spatial (3 km) resolution, consistent viewing geometry, and wide coverage. A tailored look-up table, based on an AOD-dependent smoke model for North America, links CR to SSA. Case studies show strong agreement with AERONET measurements, with retrieval differences mostly within 0.01—well below AERONET’s ±0.03 uncertainty. The method captures temporal and spatial variations in smoke absorption and demonstrates robustness across daylight hours. This GEO-based CR approach offers an effective tool for high-resolution SSA retrieval, contributing to improved aerosol radiative forcing estimates and climate modeling."

 The impact of wildfire smoke on surface air quality is examined for one of the largest metro areas in the United States (Phoenix, Arizona) as a case study of urban areas in arid regions. While many studies have examined direct smoke impacts at surface level, the present work seeks to also identify the composite impact of smoke throughout the atmospheric column on surface air quality. O3 and PM2.5 concentrations increased on smoke days compared to no smoke days, although increases in these pollutants were not distributed equally across the study region. O3 and PM2.5 showed concurrent increases on smoke days, while no relationship between the two was found for no smoke days. Smoke days tended to have higher mean daily air temperatures than no smoke days (34.1 °C vs. 32.9 °C, respectively). Given that the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for O3 was exceeded on 51 % of smoke days compared to 28 % of no smoke days examined, results of this work highlight the need to understand the mechanisms by which wildfire smoke throughout the atmospheric column impacts surface air quality to develop effective strategies for protecting vulnerable populations and improving air quality."

 Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a key parameter for evaluating climate change and air quality, yet ground-based AOD observations in China remain limited, and satellite data often suffer from acquisition gaps due to cloud cover. Surface visibility (VIS) offers a promising alternative for AOD retrieval, but the relationship between VIS and AOD is complex and shaped by multiple factors such as meteorological conditions, the vertical distribution of aerosols, topography, and population density. This study systematically explored the influence of these factors on the hourly VIS–AOD relationship, using over ∼2300 automatic VIS measurements and Himawari-8 satellite-retrieved AOD data collected across China from 2016 to 2021. The results reveal significant spatiotemporal variations in the VIS–AOD relationship, with stronger diurnal aerosol fluctuations in eastern China compared to the west, and a consistent inverse correlation between VIS and AOD. The correlation peaks in the late afternoon and reaches a seasonal maximum during winter. These relationships are influenced not only by regional meteorological thresholds but also by constraints from aerosol vertical distribution patterns and geographical conditions. Crucially, adjusting the AOD by incorporating the planetary boundary layer height markedly improves its correlation with VIS, underscoring the importance of daily planetary boundary layer dynamics. These findings offer valuable insights for refining hourly AOD retrieval methods from VIS, thereby enhancing the understanding of aerosol behavior across China."

 The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) suffers severe surface ozone (O3) pollution during summer (June-July-August, JJA). Elucidating the role of meteorology and emissions is crucial for effective controls on O3 pollution. We used the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) - Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system to quantify the influences of meteorology, anthropogenic and biogenic emissions on O3 variations in the YRD between 2019 and 2022. Contrasting trends in surface O3 were found in the Hangzhou Bay (HZB) (3.3 μg m−3 yr−1) and the rest of the YRD (−1.9 μg m−3 yr−1). Underlying factors affecting surface O3 differed between these two subregions. In HZB, meteorological variations dominated the strong O3 increase with a contribution of ∼94 %. By contrast, in the rest of the YRD, meteorology (42 %) and anthropogenic emissions (53 %) were both key contributors to the modest O3 decrease. Our results reveal a shift in O3 drivers in contrast to 2013–2019, characterized by an increasing importance of meteorology and a decreasing contribution of anthropogenic emissions. Consequently, the anthropogenically driven O3 decrease, which ensues from current pollutant control policies, is difficult to offset the strong positive meteorological influence such as in HZB. There is an urgent need for stricter and more efficient control of O3 precursor emissions to mitigate the substantial influences of meteorology. Emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds are of particular concern, as they are still on the rise."

 To prevent poor air quality during the Beijing Winter Olympics (BWO), substantial air pollution control measures were implemented in Beijing and surrounding cities. However, the actual causal effects of these measures remain uncertain, primarily due to the difficulty of establishing an appropriate control group under complex meteorological conditions and high anthropogenic emissions in cold season. This study addresses that challenge by employing an artificial intelligence (AI)-based Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) model to estimate the causal effects of intervention measures. Utilizing temporal-related proxies, meteorological data, and PM2.5 concentration records from 2015 to 2021, counterfactual PM2.5 concentrations were first predicted using a Random Forest-Long Short-Term Memory (RF-LSTM) hybrid model, which generated a covariate for the BSTS model to enable robust causal inference with minimal parametric assumptions. The results indicate that, in the absence of interventions, Beijing's PM2.5 during the Winter Olympics would have been 20 μg/m3 (34 %) higher. The implemented measures significantly reduced peak PM2.5 levels during the Winter Olympics and Winter Paralympics. Rigorous validation confirmed the accuracy of the predicted counterfactual PM2.5 concentration, thereby strengthening the reliability of the causal inference results. Overall, the AI-based BSTS approach effectively quantified the PM2.5 reductions attributable to the air quality assurance measures during the BWO, providing strong evidence for the effectiveness of pollution control efforts."

 Aerosols, which offset a third of the greenhouse gas forcing, remain the primary source of uncertainty in climate monitoring. Satellite products, models, or reanalyses provide time series of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), each with distinct strengths and weaknesses. This study evaluates the temporal stability of these datasets from 2003 to 2022 using spatially representative long-term AERONET measurements as a reference.AOD has decreased globally since 2015, driven by anthropogenic emissions reduction in Europe, the US, and particularly in East Asia. Aerosols continue to rise in India due to growing anthropogenic emissions, and in South America due to a shift from declining to increasing organic matter aerosol trends. While all products capture these regional trends, they diverge in terms of magnitude, seasonal variability, and temporal patterns. Only CAMS EAC4 reanalysis reproduces the AOD decrease observed at AERONET stations in Europe and the US with a trend in the bias below 5%/decade. The other products evaluated show drifts above 10%/decade, underestimating the AOD decrease in these regions. MERRA-2 and the C3S multi-satellite products exhibit spurious jumps likely caused by methodological changes. Satellite-based (MODIS and MISR) AOD trends have a positive drift compared to AERONET, potentially due to the use of static aerosol composition datasets. The low satellite revisit time and a calibration drift could also contribute to the MISR spurious trend. An analysis of the reduced temporal sampling of satellites revealed that the impact at the station level is small, suggesting that the drifts found can be attributed to the products. Our results suggest that the aerosol Essential Climate Variable could be better served by reanalysis rather than by direct satellite observations."

Using the satellite-based high-resolution PHLET inversion, we derived city-level NOX emissions in China from 2012 to 2020.

Finally, the Covid-19 lockdown had an impact on NMHC concentrations, reaching a 50 % decrease for traffic-related sources. 
 Long-term measurements of volatile organic compound (VOC) concentrations are crucial to improve our knowledge about their role in atmospheric chemistry, especially in regions with high photochemistry, such as the Mediterranean Basin. A field measurement campaign of 18 months has been conducted in Marseille from March 2019 to August 2020 with online measurements of C2 to C16 non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) using two thermal desorber–gas chromatography–flame ionization detector (TD-GC-FID) instruments. The positive matrix factorization model has been applied to this dataset for each season. Six yearlong factors were identified (traffic exhaust, fuel evaporation, industrial sources, shipping, regional and local urban backgrounds, and IVOCs), and two  seasonal factors were identified  (biogenic sources in summer and residential heating during cold periods).Traffic (exhaust and evaporation) is the largest contributor to  measured NMHC concentrations, with a relative contribution of about 40 %, with the exception of spring 2020, where the relative contribution was only 25 %. The potential contribution of each factor to secondary pollutant formation has been evaluated. Results reveal that the shipping source is potentially one of the most important contributors to secondary organic aerosol formation potential, despite the low contribution of this factor to NMHC concentrations.The impact of the lockdown due to Covid-19 is clearly visible across all sources, especially the traffic source. The contribution of this source decreased by half during spring 2020 in comparison with other seasons.A comparison of these results with emission inventories may be useful to evaluate their accuracy for a better understanding of the atmospheric pollution occurring in Marseille."

N. Power;Aldona Wiacek,"On path length, beam divergence, and retroreflector array size in open-path FTIR spectroscopy","The choice of path length and retroreflector array size in open-path Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy must be made with care.  Longer paths increase target gas absorption (lowering detection limits), and larger retroreflector arrays increase the return signal (improving retrieved concentration precision), but there are limitations to both. An optimum array size and path combination exists in each specific observational environment and application, as explored in this work. 
 Open-path Fourier transform infrared (OP-FTIR) spectroscopy is an established technique used to measure boundary layer trace gas concentrations, consisting (in this work) of a spectrometer with an active mid-IR source coupled to a single transmitting and receiving telescope, as well as a cube-corner retroreflector array separated from the spectrometer and telescope by an atmospheric path. The detection limit at first increases with increasing optical path length (OPL) in the atmosphere, which controls target gas spectral absorption depth; however, open-path beam divergence can lead to overfilling of the distant retroreflector array for separations greater than ∼ 150 m (OPL ∼ 300 m; the details depend on specifics of spectrometer and telescope optics, plus array size), resulting in decreased returning radiation at the detector. In this case, the absorption signature of the target gas increases, but the signal-to-noise ratio of the recorded spectrum decreases. We present the results of theoretical spectral simulations for formaldehyde (HCHO) that show how path length, interfering water concentration, and HCHO target concentration affect the expected differential absorption spectrum of the HCHO target at 1 ppb. HCHO serves as a proxy for any low-abundance trace gas with relatively weak absorption features, which makes it sensitive to changes in the performance and setup of the OP-FTIR system, as explored in this study. We demonstrate that optical path lengths  >∼ 300 m are necessary for robust HCHO spectral signatures (at our typical random plus systematic noise levels). Next, we present the results of two field experiments where the retroreflector array area was increased to collect a larger fraction of returning radiation, at two-way path lengths ranging from 50 to 1300 m. We confirm that the larger retroreflector array resulted in a slower decrease in the signal as a function of optical path length. Finally, we perform retrievals of HCHO concentrations from spectra collected at the same field site and path length in Halifax Harbour during 2018 and 2021, with a smaller and a larger retroreflector array, respectively. We demonstrate that retrievals based on larger retroreflector array spectra exhibit ∼2× higher precision (average standard deviation in hourly formaldehyde data bins over 2 d), even though systematic errors remain in the fitted spectra, due to water vapour. Where systematic fitting errors in interfering species (e.g., water) are significant, a longer path may not be optimal for a given target gas, leading instead to biased retrievals; moreover, at very long optical path lengths the signal-to-noise ratio decreases with increasing water vapour due to broadband mid-IR spectrum signal reduction in water-saturated regions. We discuss factors to consider in the choice of path length and retroreflector array size in open-path FTIR spectroscopy, which must be made with care."

Gijsbert Tilstra;David P. Donovan;Gerd-Jan van Zadelhoff;J. Pepijn Veefkind,Improvements in aerosol layer height retrievals from TROPOMI oxygen A-band measurements by surface albedo fitting in optimal estimation,"The aerosol layer height (ALH) from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) has been constantly improved since its release in 2019. Over bright surfaces, fitting the albedo improved the retrieval, as shown for a set of situations, ranging from multiple layers of smoke to thick desert dust plumes and low-altitude industrial pollution. The latest results of the operational ALH are compared to profiles from the ATmospheric LIDar (ATLID) on board the recently launched EarthCARE mission. 
 The aerosol layer height (ALH), from the Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI L2_AER_LH product, is based on an optimal estimation (OE) approach, fitting cloud-free measurements to synthetic reflectances in the strongest oxygen absorption band, provided by a neural network trained with high-resolution simulated reflectances. The ALH has been continuously improved since its release in 2019, focusing especially on (bright) land surfaces, over which the ALH product showed  underestimated ALHs (biased towards the surface).  This paper describes the latest updates of the ALH product, which includes first the introduction of the directional Lambertian-equivalent reflectance (DLER) climatology to improve the surface albedo characterization over land. Second, the paper describes a further improvement, adding the surface albedo in the feature vector of the OE inversion, using the DLER as prior information. Using this approach, the retrievals over land largely match the retrievals over ocean, which have shown a good comparison with validation data since its release, most notably with Cloud-Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) weighted extinction heights. The albedo is fitted for both land and ocean surfaces, but the implementation is different over land and ocean because of the large range of land surface albedos. Over land, the a priori surface albedo values are relaxed so the fitting procedure can incorporate the albedo effects in the retrieval over land. Over ocean, the retrievals are optimized by tuning the a priori error settings. The current implementation improves retrievals over land with approximately 1.5 times more converged results and decreases land–ocean contrasts in the ALH retrievals. The average difference between CALIOP weighted extinction height decreased for selected cases from approximately −1.9 to −0.9 km over land and from approximately −0.8 to +0.1 km over ocean. An independent verification with ATmospheric LIDar (ATLID) data from EarthCARE showed consistent behaviour between the new operational data and the test cases."

Multispectral satellite instruments such as Sentinel‐2 offer frequent global coverage, making them suitable for monitoring methane super‐emitters worldwide. However, automatically detecting methane emissions from the vast amount of noisy multispectral satellite data remains challenging. Recent studies have shown that deep learning is promising for this task, but it requires a large set of representative training samples, which are still limited. Hyperspectral data, particularly from airborne sources, are relatively mature and have accumulated some data sets, for example, from Carbon Mapper. Here, we develop PlumeBed, which consists of a synthetic image generation module and a domain adversarial neural network (DANN) module. The synthetic image generation module synthesizes training data by combining Carbon Mapper methane plumes and Sentinel‐2 background noises. The DANN module is then trained to detect methane plumes from Sentinel‐2 images. Evaluation against testing data sets compiled from previously reported super‐emitters shows that the PlumeBed detector achieves an average macro‐F1 score of 0.86, outperforming the conventional deep learning frameworks such as ResNet‐50. We further apply PlumeBed to a previously unseen region in the Dauletabad gas field of Turkmenistan. This application unveils 14 methane super‐emitters based on 1‐year of Sentinel‐2 data.

 Large-scale quasi-stationary Rossby waves in the tropospheric jet stream favour spatially compounding hot–dry and cold–wet weather across the northern hemisphere. However, how this circumglobal circulation pattern affects northern hemisphere ecosystem productivity remains unexplored. Here, using satellite proxies of vegetation photosynthesis, we assess the impact of Rossby wave-7 events during which the jet stream exhibits seven peaks and troughs and tends to produce prolonged weather anomalies. Our results show organized declines in vegetation productivity in warm cores and enhancement in cold cores at northern mid-latitudes during summer Rossby wave-7 events. Mid-latitude biomes within warm cores become much more susceptible to water limitations, resulting from an increased exposure to compound hot–dry (or cold–wet) extremes and a nonlinear physiological response to compound stressors. Of the warm cores analysed, wave events elevate the climatic risk of productivity declines by a factor of 8.3, 6.2 and 4.0 over western Europe, western Asia and the western United States, respectively, due to hot–dry extremes. In particular, 32–44% of the warm anomalies and 52–88% of the dry anomalies fall within the range of warmer–drier conditions projected for 2081–2100 by state-of-the-art climate models under a medium emissions scenario. Therefore, the observed Rossby-wave-driven impacts provide an indication of how a warmer–drier future climate could reduce the carbon uptake capacity of northern hemisphere ecosystems. Satellite observations suggest that prolonged hot–dry conditions induced by Rossby waves in the jet stream reduce ecosystem productivity, providing insights into the potential impacts of a future warmer and probably drier climate."

In this study, the spatial distribution pattern of warm-season heavy precipitation microphysics in China is investigated using observations from China's first precipitation satellite, FY-3G PMR, from April to September 2024. Firstly, the quality of this new satellite dataset is evaluated by comparing it to ground-based polarimetric radar observations and retrievals. Subsequently, the spatial evolution of heavy precipitation microphysics is demonstrated in terms of the monsoon's advancement and the three-step topography across China, in association with the variation in raindrop size distribution (DSD) and the responsible microphysical processes. As the raindrop diameter increases and the number concentration decreases with increasing latitude, the maritime-DSD feature of the South China Sea, the monsoonal-DSD of South and Central-East China, and the continental-DSD of North China, are identified.

The satellite-retrieved dataset reports an average global CO2 enhancements of 0.58 ± 1.81 ppm and a 60 % higher CO2 enhancement (1.43 ± 2.04 ppm) in global urban areas. 
 We present a novel global dataset of CO2 enhancements (ΔXCO2) derived by fusing NASA’s OCO-3 satellite and NOAA ground-based observations. CO2 enhancements quantify the spatially resolved excess in atmospheric CO2 concentrations arising from anthropogenic emissions, biospheric CO2 exchanges, and atmospheric CO2 transport. Leveraging decades of monthly CO2 measurements from eight remote stations strictly selected from NOAA ESRL network, such as the Mauna Loa station, we address the critical challenge of isolating localized CO2 signals from background concentrations by developing a latitude-dependent global CO2 baseline model that effectively captures spatial and seasonal variability in background CO2. The developed baseline model demonstrates near-perfect hemispheric predictive accuracy (Northern: R2=0.988, RMSE=1.78 ppm; Southern: R2=0.995, RMSE=1.09 ppm). Spatially explicit ΔXCO2 is then estimated by removing the column-corrected background CO2 from co-located OCO-3 observations. Validations of the estimated ΔXCO2 against tropospheric NO2 (R2=0.896) and prior in-situ urban CO2 measurements, along with the dataset's high spatiotemporal resolution (~ 3 km2), demonstrates its potential for tracking anthropogenic and biospheric CO2 dynamics.

However, environmental factors, especially relative humidity (RH), cause discrepancies for low-cost sensors when compared with regulatory-grade instruments. Developing methods of correcting or accounting for this RH discrepancy is therefore key to attaining data from low-cost air quality sensors, which can be used to monitor compliance with global air quality guidelines. Here, we developed a simple aerosol dryer and placed a pair of Plantower PMS7003 sensors before and after it, continuously monitoring the impact of drying on the reported particle mass concentrations. During the monitoring period, drying reduced the reported mass concentration for Brisbane’s PM2.5 by 25–40%.

 Machine learning techniques based on satellite observations energize the derivation of near-surface air pollutant concentrations. However, most of previous studies mainly focused on estimating single air pollutant concentration, ignoring the interactions and dependencies between different air pollutants. Therefore, we proposed a Multiple Pollutants simultaneous estimation method based on Attention mechanism augmented Random Forest model (MPA-RF), including PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2, CO and SO2. Specifically, self-attention mechanism was incorporated with the multi-output random forest first to emphasize pertinent features in inputs during model training.

Satellite observations from Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) in three major urban agglomerations in China were extracted to demonstrate the model performance using sample- and site-based cross-validation schemes. Results elucidate that the proposed model is capable of deriving simultaneous estimations of six air pollutants with high accuracy, R2 ranging from 0.74 to 0.93. Benefiting from the consideration of interactions and dependencies between different air pollutants, the proposed model outperforms other single-task contrast models with an R2 improvement ranging from 9% to 26%.

Prajeesh;Murali Shankar Venkatraman;Md Saquib Saharwardi;Ibrahim Hoteit,Atmospheric carbon dioxide over the Arabian Peninsula: Variability and associated sources,"•High XCO2concentrations occur in spring, while low concentrations are observed in autumn. •The seasonal cycle amplitude of XCO2peaks at nearly 8 ppm over the AP. •The seasonal XCO2cycle over the AP is largely shaped by CO2transport from broader Europe region. •A one-month lag is observed between CO2levels in Europe and the AP due to atmospheric transport. •El Niño events amplify XCO2over the AP, with increases of up to 1 ppm during peak phases. 
 This study uses near-decade-long OCO-2 satellite measurements of column-averaged dry-air carbon dioxide (CO2) mole fraction (XCO2) to understand CO2 dynamics across the Arabian Peninsula (AP). The XCO2 over the AP exhibits strong seasonality, with considerably high and low concentrations during spring and autumn, respectively. Local CO2 fluxes, predominantly from anthropogenic sources, do not display seasonal variations, resulting in minimal impact on the seasonal XCO2 cycle across the AP. Analyses of CarbonTracker model outputs reveal a considerable north-to-south transport of CO2, mainly from Europe and adjacent areas and confined between the low and middle levels of the atmosphere. The seasonal XCO2 cycle observed in the AP clearly replicates the seasonality of this transport pattern. Furthermore, a cross-correlation analysis shows a lag of approximately 1 month in CO2 concentrations between Europe and the AP, with the former preceding the latter. The transport of CO2 from Europe is influenced by considerable variations in local fluxes across the Europe. From winter to early spring, net positive CO2 fluxes occur due to high respiration, increasing local CO2 levels. Conversely, from summer to early autumn, net negative fluxes arise from enhanced uptake, reducing local CO2 concentrations. These concentrations of CO2 are subsequently transported to the AP, driven by synoptic-scale systems (shamal winds) moving toward the region.The evolution of El Niño conditions considerably amplifies the XCO2 levels over the AP by up to approximately 1 ppm. Notably, during the peak phase of the recent 2015–2016 El Niño, we noted strongly positive anomalies over the southern latitudes, which subsequently migrated to the AP."
10.1016/j.atmosenv.2025.121355,True,Atmospheric Environment,该研究论文主要关注中国山东省的地面臭氧污染问题，利用卫星遥感数据（如甲醛和二氧化氮柱浓度）结合地面观测数据，分析了2019年至2023年间臭氧形成的敏感性机制。研究发现，虽然氮氧化物减排有效，但挥发性有机物控制不足导致臭氧反弹。此外，COVID-19封锁期间，氮氧化物减排与挥发性有机物减排的不平衡也导致了臭氧浓度升高。研究强调了协同控制挥发性有机物和氮氧化物的重要性，并提出了至少减少60%挥发性有机物才能有效控制封锁期间臭氧升高的建议。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术，特别是空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析密切相关。,"['ground-level ozone', 'volatile organic compounds', 'nitrogen oxides', 'air quality monitoring', 'satellite observations', 'formaldehyde', 'nitrogen dioxide', 'HCHO/NO2 ratio', 'emission control', 'COVID-19 lockdowns']",Lei Sun;Yetong Ma;Yichao Gai;Chuanyong Zhu;Zhenguo Liu;Renqiang Li;Chen Wang;Baolin Wang;Na Yang;Guihuan Yan;Chongqing Xu,"Diagnosing ozone formation regimes in Shandong province, China (2019–2023): Implications for volatile organic compounds control policies during the warm season and COVID-19 lockdowns","•The VOC-limited areas initially expanded, then gradually shrank. •Inadequate VOC control caused O3rebound despite effective NOxreductions. •O3levels increased during lockdown due to unbalanced VOC and NOxreductions. •At least 60 % VOC reduction to mitigate O3rise during the lockdown. 
 Ground-level ozone (O3) concentrations in Shandong Province have exhibited a dynamic trend, characterized by an initial decline followed by a rebound. To investigate the drivers of these changes, we combined satellite-derived formaldehyde-to-nitrogen dioxide ratios (HCHO/NO2) with ground-based O3 measurements to establish a diagnostic threshold for O3 formation sensitivity. Results reveal a transition from NOx-limited/transitional regimes to VOC-limited regimes from 2019 to 2021, followed by a gradual reversal to transitional regimes from 2021 to 2023. Satellite observations corroborate this trend, showing a rebound in HCHO columns alongside a sharp decline in NO2 columns between 2019 and 2023. These findings highlight that while stringent NOx emission controls have succeeded in reducing NO2 levels over the past five years, insufficient VOC mitigation has enabled O3 resurgence. During COVID-19 lockdowns, we found that abrupt NOx reductions did not shift Shandong to NOx-limited regimes. Unbalanced emission reductions lead to O3 increases, with at least 60 % VOC reductions required to offset O3 rises. This suggests that future measures (e.g., transport electrification) may be insufficient without synergistic VOC/NOx control."

 Accurate quantitative assessment of biomass burning (BB) aerosol radiative effects (BBARE) in the North China Plain is a key scientific issue in regional aerosol radiative effects research. However, there is currently a lack of comparative analysis between BBARE based on observation and model simulations of BBARE, especially with regard to the differences between the two BBARE estimates in urban-rural differences. This study focuses on 10 typical BB events that affected Beijing during July, September and October 2014 in the North China Plain, and quantifies the BBARE at various radiation stations using both observational data-based machine learning approach and the WRF-Chem model. Based on the quantitative results, the BBARE obtained through the two methods was analysed in direct comparison and in terms of urban-rural differences. Direct comparison results indicate that the BBARE simulated by WRF-Chem shows an overall underestimation compared to the results based on observations. In terms of urban-rural differences in BBARE, observation-based BBARE was on average 91.28 % lower in urban stations than in rural stations, while model-simulated BBARE showed the opposite urban-rural difference (the urban stations' BBARE was on average 38.52 % higher than rural stations). This urban-rural difference in BBARE based on observations is due to the fact that urban SSR is more severely affected by background aerosols, resulting in limited changes in SSR caused by additional BB aerosols. However, the model simulation only considers the reduction in SSR caused by increased BB aerosols, neglecting the influence of pre-existing aerosol. By identifying these disparities, this study will help to enhance the accuracy of model simulations of BBARE."

 The Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI) Dark Target (DT) algorithm, adapted from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) DT algorithm, demonstrated aerosol retrieval performance similar to that of MODIS Collection 6.1 (C6.1) DT products. However, discrepancies arose in urban areas, where MERSI retrievals tended to exhibit noticeable positive biases, primarily due to the inadequate representation of urban surface reflectance. To address this issue, this study developed an enhanced algorithm by parameterizing a binary quadratic spectral surface reflectance model using urban percentage (UP) and vegetation index, named the MERSI DT_UP algorithm. Global validation against Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements showed that MERSI DT_UP retrievals in 2019 exhibited greater accuracy than MERSI DT retrievals. The correlation coefficient between satellite retrievals and AERONET for MERSI DT_UP (R = 0.882) was higher than that for MERSI DT (R = 0.875), and the mean bias was reduced to −0.001 from 0.018. Additionally, the percentage of matchups falling within the expected error envelope (within EE%) of ± (0.05 + 0.2τ) increased by 1.5 %. Across different urbanization levels, MERSI DT_UP retrievals showed significant reductions in mean biases (ranging from 0.003 to 0.217) and notable increases in within EE% (ranging from 2.2 % to 49.3 %) compared to original results. Moreover, improvements were also observed on moderately vegetated and moderately bright surfaces, as demonstrated by the error dependence analysis. The proposed surface reflectance model supports the algorithm development for MERSI and holds potential for application to other sensors."

However, the sources of this dust are not well-documented, limiting understanding of dust emissions. Here, we systematically quantify dust source activation frequency (DSAF) across East Asia (80–130° E; 27–52° N) between January 2016 and December 2023. Our data reveal a vast dust-active area extending from the Tibetan Plateau (TP) in the southwest to the Huin Bair Sandy Land in the northeast, but two regions dominate: southern sources centered on the margins of the Taklimakan Desert and northern ones centered on the valleys of the Gobi Desert. East Asia is most dust-active in boreal spring (46% of all recorded events). This seasonal peak is pronounced in northern sources where snow cover, vegetation and orographic/topographic influence on winds are clear controls on DSAF. The main southern sources are active year-round with DSAF hotspots attributable to desiccated lakes and riverbeds. The TP, commonly considered a sink for in-bound windblown dust, is also a dust source, particularly in winter, with emissions controlled by precipitation patterns, snow cover and wind funneling through deep river gorges. Contrary to suggestions, our data show that the Loess Plateau is not a major dust source. We document a marked increase in dust source activation during the 2020 extreme heat wave on the overgrazed Mongolian Plateau grasslands. Our data provide a framework to study past variability in the two-way climate interactions that control dust emissions on historical and geological timescales and a baseline from which to measure future change."

Using remote sensing observations during two field experiments in Houston, Texas, we identify four diurnal patterns of shallow convective clouds. We find areas more frequently experiencing shallow convective clouds, and we find areas where the vertical extent of shallow convective clouds is higher and where they are more likely to precipitate. This provides insight into the complicated environment that forms these clouds in Houston. 
 Shallow convection plays an important role in Earth's climate system by regulating the vertical transport of heat, moisture, and momentum in the lower troposphere. Aerosols, large-scale meteorology, and low-level convergence influence the spatiotemporal variability in shallow convection, and the coastal urban area of Houston, Texas, is an ideal laboratory to investigate these complex interactions. Here, geostationary satellite and ground-based radar observations from June to September 2022 during the TRacking Aerosol Convection interactions ExpeRiment (TRACER) and Experiment of Sea Breeze Convection, Aerosols, Precipitation, and Environment (ESCAPE) field campaigns are used to characterize the spatial coverage, vertical extent, and precipitation fraction of shallow convective clouds. The fused operational remote sensing datasets over a 250 km × 250 km domain are evaluated against profiling observations. The domain-wide diurnal shallow cloud fractions are used to identify four distinct modes of shallow convection. In all clusters, the domain-wide cloud fractions are consistently higher than the domain-wide precipitation fractions, and shallow cloud fractions are higher over water than they are over land, while the shallow precipitation fractions show the opposite behavior. In the two modes with minimal deep cloud activity, shallow cloud frequency is highest over ocean in the early morning, and there is a transition to higher shallow cloud frequency over land by the afternoon in one cluster or to high shallow cloud frequencies everywhere by the afternoon in the other. Lastly, we find regions with higher shallow cloud top heights and a large region along the coastline where shallow clouds are more likely to precipitate."

Second, we discuss the advantages and differences of the more constrained experiment compared to fully interactive model experiments. This way, we advance the process-level understanding of the drivers of SAI-induced atmospheric responses. 
 A new Stratospheric Aerosol Intervention (SAI) experiment has been designed for the Chemistry–Climate Model Initiative (CCMI-2022) to assess the impacts of SAI on stratospheric chemistry and dynamical responses and inter-model differences using a constrained setup with a prescribed stratospheric aerosol distribution and fixed sea surface temperatures and sea ice. This paper serves a dual purpose: first, it describes the details of the experimental setup and the prescribed aerosol distribution and demonstrates the suitability of the simplified setup to study SAI impacts in the stratosphere in a multi-model framework. The experiment allows attributing inter-model differences to the resulting impacts on atmospheric chemistry, radiation, and dynamics rather than the model uncertainty arising from differences in aerosol forcing and feedbacks from the ocean and sea ice under SAI. Second, we use the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM6) to compare the interactive stratospheric aerosol configuration with coupling to land, ocean, and sea ice used to produce the stratospheric aerosol distribution with the results of the constrained SAI experiment.  With this, we identify and isolate the stratosphere-controlled SAI-induced impacts from those influenced by the coupling with the ocean. Overall, this comparison facilitates an advanced process-level understanding of the drivers of SAI-induced atmospheric responses. For example, we confirm earlier suggestions that the SAI-induced positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation in winter, with the corresponding winter warming over Eurasia and related changes, is driven by stratosphere–troposphere coupling. Future multi-model comparisons will thus provide an important contribution to upcoming scientific assessments of ozone depletion."

The method is highly competitive, with commonly used parametric models yielding more accurate estimates while accounting for wavelength dependence. The resulting normalized estimation errors of the spectrometer spectral responses are less than 1 %, which will allow for better quantification of trace gas concentrations at the Earth surface. 
 High-resolution spectrometers are composed of different optical elements and detectors that must be modeled as accurately as possible. Specifically, accurate estimates of instrument spectral response functions (ISRFs) are critical in order not to compromise the retrieval of trace gas concentrations from spectral measurements. Currently, parametric models are used to estimate these response functions. However, these models cannot always take into account the diversity of ISRF shapes that are encountered in practical applications. This paper studies a new ISRF estimation method based on a sparse representation of the ISRF in a dictionary. The proposed method is shown to be very competitive when compared to parametric models, yielding up to 1 order of magnitude smaller normalized ISRF estimation errors. The method is applied to different high-resolution spectrometers, demonstrating its reproducibility for multiple remote sensing missions."

 In a rapidly changing climate, evidence-based decision-making benefits from up-to-date and timely information. Here we compile monitoring datasets (published at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15639576; Smith et al., 2025a) to produce updated estimates for key indicators of the state of the climate system: net emissions of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate forcers, greenhouse gas concentrations, radiative forcing, the Earth's energy imbalance, surface temperature changes, warming attributed to human activities, the remaining carbon budget, and estimates of global temperature extremes. This year, we additionally include indicators for sea-level rise and land precipitation change. We follow methods as closely as possible to those used in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Working Group One report.The indicators show that human activities are increasing the Earth's energy imbalance and driving faster sea-level rise compared to the AR6 assessment. For the 2015–2024 decade average, observed warming relative to 1850–1900 was 1.24 [1.11 to 1.35] °C, of which 1.22 [1.0 to 1.5] °C was human-induced. The 2024-observed best estimate of global surface temperature (1.52 °C) is well above the best estimate of human-caused warming (1.36 °C). However, the 2024 observed warming can still be regarded as a typical year, considering the human-induced warming level and the state of internal variability associated with the phase of El Niño and Atlantic variability. Human-induced warming has been increasing at a rate that is unprecedented in the instrumental record, reaching 0.27 [0.2–0.4] °C per decade over 2015–2024. This high rate of warming is caused by a combination of greenhouse gas emissions being at an all-time high of 53.6±5.2 Gt CO2e yr−1 over the last decade (2014–2023), as well as reductions in the strength of aerosol cooling. Despite this, there is evidence that the rate of increase in CO2 emissions over the last decade has slowed compared to the 2000s, and depending on societal choices, a continued series of these annual updates over the critical 2020s decade could track decreases or increases in the rate of the climatic changes presented here."

Trained and validated on simulated data, our model accurately predicts emissions despite challenges like cloud cover. When applied to real OCO3 satellite images, the results closely match reported emissions. This study shows that neural networks trained on simulations can effectively analyse real satellite data, offering a new way to monitor CO2 emissions from space. 
 This paper presents the development and application of a deep-learning-based method for inverting CO2 atmospheric plumes from power plants using satellite imagery of the CO2 total column mixing ratios (XCO2). We present an end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) approach, processing the satellite XCO2 images to derive estimates of the power plant emissions, that is resilient to missing data in the images due to clouds or to the partial view of the plume owing to the limited extent of the satellite swath.The CNN is trained and validated exclusively on CO2 simulations from eight power plants in Germany in 2015. The evaluation on this synthetic dataset shows an excellent CNN performance with relative errors close to 20 %, which is only significantly affected by substantial cloud cover. The method is then applied to 39 images of the XCO2 plumes from nine power plants,  acquired by the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 Snapshot Area Maps (OCO3 SAMs), and the predictions are compared to average annual reported emissions. The results are very promising, showing a relative difference in the predictions to reported emissions only slightly higher than the relative error diagnosed from the experiments with synthetic images. Furthermore, analysis of the area of the images in which the CNN-based inversion extracts the information for the quantification of the emissions, based on integrated-gradient techniques, demonstrates that the CNN effectively identifies the location of the plumes in the OCO-3 SAM images. This study demonstrates the feasibility of applying neural networks that have been trained on synthetic datasets for the inversion of atmospheric plumes in real satellite imagery from XCO2 and provides the tools for future applications."

Marlier,Contribution of Large Wildfire Events and Burn Severity Classes to Air Pollution in California in 2018,"Wildfire smoke represents a growing threat to air quality and public health. The newly available Wildfire Burn Severity and Emissions inventory (WBSE) provides emissions estimates for individual large wildfires in California at a finer spatial resolution and for a longer historical record than global inventories. For the 2018 wildfire season, we utilized daily emissions from WBSE and the Fire INventory from NCAR (FINNv2.5) with atmospheric modeling to simulate fire-derived fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations at 16 California receptors. Simulated concentrations with WBSE and FINNv2.5 were significantly correlated with station observations at 11 receptors, but the strength of correlations varied. We leveraged WBSE’s event-based framework and burn severity classification to quantify contributions of individual wildfires and burn severity classes to fire-derived PM2.5 pollution. We found that the top ten largest fires in our modeling period accounted for nearly all fire-derived PM2.5 pollution at our receptors. Most fire-derived PM2.5 came from moderate or high severity burned areas. Multiple fires contributed to almost all poor air quality days, and all had contributions from 3 to 4 burn severity classes.

10.1021/acsestair.5c00010,True,ACS ES&T Air,该论文研究了印度棕色碳（BrC）的光吸收特性及其对气候的影响。棕色碳是一种大气污染物，该研究综述了当前关于印度棕色碳光吸收的研究现状，包括其时空分布、主要来源（如生物质燃烧和车辆排放）以及辐射效应。研究强调，目前的研究主要集中在印度恒河平原，且全球气候模型在评估棕色碳的辐射强迫时，依赖于非印度地区的数据，可能无法准确反映印度的情况。因此，论文指出需要扩大空间覆盖范围、进行多样化的源解析，并改进辐射效应的估算，以更好地了解棕色碳对印度乃至全球气候的影响。虽然没有明确提到遥感技术，但棕色碳作为大气成分，其研究与大气环境遥感技术，如用于空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等是相关的。,"['Brown carbon', 'Light absorption', 'Radiative forcing', 'Aerosol', 'Climate impact', 'Air quality', 'Atmospheric composition']",Chimurkar Navinya;Taveen Singh Kapoor;Chandra Venkataraman;Harish C.

Chakrabarty,Brown Carbon Light Absorption over India: Research Status and Need for Discerning Climate Impacts,"Brown carbon (BrC) absorbs solar radiation and influences the regional and global climate. A major pollutant in India, BrC absorption has received reasonable research attention, with studies focusing on spatial-temporal variability and emission sources. By synthesizing the available literature, this paper presents the current research status on the topic and identifies gaps that need to be addressed to better understand the climate impacts of BrC in India. In terms of the measurement of BrC light absorption, we find that the solvent extraction technique is the most commonly used, followed by the Ångström exponent extrapolation and the component subtraction techniques. Measurement sites are concentrated in the Indo-Gangetic plains, which show significantly higher absorption levels than other regions. Seasonal variability shows increased absorption during postmonsoon and winter periods, particularly in peninsular India. Though limited in number, studies on emission sources identify biomass burning and vehicular emissions as key contributors. In terms of radiative impact, assessments from the Indo-Gangetic plains suggest that BrC contributes substantially to direct radiative effects, potentially accounting for a net 31–48% warming. Global climate models assign a net forcing of 0.5–2 W m–2 over India; however, they rely on parametrizations derived from non-Indian locations and sources, which may not accurately represent BrC over India. Overall, expanded spatial coverage, diverse source characterization, and improved radiative effect estimations are key to decoding BrC’s climate impact in India and globally."

Davies,Hygroscopicity and Phase Transformations of Internally Mixed Organic–Inorganic Proxies of Biomass Burning Aerosol,"Biomass burning (BB) is a major source of atmospheric aerosols through both direct emissions and the secondary formation of particles. In addition to releasing large amounts of organic compounds in both the gas and particle phases, biomass burning plumes also emit inorganic species. Potassium salts are directly emitted, while ammonium salts can form due to reactions with ammonia. Aerosol particles formed from biomass burning are therefore a complex internal mixture of organic molecules and inorganic components. The molecular interactions between these species and water dictate the hygroscopic growth and phase behavior of the aerosol. In this work, we explore the hygroscopic growth and phase behavior for a series of mixed particles containing common water-soluble biomass burning compounds, phthalic acid, 4-nitrocatechol, and levoglucosan, and salts, potassium chloride, ammonium sulfate, sodium chloride, and potassium sulfate. These measurements were carried out using a linear quadrupole electrodynamic balance (LQ-EDB) coupled with Mie resonance spectroscopy to probe single particles as a function of the relative humidity. The morphology of these samples was observed to span from well-mixed aqueous solutions to fully effloresced particles with a variety of phase-separated states identified in between. From light scattering and hygroscopic growth measurements, we infer the phase of the particles under atmospherically relevant conditions and report the onset of phase transitions. We break down the contributions of individual components to the hygroscopicity using the Zdanovskii–Stokes–Robinson relation and compare these to predictions from a semiempirical thermodynamic model (AIOMFAC). For fully deliquesced particles, the predictions generally agree with observations, while particles that have undergone phase transitions show the largest deviations. Overall, this work highlights the limitations of assuming that BB particles are well-mixed and provides important physicochemical data to predict and interpret the humidity response of the BB aerosol."

Based on 17 years (2003–2019) of satellite and reanalysis data combined with a multivariate regression model, this study identifies a distinctive transition from supercooled to ice clouds over the TP, in contrast to most Asian regions where atmospheric warming favors a shift from cold to warm clouds. The transition is most pronounced in summer, with supercooled cloud fraction (CF $CF$) decreasing by 3.5% per decade and ice CF $CF$ increasing by 2.7% per decade. Enhanced cloud vertical development primarily drives this transition, accompanied by cloud‐top cooling of 6.0°C for supercooled and 10.2°C for ice clouds over the 17‐year period. Surface and atmospheric warming, changes in large‐scale circulation, and warmer glaciation temperatures contribute to the cooling. These findings underscore the unique cloud‐phase changes over the TP and highlight the need for further research on their climate implications."

In this study, we analyze surface observations of PM2.5 composition from 2002 to 2022 to identify the chemical components driving this shift. We find that PM2.5 concentrations plateau across seasons and regions in the contiguous U.S. since 2016, even after excluding estimated wildfire impacts, suggesting that the rise in wildfire activity alone does not account for these trends. The stagnation is primarily driven by a slowdown in the reduction of sulfate and a non‐significant increase in organic aerosols. In the Eastern and Central U.S., sulfate concentrations generally mirror decreasing anthropogenic SO2 emissions, except in winter, where chemical feedbacks related to oxidant limitations weaken the response of sulfate. We find that nitrate and NO2 concentrations decrease slower than anthropogenic nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, particularly in fall and winter, suggesting a potential overestimate in the decrease of NOx emissions in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency National Emission Inventory (NEI) and/or an increasing role of natural and non‐U.S. sources. In the Southeast, the decline in organic aerosol concentrations has stalled since 2015, possibly due to weaker decreases in sulfate‐induced secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from isoprene, combined with increases in monoterpene‐derived SOA as the climate warms. Despite continued decreases in the NEI black carbon (BC) emissions, BC concentrations have stagnated since 2015, even after removing the estimated influence of wildfire smoke, indicating a possible underestimate in emissions."

Numerous tree species experience biomass loss and increased mortality following O3 exposure. Quantifying levels of O3 at which deleterious impacts occur to individual trees under in situ conditions is essential for the effective management of air and forest resources. Previously, O3 critical levels (CLs) were established based on controlled seedling experiments. However, seedling experiments may fail to reflect O3 impacts on mature trees. In this study, we report the first results for empirically derived, species‐specific O3 CLs for tree growth and survival using a database of ∼1.5 million trees observed over time across the conterminous United States. Using a machine learning approach, we calculated O3 CLs for 88 tree species (growth: 72 species; survival: 51 species). To our knowledge, most tree species we assessed have no prior determination of O3 CLs. Estimated O3 CLs (W126) for 5% decline in the tree growth rate ranged from 1.9 to 37.6 ppm‐hr (mean: 10.5 ppm‐hr), and estimated O3 CLs for 1% tree survival probability decline ranged from 1.9 to 37.9 ppm‐hr (mean: 9.3 ppm‐hr) across species. Recently (2016–2018), portions of the western United States exceeded O3 CLs for nearly all tree species for both growth and survival. Nationally, O3 exposure levels were below the growth CLs for most species, while levels may have exceeded the survival CLs for some species. Our results provide new evidence of the range and uncertainty of impacts of ozone exposure on trees across the United States."

 We introduce a new instrument to measure spectral light absorption by aerosol particles. BLAnCA (Broadband Light Analyzer of Complex Aerosol) is an automatic laboratory instrument for offline measurement of aerosol collected on suitable media. BLAnCA is equipped with a white light source and a high-resolution spectrometer, and measures in the range between 375 and 1000 nm with a spectral resolution of 5 nm. This allows for the determination of fine structure of the absorption properties of a sampled aerosol, which can lead to improvement in the robustness and scope of source apportionment and the evaluation of climate-relevant properties such as the aerosol mass absorption cross-section. The new instrument has been validated against a multi-wavelength absorbance analyzer, obtaining an agreement of up to 99 % between absorption coefficient measurements. The absorption coefficient limit of detection for BLAnCA has been estimated at 1.20 Mm−1 (2.70 Mm−1) for standard EU (EPA) sampling conditions, corresponding to an elemental carbon detection limit of about 1.3 μg cm−2, if a mass absorption cross-section of 4.7 m2g−1 at 1000 nm is considered. The instrument has been used to characterize several types of aerosol samples, each with its own distinct absorption features, which show the potential for BLAnCA to identify different kinds of particulate matter based on their optical properties."

High-resolution weather model simulations reveal that non-rain clouds at the edge of cloud systems are prone to evaporation, leading to an aerosol drying effect and a transition of aerosols back to the accumulation mode for future activation. The study shows that this dynamic behavior is often not adequately represented in most previous prescribed-aerosol simulations. 
 The presence of warm boundary layer stratiform clouds over the eastern North Atlantic (ENA) region is commonly influenced by the Azores High, especially during the summer season. To investigate comprehensive aerosol–cloud interactions, this study employs the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with a chemistry component (WRF-Chem), incorporating aerosol chemical components that are relevant to the formation of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and accounting for aerosol spatiotemporal variation. This study focuses on aerosol indirect effects, particularly the long-range transport of aerosols, in the ENA region under three different weather regimes: a ridge with a surface high-pressure system, a post-trough with a surface high-pressure system, and a weak trough. The WRF-Chem simulations conducted at a near-large-eddy scale offer valuable insights into the model's performance, especially in terms of its ability to use high spatial resolution to capture mesoscale cloud features across various weather regimes. Our result shows that introducing 5 times more aerosols to either non-precipitating or precipitating clouds significantly increases ambient CCN numbers, resulting in, to varying degrees, higher liquid water path (LWP) values. The substantial aerosol–cloud interaction especially occurs in the precipitating clouds and demonstrates the susceptibility of the LWP to changes in CCN under different regimes. Conversely, thin, non-rain clouds at the edges of a cloud system are prone to evaporation, exhibiting an aerosol drying effect. The aerosols released during this process transition back to the accumulation mode, facilitating future activation. This dynamic behavior is not adequately represented in prescribed-aerosol simulations."

Both the OMI and TROPOMI inversions show decreases in European NOx anthropogenic emission budgets in 2019 compared to 2005 but with different magnitudes. 
 There are great expectations about the detection and the quantification of NOx emissions using NO2 tropospheric columns from satellite observations and inverse systems. This study assesses the potential of the OMI-QA4ECV and TROPOMI satellite observations to improve the knowledge of European NOx emissions at the regional scale and to inform about the spatio-temporal variability of NOx anthropogenic emissions in 2019 compared to 2005, at the resolution of 0.5° over Europe.  We first characterize the level of consistency between retrievals from OMI-QA4ECV and from the more recent reprocessing of the TROPOMI data, called TROPOMI-RPRO-v02.04, and the implications of the possible inconsistencies for inversions. Furthermore, starting from European emission estimates from the TNO-GHGco-v3 inventory for the year 2005, regional inversions using the Community Inversion Framework coupled to the CHIMERE chemistry-transport model and assimilating satellite NO2 tropospheric columns from OMI and TROPOMI have been performed to estimate the European annual and seasonal budgets for the year 2019.  Both the OMI and TROPOMI inversions show decreases in European NOx anthropogenic emission budgets in 2019 compared to 2005. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the reductions of the NOx anthropogenic emissions is different with OMI and TROPOMI data, with decreases in EU-27 + UK between 2005 and 2019 of 16 % and 45 %, respectively.  A TROPOMI inversion giving more weight to the satellite data becomes consistent with the independent TNO-GHGco-v3 inventory for the year 2019, with annual budgets for EU-27 + UK showing absolute relative difference of only 4 %. These TROPOMI inversions are therefore in agreement with the magnitude of the decline in NOx emissions declared by countries, when aggregated at the European scale. However, our results – with OMI and TROPOMI data leading to different magnitudes of corrections on NOx anthropogenic emissions – suggest that more observational constraints would be required to sharpen the European emission estimates."

Grassian,Elucidating the Impact of Wildfire Molecular Tracers on Nitrous Acid (HONO) Production from Aqueous Nitrate Photochemistry,"Nitrous acid (HONO), a gaseous tropospheric pollutant, significantly influences the oxidative potential of the atmosphere as a major source of hydroxyl radicals (•OH). Recently, HONO has been identified as a primary and secondary product of wildfire smoke, yet mechanisms for its formation are poorly understood. In this study, wildfire-emitted organic compounds, such as levoglucosan (LG), syringic acid (SA), and vanillic acid (VA), were studied to investigate their impact on HONO production from aqueous nitrate photochemistry. The presence of SA and VA increased gas-phase HONO yields by 3- and 5-fold, respectively, while LG increased HONO production the most, 6-fold. Furthermore, a nonlinear relationship between HONO and LG concentration was found. Aqueous nitrate samples exposed to lower concentrations of LG were shown to produce an LG-derived carbonyl compound, whereas the samples exposed to a higher LG concentration resulted in an LG dimer. The mechanisms as to how these differences in products affect HONO enhancement are discussed. Gas-phase HONO yields were quantified using incoherent broadband cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy (IBCEAS), and identification of any condensed phase products from aqueous nitrate samples was done by high resolution mass spectrometry. Studying nitrate photochemistry in the presence of wildfire-emitted organic compounds can potentially minimize the knowledge gap on the observed high concentrations of gaseous HONO formation during biomass burning events."

The subgrid variability of aerosol and precursor gas emissions is better represented at the higher resolution. The budget analysis of aerosols in eastern China shows that wet/dry deposition is not sensitive to the model resolution, but sulfate formation (e.g., sulfuric acid gas condensation and aqueous‐phase chemistry) increases and aerosol transport out of the region decreases as the resolution increases, which lead to increased aerosol burden and lifetime. Compared to UN‐CESM, VR‐CESM simulates stronger descending motion along the mountain edge and blocking effects of mountain peaks, which weakens the dispersion of aerosols over the Taihang Mountains and Sichuan Basin. In comparison to surface observations, VR‐CESM simulates higher aerosol concentrations in urban areas than UN‐CESM does. Over eastern China, increasing model resolution improves the simulated aerosol optical depth (AOD) in terms of spatial distribution and magnitude. Over northern (southwestern) China, the simulated AOD increases by ∼17% (∼32%) with increasing resolution and becomes more comparable to satellite retrievals. The improvements are more significant in urban areas and regions with complex terrains than in rural and coastal areas. The regional annual‐mean aerosol direct radiative effect in eastern China simulated by VR‐CESM increases by ∼54% (−1.08 W/m2 more cooling) at the top of the atmosphere compared to UN‐CESM."

One large pyroCb event over the Sparks Lake fire that generated persistent overshooting tops had a remarkable amount of lightning activity, with 5,600 total lightning strikes, while the rest of the pyroCb events corresponded with lower injection altitudes and minimal to no observed lightning activity. The cloud‐to‐cloud (CC) to cloud‐to‐ground (CG) lightning ratio (CC:CG) in this Sparks Lake pyroCb was significantly higher than in other high‐based storms but displayed similar lightning density and slightly lower peak current distributions. All clean and smoke‐filled thunderstorms produced significant levels of lightning activity, regardless of their cloud‐top altitudes. However, ingestion of smoke significantly reduced the percentage of positive polarity CG strikes when compared to clean cases.

 Most previous studies on the climatic effects of Antarctic ozone have focused primarily on the Southern Hemisphere. This study suggests that September-October Antarctic ozone anomalies account for approximately 12% of the interannual variability in East Asian summer precipitation. The precipitation anomalies linked to the Antarctic ozone index are characterized by increased rainfall between the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers in central East China and decreased rainfall over Southeastern China. Our analysis reveals that positive Antarctic ozone anomalies during September–October are associated with a negative phase of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) during the subsequent boreal winter. The resulting SAM-related circulation anomalies exert a significant influence on sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) in the southwestern Indian Ocean, particularly near the Madagascar region. Owing to the ocean’s thermal inertia, these SSTAs persist into the subsequent boreal spring, altering the meridional circulation and leading to anomalous subsidence near 15°N, which in turn results in elevated skin temperature anomalies (SKTAs) over the Indochina Peninsula. Numerical experiments conducted with the Community Atmospheric Model version 5 further confirm the role of southwestern Indian Ocean SSTAs in driving this response. Land memory and positive land–atmosphere feedbacks sustain these SKTAs into boreal summer. Consequently, the SKTAs-induced heating over the Indochina Peninsula enhances the southwesterly monsoon and strengthens precipitation over central East China, as demonstrated by linear baroclinic model experiments. Furthermore, the Specified-Chemistry version of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model is used to verify the remote influence of Antarctic ozone anomalies on East Asian summer precipitation. Our findings provide an additional predictor for summer precipitation over East Asia and deepen our understanding of the interhemispheric impacts of Antarctic ozone."

 Since 2013, China's air quality has significantly improved due to the reduction of anthropogenic emissions. The influence of long-distance transport of biomass burning emissions in Southeast Asia (BBSEA) on air quality in southern China (SC) would likely continue to increase, especially under the trend of global warming. We quantify the contribution of BBSEA to the surface and high-altitude BC concentrations in SC (two provincial capitals: Guangzhou (GZ), Guangdong, and Kunming (KM), Yunnan) in March–April 2014 and 2019 by using the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model and its adjoint. For three severe pollution events in SC in 2014, the contributions of BBSEA to daily average BC concentrations in GZ are 0.08–0.19 μg m−3 (2 %–5 %) at the surface and 0.20–0.78 μg m−3 (59 %–73 %) at 700 hPa. In KM, the corresponding contributions are 0.27–0.54 μg m−3 (15 %–33 %) and 0.25–0.45 μg m−3 (28 %–45 %). The transport time of BBSEA to the surface of GZ (KM) is about 3–6 days (1–5 days). The shift in wind fields from southwest to west and stronger wind speeds in April likely shorten the transport time of BBSEA to SC. On March 27, 2019, the relative contributions of BBSEA to the surface BC concentrations increase by 10 % in GZ and 14 % in KM, compared to March 23, 2014. Our study would offer scientific support for understanding BC sources and potential improvement of air quality in SC."

 Char and soot represent distinct types of elemental carbon (EC) with varying sources and physicochemical properties. However, quantitative studies in sources, atmospheric processes and light-absorbing capabilities between them remain scarce, greatly limiting the understanding of EC's climatic and environmental impacts. For in-depth analysis, concentrations, mass absorption efficiency (MAE) and stable carbon isotope were analyzed based on hourly samples collected during winter 2021 in Nanjing, China. Combining measurements, atmospheric transport model and radiative transfer model were employed to quantify the discrepancies between char-EC and soot-EC. The mass concentration ratio of char-EC to soot-EC (RC/S) was 1.4 ± 0.6 (mean ± standard deviation), showing significant dependence on both source types and atmospheric processes. Case studies revealed that lower RC/S may indicate enhanced fossil fuel contributions, and/or considerable proportions from long-range transport. Char-EC exhibited a stronger light-absorbing capability than soot-EC, as MAEchar (7.8 ± 6.7 m2g−1) was significantly higher than MAEsoot (5.4 ± 3.4 m2g−1)(p < 0.001). Notably, MAEchar was three times higher than MAEsoot in fossil fuel emissions, while both were comparable in biomass burning emissions. Furthermore, MAEsoot increased with aging processes, whereas MAEchar exhibited a more complex trend due to combined effects of changes in coatings and morphology. Simulations of direct radiative forcing (DRF) for five sites indicated that neglecting the char-EC/soot-EC differentiation could cause a 10 % underestimation of EC's DRF, which further limit accurate assessments of regional air pollution and climate effects. This study underscores the necessity for separate parameterization of two types of EC for pollution mitigation and climate change evaluation."

 Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is a critical parameter for understanding the Earth's atmospheric energy balance and addressing key health-related concerns. This study presents an innovative approach for simulating virtual nighttime AOD based on daytime observations from the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) with ultraviolet and visible bands onboard the GEO-KOMPSAT (GK)-2B satellite. This study set the spatial domain to 20°N–43°N and 117°E–132°E, primarily to encompass South Korea and the Yellow Sea. By employing a deep learning-based data-to-data (D2D) translation technique, we trained and tested the D2D model to learn the GEMS AOD values from infrared (IR) bands at the Advanced Meteorological Imager (AMI) onboard the co-located GK-2A satellite. We used the paired daytime GEMS AOD datasets and ten IR brightness temperature (BT) and BT difference (BTD) measurements at the GK-2A AMI sensor. The trained D2D model was subsequently applied to nighttime AMI BT and BTD data to simulate daytime-like nighttime GEMS AOD values, assuming consistency in IR datasets without reliance on solar reflection. Our proposed nighttime AOD generation model was quantitatively evaluated using daytime GEMS AOD as a reference. The results showed excellent performance, with a probability of detection of 0.888, a false alarm ratio of 0.159, a critical success index of 0.760, a Heidke skill score of 0.778, and a proportion correct of 0.895 for the case on February 25, 2022, at 05:45 UTC (14:45 Korea Standard Time). Validation of the D2D-generated nighttime GEMS AOD data, using Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) aerosol layer and Vertical Feature Mask data, as well as Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observations, demonstrated excellent agreement with CALIPSO aerosol data and closely matched AOD values from AERONET. This study provides a valuable contribution to continuous AOD monitoring, offering the ability to observe AOD both day and night at 10-min intervals over East Asia, supporting atmospheric and environmental forecasting efforts."

Lamsal,Monitoring of total and off-road NOx emissions from Canadian oil sands surface mining using the Ozone Monitoring Instrument,"The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) was used to understand the evolution of NOx emissions from the Canadian oil sands. OMI NO2 combined with winds and reported stack emissions found emissions from the heavy-hauler mine fleet have remained flat since 2005, whereas the total oil sands mined have more than doubled. This difference is a result of emissions standards that limit NOx emissions becoming more stringent over this period, confirming the efficacy of the policy enacting these standards. 
 The oil sands in Alberta, Canada, are a significant source of air pollution. Observations from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on the NASA Aura satellite have been used to quantify NOx emissions from the surface mining region of the oil sands. Two related emissions methods were utilized, one for point and one for area sources, where OMI vertical column densities of NO2 were combined with winds from a meteorological reanalysis and a two-dimensional exponentially modified Gaussian (EMG) plume model. This work better connects the two (point and area) emissions methods and discusses the interpretation of fit parameters and the ability of OMI (and other sensors) to resolve emissions between neighbouring sources.The two methods employed, in good agreement with each other, indicated an increase in emissions from about 55 to 80 kt [NO2] yr−1 between 2005–2011 and a flat trend thereafter. Reported emissions were within 15 % of reported emissions, consistent to within uncertainties. In an extension of this methodology, OMI observations were combined with reported point source emissions to derive the more uncertain emissions component from the large off-road mining fleet. These were found to make up about 60 % of total NOx emissions, also consistent with reported emissions. The OMI-derived 0.9 % yr−1 increase in fleet emissions and the 5.5 % yr−1 increase in bitumen mined, generally a good proxy for fleet emissions, can be reconciled by considering the evolution of the mine fleet over this period. OMI is therefore able to track the transition from US EPA Tier 1 standards, through Tier 4 standards, to the present and in doing so demonstrates the efficacy of this policy. Furthermore, this analysis shows that had the fleet remained at Tier 1, this source would currently be emitting an additional 40 kt [NO2] yr−1."

Ivey,"Assessing the Impact of Wildfire Smoke Transport Through Chemical Transport Modeling, Satellite Retrievals, and Ground-Based Observations of Ozone in Rural Nevada","Wildfires emit a large amount of ozone precursors, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter into the troposphere and sometimes the stratosphere. With the increasing wildfire events in recent years, the western U.S. regions may experience challenges with higher-than-normal air pollution levels during the fire season (June-October). Therefore, determining the ozone enhancement pattern from wildfire smoke is crucial to understanding the influence of wildfire plume transport on a subregional basis. This study investigates the impact of the 2013 Rim Fire on ozone levels in rural Nevada, employing a combination of ground-based monitors, satellite remote sensing, and atmospheric modeling. The research focuses on understanding how wildfire smoke affects ozone concentrations in the downwind regions. Findings indicate significant ozone enhancements on smoke days compared to nonsmoke days, highlighting the contribution of wildfire emissions to regional air quality deterioration. The study demonstrates that the chemical transport model underestimated ozone levels downwind of wildfire plumes, likely due to uncertainties in smoke emissions estimates and differences in chemical mechanisms across model versions. Satellite observations of nitrogen dioxide and formaldehyde underline the link between wildfire emissions and increased ozone production. The comprehensive approach combining ground-based monitoring, remote sensing, and advanced modeling provides deeper insights into the dynamics of wildfire smoke and its effects on air quality, emphasizing the need for integrated strategies to manage the impacts of wildfires on regional air quality."

 Wildfires reduce vegetation cover and soil biocrust, thus expanding bare grounds susceptible to wind erosion. However, global characterization of post-fire dust emissions has remained qualitative and focused only on landscapes disturbed by relatively large wildfires. Here we apply principles of fluid mechanics to satellite measurements to quantify post-fire dust emissions. We find that 61% of global wildfires at various extents are followed by enhanced dust emissions, injecting 5.6 (3.3–9.2) Tg of dust per year during 2003 to 2022. 95% of the post-fire dust emissions are sourced to small wildfires, which occur more frequently and broadly than large wildfires especially across sparsely vegetated regions. Despite the recent decline in global burned area and a resultant decreasing occurrence of post-fire dust events, the total amount of global post-fire dust emissions has increased by 77% during the last two decades. This elevation in total post-fire dust emissions is attributed to intensifying burning and worsening fire-induced land degradation, which trigger a 155% increase in the intensity of post-fire dust emissions. With an ongoing enhancement of extreme wildfires and synchronized droughts under global warming, our results indicate the emerging importance of post-fire dust emissions globally and regionally. Post-fire dust emissions have increased by 77% globally over the past two decades, and small fires account for 95% of these emissions, according to analysis of satellite observations."

 Over the past few decades, a reduction in chlorinated long-lived ozone-depleting substance emissions due to the regulations imposed by the Montreal Protocol has led to a global decrease in stratospheric chlorine. At the same time, emissions of chlorinated Very Short-Lived Substances, which are unregulated, have increased. Here we show that observed changes of inorganic stratospheric chlorine are inconsistent with changes in the tropospheric abundances of long-lived ozone-depleting substances. Satellite observations of stratospheric chlorine species from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment—Fourier Transform Spectrometer during 2004–2020 reveal that the observed decrease in inorganic stratospheric chlorine is 25%–30% smaller than expected based on trends of long-lived ozone-depleting substances alone. At mid-latitudes in the lower stratosphere, this can be explained by the chlorinated Very Short-Lived Substances increase, which offsets the long-term reduction of stratospheric chlorine by up to 30%.

Results from the two components are combined based on their respective confidence. A validation was conducted against 6 years of CALIPSO LiDAR data over the Australian continent, showing an overall accuracy of 96 %. The algorithm requires no ancillary data. It is also computationally efficient and so is suitable for near real-time (i.e., within 2 h) operation and can be readily adopted to similar operational geostationary sensors."

 A systematic, long-term analysis of county-level UVR in Xizang is conducted by integrating satellite data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME-2) with ground-based observations spanning 1961–2022. The spatiotemporal characteristics and influencing factors of parameters such as UV index (UVI), UVB, and UVA are analyzed. During 2005–2022, UVA, spectral irradiances (I310:310 nm, I324:324 nm and I380:380 nm) show significant upward trends, with Sen's slope values all exceeding 0.51. The mean values of Erythemal Daily Dose, UVA, and UVB in each county of Xizang are respectively 24.85–37.79, 3.32–5.10, 903–1330 (kJ/m2), with high values distributed in the areas of Shigatse, Lhasa, and southern Shannan. The population-weighted UVI across all counties exceeds 8.65, with 84.27 % of the population classified as experiencing “Extreme” UV exposure according to the WHO's UVI classification. The percentage of UVR in surface solar radiation is higher in the west and lower in the east, peaking in summer and dipping in winter, while the UVA/UVB ratio exhibits the opposite seasonal trend, increasing exponentially from summer to winter. UVR has higher coefficient of variation in the afternoon and more fluctuating peak times in summer with a higher risk of extreme values. Spatial multiple regression analysis (p < 0.001) indicates that UVR is significantly influenced by elevation and SA (positive effects), and by ozone total column (OTC), cloud optical thickness (COT), aerosol index (AI), and latitude (negative effects), with the model performing best in autumn and for the shorter wavelength band (I305). Temporally, COT and OTC show positively synchronous variation with UVR, while SA and AI show negative.

 This study investigated the complex relationships between aerosols, clouds, and solar radiation over the Korean Peninsula using long-term observational data from 1994 to 2023. We identified a negative correlation between PM10 concentration and solar radiation, indicating that aerosol levels significantly affect solar energy availability. Using the WRF-CMAQ coupled model, we quantitatively analyzed the contributions of aerosol direct effect (ADE) and cloud radiative effect (CRE), focusing on the differing impacts of stratus and cumulus clouds. Our findings reveal that stratus clouds, which are prevalent in the early morning, contribute substantially to ADE, while cumulus clouds, which develop in the afternoon owing to increased surface heating, primarily influence CRE. The Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) showed the highest contributions from both ADE and CRE, indicating that areas with a high population density and elevated aerosol concentrations (PM10, PM2.5, and AOD) experienced a pronounced impact of ADE on solar radiation. Conversely, in the Gangwon (GW) region, where mountainous terrain promotes cumulus cloud development, the afternoon contributions of CRE are more pronounced.

 Satellite-based measurements have been widely used for estimating fire-emitted pollutants based on the parameters of either burned area or fire radiative power (FRP). Fire-related remote sensing additionally requires information on active fire areas and fire temperature at a subpixel scale, as well as the combustion phases (i.e., smoldering and flaming) to infer the plume injection height and to understand the mechanics of resulting atmospheric processes like pyro-convection. The FRP is as a key indicator of fire intensity that is frequently retrieved using infrared signals. The fire properties at a subpixel level, including the effective fire temperature and fire area, can be retrieved by the bi-spectral method. However, these approaches normally neglect the heat transport phenomena and subsequently fail to characterize the fire area that could be composed of different combustion phases (e.g. smoldering, flaming, or a combination of the two). Neglecting the phenomena of heat transfer leads to mis-estimation of the actual fire area and its associated emission profile for combustion products that are a function of the combustion phase. To address this challenge, this work presents a new approach to resolve the effective temperature variation inside each fire pixel using a semi-empirical heat-transfer algorithm. This algorithm utilizes radiance observations from geostationary satellites as inputs. With the aid of fine-spatial-resolution spaceborne and airborne observations, we evaluated and validated the fire retrieval performance on western US wildfires corresponding to the 2019 season. Our results show that FRP obtained through this heat-transfer method exhibits a stronger linear correlation with those retrieved from airborne measurements. Moreover, by analyzing the temperature variation curve obtained using this method, it is possible to further retrieve the fire area under different combustion conditions within the fire pixels."

This process is expected to make the clouds brighter, allowing them to reflect more sunlight back to space. However, it may also cause the clouds to lose water over time, reducing their ability to reflect sunlight. We use a computer model to show that the loss of cloud water occurs relatively quickly and does not completely offset the initial brightening. 
 Cloud liquid water path (L) adjusts to perturbations in cloud droplet number concentration (N) over time. We explore the magnitude and timescale of this adjustment in nocturnal non-precipitating marine stratocumuli using large eddy simulations of baseline conditions and aerosol seeding experiments for 22 meteorological conditions. The results confirm that the L adjustment (δL) slope (k) is more negative for simulation pairs with relatively low N and less negative for high N. Overall, k is unlikely to be lower than −0.4 within 24 h of seeding start, meaning the L adjustment is unlikely to fully offset the brightening due to the Twomey effect. After seeding, the δL becomes increasingly negative, which can be characterized by an exponential convergence. This evolution is governed by a short timescale around 5 h and lasts for around 8–12 h. It is driven by the feedback between entrainment, L, and boundary layer (BL) turbulence. Other processes, including radiation, surface fluxes, and subsidence, respond to the seeding weakly. This short timescale is insensitive to the amount of seeding, making the evolution of δL and some other deviations similar for different seeding amounts after appropriate scaling. The timescale of k evolution is closely related to the δL timescale and hence also short, while it could also be affected by the δN evolution. The results are most relevant to conditions where seeding is applied to a large area of marine stratocumulus in well-mixed and overcast BL where shear is not a primary source of turbulence."

A study of different variables and their efficiency as inputs for these models is also proposed and reveals that the best results are obtained when using all of them. Comparison between network architectures and information fusion methods allows for the extraction of knowledge on the most efficient methods in the context of this study. 
 Ground-level concentrations of particulate matter (more precisely PM2.5) are a strong indicator of air quality, which is now widely recognised to impact human health. Accurately inferring or predicting PM2.5 concentrations is therefore an important step for health hazard monitoring and the implementation of air-quality-related policies. Various methods have been used to achieve this objective, and neural networks are one of the most recent and popular solutions. In this study, a limited set of quantities that are known to impact the relation between column aerosol optical depth (AOD) and surface PM2.5 concentrations are used as input of several network architectures to investigate how different fusion strategies can impact and help explain predicted PM2.5 concentrations. Different models are trained on two different sets of simulated data, namely, global-scale atmospheric composition reanalysis provided by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) and higher-resolution data simulated over Europe with the Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques ALADIN model. Based on an extensive set of experiments, this work proposes several models of knowledge-inspired neural networks, achieving interesting results from both the performance and interpretability points of view. Specifically, novel architectures based on boundary condition generative adversarial networks (BC-GANs, which are able to leverage information from sparse ground observation networks) and on more traditional UNets, employing various information fusion methods, are designed and evaluated against each other. Our results can serve as a baseline benchmark for other studies and be used to develop further optimised models for the inference of PM2.5 concentrations from AOD at either the global or regional scale."

Residential fuel combustion is a major contributor to light-absorbing brown carbon (BrC) and black carbon (BC), yet their mass absorption efficiency (MAE) and association with complex chemical components remain poorly understood. This study investigated the MAE of BrC at λ = 370 nm (MAEBrC) and BC at λ = 880 nm (MAEBC), focusing on their variabilities attributed to organic chemical components through 131 burning tests involving various fuel-stove combinations. The MAEBrC, with an average of 4.8 ± 2.2 m2/g and a range of 0.35 to 10 m2/g, was comparable to previously reported values from field-based experiments; however, MAEBC (average: 8.7 ± 3.7 m2/g, range: 2.9–28 m2/g) was obviously lower than those field-based observations. This discrepancy was attributed to the greater dependence of MAEBC on combustion efficiency and highlighted the need for appropriate methodologies for measuring MAE values. MAEBC increased with the rise in organic carbon-to-element carbon ratios due to the lensing effect, which was a significant factor determining the MAEBC and explaining 36–77% of its variations. While MAEBrC mainly depended on the different BrC chromophores emitted during combustion with protein-like substances and humic-like substances being the predominant components of BrC derived from biomass and coal combustion, contributing 31% and 46% to the light absorption of extractable BrC from biomass and coal, respectively."

However, DVP's dependency on elevation and evolution in a warming climate remain unclear. This study investigates the elevation‐dependency of the terrestrial DVP in boreal summer and its evolution using 20‐year satellite data. Results show that late‐afternoon to evening is the major peak period for boreal summer precipitation across all altitudes, while late night is the secondary peak period at 2–4 km above sea level (ASL). Precipitation tends to peak more in the late afternoon above 5 km ASL compared to lower altitudes. With global warming, the late‐afternoon peak is weakening while the evening peak is strengthening, particularly above 4 km ASL. Diurnal precipitation may have become more homogeneous with narrowing amplitude, which is more pronounced at lower elevations. These findings highlight DVP is elevation‐dependent and is evolving in probable response to global warming."

We hypothesize that this darkening is mostly caused by the rapid thermodynamic adjustment of the cloudy environment to the slight, but spatially coherent, warming introduced by the pressure pulse. The corresponding reduction in relative humidity leads to the shrinkage and evaporation of small cloud droplets and hygroscopic particles in the halo region, which, in turn, temporarily reduces the optical thickness of the cloudy column."

To address this, we developed an Interpretable machine learning (ML) and source apportionment (IMSA) framework. The framework screens pollutant sources for PM2.5 and CO2, and calculates their contributions, revealing that industrial emissions (IE) (11%, 29%), vehicle exhaust (VE) (13%, 19%), and coal combustion (19%, 15%) are major shared sources.

 Lingering global emissions of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) are slowing ozone layer recovery. Estimates of global CCl4 emissions based on observed atmospheric mole fractions and inverse modelling (top down) exceed the emissions derived from known sources (bottom up) by ~30–40%. Here we derived CCl4 emissions from China for 2011–2021 using long-term atmospheric observations from a network of sites from across China and a top-down approach. Mean annual CCl4 emissions in China during 2011–2021 were between approximately 16 Gg yr−1 and 25 Gg yr−1, substantially larger than previous bottom-up inventories for China of less than 6 Gg yr−1 since 2011. Expressed in terms of ozone depletion potential (ODP)-weighted emissions, CCl4 annual emissions from China are comparable to global annual ‘unexpected’ trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) emissions during 2013–2018, or global total annual hydrochlorofluorocarbon emissions in 2020. The CCl4 emissions from China accounted for approximately half of the reported global total during 2011–2020, with neither showing a significant decreasing trend during this period. Substantial CCl4 emissions in China from allowed feedstock use, during the renewed production of CFC-11 between 2013 and 2018, and from by-production could close some of the emissions gap. However, ~4–15 Gg yr−1 of CCl4 emissions in China remain unexplained during 2011–2021, potentially accounting for more than half of the remaining global gap.

 Brown carbon (BrC) aerosols impact climate and air quality through light absorption, but their size-resolved characteristics remain unclear. This study employs a novel positive matrix factorization (PMF) approach constrained by light absorption and marker fragment to derive the size distribution of the BrC number concentration and light absorption at high time and size resolutions. Our results show distinct bimodal patterns in the BrC number concentration for the sub-500 nm particles at Mace Head, the west coast of Ireland, with peaks at ~20 nm and 107 nm, attributable to new particle formation (nucleation mode) and subsequent growth processes to the accumulation mode, respectively. Light absorption also exhibited a bimodal distribution, with peaks at 137 nm and increasing values to 484 nm. This difference highlights that the larger particles (e.g. around 484 nm), though fewer in number (~3.6% of the total BrC particles), contribute significantly (~70%) to light absorption due to high mass concentration. The direct solar absorption of BrC relative to black carbon ranges from 1.7% to 4.8%, with a slight increase for particles larger than 100 nm, emphasizing the importance of larger particles in BrC radiative effects. These results offer insights into the size-resolved properties of sub-500 nm BrC, enhancing our understanding of BrC properties and potentially reducing uncertainties in aerosol-radiation interactions."

We explored how black carbon (BC) responded to these measures and found that a reduction in liquid fuel use was the main factor driving a decrease in BC levels. Additionally, meteorological factors also played a significant role in the long-term trends of BC. These factors should be considered in future emission reduction policies to further enhance air quality improvements. 
 Black carbon (BC) is an essential component of particulate matter (PM), with a significant impact on climate change. Few studies have investigated the long-term changes in BC and its sources, particularly considering primary emissions of BC, which is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. Here, 3-year BC observations (2019–2021) are reported in Nanjing, a polluted city in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, eastern China. The results revealed that the average BC concentration was 2.5 ± 1.6 µg m−3, peaking in winter, with approximately 80 % attributed to liquid fuel combustion. Based on 3-year monitoring data, the random forest (RF) algorithm was employed to reconstruct BC concentrations in Nanjing from 2014 to 2021. Source apportionment was conducted on the reconstructed time series, which revealed a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in BC levels over the 8-year period, primarily due to reduced emissions from liquid fuels. Compared to the earlier control policy period (P1: 2013–2017), BC concentrations declined more steeply after 2018 (P2) due to reduced solid fuel burning. The seasonal analysis indicated significant reductions (p < 0.05) in BC, BCliquid (black carbon from liquid fuel combustion) and BCsolid (black carbon from solid fuel combustion) during winter, with BCliquid accounting for 77 % of the reduction. Overall, emission reduction was the dominant factor in lowering BC levels, contributing between 62 % and 86 %, though meteorological conditions played an increasingly important role in P2, particularly for BC and BCliquid. Our results demonstrate that targeted control measures for liquid fuel combustion are necessary, as it is a major driver of BC reduction, and highlight the non-negligible influence of meteorological factors on long-term BC variations."

 Sulfur dioxide emitted during volcanic eruptions can be hazardous for aviation safety. As part of their activities, the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centres (VAACs) are therefore interested in the real-time atmospheric monitoring of this gas. A recent development aims at improving the forecasts of volcanic sulfur dioxide quantities made by the MOCAGE (Modèle de Chimie Atmosphérique à Grande Échelle) chemistry transport model. For this purpose, observations from both TROPOMI (Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument) and IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer; B and C) located on separate polar-orbiting satellites are assimilated into the model. These sulfur dioxide measurements are based on the eruption event of the La Soufrière Saint Vincent volcano in April 2021. Observations from OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) are considered validation data.

Yokelson,Age of smoke sampled by aircraft during FIREX-AQ: methods and critical evaluation,"Smoke age is an important factor in the chemical and physical evolution of smoke. Two methods for determining the age of smoke are applied to the NASA-NOAA FIREX-AQ field campaign: one based on wind speed and distance, and another using an ensemble of modeled air parcel trajectories. Both methods are evaluated, with the trajectory method, which includes plume rise and uncertainty estimates, proving more accurate. 
 The age of smoke, meaning the time elapsed since it was produced in a fire, is an important parameter for interpreting measurements of evolving smoke composition. This study describes the smoke age estimates developed for large plumes sampled in the 2019 NASA-NOAA FIREX-AQ field experiment. Smoke ages are computed using two methods and applied to observations from two aircraft: the NASA DC-8 and a NOAA Twin Otter. The first method uses measurements of mean horizontal wind speed, as observed by the sampling aircraft, and distance to the fire to provide a single age estimate for each plume-crossing performed by the aircraft. While this ""mean-wind method"" uses accurate wind measurements, it can be systematically biased by assumptions that plume rise time is negligible and that winds are homogeneous horizontally and in time during the plume transport. Wind inhomogeneities due to terrain effects and day-to-night transition, among other factors, affected some plumes during FIREX-AQ. The mean-wind method therefore performs best for short-range transport over level terrain with steady winds. The second method relies on upwind air parcel trajectories and plume rise computed with multiple high-resolution meteorological datasets. This ""trajectory-based method"" quantifies age uncertainty from the meteorological ensemble, plume rise speed, wind speed errors, and fire location. The second method also resolves age differences from the center to edge of a transect. Still, it is susceptible to errors in the meteorological model. With careful comparison of the simulated trajectories to smoke transport observed from geostationary satellite imagery described here, we filter out many trajectory errors and improve the smoke age estimates. The two age methods are strongly correlated (R = 0.93) for the periods during FIREX-AQ when both ages are available. The mean-wind age is systematically 14 % younger than the trajectory-based age and the median absolute difference between them is 19 % (23 % for mean). The favorable agreement between the two age methods reflects that the mean-wind method was selectively applied to plumes with little wind variability. Trajectory-based ages are available for more of the FIREX-AQ smoke observations than the mean-wind ages. The median trajectory-based age uncertainty during FIREX-AQ is 24 % and the mean uncertainty is 37 %, due to a long-tailed distribution. The main source of age uncertainty is spread within the meteorological ensemble, followed by discrepancy between measured and modeled wind speed, then other factors like plume rise. The age uncertainty variable enables the user to identify periods with high or low confidence in the age estimate, thereby informing studies of smoke aging."

Here we develop an assessment framework combining an agricultural management technology database and evaluate technology combinations for their potentials in NH3 emission reductions and consequent air quality and ecosystem benefits for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region. Results show that BTH agricultural NH3 emissions can be reduced by up to 57% (274 Gg of N per year) in 2019. With maximum feasible NH3 reduction (57%), annual PM2.5 concentrations and nitrogen deposition in BTH can be reduced by up to 7% and 13%, respectively, which are more significant than the effects of halving local anthropogenic NOx emissions. When combining NH3 and NOx emission reductions, the effects of NH3 controls on PM2.5 mitigation will be suppressed while facilitating more efficient local nitrogen deposition mitigation. Our findings implicate that technically feasible NH3 emission reductions are still useful for current PM2.5 management and nitrogen deposition mitigation. In the near future, with continuous NOx controls, additional NH3 controls are required to further mitigate nitrogen deposition in BTH, while associated air quality benefits would depend nonlinearly upon the levels of NH3 and NOx emission reductions."

Based on a data set containing 109 measured mass fractions of p-SO42– (p-SO42– fraction) from CFPPs in China, this study develops a Bayesian linear regression model to identify the dominant factors of p-SO42– formation and to quantify the effects. The results indicate that coal’s sulfur content and usage of certain APCDs promote the formation of p-SO42–, including selective catalytic reduction (SCR), wet flue gas desulfurization (WFGD), and semidry desulfurization (SDD), whereas the wet electrostatic precipitator (WESP) and desulfurization efficiency inhibit it. Benchmarking against machine learning approaches demonstrates the performance of the Bayesian model (R2 = 0.72, and RLOO2 = 0.45), which outperformed random forest and XGBoost algorithms in generalization ability, showing its advantages in addressing small data sets. The model predicts an average p-SO42– fraction of 0.144 ± 0.037 g/g across 69 CFPPs in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) region.

Traditional NPF event classification schemes in the literature, primarily through visual inspection of particle number size distributions, are subjective, time-consuming, and laborious. Here, we introduced a fast object detection deep learning algorithm, You Only Look Once (YOLO), for the first time to detect NPF events. We used more than one year of asynchronous particle number size distribution data from 20 diverse geographical locations globally. The YOLO algorithm was first trained and validated using a small subset of manually annotated 252 NPF events and 195 non-events (approximately 25 images from each measurement site). The trained YOLO algorithm was then evaluated to detect NPF events against the remaining 6462 observation days across all measurement sites. The performance metrics of the trained YOLO algorithm revealed high precision and accuracy in detecting NPF events. The model accuracy for each measurement site was calculated by taking the ratio of the total number of NPF events detected by the trained YOLO algorithm at a confidence score (CoS) > 0.1 to the total number of visually identified NPF events. Considering all measurement sites, the trained YOLO algorithm’s accuracy (in fraction) for detecting NPF events ranged from 0.74 to 0.97 at a CoS > 0.1, although the accuracy decreased with increasing threshold CoS. This work underscores the efficacy and robustness of the YOLO algorithm and demonstrates its applicability in accurately detecting NPF events in diverse environmental conditions worldwide."

Qingdao is a coastal city in eastern China, located in the Asian continental outflow, where iron constitutes one of the major mineral species in fine particles (PM2.5). Using positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis of PM2.5 composition data (139 samples collected during the spring of 2017 and 2018) from Qingdao, we quantified the sources of total iron (FeT) and its water-soluble fraction (i.e., FeS) and the iron solubility (%FeS = FeS/FeT×100%) enhancement mechanisms. Our results revealed that while mineral dust contributed 71.1% of FeT, anthropogenic sources dominated FeS, accounting for 63.6% of FeS. During dust events, aged dust particles contributed about half of the FeS, with %FeS enhanced by up to 2.2-fold through atmospheric aging processes. In non-dust periods, anthropogenic sources accounted for 84.8% of FeS, with the %FeS mainly modulated by ship emissions, secondary aerosols, and aging of industrial particles. Notably, ship emissions exhibited exceptionally high %FeS, while secondary processes involving organic ligands and acid-processed industrial aerosols significantly enhanced %FeS. These findings quantitatively demonstrate the significance of anthropogenic air pollutants and secondary processes in FeS occurrence in Asian continental outflow, with important implications for understanding iron biogeochemical cycling in downwind marine ecosystems."

 Cropland expansion has been the most notable change in global land use since industrialization. However, assessments of radiative forcing from land-use change have generally neglected the effects of cropland expansion on secondary organic aerosol. Here we perform a series of cropland expansion sensitivity experiments with an Earth system model that incorporates advanced secondary organic aerosol processes, including organic new particle formation. Our model results show an ~ 10% decrease in biogenic secondary organic aerosol burden due to cropland expansion since industrialization. This has reduced radiation scattering and cloud droplet formation associated with secondary organic aerosol, leading to a 146 ± 112 mW m−2 decline in its radiative cooling forcing, equivalent to 8% of CO2-induced radiative warming forcing since industrialization. The radiative impact is mainly attributed to the transition from evergreen and deciduous broadleaf forests to croplands. The radiative impacts are projected to increase by approximately 50% under future climate warming and reduced anthropogenic aerosol and precursor gas emissions, due to changes in biogenic emission intensity and background cloud condensation nuclei concentration. Policies addressing food security and climate change should account for the radiative impact of biogenic secondary organic aerosol from cropland expansion. Model simulations suggest that cropland expansion since industrialization has reduced atmospheric biogenic secondary organic aerosol by 10% and its associated radiative cooling effect by 11%."

 Existing remote sensing techniques provide insights into the global-scale daily distribution of tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) vertical column densities (VCDs). However, they struggle to quantify the diurnal variation of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, crucial for understanding air quality and atmospheric environment. We present a novel mass-conserving inversion method and sampling strategy that uses the overlap between adjacent swath edges of polar orbiting satellite Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI to quantify five years (May 2018 to April 2023) of global diurnal NOx emissions over upper mid-latitude regions. We account for first-order thermodynamics, chemical decay, and advective and pressure induced transport, allowing a flexible, rapid, and reliable alternative to complex models. By sampling two daytime NO2 VCDs across consecutive orbits approximately 100 min apart, emissions rates are computed for both the 100-min window around midday as well as the 24-h daily cycle. Robust climatological estimates and uncertainty quantification are enabled over major urban areas like New York, Benelux, North China Plain, and Almaty. The estimated diurnal emissions variation show that 100-min emissions are 21 %–105 % higher than 24-h averages, which reveals differences in chemical lifetime from different energy sources, unique spatial-temporal weekend effects over China, USA, and Europe, and see-saw of emissions underestimation over cleaner regions and improvement over polluted regions.

 In tropical South America there has been substantial progress in atmospheric monitoring capacity, but the region still has a limited number of continental atmospheric stations relative to its large area, hindering net carbon flux estimates using atmospheric inversions. In this study, we use dry-air CO2 mole fractions measured at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO) and airborne vertical CO2 profiles in an atmospheric inversion system to estimate net carbon exchange in tropical South America from 2010 to 2018. Given previous knowledge of a bias due to undried samples in the airborne vertical profiles, we calculate the effect of this systematic uncertainty in our inverse estimates and propose a water-vapor correction to the airborne CO2 profiles. We focus our analysis on the biogeographic Amazon and its neighboring “Cerrado and Caatinga” biomes. Including the water-vapor correction changes the posterior ensemble median from −0.33 to −0.04 PgC yr−1 with a posterior uncertainty of 0.33 PgC yr−1 for the Amazon and for the Cerrado and Caatinga from 0.31 to 0.50 PgC yr−1, with an uncertainty of 0.24 PgC yr−1. Our estimates of carbon exchange include the contributions from both net vegetation exchange and release from fires. Assuming that the correction brings the observational data closer to the truth implies that the Amazon is a weaker sink of carbon and that the Cerrado and Caatinga is a larger source. We do not find a strong spatial shift of fluxes within the biogeographic Amazon due to the correction, nor do we find a strong impact on the interannual variations. Finally, to further reduce the uncertainty in regional carbon balance estimates in tropical South America, we call for an expansion of the atmospheric monitoring network on the continent, mainly in the Amazon–Andes foothills."

This is compared to literature values and common models. The results show that the method used primarily matches current literature values. Additionally, a pesticide’s volatility as an indicator of the likelihood of atmospheric transport occurring is explored. 
 Pesticides have been found to be transported through the atmosphere away from fields after application. A key indicator of a pesticide's likelihood to reside in the atmosphere is its vapour pressure. Within this study we evaluate a novel method, the Filter Inlet for Gases and AEROsols (FIGAERO) coupled with a chemical ionisation mass spectrometer, using a set of calibration compounds, polyethylene glycols (PEGs). Two methods of compound delivery onto the filter have been tested: atomisation and syringe deposition. Delivery results are consistent with previous studies, highlighting the lack of suitability of the syringe method. The successful calibration using the atomisation method was then used to determine the vapour pressure of six pesticides. This is the first time particle-phase pesticides have been measured with particle-phase chemical ionisation mass spectrometry (CIMS). The pesticide volatilities were compared with widely accepted standard literature values used in industry, as well as values derived from a common environmental model frequently employed in industrial applications. Results showed that measurements from the FIGAERO-CIMS were consistent with reported literature values for some compounds, while others differed by up to 2 orders of magnitude. Determinations of dicamba, MCPA, and MCPP volatility using the FIGAERO-CIMS showed them to be semi-volatile, in agreement with literature values within 1 order of magnitude.  Mesotrione exhibited the largest difference in volatility, with the   FIGAERO-CIMS measuring a low volatility of 4.12×10-8Pa at 298 K (compared to a literature value of 5.7×10-6Pa). The difference for 2,4-D of 1 order of magnitude can be explained by the smaller particles deposited on the FIGAERO filter compared to the aerosolised PEG calibration particles, leading to evaporation at higher Tmax values and a lower measured vapour pressure and thus further supporting the conclusion that a calibration using the same particle size is required. The atmospheric implications of the pesticide volatilities are also discussed. A pesticide's volatility is often a key indicator of the likelihood of the potential for short- or long-range transport occurring, thus determining a pesticide's fate in the atmosphere and potential for environmental pollution from transportation in the air."

We use an AI scheme to achieve fast, accurate, and stable end-to-end simulation for full ACI within an atmospheric model, replacing numerical schemes. This innovation is expected to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of ACI simulations in climate models that would otherwise neglect or simplify ACI processes. 
 Simulating aerosol chemistry and interactions (ACI) is crucial in climate and atmospheric modeling, yet conventional numerical schemes are computationally intensive due to the stiff differential equations and iterative methods involved. While artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated  potential in accelerating photochemistry simulations, it has not been applied for simulating the full ACI processes, which encompass not only chemical reactions but also other processes, such as nucleation and coagulation. To bridge this gap, we develop a novel Artificial Intelligence Model for Aerosol Chemistry and Interactions (AIMACI), focusing initially on inorganic aerosols. Trained based on a conventional scheme, it has been validated in both offline and online modes (referring to whether it is coupled into a three-dimensional atmospheric model). Results demonstrate that AIMACI is not only comparable with  conventional schemes in spatial distributions, temporal variations, and evolution of particle size distribution of main aerosol species, including water content in aerosols, but also exhibits robust generalization ability, reliably simulating one month under different environmental conditions across four seasons despite being trained on limited data from merely 16 d. Notably, it exhibits ∼5× speedup with a single CPU and ∼277× speedup with a single GPU, compared with conventional schemes. However, the stability of AIMACI for year-scale global simulations remains to be seen, requiring further testing. AIMACI's generalization capability and its modular design suggest potential for future coupling to global climate models, which are expected to enhance the precision and efficiency of ACI simulations in climate modeling that neglects or simplifies ACI processes."

Key findings include the extension of the N2O–∆′17O correlation to the upper troposphere and the identification of significant differences in the N2O–∆′17O slope in StratoClim samples. Additionally, the ∆′17O measurements are used to estimate global stratospheric production and surface removal of ∆′17O, providing an independent estimate of global vegetation CO2 exchange. 
 High-precision measurements of the triple oxygen isotope composition of CO2 (Δ′17O) can be used to estimate biosphere–atmosphere exchange of CO2, the residence time of tropospheric CO2, and stratosphere–troposphere exchange. In this study, we report measurements of  the Δ′17O(CO2) from air samples collected during two aircraft-based programmes, CARIBIC and StratoClim. CARIBIC (Civil Aircraft for the Regular Investigation of the atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container) provided air samples from numerous transcontinental flights in  the upper troposphere–lower stratosphere region. StratoClim (Stratospheric and upper tropospheric processes for better climate predictions) conducted intensive campaigns with the high-altitude aircraft M55 Geophysica during the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone (ASMA), providing air samples from altitudes up to 21 km.Using high-precision Δ′17O measurements of the CARIBIC samples, we show that the N2O–Δ′17O correlation, previously observed in the stratosphere, extends to the upper troposphere. Moreover, we found no significant spatial or hemispheric differences in Δ′17O(CO2) for the upper-tropospheric samples collected during the CARIBIC programme. However, in many of the StratoClim samples, with significant stratospheric contributions, we observed a much lower N2O–Δ′17O slope compared to CARIBIC samples and previous publications. This deviation is attributed to change in eddy diffusion above the tropopause within the ASMA, confirming previously published model calculations. These samples provide the first experimental evidence that differences in vertical mixing/transport can lead to significantly different N2O–Δ′17O slopes. High-precision Δ′17O measurements can identify ejections of tropospheric air into the stratosphere based on the slope of the N2O–Δ′17O correlation, as both tracers have chemical lifetimes longer than their transport times.Furthermore, we use the Δ′17O measurements from the lower stratosphere and the upper troposphere to estimate global stratospheric production and surface removal of the isotope tracer Δ′17O. The removal estimate is then used to derive an independent estimate of global vegetation exchange of CO2, confirming earlier estimates based on surface level Δ′17O measurements."

This is the case for measurements of atmospheric water vapour using Raman lidar, which are of growing interest in the context of climate risks such as extreme precipitation. This study addresses this issue. It is based on six campaigns spread over a period of 7 years between 2016 and 2022. 
 Numerous field campaigns have been carried out to quantify the water vapour content of the atmosphere using vibrational Raman lidar technology. Each of them raises the question of calibration methods, in particular the reliability of this calibration over time. We present a study on the stability of the calibration of the WALI (Water vapour and Aerosol Lidar, now renamed Weather and Aerosol LIdar) lidar developed at Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement (LSCE) in France, over a period of 7 years (2016–2022) and across several field campaigns. A calibration method is applied mainly using radiosondes and, in a few cases, airborne meteorological probes. Complementing the previous approaches, we show that ground-based meteorological measurements can be of great value for lidar calibration under conditions of vertical stability in the lower troposphere and provide good knowledge of the lidar overlap function, with full overlap within the planetary boundary layer. Using statistical criteria, we emphasize that these three calibration approaches should remain consistent over time. The observation periods considered here allow us to sample a wide range of water vapour contents in the lower troposphere, from 0.5 g kg−1 to more than 10 g kg−1, characteristic of the variabilities expected over the mid-latitudes and even over the Arctic. From comparisons between lidar and in situ measurements (radiosondes and/or flights), we observe a variability of more than 10 % in the calibration constant between field experiments conducted with and without laser injection seeding. The root mean square error between the lidar and in situ reference measurements is between 0.23 and 0.6 g kg−1, mainly due to the atmospheric variability during the calibration. The bias is small, less than 0.08 g kg−1. For all the situations studied, the correlation coefficient remains high, above 0.75. The instrumental error is comparable to the 0.4 g kg−1 recommended by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Such a precision requires the use of a significant number of reference profiles,  and the remaining limitation is due to the uncertainties associated with in situ weather sensors. We note that the use of ground-based measurements does not introduce any more uncertainty in the lidar calibration coefficient than vertical profiles obtained by radiosondes or airborne means. Furthermore, the use of reanalyses can be an interesting option for calibration if the lidar profiles are not used in the models themselves, e.g. by means of assimilation."

However, few studies have addressed the challenges in the prior vertical structure. Different observations are assimilated to examine the sensitivity of assimilation to vertical structure. Results show that assimilation can optimize the dust field in general. However, if the prior introduces an incorrect structure, the assimilation can significantly deteriorate the integrity of the aerosol profile. 
 Modelling and observational techniques are pivotal in aerosol research, yet each approach exhibits inherent limitations. Aerosol observation is constrained by its limited spatial and temporal coverage compared to that of models. On the other hand, models tend to possess higher uncertainties and biases compared to observations. Aerosol data assimilation has gained popularity as it combines the advantages of both methods. Despite numerous studies in this domain, few have addressed the challenges faced in assimilating aerosol data with significant differences in magnitude and degree of freedom between the model state and observations, especially in the vertical direction. These challenges can lead to the preservation – or even the exacerbation – of structural inaccuracies within the assimilation process. This study investigates the sensitivity of dust aerosol data assimilation to the vertical structure of the aerosol profile. We assimilate a variety of dust observations, encompassing ground-based particulate matter (PM10) measurements, and satellite-derived dust optical depth (DOD) data, using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). The assimilation process is elucidated, detailing the assimilation of raw ground-based and satellite-based observations for an optimized three-dimensional (3D) posterior state. To demonstrate the impact of accurate vs. erroneous prior aerosol vertical profiles on the assimilation result, we select three cases of super dust storms for analysis. Our findings reveal that the assimilation of ground observations would optimize the dust field at the ground in general. However, the vertical structure presents a more complex challenge. When the prior profile accurately reflects the true vertical structure, the assimilation process can successfully preserve this structure. Conversely, if the prior profile introduces an incorrect structure, the assimilation can significantly deteriorate the integrity of the aerosol profile. This is also found in the assimilation of DOD, which exhibits a comparable pattern in its sensitivity to the initial aerosol profile's accuracy."

Airborne measurements during the 2023 Atmospheric Emissions and Reactions Observed from Megacities to Marine Areas (AEROMMA) campaign investigated nonlinear O3 photochemistry in these cities. We report mean ozone production efficiency (OPE), the enhancement ratio of Ox (= O3 + NO2) to NOx oxidation products, of 9 ± 4 (1σ), 6 ± 3, and 6 ± 3 ppbv ppbv–1 in NYC, Chicago, and LA, respectively. Compared to historical values, OPE has increased in NYC but remains constant in LA. We find that OPE during AEROMMA has a nonlinear, inverse relationship with total reactive nitrogen (NOy, a proxy for initial NOx) and a positive correlation with the nonmethane VOC to NOy enhancement ratio. A zero-dimensional photochemical model supports these observed OPE dependences on NOx and VOCs and shows that OPE is a distinct metric from total O3 production that is informative to the development of O3 pollution control strategies. We find that OPE values have higher variability, and a larger increase with NOx emissions reductions, in areas that experience NOx-sensitive rather than NOx-saturated O3 photochemistry; nonetheless, NOx reductions under NOx-sensitive conditions still reduce total O3 production despite the corresponding increase in OPE."

However, comprehensive evaluations of three-dimensional models in simulating both nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) and OVOCs remain scarce, hindering O3 control strategies. This study systematically evaluates the Community Multiscale Air Quality model (CMAQv5.3.3) using hourly observations from 12 monitoring sites across China from 2017 to 2021. Results reveal that the model underestimates NMHCs by 22.0% and OVOCs by 43.7%, on average. Within the 14 abundant OVOC components, formaldehyde (HCHO) and ketones (PRD2) show overpredictions, while other OVOCs are underpredicted (4.7–94.2%), with simulated OVOC contributions to total VOCs (8.8–36.7%) being substantially lower than observations (16.6–60.8%). The model exhibits persistent underestimation in daytime concentrations across seasons and shows stronger declines in daytime concentrations from nighttime peaks compared to observations, which suggests overestimated atmospheric physical diffusion or vertical mixing processes. Residual error analysis after subtracting the simulation bias of NMHCs (primarily attributed to biases in emissions and atmospheric physical processes) highlights inadequate secondary chemical formation as a major bias source for OVOCs. Sensitivity experiments demonstrate that conventional adjustments to boundary layer and surface parametrization schemes, minimum turbulent diffusivity (Kzmin), or primary emissions failed to resolve daytime OVOCs underestimation. On the contrary, adjusting eddy diffusivity values during the day, the local vertical gradient in an unstable atmospheric state, and the yield coefficient for OVOCs chemical formation effectively enhance the simulated daytime concentrations of OVOCs and reduce the model bias. This study highlights that better descriptions of the atmospheric diffusion or vertical mixing processes during the daytime and the secondary chemical formations of OVOCs should be prioritized to improve the performance of NMHCs and OVOCs modeling."

White;Yoo‐Jeong Noh;John M. Haynes;Imme Ebert‐Uphoff,Emulating Daytime ABI Cloud Optical Properties at Night With Machine Learning,"Cloud optical property retrievals from passive satellite imagers tend to be most accurate during the daytime due to the availability of visible and near‐infrared solar reflectance. Infrared (IR) channels have a relative lack of spectral sensitivity to optically thick clouds and are heavily influenced by cloud‐top temperature making retrievals of cloud optical depth, cloud effective radius, and cloud water path more difficult at night. We examine whether the use of spatial context — information about the local structure and organization of cloud features — can help overcome these limitations of IR channels and provide more accurate estimates of nighttime cloud optical properties. We trained several neural networks to emulate the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) NOAA Daytime Cloud Optical and Microphysical Properties (DCOMP) algorithm using only IR channels. We then compared the neural networks to the NOAA operational daytime and nighttime products, and the Nighttime Lunar Cloud Optical and Microphysical Properties (NLCOMP) algorithm, which utilizes the low‐light visible band on VIIRS. These comparisons show that the use of spatial context can improve estimates of nighttime cloud optical properties. The primary model we trained, U‐NetCOMP, can reasonably match DCOMP during the day and significantly reduces artifacts associated with day/night terminator. We also find that U‐NetCOMP estimates align more closely with NLCOMP at night compared to the nighttime NOAA operational products for ABI. Lastly, we perform a comparison with ground‐based instruments and find that U‐NetCOMP improves upon the nighttime operational product with some exceptions for thin cirrus clouds over cold surfaces."

 Orbital imaging spectroscopy in the shortwave infrared is a powerful measurement technique that can lead to the detection and monitoring of both anthropogenic and natural methane point sources. Analysts map the absorption of methane by applying spectroscopic detection methods like the matched filter (MF) or Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) at each pixel in a scene. Unfortunately, methane plume identification is complicated by false detections due to instrument noise, especially for subtle methane enhancements at low signal levels, and surface spectroscopy features that mimic gas methane absorption features. Current systems rely on manual review to vet these detections. This review process is time consuming and can be subjective for plumes close to the instrument detection limit. As observations scale up from proof of concept studies with hundreds of plumes to global monitoring systems having thousands, improved automation will be necessary to reduce the cost and subjectivity of manual review. This paper presents a new purely spectroscopic approach for rejecting false positives based on the aggregate plume transmittance. Specifically, we use the total plume transmittance as a discriminator with improved model properties and noise statistics that can dramatically improve false positive rejection rates. A sampling approach provides rigorous detection p-values that account for spatial correlations in background interference. We demonstrate the approach on a catalog of thousands of plumes from the EMIT (Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation) imaging spectrometer, and illustrate its use in the context of a methane plume mapping workflow. This process identifies 92 potential errors in the existing review process: 42 likely false positives and 50 false negatives. Including spectral information during the plume review process can disambiguate marginal detections, making methane point source observing campaigns more robust and sensitive than a review process based primarily on plume morphology."

 Shallow earthquakes are among the most devastating natural hazards, and aerosol anomalies offer insights into crust–atmosphere interactions critical for earthquake forecasting and environmental assessment. However, standardized anomaly extraction protocols—especially whether to center analyses on epicenters or fault zones—remain undefined, and the driving mechanisms of these anomalies are insufficiently studied. This work utilizes MODIS AOD retrievals and a background field–based Robust Satellite Technique (RST) algorithm to detect AOD anomalies linked to 14 global shallow-focus earthquakes using a 2σ threshold, followed by statistical significance testing (p < 0.05). Spatiotemporal analysis of five representative events reveals that higher-magnitude earthquakes generate stronger (up to 6.28σ) and longer-lasting (≥4 days) AOD perturbations. AOD peaks follow a consistent spatial hierarchy: marine > coastal > inland. Marine anomalies cluster around fault zones; coastal anomalies appear as discrete points near faults; inland anomalies show pre-seismic, banded distributions migrating toward epicenters. By employing buffer zones of 0.5°, 1°, and 2°, we isolated pre- and post-seismic AOD anomalies across diverse tectonic settings. The results suggest that a 1° buffer is the optimal spatial window for most earthquake cases. Micro–scale diagnostics via aerosol classification maps and particle–size distribution metrics identified shifts between fine– and coarse–mode particles, while macro–scale HYSPLIT–4 backward–trajectory analyses elucidated the roles of local topography, anthropogenic emissions, and dust storm inputs on anomaly formation. These findings advance our understanding of seismic aerosol perturbations and inform the development of integrated remote–sensing frameworks for earthquake monitoring and environmental impact assessment."

In comparison to background conditions and other recent moderate stratospheric eruptions, one notable effect of the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai eruption was the significant modification of the size distribution (SD) of the stratospheric aerosol layer, resulting in a larger mean particle size and a smaller SD spread for Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai. Starting from satellite-based SD retrievals and the assumption of pure sulfate aerosol layers, in this work, we calculate the optical properties of both background and Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai-perturbed stratospheric aerosol scenarios using a Mie code. We found that the intensive optical properties of the stratospheric aerosol layer (i.e. the single-scattering albedo (SSA), the asymmetry parameter, the aerosol extinction per unit mass, and the broad-band average ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) to mid-infrared (MIR) Ångström exponent (AE)) were not significantly perturbed by the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai eruption with respect to background conditions. The calculated AE was found to be consistent with multi-instrument satellite observations of the same parameter. Thus, the basic impact of the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai eruption on the optical properties of the stratospheric aerosol layer was an increase in the stratospheric aerosol extinction (or optical depth), without any modification of the shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) relative absorption, angular scattering, and broad-band spectral trend of the extinction, with respect to background. This highlights a marked difference between the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai perturbation of the stratospheric aerosol layer and perturbations from other larger stratospheric eruptions, such as Pinatubo 1991 and El Chichón 1982. With simplified radiative forcing estimations, we show that the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai eruption produced an aerosol layer likely 1.5–10 times more effective in producing a net cooling of the climate system with respect to the Pinatubo and El Chichón eruptions due to more effective SW scattering. As intensive optical properties are seldom directly measured, e.g. from satellite, our calculations can support the estimation of radiative effects for the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai eruption with climate or offline radiative models."

We use the novel technique polar imaging nephelometry that helps to determine the phase functions using a CMOS camera. The capability of measuring with polarized light helps to infer new properties about the mixture of Saharan dust particles with those of anthropogenic origin. 
 This work investigates scattering matrix elements during different Saharan dust outbreaks over Granada (southeast Spain) in 2022 using a polarized imaging nephelometer (PI-Neph) capable of measuring continuously the phase function (F11) and the polarized phase function (-F12/F11) at three different wavelengths (405, 515 and 660 nm) in the range 5–175°. The focus is on two extreme dust events (PM10 > 1000 µg m−3) in March 2022. During the peaks of these events F11 and -F12/F11 show the classical patterns observed for dust samples in laboratory measurements available in the Granada–Amsterdam Light Scattering Database at all wavelengths. However, for the moments prior to and after the peaks the results reveal important sensitivity in -F12/F11 at 405 nm. For the other wavelengths, however, this difference in -F12/F11 is not evident. Moreover, no remarkable changes are found in F11, which is always characterized by strong predominance of forward scattering. The analyses of more frequent and moderate events recorded in summer 2022 (PM10 between 50 and 100 µg m−3) revealed F11 and -F12/F11 patterns like those observed prior to and after the extreme events. The combination of PI-Neph measurements with additional in situ instrumentation allowed a typing classification that revealed the peaks in the extreme dust events as pure dust, while for the rest of cases it remarked a mixture of dust with urban background pollution. In addition, simulations with the Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties (GRASP) code explain the different patterns in -F12/F11, with changes in the refractive indexes and with the different contributions of the fine and coarse mode."

We examine the relationship between fire variability and the values of carbon monoxide and aerosol optical depth observed by satellites. The observed increase in wildfires has led to a corresponding rise in the mean and extreme values of carbon monoxide and aerosol optical depth during the summer and early autumn across the Northern Hemisphere. 
 Biomass burning has a significant impact on the composition of the atmosphere and climate due to large emissions of trace gases and aerosols. Previous studies have demonstrated the influence of biomass burning emissions on the spatial and temporal variability of carbon monoxide (CO) and aerosol concentration on hemispheric scales. This study aims to examine the variability of fires and their impact on the mean and extreme values of CO and aerosol optical depth (AOD) observed by satellites (IASI/Metop for total column CO and MODIS/Terra and Aqua for AOD), focusing on the extratropical Northern Hemisphere (NH) from 2008 to 2023. While biomass burning due to agricultural practices is decreasing in many regions, boreal regions and the western United States have experienced a notable rise in burned area, up to +37 % in recent years (2017–2023) compared to the 2008–2023 period, and fire intensity. This is consistent with an increase in meteorological fire risk in these regions. The increase in wildfires has led to a rise in the mean and extreme values of CO and AOD during the summer and early autumn across the whole of the NH, up to +9.3 % and +33 % for extreme values of total column CO and AOD in boreal regions and the western United States in recent years compared to 2008–2023. The number of days with extreme total column CO and AOD has increased by more than 50 % in recent years during summer in North America, the Atlantic and Europe, in comparison to the full period. A robust correlation (r = 0.83) between the number of plumes and burned areas in the extratropical Northern Hemisphere is obtained."

Our study provides a comprehensive 3D comparison of model outputs to assess the robustness and applicability of these schemes. An improvement in O3 distribution in the tropical free troposphere is observed due to inclusion of LNOx (nitrogen oxide emissions from lightning) in the model. Inclusion of LNOx also reduces the lifetime of trace gas CH4. 
 Estimating nitrogen oxide emissions from lightning (LNOx) in models is highly uncertain, affecting the accuracy of atmospheric composition and air quality assessments. Still, it is essential to include these emissions in models to increase the realism of representing the gases and aerosols. LNOx emissions have recently been incorporated into the updated version of the CHIMERE model (v2023r2). In this study, we evaluate the present state of modelling the lightning flashes over the Northern Hemisphere (NH), using a classical scheme based on cloud-top height (CTH) and an updated ice-flux-based scheme (ICEFLUX). We conduct a comprehensive 3D comparison of model outputs, including in situ measurements and satellite data, to rigorously assess the robustness and applicability of these parameterizations. The comparative analysis reveals that the CTH scheme provides a more accurate spatial variability of lightning flashes over lands and tropical oceans. Both parameterizations accurately capture the magnitude of lightning flashes over the tropics, while the ICEFLUX scheme is more effective in representing mid-latitudinal flashes. However, both schemes perform well in capturing the seasonal variation of lightning flashes. The estimated flash frequencies over the NH from the experiments closely align with satellite observations, and the LNOx emissions fall within the range reported in previous modelling studies. There is an overall increase in ozone (O3) concentration due to inclusion of LNOx, which substantially improves the tropospheric O3 distribution, specifically in the tropical free troposphere. The LNOx emissions hence critically influence the O3 burden as well as the hydroxyl radicals, which further impact the atmospheric lifetime of trace gas methane."

Kotarba;Izabela Wojciechowska,Satellite-based detection of deep-convective clouds: the sensitivity of infrared methods and implications for cloud climatology,"The research investigates methods for detecting deep convective clouds (DCCs) using satellite infrared data, essential for understanding long-term climate trends. By validating three popular detection methods against lidar–radar data, it found moderate accuracy (below 75 %), emphasizing the importance of fine-tuning thresholds regionally. The study shows how small threshold changes significantly affect the climatology of severe storms. 
 Reliable deep-convective cloud (DCC) climatology relies heavily on accurate detection. Infrared-based algorithms play a critical role, as they are the only ones that can be applied to the 6.7 µm water vapour (WV) absorption band and the 11 µm infrared (IR) window band. For over 40 years, the latter has been the only daytime/nighttime channel used in satellite cloud imaging. This study presents the first global validation of three commonly used DCC detection methods, which use brightness temperature (Tb) in the WV and IR bands. These methods are the infrared-window method (IRW; Tb11), the brightness temperature difference method (BTD; Tb6.7−Tb11), and the temperature difference method with the tropopause method (TROPO; Tb11−Ttropo). All methods were applied to 1 year (2007) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations and validated against collocated CloudSat-CALIPSO lidar–radar cloud classifications. Results indicate that even with optimal parameter configurations, DCC detection accuracy remains moderate and is below 75 % (Cohen's κ < 0.4) for all methods. Global accuracy ranged from 56.6 % (for TROPO) to 72.8 % (for BTD) using an optimal threshold of −2 K. Regionally, the BTD method performs best, with an accuracy of 72.9 % over Europe and 67.9 % over Africa. Misclassifications are common with cloud types such as nimbostratus and altostratus (single-layer cloud regimes) and cirrus and altostratus (multilayer cloud regimes). Overall, the BTD method slightly outperforms the others, while TROPO is the least effective. Our study highlighted the high sensitivity of these methods to threshold selection. Even a ±1 K change in the threshold resulted in a 10 %–40 % variance in DCC frequency. This finding is of particular importance for the construction of homogenous DCC datasets, whether they are global mosaics or time series spanning multiple generations of satellite instruments."

Several compounds exhibited significantly higher averaged concentrations, with pronounced spatial and seasonal variability, distinguishing Houston from urban areas in the temperate and cooler climate zone. A customized box model was employed to estimate seasonal emissions for the Greater Houston Area, showing that emissions of most VCPs were significantly higher during the summer.

The maximum monthly mean O3 concentration within the boundary layer was observed at an altitude of 100–300 m. Concentrations of O3 and its precursors declined from 2018 to 2021, followed by slight increases in 2022 and 2023. The combined temporal percentages of O3 formation under the NOx-limited and transition regimes were accessed at both sites. These percentages for the boundary layer condition have reached 69.2% at the rural site during summer 2023. The trend toward a shift from the VOC-limited to NOx-limited regime was observed. This shift occurred at a much faster rate at the rural site than at the urban site.

This study provides laboratory evidence that dark ozonolysis of limonene, in the presence of biogenic (α-pinene) or anthropogenic (toluene) precursors, generates SOAs more effectively in BrC formation when subsequently dried with (NH4)2SO4/glycine in bulk solutions, and toluene had a stronger effect than α-pinene in promoting oligomeric BrC formation. BrC absorption was significantly enhanced in limonene-SOA and the (NH4)2SO4/glycine mixed droplet upon evaporation at ∼75% RH but was suppressed at lower RH, likely due to reduced aerosol liquid water and precursor evaporation. RH-dependent trends were also observed in SOA generated by limonene and toluene mixtures (lim/tol-SOA), with the strongest oligomeric BrC absorption at ∼85% RH for both (NH4)2SO4 and glycine systems. While bulk-dried experiments showed 1–2 orders of magnitude differences in BrC absorption between limonene-SOA and lim/tol-SOA, evaporated droplets exhibited no significant differences.

Specifically, we examine relationships between simulated present‐day cloud fraction, cloud top height, and cloud optical depth with tropical high cloud, midlatitude low cloud, global high cloud altitude, and tropical low cloud feedbacks for CMIP5 and CMIP6 models that have produced MISR simulator output. We find that the strength of all four of these simulated cloud feedbacks have statistically significant relationships with simulations of present‐day clouds. We use these relationships in an emergent constraint analysis to narrow the spread in the estimated strength of each feedback. This suggests that future expert assessments of cloud feedbacks (and climate sensitivity) should consider the state of present‐day clouds and the climate modeling community might consider undertaking simulations where models are systematically tuned to eliminate (or at least reduce) biases relative to satellite observations."

Existing quantitative segmentation methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers are limited in their ability to process large-scale remote sensing images. They are also susceptible to interference from species with similar spectral features, resulting in high false positive rates. To cope with these difficulties, we propose kMetha-Mamba — a k-means clustering mamba-based network for methane plumes segmentation. Specifically, the spatial feature encoder (SFE) is employed to extract clustering patches from the methane enhancement product for follow-up complementary learning with spectral information. Subsequently, similar pixels are clustered based on the ability of spectral derivative to distinguish between subtle spectral variations in a continuous region and species with similar spectral features. However, traditional k-means clustering algorithms are susceptible to the influence of outliers. In this study, we revisit the relationship between pixels and the selective scanning mechanism from the perspective of clustering, and propose k-means mamba to implement cluster center updating by multi-directional local scanning, which mitigates the effect of outliers on cluster centers. Finally, kMetha-Mamba utilizes a mamba-based decoder (MBD) with linear complexity and long-range dependencies to achieve high efficiency and precision segmentation. Extensive experiments on hyperspectral and multispectral datasets from different sensors have shown that kMetha-Mamba has the best performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Among them, it achieve the highest accuracy of 88.69% and the lowest false positive rates of 0.0466% on the AVIRIS-NG dataset."

 The optical response of pure materials (quartz, halite, pyrite, and pyrrhotite) typically composing mineral dust in central Los Andes was studied through their controlled deposition on a reflective surface and the measurement of the solar irradiance and the reflected radiance with a hyperspectral radiometric system. Results show that the refractive index, derived from the crystalline structure of the material, has a primary effect on its optical properties, while the size distribution of the particles has a secondary effect, which in some cases is counteracted by the type of crystallinity. These results are useful for understanding the effect of mineral dust on radiative forcing in sensitive areas, particularly on highly reflective surfaces such as snow or ice. Iron-rich minerals, like pyrite and pyrrhotite, contribute significantly to local warming due to their significant ability to reduce albedo, whereas quartz and halite show much lower radiation absorption. The experimental results were compared to results from a radiative transfer model based on the Mie theory, i.e., assuming spherical size- and composition-homogeneous particles. Although these assumptions are far from realistic, especially for anisotropic materials, modelled results show similar decreasing trends for spectral albedo with increasing concentrations of particles on the surface and were useful to suspect inaccurate refractive index spectral data (particularly the imaginary part) for some materials, such as the type of quartz used here. In the case of halite, whose imaginary part of the refractive index is nearly zero, the albedo was not substantially affected by the particle concentration, neither in experimental nor modelled results. On the contrary, the model was unable to predict the non-linear albedo reduction for pyrrhotite dust, which can be explained by the heterogeneities in the content of sulfur and impurities, therefore contributing to an increase in the light scattering, and thus in the albedo."

 Previous studies assessing the synergistic impact of PM2.5 and O3 on mortality have demonstrated regional heterogeneity in results. A time series study based on 130 Chinese counties aimed to investigate the modification of regional temperature and humidity on this synergy effect. Synergy indices and analyses stratified by coexposure level were applied to characterize the synergistic impacts of PM2.5 and O3 on mortality. Modification effects of temperature and relative humidity were evaluated by stratified analyses. Deaths attributable to PM2.5 and O3 were calculated both with and without considering their synergy, as well as the influences of regional temperature and relative humidity. The increases in cardiorespiratory mortality every 10 μ g/m3 rise in PM2.5 and O3 are significantly greater under high O3 (2 %) and PM2.5 (1.10 %) levels than under low O3 (0.53 %) and PM2.5 (0.86 %) levels. The synergistic effects were more pronounced in low-temperature areas for cardiovascular mortality and in low-humidity areas for respiratory mortality. Ignoring the synergistic impact of PM2.5 and O3 may lead to inaccurate estimates of attributable deaths, with the extent of inaccuracy influenced by temperature and relative humidity. Our study underscores the importance of considering meteorological factors when assessing the synergistic impact of PM2.5 and O3 to improve the accuracy of disease burden estimates and inform air pollution control policies."

 The chemical evolution and secondary reaction of inorganic aerosol during East Asian dust long-range transport have been extensively investigated. However, knowledge about the impact of dust on secondary organic aerosols (SOA) formation remains unclear. By combining online chemical observation of submicron aerosols and offline measurements of size-segregated aerosols in Shanghai, this study revealed that SOA dominated organic aerosols (OA) during the campaign and comprised biogenic SOA (BSOA), oxygenated OA (OOA) and aqueous-phase SOA (aqSOA). During the non-dust storm (NDS) periods, aqSOA prevailed, followed by OOA and BSOA, while in the dust storm (DS) periods OOA was dominant, followed by BSOA with a minor aqSOA. BSOA presented a similar size distribution pattern in both NDS and DS periods, with a predominant peak in the fine mode (<2.1 μm) and a minor peak in the coarse mode (>2.1 μm). However, OOA displayed a distinct size distribution pattern with a large peak in the fine mode and a small peak in the coarse mode during the NDS periods and only a large coarse-mode peak during the DS periods, respectively. HR-AMS analysis results further suggested that during the campaign OOA are composed of carboxylic acid-like compounds, which were produced largely by photochemical oxidation, BSOA was formed by photochemical oxidation of isoprene, while aqSOA was produced mainly through aqueous-phase reactions of carbonyls. Compared to those in the NDS periods, during the DS periods OOA formation was enhanced through reactive uptake by alkaline dust particles, particularly in the coarse mode. In contrast, aqSOA and BSOA formation was suppressed mainly due to dry conditions and reduced aerosol acidity in the DS periods."

Over continental regions, evapotranspiration (ET) is often limited by water availability. In this study, we spatially quantify how much of the total atmospheric water vapour evaporated most recently from land and calculate the relative contribution of that water vapour to the atmospheric radiative budget. Using a combination of tracer-enabled Earth system model simulations and radiative transfer calculations, we are able to explicitly quantify the 3D distribution of terrestrial vs. oceanic water vapour, and the spatial contribution of each to the surface and top of atmosphere radiative budgets. We find that over many continental regions, more than half of the total column-integrated water vapour originates from land ET, and that this vapour contributes up to 30 W m−2 of longwave radiation into the surface in the annual mean (about 10% of the total). Understanding how terrestrial ET impacts the base-state of water vapour distribution and the water vapour greenhouse effect is critical to understanding how and where changes in terrestrial ET, driven by climate change, land use, etc, will modify the radiative properties of the atmosphere and thus the climate system."

Measurements of the mass spectral absorption cross section (MAC), supplemented by literature data, allowed us to establish a generalised exponential relationship between the spectral absorption and the elemental-to-total-carbon ratio (EC / TC) in soot. This relationship can provide a useful tool for modelling the properties of soot. 
 Soot aerosol generated from the incomplete combustion of biomass and fossil fuels is a major light-absorber; however its spectral optical properties for varying black carbon (BC) and brown carbon (BrC) content remain uncertain. In this study, soot aerosols with varying maturity and composition, i.e. elemental-to-total-carbon ratio (EC/TC), have been studied systematically in a large simulation chamber to determine their mass absorption, scattering, and extinction cross sections (MAC, MSC, MEC); single-scattering albedo (SSA); and absorption and scattering Ångström exponents (AAE, SAE). The MAC, MEC, SSA, and AAE show a variability between the different types of soot with varying EC/TC ratios. The MAC (MEC) at 550 nm increases for increasing EC/TC, with values of 1.0 (1.4) m2 g−1 for EC/TC = 0.0 (BrC-dominated soot) and 4.6 (5.1) m2 g−1 for EC/TC = 0.79 (BC-dominated soot). The AAE and SSA (550 nm) decrease from 3.79 and 0.29 (EC/TC = 0.0) to 1.27 and 0.10 (EC/TC = 0.79). Combining present results for soot from propane combustion with literature data for flame soot from diverse fuels supports a generalised exponential relationship between particle EC/TC and its MAC and AAE values (MAC550=(1.3±0.05) e(1.8±0.1)ECTC; AAE=(0.73±0.12)+(3.29±0.12) e-(2.32±0.30)ECTC), which represents the optical continuum of spectral absorption for soot with varying maturity. From this, it is possible to extrapolate a MAC of 7.9 and 1.3 m2 g−1 (550 nm) and an AAE (375–870 nm) of 1.05 and 4.02 for pure EC (BC-like) and pure OC (BrC-like) soot. The established relationship can provide a useful parameterisation for models to estimate the absorption from combustion aerosols and their BC and BrC contributions."

Numerical models struggle to reproduce the MSAp seasonal cycle. We evaluate three numerical models and one reanalysis product’s ability to simulate MSAp. We develop data-driven models for MSAp at four Arctic stations. The data-driven models outperform the numerical models and reanalysis product and identified precursor source-, chemical-processing-, and removal-related features as being important for modeling MSAp. 
 Natural aerosol components such as particulate methanesulfonic acid (MSAp) play an important role in the Arctic climate. However, numerical models struggle to reproduce MSAp concentrations and seasonality. Here we present an alternative data-driven methodology for modeling MSAp at four High Arctic stations (Alert, Gruvebadet, Pituffik (formerly Thule), and Utqiaġvik (formerly Barrow)). In our approach, we create input features that consider the ambient conditions experienced during atmospheric transport (e.g., dimethyl sulfide (DMS) emission, temperature, radiation, cloud cover, precipitation) for use in two data-driven models: a random forest (RF) regressor and an additive model (AM). The most important features were selected through automatic selection procedures, and their relationships with MSAp model output was investigated. Although the overall performance of our data-driven models on test data is modest (max. R2=0.29), the models can capture variability in the data well (max. Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.77), outperform the current numerical models and reanalysis products, and produce physically interpretable results.The data-driven models selected features which can be grouped into three categories, the sources, chemical processing, and removal of MSAp, with specific differences between stations. The seasonal cycles and selected features suggest gas-phase oxidation is relatively more important during peak concentration months at Alert, Gruvebadet, and Pituffik (Thule), while aqueous-phase oxidation is relatively more important at Utqiaġvik (Barrow). Alert and Pituffik (Thule) appear to be more influenced by processes aloft than in the boundary layer. Our models usually selected chemical-processing-related features as the main factors influencing MSAp predictions, highlighting the importance of properly simulating oxidation-related processes in numerical models."

Our study reveals that New Zealand's land absorbs more CO2 than previously estimated, particularly in areas dominated by indigenous forests. Our results highlight gaps in current national CO2 estimates and methods, suggesting a need for further research to improve emissions reports and refine approaches to track progress toward climate mitigation goals. 
 Accurate national-scale greenhouse gas source and sink estimates are essential to track climate mitigation efforts. Inverse models can complement inventory-based approaches for emissions reporting by providing independent estimates underpinned by atmospheric measurements, yet few nations have developed this capability for carbon dioxide (CO2). We present results from a decade-long (2011–2020) national inverse modelling study for New Zealand, which suggests a persistent carbon sink in New Zealand's terrestrial biosphere (-171±29 Tg CO2 yr−1). This sink is larger than expected from either New Zealand's Greenhouse Gas Inventory (−24 Tg CO2 yr−1) or prior terrestrial biosphere model estimates (-118±22 Tg CO2 yr−1; Biome-BGCMuSo and CenW). The largest differences are in New Zealand's South Island, in regions dominated by mature indigenous forests, generally considered to be near equilibrium, and certain grazed pasture regions. Relative to prior estimates, the inversion points to a reduced net CO2 flux to the atmosphere during the autumn/winter period. The overall findings of this study are robust with respect to extensive tests to assess the potential biases in the inverse model due to transport error, prior biosphere, ocean and fossil fuel estimates, background CO2, and diurnal cycles. We have identified CO2 exchange processes that could contribute to the gap between the inverse, prior and inventory estimates, but the magnitude of the fluxes from these processes cannot entirely explain the differences. Further work to identify the cause of the gap is essential to understand the implications of this finding for New Zealand's inventory and climate mitigation strategies."

We found that the performance of current γ (N2O5) parameterizations showed deviations with the varying aerosol liquid water content (ALWC). Such differences would lead to biased estimation of particulate nitrate production potential. We give suggestions for future research directions. 
 The heterogeneous hydrolysis of dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) is a critical process in assessing NOx fate and secondary pollutant formation. However, accurate quantification of the N2O5 uptake coefficient (γ (N2O5)) in ambient conditions is a challenging problem that can cause unpredictable uncertainties in the predictions of air quality models. Here, the γ (N2O5) values were directly measured using an improved in situ aerosol flow tube system at a site located in a highland region in southwestern China to investigate influencing factors and the performance of current γ (N2O5) parameterizations under this typical environmental condition. The nocturnal mean γ (N2O5) value ranged from 0.0018 to 0.12 with an average of 0.023±0.021. The relationship between the measured γ (N2O5) and impacting factors was consistent with previous laboratory results, except for aerosol chloride. The aerosol water significantly promoted N2O5 uptake, while particulate organics and nitrate showed suppression effects. We found that several parameterizations can capture the median of measured values, whereas none of the 10 parameterizations were able to reproduce the variabilities and showed poor correlations (R2=0.00–0.09). Elevated biases of predictions specifically occurred at high aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) (> 35 M) and low ALWC (< 25 M) levels with an underestimation of −37 % to −1 % and an overestimation of 34 % to 189 %, respectively. Such differences between the measured and parameterized γ (N2O5) would lead to a biased estimation (−77 % to 74 %) of the particulate nitrate production potential. Our findings suggest the need for more direct field quantifications of γ (N2O5) and laboratory measurements under extreme ALWC conditions to re-evaluate the response coefficients between γ (N2O5) and aerosol chemical compositions in parameterizations."

Additionally, the simulation of the bright band is addressed and then successfully applied to model forecasts for the purpose of classifying NWP (numerical weather prediction) model columns between stratiform and convective categories. 
 Because of their high sensitivity to hydrometeors and high vertical resolutions, spaceborne radar observations are emerging as an undeniable asset for numerical weather prediction (NWP) applications. The EUMETSAT (European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites) NWP SAF (Satellite Application Facility for Numerical Weather Prediction) released an active sensor module within version 13 of the RTTOV (Radiative Transfer for TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder) software with the goal of simulating both active and passive microwave instruments within a single framework using the same radiative transfer assumptions. This study provides an in-depth description of this radar simulator. In addition, this study proposes a revised version of the existing melting-layer parameterization scheme of Bauer (2001) within the RTTOV-SCATT v13.1 model to provide a better fit to observations below the freezing level. Simulations are performed with the revised and default schemes for the Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) instrument on board the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission using the ARPEGE (Action de Recherche Petite Echelle Grande Echelle) global NWP model, operational at Météo-France for two different 1-month periods (June 2020 and January 2021). Results for a case study over the Atlantic Ocean show that the revised melting scheme produces more realistic simulations much closer to observations compared to the default scheme both at Ku (13.5 GHz) and Ka (35.5 GHz) frequencies. A statistical assessment covering several cases shows significant improvement of the first-guess departure statistics. As a step further, this study showcases the use of melting-layer simulations for the classification of precipitation (stratiform, convective, and transition) using the dual-frequency ratio (DFR) algorithm. The classification results reveal a significant overestimation of the rain reflectivities in both hemispheres, which could indicate either an overproduction of convective precipitation in ARPEGE or a misrepresentation of the convective precipitation fraction within the forward operator."

In this study, we presented OH measurements in a megacity, Beijing, for two seasons. Though the chemical conditions were highly variable, we found that more than half of the OH variability could be attributed to changes in photolysis frequencies. We developed an empirical parametrization that successfully reproduces observed OH concentrations across different seasons in Beijing by considering photolysis rates and NO2 concentrations. This parametrization demonstrates sustained OH production even during winter haze, which is critical for understanding oxidation processes under low solar radiation. Our findings provide a valuable tool for improving air quality models in polluted urban environments and offer insights into effective pollution control strategies."
10.1029/2025AV001682,True,AGU Advances,该研究论文探讨了近期计划烧除和土地管理对美国西部野火燃烧严重程度和烟雾排放的影响。研究使用了高分辨率卫星图像、土地管理记录和火灾排放数据，评估了计划烧除对2020年野火季的影响，包括燃烧严重程度和PM2.5排放。结果表明，计划烧除可以降低燃烧严重程度和烟雾PM2.5排放，尤其是在非城乡交界地区。该研究还量化了计划烧除对减少PM2.5排放的净效益，并提出了扩大计划烧除规模的政策建议。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它使用了卫星观测数据来监测空气质量（PM2.5排放）和评估大气成分变化。,"['air quality monitoring', 'satellite observations', 'PM2.5 emissions', 'wildfire smoke', 'burn severity', 'land management', 'prescribed burning', 'remote sensing']",Makoto Kelp;Marshall Burke;Minghao Qiu;Iván Higuera‐Mendieta;Tianjia Liu;Noah S. Diffenbaugh,Effect of Recent Prescribed Burning and Land Management on Wildfire Burn Severity and Smoke Emissions in the Western United States,"Wildfires in the western US increasingly threaten infrastructure, air quality, and public health. Prescribed (“Rx”) fire is often proposed to mitigate future wildfires, but treatments remain limited, and few studies quantify their effectiveness on recent major wildfires. We investigate the effects of Rx fire treatments on subsequent burn severity across western US ecoregions and particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions in California. Using high‐resolution (30‐m) satellite imagery, land management records, and fire emissions data, we employ a quasi‐experimental design to compare Rx fire‐treated areas with adjacent untreated areas to estimate the impacts of recent Rx fires (Fall 2018–Spring 2020) on the extreme 2020 wildfire season. We find that within 2020 wildfire burn areas where Rx fires were used prior to 2020, burn severity changed by −16% (p < 0.001) and smoke PM2.5 emissions changed by −101 kg per acre (p < 0.1). Rx fires in the wildland‐urban interface (“WUI”) were less effective in reducing burn severity and smoke PM2.5 emissions than those outside the WUI. Overall, Rx fires led to a net reduction of −14% in PM2.5 emissions, including those from the Rx fires themselves. The proposed policy of treating one million acres annually in California could reduce smoke emissions by 655,000 tons over the next 5 years, equivalent to 52% of the emissions from 2020 wildfires. Our analysis provides comprehensive estimates of the net benefits of Rx fire on subsequent burn severity and smoke PM2.5 emissions in the western US, an empirical basis for evaluating proposed Rx fire expansions, and valuable constraints for future modeling."
10.1016/j.rse.2025.114880,True,Remote Sensing of Environment,该研究论文关注的是NOAA-AVHRR卫星数据中由于轨道漂移引起的表面温度时间序列的偏差问题。论文提出了一种新的指标（漂移幅度度量DAM）来量化这种漂移效应，并使用MSG-SEVIRI数据进行模拟和验证。研究结果表明，该指标可以有效地评估轨道漂移对不同平台和地表覆盖类型的影响。虽然该研究直接关注的是地表温度而非大气成分，但它涉及卫星观测数据的质量控制和校正，这对于利用遥感技术进行大气环境监测（如气溶胶光学厚度反演、地表温度对空气质量的影响等）是至关重要的。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术具有间接的相关性。,"['NOAA-AVHRR', 'Orbital Drift', 'Surface Temperature', 'LTDR', 'MSG-SEVIRI', 'Land Surface Temperature (LST)', 'Brightness Temperature', 'Remote Sensing', 'Satellite Observations']",Yves Julien;José A. Sobrino,Introducing the Drift Amplitude Metric (DAM) to assess drift influence on surface temperature time series,"•NOAA-AVHRR temperature data suffer from orbital drift effect. •No metric presently exists to quantify this drift effect. •We present and apply a Drift Amplitude Metric (DAM) to simulated and real data. •The DAM quantifies the drift amplitude for different platforms and land covers. •Absolute ensemble DAM values above 3 correspond to drifted temperature time series. 
 NOAA-AVHRR (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration – Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) data, although the only ones to allow a daily monitoring of our planet during the 80s and 90s, are underused because of their platforms orbital drift, which introduces an artificial decreasing trend in surface temperatures. Despite the clearly observable effects, no quantitative measure of this orbital drift effect exists. Using MSG-SEVIRI (Meteosat Second Generation – Spinning Enhanced Visible Infra-Red Imager) data, which temporal resolution allows for an adequate simulation of drifted and undrifted AVHRR-like time series, we propose and analyze the behavior of a Drift Amplitude Metric (DAM), based on the difference in average LST temperatures between the first and the last year of a given satellite activity period. We then apply this metric to LTDR V6 (Long Term Data Record – Version 6) channel 4 brightness temperature to evaluate its utility. Our results enable quantification of the amplitude of the orbital drift effect, particularly pronounced for the NOAA 14 platform, and in more heterogeneous land cover types (Savannas, Grasslands and Shrublands). These findings are confirmed using real-case scenarios (LTDR V6 data). We show that the mentioned metric is more effective when applied to an ensemble of pixels (several hundreds) to identify time series impacted by orbital drift. This metric will be used to assess the quality of orbital drift correction methods in future work."

 Atmospheric volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are crucial to reducing air pollution, which has adverse effects on human health. However, VOCs estimation and forecasting has been limited by insufficient observational data and complex interactions with other pollutants. Here, we developed machine learning models to estimate regional VOCs distributions and produce hourly distribution maps for the next 24 h with a 1 km resolution. Combining VOCs observations from monitoring sites, along with meteorological, emission, geographical and other related variables, we successfully employed a space-time LightGBM model to estimate VOCs concentrations from 2019 to 2021 and created a high-resolution uninterrupted VOCs dataset in Shanghai. Using this dataset, we evaluated the forecasting performance of three machine learning models and one deep learning model, finding that LightGBM outperformed other models. The models demonstrated substantial efficacy, with R2 values ranging from 0.527 to 0.938 and MAE values between 41.5 and 126 ppb, indicating significant performance in both temporal and spatial scales. With developed models, we provided first high-resolution hourly VOCs prediction maps in Shanghai, providing valuable insights for control strategy formulation in advance. This study also offers a novel tool for VOCs forecasting, with the developed model being adaptable to other regions experiencing high VOCs levels."

 Observations from multi-wavelength Raman-Mie Lidar, small scanning Lidar, HALO Doppler Lidar, LMOL (NASA Langley Mobile Ozone Lidar), NASA MPL (Micro-Pulse Lidar), local weather stations, Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (VADEQ) air quality monitoring instruments and radiosondes are used to study and assess wildfire smoke transport, vertical distribution, optical properties, and potential impact on air quality and weather in Hampton, VA and coastal areas during the winter 2019. We investigated an episode of fresh smoke transported and mixed into the planetary boundary layer (PBL) on November 20–21, 2019 at Hampton University (HU). The horizontal advection of the smoke is shown to be characterized with the prevailing northwest winds from the PBL to the top of troposphere based on wind measurements from radiosondes and Doppler wind lidar. The wildfire smoke transport paths are identified from HYSPLIT backward trajectory analysis. Results of measurements and characterization of fresh wildfire smoke in the troposphere over HU, are presented and discussed. Quadrative analyses of optical and microphysical properties of the smoke aerosols include aerosol backscatterings, AODs, angstrom exponents, lidar ratios and depolarization. The relationships of AOD of smoke aerosol and NO2 or O3 were obtained to understand the impact of wildfire smoke on local environment. It was concluded that the AOD and ground O3 concentration have a good positive relationship without interruption of turbulence. And, NO2 concentration increased with sea breeze at night. Much smoke aerosol and water vapor were transported to local and affect local weather in winter. It was found that wildfire smoke transport can maintain local temperature and force land breeze transition to sea breeze in boundary layer, which caused boundary wind shear and increase convection to delay smoke sinking and produce much cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) above boundary layer, which lead to following cloudy and raining days after wildfire."

 Continuous aerosol monitoring in East Asia is essential due to the massive aerosol emissions from natural and anthropogenic sources. Geostationary satellites enable continuous aerosol monitoring; however, the observation is limited to the daytime. This study proposed machine learning-based models to estimate daytime and nighttime aerosol optical depth (AOD) in East Asia using a geostationary satellite, Geo-KOMPSAT-2A (GK-2A). The input variables for the machine learning models include the brightness temperature (BT) and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance from GK-2A, meteorological and geographical data, and auxiliary variables. The two models that used different combinations of GK-2A variables were proposed and compared: the all-day BT model, which estimates AOD during both day and night using BT variables, and the daytime TOA model, which estimates AOD during the day using TOA reflectance variables as well. The estimated AODs by the models were validated with ground-based AOD data from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) by 10-fold cross-validation and hold-out validation methods. The performance of the daytime TOA model was slightly higher than the all-day BT model during the day (R2 = 0.80–0.82, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.107–0.116 for the all-day BT model, R2 = 0.83, RMSE = 0.098 for the daytime TOA model). The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis showed that total precipitable water content and seasonality contributed the most for both proposed models. BT differences and TOA reflectance variables were identified as the next most contributing variables for the all-day BT and daytime TOA models. The spatiotemporal distributions of estimated AODs from the proposed models show similar patterns compared with other AOD products. A time series comparison at a test station demonstrated that the estimated AOD of the proposed models was consistent with the AERONET AOD."

 Field observations highlight high H2O2 level and enhanced sulfate production during haze episodes in China, but so far, the known H2O2 sources and traditional secondary sulfate formation mechanisms cannot elucidate these phenomena. In recent years, the atmospheric photosensitized multiphase oxidation of SO2 to trigger sulfate production has attracted great attention. However, few reports on the contributions of triplet excited states and its secondary reactive oxygen species (ROS) formed in photosensitization reaction to sulfate formation. In this study, the aqueous photochemistry of water-soluble humic-like substances (HULIS) proxy was further investigated. It was found that hydroxyl radicals and peroxyl radicals were produced after 313 nm UV irradiation, accompanied by H2O2 production. The effect of HULIS photosensitization on SO2 oxidation was also investigated. The results showed that the triplet excited states of HULIS (3HULIS∗) cannot directly and effectively oxidize SO2 to form sulfate, but the formation of sulfate was realized by the oxidation of ROS generated by the secondary reaction of 3HULIS∗ in the presence of O2 and hydrogen atom donors such as HULIS itself. These findings clarify the misunderstood role of the 3HULIS∗ in the photosensitized oxidation of SO2, and the study helps better understand atmospheric photosensitization processes."
