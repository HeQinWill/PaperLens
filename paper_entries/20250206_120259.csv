10.1088/1748-9326/ada2ae,True,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文关注平流层气溶胶注入(SAI)对天空视觉效果的影响，这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。论文利用三维可见光辐射传输模型，模拟不同类型气溶胶（硫酸盐、碳酸钙、金刚石）在不同平流层气溶胶载量下对天空颜色和亮度的影响，并结合地面观测者视角和全球人口密度及气溶胶光学厚度数据，量化SAI的可感知性。研究结果表明，SAI引起的天空变化在高太阳角度下可能难以被大多数人察觉，但在日出日落时分更为明显。该研究与大气成分分析（特别是气溶胶）和卫星遥感观测密切相关，因为卫星观测可以用来监测平流层气溶胶的浓度和分布，从而辅助评估SAI对气候和环境的影响。  研究中使用的辐射传输模型也是大气遥感技术中的重要工具。,"['Stratospheric aerosol', 'Aerosol optical depth', 'Radiative transfer', 'Sky color', 'Public perception', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Air quality']",Ansar Lemon;David W Keith;Steve Albers,Under a not so white sky: visual impacts of stratospheric aerosol injection,"Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) could change the sky’s appearance. This could play a role in shaping public perception of SAI. Noticeability depends strongly on tropospheric aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the amount of SAI used. We aim to quantify the noticeability of changes in sky color and brightness due to SAI. We use a 3D visible light radiative transfer package to generate cloudless sky images during high sun, sunset, and twilight under SAI from the reference point of a ground observer. We consider three aerosol types: H2SO4, CaCO3, and diamond. We consider stratospheric aerosol loadings required to produce radiative forcings of −1, −2, and −4 W m−2. We use population density and AOD data to compute the distribution of AODs people experience and then simulate sky images for the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of that distribution. We compare the simulated changes in color and brightness to experimental measurements of minimum thresholds humans can detect. The three aerosol types cause similar changes, except most notably the diamond aerosol increases brightness of the solar aureole by roughly three to five times less than do H2SO4 or CaCO3. During high sun, sky whitening from sulfate SAI at −2 W m−2 is undetectable for roughly half of observers chosen randomly from the global population. For the remainder of the population, we expect whitening to still be unnoticeable for all but perhaps the most astute observers aided by color samples. Brightening and enlargement of the solar aureole is the most visible feature during high sun for H2SO4 and CaCO3, while changes near twilight would be the most noticeable impact of SAI. We cannot evaluate the fraction of the population who would notice these changes."
10.5194/acp-25-1659-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文主要研究气候变化对极端降水事件的影响。它关注的是全球变暖背景下，气候变化的均值和日变化对夏季极端降水事件发生频率的影响。研究使用了三个地球系统模式的模拟数据，分析了不同排放情景下，北半球夏季降水和最高气温的变化。结果表明，在许多地区，气候变化的日变化对极端降水事件的影响比均值变化更显著。这与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等关系不大。研究主要集中在气候模式模拟和数据分析上，而非遥感技术的应用。,"['precipitation', 'temperature', 'climate change', 'global warming', 'extreme weather events', 'Earth system models', 'climate model simulations']",Kalle Nordling;Nora L. S. Fahrenbach;Bjørn H. Samset,Climate variability can outweigh the influence of climate mean changes for extreme precipitation under global warming,"People experience daily weather, not changes in monthly averages. We investigate the likelihood of events, which occurred once every 10 years in the pre-industrial era. We analyze how summertime precipitation and daily maximum temperature events evolve. Our focus is on understanding the role of day-to-day variability in the change in the number of extreme weather days. We find that in most regions, a change in variability is the primary driver for change in summertime extreme precipitation. 
 As global warming progresses, weather conditions like daily temperature and precipitation are changing due to changes in their means and distributions of day-to-day variability. In this study, we show that changes in variability have a stronger influence on the number of extreme precipitation days than the change in the mean state in many locations. We analyze daily precipitation and maximum temperatures at four levels of global warming and under different emission scenarios for the Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer (June–August). Our analysis is based on initial-condition large-ensemble simulations from three fully coupled Earth system models (MPI-ESM1-2-LR, CanESM5 and ACCESS-ESM1-5) contributing to the Climate Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). We also use information from the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project (PDRMIP) to discern the influence of different climate drivers (notably aerosols and greenhouse gases). We decompose the total changes in daily NH summer precipitation and daily maximum temperature into mean and variability components (standard deviation and skewness). Our results show that in many locations, variability exerts a stronger influence than mean changes on daily precipitation. Changes in the widths and shapes of precipitation distributions are especially dominating over mean changes in Asia, the Arctic and sub-Saharan Africa. In contrast, temperature changes are primarily driven by changes in the mean state. For the near future (2020–2040), we find that reductions in aerosol emissions would increase the likelihood of extreme summertime precipitation only over Asia. This study emphasizes the importance of incorporating daily variability changes into climate change impact assessments and advocates that future emulator and impact model development should focus on improving the representation of daily variability."
10.5194/acp-25-1617-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了冰核粒子（INPs）对北极云的模拟和气候影响。研究人员利用挪威安德内斯2021年3月的观测数据，开发了一个特定于北极的INP参数化方案，并将其应用于挪威地球系统模型（NorESM）。结果表明，改进后的参数化方案提高了模型对北极云相的模拟精度，增加了云液水路径（CLWP），并导致地表净辐射增加2 W m−2，与地面观测结果更一致。此外，北极地表气温在秋季也升高了0.7°C。 这项研究强调了INPs在北极气候中的重要作用，以及区域特定INP参数化方案在改进北极地区云模拟方面的有效性。研究中使用了卫星观测数据来验证模型改进的效果，体现了大气环境遥感技术在该研究中的应用。,"['cloud phase', 'cloud radiative effect', 'ice nucleating particles', 'Arctic climate', 'satellite observations', 'global climate model', 'surface radiation budget']",Astrid B. Gjelsvik;Robert O. David;Tim Carlsen;Franziska Hellmuth;Stefan Hofer;Zachary McGraw;Harald Sodemann;Trude Storelvmo,Using a region-specific ice-nucleating particle parameterization improves the representation of Arctic clouds in a global climate model,"Ice formation in clouds has a substantial impact on radiation and precipitation and must be realistically simulated in order to understand present and future Arctic climate. Rare aerosols known as ice-nucleating particles can play an important role in cloud ice formation, but their representation in global climate models is not well suited for the Arctic. In this study, the simulation of cloud phase is improved when the representation of these particles is constrained by Arctic observations. 
 Projections of global climate change and Arctic amplification are sensitive to the representation of low-level cloud phase in climate models. Ice-nucleating particles (INPs) are necessary for primary cloud ice formation at temperatures above approximately −38 °C and thus significantly affect cloud phase and cloud radiative effect (CRE). Due to their complex and insufficiently understood variability, INPs constitute an important modelling challenge, especially in remote regions with few observations, such as the Arctic. In this study, INP observations were carried out at Andenes, Norway, in March 2021. These observations were used as a basis for an Arctic-specific and purely temperature-dependent INP parameterization, which was implemented into the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM). This implementation results in an annual average increase in cloud liquid water path (CLWP) of 70 % for the Arctic and improves the representation of cloud phase compared to satellite observations. The change in CLWP in boreal autumn and winter is found to likely be the dominant contributor to the annual average increase in net surface CRE of 2 W m−2. This large surface flux increase brings the simulation into better agreement with Arctic ground-based measurements. Despite the fact that the model cannot respond fully to the INP parameterization change due to fixed sea surface temperatures, Arctic surface air temperature increases by 0.7 °C in boreal autumn. These findings indicate that INPs could have a significant impact on Arctic climate and that a region-specific INP parameterization can be a useful tool to improve cloud representation in the Arctic region."

The fluorescence measurements were taken at five wavelengths. The results revealed that fluorescence capacity increases with altitude, suggesting a higher concentration of organic compounds in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere than in the lower troposphere. The fluorescence spectra peaked in the 513 and 560 nm channels in smoke layers but decreased with wavelength in urban aerosols. 
 The fluorescence lidar at the Prokhorov General Physics Institute (Moscow) was utilized to study smoke transported over the Atlantic during the wildfire season from May to September 2023. The lidar system, which is based on a tripled Nd : YAG laser, performs fluorescence measurements across five spectral intervals centered at wavelengths of 438, 472, 513, 560 and 614 nm. This configuration enables the assessment of the spectral dependence of fluorescence backscattering over a broad range of altitudes, from the planetary boundary layer (PBL) to the middle and upper troposphere (MUT). The fluorescence capacity of smoke, defined as the ratio of fluorescence backscattering to aerosol backscattering at the laser wavelength, exhibits significant variation in the MUT, with changes of up to a factor of 3. This variation is likely indicative of differences in the relative concentration of organic compounds within the smoke. Analysis of more than 40 smoke episodes has enabled an evaluation of the height dependence of smoke fluorescence properties. Observations reveal that the fluorescence capacity generally increases with altitude, suggesting a higher concentration of organic compounds in the MUT compared to the lower troposphere. Additionally, the measurements consistently show differences in the fluorescence spectra of smoke and urban aerosol. Urban aerosol fluorescence tends to decrease gradually with wavelength, whereas the peak of smoke fluorescence is observed in the 513 and 560 nm channels. This spectral distinction provides an effective means of separating smoke from urban aerosol. The technique was applied the analysis of events where smoke from the upper troposphere descended into the PBL, demonstrating its utility in distinguishing between these aerosol types."

These symptoms are concentration dependent; thus accurate information about the pollen load in the atmosphere is essential. Moreover, pollen grains and fragments of it are likely to contribute to cloud processes and suppress precipitation. Here, we estimate the concentration and cloud-relevant parameters of birch pollen in the atmosphere using observations from a PollyXT and a CL61 ceilometer. 
 The accurate representation of microphysical properties of atmospheric aerosol particles – such as the number, mass, and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration – is key to constraining climate forcing estimations and improving weather and air quality forecasts. Lidars capable of vertically resolving aerosol optical properties have been increasingly utilized to study aerosol–cloud interactions, allowing for estimations of cloud-relevant microphysical properties. Recently, lidars have been employed to identify and monitor pollen particles in the atmosphere, an understudied aerosol particle with health and possibly climate implications. Lidar remote sensing of pollen is an emerging research field, and in this study, we present for the first time retrievals of particle number, mass, CCN, giant CCN (GCCN), and ultragiant CCN (UGCCN) concentration estimations of birch pollen derived from polarization lidar observations and specifically from a PollyXT lidar and a Vaisala CL61 ceilometer at 532 and 910 nm, respectively.A pivotal role in these estimations is played by the conversion factors necessary to convert the optical measurements into microphysical properties. This set of conversion parameters for birch pollen is derived from in situ observations of major birch pollen events at Vehmasmäki station in eastern Finland. The results show that under well-mixed conditions, surface measurements from in situ instrumentation can be correlated with lidar observations at higher altitudes to estimate the conversion factors. Better linear agreement to the in situ observations was found at the longer wavelength of 910 nm, which is attributed to a combination of lower overlap and higher sensitivity to bigger particles compared to observations at 532 nm. Then, the conversion factors are applied to ground-based lidar observations and compared against in situ measurements of aerosol and pollen particles. In turn, this demonstrates the potential of ground-based lidars such as a ceilometer network with the polarization capacity to document large-scale birch pollen outbursts in detail and thus to provide valuable information for climate, cloud, and air quality modeling efforts, elucidating the role of pollen within the atmospheric system."

One question is how aerosols affects the amount of cloud water. We used a cloud-scale model to study these effects on marine clouds. The study showed that variations in cloud properties and instrument noise can cause bias in satellite-derived cloud water content. However, our results suggest that for similar weather conditions with well-defined aerosol concentrations, satellite data can reliably track these effects. 
 The response in cloud water content to changes in cloud condensation nuclei remains one of the major uncertainties in determining how aerosols can perturb cloud properties. In this study, we used an ensemble of large eddy simulations of marine stratocumulus clouds to investigate the correlation between cloud liquid water path (LWP) and the amount of cloud condensation nuclei. We compare this correlation directly from the model to the correlation derived using equations which are used to retrieve liquid water path from satellite observations. Our comparison shows that spatial variability in cloud properties and instrumental noise in satellite retrievals of cloud optical depth and cloud effective radii results in bias in the satellite-derived liquid water path. In-depth investigation of high-resolution model data shows that in large part of a cloud, the assumption of adiabaticity does not hold, which results in a similar bias in the LWP–CDNC (cloud droplet number concentration) relationship as seen in satellite data. In addition, our analysis shows a significant positive bias of between 18 % and 40 % in satellite-derived cloud droplet number concentration. However, for the individual ensemble members, the correlation between the cloud condensation nuclei and the mean of the liquid water path was very similar between the methods. This suggests that if cloud cases are carefully chosen for similar meteorological conditions and it is ensured that cloud condensation nuclei concentrations are well-defined, changes in liquid water can be confidently determined using satellite data."

This study reveals that coarse aerosol particles invigorate shallow rainfall through enhanced coalescence processes, whereas fine aerosol particles suppress shallow rainfall through intensified microphysical breaks. These impacts are independent of thermodynamic environments but are more significant in low-humidity conditions. 
 Densely populated southern China, adjacent to the South China Sea, which is associated with shallow precipitation during summer, is an open-air natural laboratory for studying the impact of aerosol particles on shallow-precipitation events. Using 8 years of data from Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar measurements, aerosol reanalysis, and atmospheric reanalysis, this study investigates the potential influence of coarse and fine aerosol particles on the structure of the precipitation and the microphysical processes of shallow precipitation in southern China. Statistical results indicate that during coarse-aerosol-polluted  conditions, shallow-precipitation clouds have a lower mean height of the storm top (STH; ∼3.2 km) but a higher mean near-surface rain rate (RR; ∼1.78 mm h−1) and are characterized by high concentrations of large raindrops, driven mainly by significant collision–coalescence processes (accounting for 74.1 %). In contrast, during fine-aerosol-polluted conditions, shallow-precipitation clouds develop a deeper median STH of ∼3.7 km with lower surface RR characterized by a low concentration of small raindrops, resulting from increased breakup processes (33.1 %) and reduced collision–coalescence processes (69.6 %). The coarse (fine) aerosol particles act as promoters (inhibitors) of radar reflectivity in the profile of shallow precipitation, regardless of dynamic and humid conditions. The effect of coarse aerosol particles in promoting precipitation and the inhibiting effect of fine aerosol particles are the most significant under low-humidity conditions, mainly attributed to significantly enhanced collision–coalescence processes, exceeding 22.2 %. Furthermore, the increase in RR above 3 km in coarse-aerosol-polluted environments is mainly driven by the high concentration of hydrometeors in low-instability conditions, whereas it is driven by large hydrometeors in high-instability environments."

It highlights regional disparities: in the northern NCP, adverse weather negated emission reduction effects. In contrast, the southern NCP featured a PM2.5 decrease due to favorable weather and emission reductions. The research highlighted the interaction between emissions, meteorology, and PM2.5. 
 Haze events in the North China Plain (NCP) during the COVID-19 lockdown underscore the intricate challenges of air quality management amid reduced human activities. Utilizing the WRF-Chem model, we explored how sharp emission reductions and varying meteorological conditions influenced fine-particulate-matter (PM2.5) concentrations across the NCP. Our analysis highlights a marked regional contrast: in the northern NCP (NNCP), adverse meteorology largely offset emission reductions, resulting in PM2.5 increases of 30 to 60 µg m−3 during haze episodes. Conversely, the southern NCP (SNCP) benefited from favorable meteorological conditions that, combined with emission reductions, lowered PM2.5 by 20 to 40 µg m−3. These findings emphasize the critical role of meteorology in shaping the air quality response to emission changes, particularly in regions like the NNCP, where unfavorable weather patterns can counteract the benefits of emission reductions. Our study provides valuable insights into the complex interplay of emissions, meteorology, and pollutant dynamics, suggesting that adequate air quality strategies must integrate emission controls and meteorological considerations to address regional variations effectively."

 Sea ice forms a thin but horizontally extensive boundary between the ocean and the atmosphere and has complex, crust-like dynamics characterized by intermittent sea ice deformations. The heterogeneity and localization of these sea ice deformations are important characteristics of the sea ice cover that can be used to evaluate the performance of dynamical sea ice models against observations across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Here, we present a new pan-Arctic sea ice deformation and rotation rate (SIDRR; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13936609, Plante et al., 2024a) dataset derived from the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) and Sentinel-1 (S1) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery from 1 September 2017 to 31 August 2023. The SIDRR estimates are derived from contour integrals of triangulated ice motion data, obtained from the Environment and Climate Change Canada automated sea ice tracking system (ECCC-ASITS). The SIDRR dataset is not regularized and consists of stacked data from multiple SAR images computed on a range of spatial (4–10 km) and temporal (0.5–6 d) scales. It covers the entire Arctic Ocean and all peripheral seas except the Okhotsk Sea. Uncertainties associated with the propagation of tracking errors on the deformation values are included. We show that rectangular patterns of deformation features are visible when the sampled deformation rates are lower than the propagation error. This limits the meaningful information that can be extracted in areas with low SIDRR values but allows for the study of linear kinematic features with a high SIDRR signal-to-noise ratio. The spatial coverage and range of resolutions of the SIDRR dataset provide an interesting opportunity to investigate regional and seasonal variability in sea ice deformation statistics across scales, and these data can also be used to determine metrics for model evaluation."

Therefore, we utilized 472 gauge stations and their catchment boundaries, characterized as stations with reliable metadata, from the Geospatial dataset for hydrologic analyses in India (GHI) (Goteti, 2023). For each of these catchments, CAMELS-IND provides a catchment mean time series of meteorological forcings for 41 years (1980–2020) and 211 catchment attributes representing hydroclimatic and land cover characteristics extracted from multiple data sources (including ground-based observations, remote sensing-based products, and reanalyses datasets). CAMELS-IND follows the same standards of the previously developed CAMELS datasets for the USA, Chile, Brazil, Great Britain, Australia, Switzerland, and Germany to facilitate comparisons with catchments of those countries and inclusion in global hydrological studies. Notably, CAMELS-IND includes available observed streamflow and catchment mean time series of 19 meteorological forcings, including precipitation, maximum, minimum, average temperature, long-wave and short-wave radiation flux, U and V components of wind, relative humidity, evaporation rates from canopy and soil surface, actual and potential evapotranspiration, and soil moisture of four layers (covering depth up to 3 m below ground) for detailed hydrometeorological studies. We also derived catchment attributes representing human influences, including the number of dams and their utilization, total volume contents of dams in catchments, population density, and increases in urban and agricultural land covers to facilitate studies to understand human influences on catchment hydrology. Furthermore, the dataset includes predicted streamflow time series from a regionally trained long short-term memory (LSTM)-based hydrological model for all 472 catchments which can fill gaps in observed streamflow data or serve as a benchmark for testing and developing new hydrological models. We envision that CAMELS-IND will provide a strong foundation for a community-led effort toward gaining new hydrological insights from hydrologically distinct Indian catchments and solving pertinent issues related to water management, quantification and risk assessment of hydrologic extremes, unraveling regional-scale hydrologic functioning, and climate change impact assessment of catchments across India.

This dataset is designed to foster collaboration between lake scientists and computer scientists to improve predictions of water quality. By offering a way for computer models to be tested against real-world lake data, LakeBeD-US offers opportunities for both sciences to grow and to give new insights into the causes of water quality changes. 
 Water quality in lakes is an emergent property of complex biotic and abiotic processes that differ across spatial and temporal scales. Water quality is also a determinant of ecosystem services that lakes provide, and thus is of great interest to ecologists. Increasingly, machine learning and other computer science techniques are being used to predict water quality dynamics as well as to gain a greater understanding of water quality patterns and controls. To benefit both the sciences of ecology and computer science, we have created a benchmark dataset of lake water quality time series and vertical profiles. LakeBeD-US contains over 500 million unique observations of lake water quality collected by multiple long-term monitoring organizations across 17 water quality variables in 21 lakes in the United States. There are two published versions of LakeBeD-US: an ""Ecology Edition"" published in the Environmental Data Initiative repository, and a ""Computer Science Edition"" published in the Hugging Face repository. Each edition is formatted in a manner conducive to inquiries and analyses specific to each domain. For ecologists, LakeBeD-US provides an opportunity to study the spatial and temporal dynamics of several lakes with varying water quality, ecosystem, and landscape characteristics. For computer scientists, LakeBeD-US acts as a benchmark dataset that enables the advancement of machine learning for water quality prediction."

The FDA accurately reproduced NOx emissions when column observations were limited to the boundary layer and when the variability of the NO2 lifetime, the NOx : NO2 ratio, and NO2 profile shapes were correctly modeled. This introduces strong model dependency, reducing the simplicity of the original FDA formulation. 
 The flux divergence approach (FDA) is a popular technique for deriving NOx emission estimates from tropospheric NO2 columns measured by the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI)  satellite sensor. An attractive aspect of the FDA is that the method simplifies three-dimensional atmospheric chemistry and transport processes into a two-dimensional (longitude–latitude) steady-state continuity equation for columns that balances local NOx emissions with the net outflow and chemical loss of NOx. Here we test the capability of the FDA to reproduce known NOx emissions from synthetic NO2 column retrievals generated with the LOTOS-EUROS chemistry transport model over the Netherlands at high spatial resolution of about 2×2 km during summer. Our results show that the FDA captures the magnitude and spatial distribution of the NOx emissions to high accuracy (absolute bias <9 %), provided that the observations represent the NO2 column in the boundary layer, that wind speed and direction are representative for the boundary layer (PBL) column, and that the high-resolution spatiotemporal variability of the NO2 lifetimes and NOx:NO2 ratio is accounted for in the inversion instead of using single fixed values. The FDA systematically overestimates NOx emissions by 15 %–60 % when using tropospheric NO2 columns as the driving observation, while using PBL NO2 columns largely overcomes this systematic error. This merely reflects the fact that the local balance between emissions and sinks of NOx occurs in the boundary layer, which is decoupled from the NO2 in the free troposphere. Based on the recommendations from this sensitivity test, we then applied the FDA using observations of NO2 columns from TROPOMI, corrected for contributions from free-tropospheric NO2, between 1 June and 31 August 2018. The NOx emissions derived from the default TROPOMI retrievals are biased low over cities and industrialized areas. However, when the coarse 1×1° TM5-MP NO2 profile used in the retrieval is replaced by the high-resolution profile of LOTOS-EUROS, the TROPOMI NOx emissions are enhanced by 22 % and are in better agreement with the inventory for the Netherlands. This emphasizes the importance of using realistic high-resolution a priori NO2 profile shapes in the TROPOMI retrieval. We conclude that accurate quantitative NOx emissions estimates are possible with the FDA, but they require sophisticated, fine-scale corrections for both the NO2 observations driving the method and  the estimates of the NO2 chemical lifetime and NOx:NO2 ratio. This information can be obtained from high-resolution chemistry transport model simulations at the expense of the simplicity and applicability of the FDA."

The results revealed that TBP (50 and 100 mg·kg–1·day–1) decreased sperm count and motility, damaged testicular structure, and induced apoptosis in mice after 35 days of oral gavage. TBP (10, 50, and 200 μM) inhibited cell viability, induced apoptosis, and reduced the ratio of BCL2/BAX in GC-2 cells after 24 h of exposure. TBP (50 and 200 μM) triggered the buildup of reactive oxygen species and induced a reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential within GC-2 cells. In addition, TBP led to gut microbiota dysbiosis and metabolic profile alterations and increased the abundance of Prevotellaceae, which are negatively associated with sperm motility. Furthermore, TBP caused inflammation, induced the infiltration of Th17 cells into the mouse small intestine, and stimulated IL-17A signaling in mouse testes.

However, uncertainties regarding the bacterial inactivation mechanisms persist due to varying findings in prior research. This study aimed to clarify the inactivation mechanisms of two representative bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus, Gram-positive) and Escherichia coli (E. coli, Gram-negative), using an argon-based APPJ (Ar-APPJ) system in a controlled medium, primarily deionized water. We identified several reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), including hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrous acid/peroxynitrite (ONOOH/ONOO–), hydroxyl radical (•OH), and hydroperoxyl radical/superoxide radical, and evaluated their roles in bacterial inactivation. Inactivation experiments and quantification of suspected RONS revealed that ONOOH was the primary lethal agent for S. aureus, while •OH predominantly inactivated E. coli. Assessment of cell membrane integrity and intracellular RONS levels showed that E. coli, with its thinner cell wall, was more vulnerable to surface damage caused by •OH. In contrast, for S. aureus, with its thicker cell wall, intracellular attack by penetrated ONOOH, being significantly more diffusive than •OH, was more effective, as •OH alone could not induce sufficient surface damage. These findings advance our understanding of bacterial inactivation by the Ar-APPJ and provide valuable insights for designing effective water disinfection strategies utilizing this technology."

However, experimental research on its impact on organism lifespan and generational effects is limited. This study exposed three generations of fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) to O3, revealing a shortened lifespan across generations. Specifically, after O3 exposure, the lifespan of the F2 generation was significantly reduced compared with F0 and F1 generations, indicating a cumulative multigenerational effect. Transcriptome analysis unveiled significant disruptions in metabolic pathways, notably the insulin signaling pathway. Subsequent qRT-PCR analysis showed elevated mRNA levels of insulin pathway-related genes (dilp2, dilp3, dilp5, InR, and TOR), alongside decreased expression levels of FOXO, 4E-BP, and Atg5 in flies exposed to O3. Notably, knocking down dilp2, rather than dilp3, dilp5, and InR, rescued the O3-induced lifespan shortening. Overall, O3 exposure triggered activation of the dilp2-mediated InR-FOXO/TOR-4E-BP-Atg5 signaling pathway, potentially contributing to shortened lifespan with cumulative effects.

The influence of PM0.1 on neurodevelopmental disorders and its underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood but are of significant concern. Through an investigation using mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), our study has uncovered disruptions in cell cycle dynamics, reduced neural precursor formation, and impaired neurogenesis during mESC neural differentiation as a result of PM0.1-induced neurodevelopmental toxicity. By employing N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing and bioinformatics, we identified Zic1 as a key target of PM0.1-induced developmental disturbances. Our mechanistic findings indicate that PM0.1 enhances m6A methylation of Zic1 by upregulating Mettl3, leading to decreased mRNA stability and expression of this gene. Furthermore, the efficacy of the METTL3 inhibitor in alleviating nerve differentiation impairments emphasizes the significance of this pathway. In addition, source analysis, molecular docking, and toxicity analyses show that PAHs with higher ring structures in PM0.1 from combustion sources competitively bind to METTL3, potentially exacerbating neurodevelopmental toxicity.

It has traditionally been believed that the reduction of Cr(VI) can only occur through interaction with traditional reducing agents like natural organic matters (NOMs) and Fe(II), with H2O merely acting as a solvent. However, this study reveals that visible light can induce the reduction of Cr(VI) by H2O even without conventional reducing agents. Specifically, within the narrow liquid-like layer between ice crystals, there is a significant increase in concentrations of protons, Cr(VI), and anions (Cl–, SO42–, and NO3–), which promotes the formation of various complexes between Cr(VI) and anions. DFT results reveal 11 types of stable Cr(VI)-anion complexes in solution, with six exhibiting visible light absorption properties.

To achieve this, we analyze acoustic emission (AE) data from displacement‐driven rock friction experiments conducted on porous sandstone samples containing either a saw‐cut (smooth) or a rough fault. Using high‐quality AE‐derived focal mechanisms and two stress tensor inversion approaches–one considering double‐couple (DC) components and the other one incorporating non‐DC components, we examine the temporal evolution of the local stress tensor for both smooth and rough faults. Our results show no significant differences between the two stress inversion methods, indicating that non‐DC components have no significant influence on the resulting stress tensors in our experiments. As macroscopic shear slip approaches, the principal stress axes surrounding the fault zone gradually rotate, regardless of the initial fault roughness. The observed evolution of stress tensors correlates with the evolving partitioning between volumetric and shear deformation, as derived from moment tensor inversion of AEs. Compared to the smooth fault, the rough fault exhibits higher local stress heterogeneity and more erratic fluctuations in AE source‐related parameters as loading progresses."

Geological media are inherently heterogeneous, with properties depending on both lithology and external factors such as weathering, erosion, and tectonic activity. The effects of stress‐dependent variations in porosity and hydraulic conductivity on groundwater flow and residence times remain unexplored. Using process‐based hillslope models, we demonstrate how external lateral stresses cause significant variations in stress and strain, particularly on slopes steeper than 30%. These stresses reorganize porosity and hydraulic conductivity, with compressive regimes reducing these properties at valley bottoms and tensional regimes elevating values at crests. This redistribution of porosity and hydraulic conductivity leads to a channeling of groundwater flow near the surface. Channeling increases discharge rates in the upper seepage zone and the proportion of rapid flows.

Analysis of satellite gravimetric observations, ocean state estimates, and wind‐driven model simulations reveals that Ocean Bottom Pressure (OBP) and velocity in the deep water layer are significantly modulated by bathymetry, with pronounced variability near topographic features.

Alkane, carboxylic acid, and hydroxyl groups were the main components of the organic aerosol (OA), contributing 35.0%, 22.5%, and 21.8%, respectively. The mass concentrations and size distributions of the OFGs strongly depended on ambient relative humidity (RH). Specifically, the OFG mass concentrations were 50% higher during the high‐RH periods than the low‐RH periods. The peak size of the OFGs size distribution was 0.56–1 μm during the high‐RH periods, while a peak size of 0.32–0.56 μm was observed during the low‐RH periods. In addition, the concentrations of the total OA, carboxylic acid, and hydroxyl groups were positively correlated with the photochemical age (PCA), with the high‐RH samples increasing faster (greater slope) with PCA and being associated with a higher oxygen‐to‐carbon ratio. These results suggest that aqueous‐phase processing likely enhanced the production of the OFGs, especially oxygenated functional groups. Further analysis of size distribution of the oxygenated OFGs and the viscosity of aerosols indicates that the secondary OFGs were formed via surface‐limited mechanisms under low‐RH conditions and volume‐limited mechanisms under high‐RH conditions.

 The robustness of the macroscopic quantum nature of a superconductor can be characterized by the superfluid stiffness, ρs, a quantity that describes the energy required to vary the phase of the macroscopic quantum wavefunction. In unconventional superconductors, such as cuprates, the low-temperature behaviour of ρs markedly differs from that of conventional superconductors owing to quasiparticle excitations from gapless points (nodes) in momentum space. Intensive research on the recently discovered magic-angle twisted graphene family has revealed, in addition to superconducting states, strongly correlated electronic states associated with spontaneously broken symmetries, inviting the study of ρs to uncover the potentially unconventional nature of its superconductivity. Here we report the measurement of ρs in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (TTG), revealing unconventional nodal-gap superconductivity. Utilizing radio-frequency reflectometry techniques to measure the kinetic inductive response of superconducting TTG coupled to a microwave resonator, we find a linear temperature dependence of ρs at low temperatures and nonlinear Meissner effects in the current-bias dependence, both indicating nodal structures in the superconducting order parameter. Furthermore, the doping dependence shows a linear correlation between the zero-temperature ρs and the superconducting transition temperature Tc, reminiscent of Uemura’s relation in cuprates, suggesting phase-coherence-limited superconductivity. Our results provide strong evidence for nodal superconductivity in TTG and put strong constraints on the mechanisms of these graphene-based superconductors.

 The Yamnaya archaeological complex appeared around 3300 bc across the steppes north of the Black and Caspian Seas, and by 3000 bc it reached its maximal extent, ranging from Hungary in the west to Kazakhstan in the east. To localize Yamnaya origins among the preceding Eneolithic people, we assembled ancient DNA from 435 individuals, demonstrating three genetic clines. A Caucasus–lower Volga (CLV) cline suffused with Caucasus hunter-gatherer1 ancestry extended between a Caucasus Neolithic southern end and a northern end at Berezhnovka along the lower Volga river. Bidirectional gene flow created intermediate populations, such as the north Caucasus Maikop people, and those at Remontnoye on the steppe. The Volga cline was formed as CLV people mixed with upriver populations of Eastern hunter-gatherer2 ancestry, creating hypervariable groups, including one at Khvalynsk. The Dnipro cline was formed when CLV people moved west, mixing with people with Ukraine Neolithic hunter-gatherer ancestry3 along the Dnipro and Don rivers to establish Serednii Stih groups, from whom Yamnaya ancestors formed around 4000 bc and grew rapidly after 3750–3350 bc. The CLV people contributed around four-fifths of the ancestry of the Yamnaya and, entering Anatolia, probably from the east, at least one-tenth of the ancestry of Bronze Age central Anatolians, who spoke Hittite4,5. We therefore propose that the final unity of the speakers of ‘proto-Indo-Anatolian’, the language ancestral to both Anatolian and Indo-European people, occurred in CLV people some time between 4400 bc and 4000 bc.

 In the centres of many galaxy clusters, the hot (approximately 107 kelvin) intracluster medium can become dense enough that it should cool on short timescales1,2. However, the low measured star formation rates in massive central galaxies3–6 and the absence of soft X-ray lines from the cooling gas7–9 suggest that most of this gas never cools. This is known as the cooling flow problem. The latest observations suggest that black hole jets are maintaining the vast majority of gas at high temperatures10–16. A cooling flow has yet to be fully mapped through all the gas phases in any galaxy cluster. Here we present observations of the Phoenix cluster17 using the James Webb Space Telescope to map the [Ne vi] λ 7.652-μm emission line, enabling us to probe the gas at 105.5 kelvin on large scales. These data show extended [Ne vi] emission that is cospatial with the cooling peak in the intracluster medium, the coolest gas phases and the sites of active star formation. Taken together, these imply a recent episode of rapid cooling, causing a short-lived spike in the cooling rate, which we estimate to be 5,000–23,000 solar masses per year. These data provide a large-scale map of gas at temperatures between 105 kelvin and 106 kelvin in a cluster core, and highlight the critical role that black hole feedback has in not only regulating cooling but also promoting it18.

 Distributed quantum computing (DQC) combines the computing power of multiple networked quantum processing modules, ideally enabling the execution of large quantum circuits without compromising performance or qubit connectivity1,2. Photonic networks are well suited as a versatile and reconfigurable interconnect layer for DQC; remote entanglement shared between matter qubits across the network enables all-to-all logical connectivity through quantum gate teleportation (QGT)3,4. For a scalable DQC architecture, the QGT implementation must be deterministic and repeatable; until now, no demonstration has satisfied these requirements. Here we experimentally demonstrate the distribution of quantum computations between two photonically interconnected trapped-ion modules. The modules, separated by about two metres, each contain dedicated network and circuit qubits. By using heralded remote entanglement between the network qubits, we deterministically teleport a controlled-Z (CZ) gate between two circuit qubits in separate modules, achieving 86% fidelity. We then execute Grover’s search algorithm5—to our knowledge, the first implementation of a distributed quantum algorithm comprising several non-local two-qubit gates—and measure a 71% success rate. Furthermore, we implement distributed iSWAP and SWAP circuits, compiled with two and three instances of QGT, respectively, demonstrating the ability to distribute arbitrary two-qubit operations6.

 Fossils representing Cretaceous lineages of crown clade birds (Aves) are exceptionally rare but are crucial to elucidating major ecological shifts across early avian divergences. Among the earliest known putative crown birds is Vegavis iaai1–5, a foot-propelled diver from the latest Cretaceous (69.2–68.4 million years ago)6 of Antarctica with controversial phylogenetic affinities2,7–10. Initially recovered by phylogenetic analyses as a stem anatid (ducks and closely related species)1,2,11, Vegavis has since been recovered as a stem member of Anseriformes (waterfowl)7–9, or outside Aves altogether10. Here we report a new, nearly complete skull of Vegavis that provides new insight into its feeding ecology and exhibits morphologies that support placement among waterfowl within crown-group birds. Vegavis has an avian beak (absence of teeth and reduced maxilla) and brain shape (hyperinflated cerebrum and ventrally shifted optic lobes). The temporal fossa is well excavated and expansive, indicating that this bird had hypertrophied jaw musculature. The beak is narrow and pointed, and the mandible lacks retroarticular processes. Together, these features comprise a feeding apparatus unlike that of any other known anseriform but like that of other extant birds that capture prey underwater (for example, grebes and loons). The Cretaceous occurrence of Vegavis, with a feeding ecology unique among known Galloanserae (waterfowl and landfowl), is further indication that the earliest anseriform divergences were marked by evolutionary experiments unrepresented in the extant diversity3,11–13. A new, nearly complete fossil skull of Vegavis from the James Ross Basin, Antarctic Peninsula, provides insight into its feeding ecology and exhibits morphologies that support placement among waterfowl within crown-group birds."

 The construction of superlattices with a spatial modulation of chemical compositions allows for the creation of artificial materials with tailorable periodic potential landscapes and tunable electronic and optical properties1–5. Conventional semiconductor superlattices with designable potential modulation in one dimension has enabled high-electron-mobility transistors and quantum-cascade lasers. More recently, a diverse set of superlattices has been constructed through self-assembly or guided assembly of multiscale building units, including zero-dimensional nanoclusters and nanoparticles6,7, one-dimensional nanorods and nanowires8,9, two-dimensional nanolayers and nanosheets10–13, and hybrid two-dimensional molecular assemblies14–17. These self-assembled superlattices feature periodic structural modulation in two or three dimensions, but often lack atomic precision owing to the inevitable structural disorder at the interfaces between the constituent units. Here we report a one-pot synthesis of multi-dimensional single-crystalline superlattices consisting of periodic arrangement of zero-, one- and two-dimensional building units. By exploiting zirconium (IV) metal–organic frameworks as host templates for directed nucleation and precise growth of metal-halide sublattices through a coordination-assisted assembly strategy, we synthesize a family of single-crystalline porous superlattices. Single-crystal X-ray crystallography and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy clearly resolve the high-order superlattice structure with deterministic atomic coordinates. Further treatment with selected amine molecules produces perovskite-like superlattices with highly tunable photoluminescence and chiroptical properties. Our study creates a platform of high-order single-crystalline porous superlattices, opening opportunities to tailor the electronic, optical and quantum properties beyond the reach of conventional crystalline solids. Using zirconium metal–organic frameworks as the host template for directed nucleation and precise growth of metal-halide sublattices, multi-dimensional single-crystalline porous superlattices can be achieved through a one-pot synthesis."

 Although cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTLs) are essential for anti-tumour immunity, they are frequently dysfunctional in tumours1. Cytokines that sustain CTL activity are attractive for cancer immunotherapy, but avoiding inflammatory toxicity remains a challenge for their clinical use2. Here we show that expression of a CTL signature is strongly associated with IL27 expression in human and mouse tumours. In mice, IL-27 acts directly on tumour-specific CTLs to promote their persistence and effector function in the tumour microenvironment. Moreover, treatment with inducible IL-27 overexpression or a half-life-extended IL-27 protein in vivo is well tolerated, induces regression of established tumours, drives an enhanced cytotoxic program in anti-tumour CTLs and synergizes with PD-L1 blockade. In patients with cancer who were treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, high expression of IL-27 correlates with a favourable clinical response, and IL-27 supports human CTL function during chronic antigen stimulation ex vivo. Our data demonstrate that endogenous IL-27 is essential for anti-tumour immunity and that IL-27 receptor agonism can safely improve anti-tumour T cell responses alone or in combination with PD-L1 blockade.

 The physics of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) is a topic of keen interest in moiré systems research, and it may provide an insight into the pairing mechanism of other strongly correlated materials such as high-critical-temperature superconductors. Here we use d.c. transport and microwave circuit quantum electrodynamics to directly measure the superfluid stiffness of superconducting MATBG through its kinetic inductance. We find the superfluid stiffness to be much larger than expected from conventional Fermi liquid theory. Rather, it is comparable to theoretical predictions1 and recent experimental indications2 of quantum geometric effects that are dominant at the magic angle. The temperature dependence of the superfluid stiffness follows a power law, which contraindicates an isotropic Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) model. Instead, the extracted power-law exponents indicate an anisotropic superconducting gap, whether interpreted in the Fermi liquid framework or by considering the quantum geometry of flat-band superconductivity. Moreover, a quadratic dependence of the superfluid stiffness on both d.c. and microwave current is observed, which is consistent with the Ginzburg–Landau theory. Taken together, our findings show that MATBG is an unconventional superconductor with an anisotropic gap and strongly suggest a connection between quantum geometry, superfluid stiffness and unconventional superconductivity in MATBG. The combined d.c.–microwave measurement platform used here is applicable to the investigation of other atomically thin superconductors.

 Over the past billion years, the fungal kingdom has diversified to more than two million species, with over 95% still undescribed. Beyond the well-known macroscopic mushrooms and microscopic yeast, fungi are heterotrophs that feed on almost any organic carbon, recycling nutrients through the decay of dead plants and animals and sequestering carbon into Earth’s ecosystems. Human-directed applications of fungi extend from leavened bread, alcoholic beverages and biofuels to pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics and psychoactive compounds. Conversely, fungal infections pose risks to ecosystems ranging from crops to wildlife to humans; these risks are driven, in part, by human and animal movement, and might be accelerating with climate change. Genomic surveys are expanding our knowledge of the true biodiversity of the fungal kingdom, and genome-editing tools make it possible to imagine harnessing these organisms to fuel the bioeconomy. Here, we examine the fungal threats facing civilization and investigate opportunities to use fungi to combat these threats.

 The genetic code is conserved across all domains of life, yet exceptions have revealed variations in codon assignments and associated translation factors1–3. Inspired by this natural malleability, synthetic approaches have demonstrated whole-genome replacement of synonymous codons to construct genomically recoded organisms (GROs)4,5 with alternative genetic codes. However, no efforts have fully leveraged translation factor plasticity and codon degeneracy to compress translation function to a single codon and assess the possibility of a non-degenerate code. Here we describe construction and characterization of Ochre, a GRO that fully compresses a translational function into a single codon. We replaced 1,195 TGA stop codons with the synonymous TAA in ∆TAG Escherichia coli C321.∆A4. We then engineered release factor 2 (RF2) and tRNATrp to mitigate native UGA recognition, translationally isolating four codons for non-degenerate functions. Ochre thus utilizes UAA as the sole stop codon, with UGG encoding tryptophan and UAG and UGA reassigned for multi-site incorporation of two distinct non-standard amino acids into single proteins with more than 99% accuracy. Ochre fully compresses degenerate stop codons into a single codon and represents an important step toward a 64-codon non-degenerate code that will enable precise production of multi-functional synthetic proteins with unnatural encoded chemistries and broad utility in biotechnology and biotherapeutics.

 Antimicrobial compounds are essential for controlling bacterial infections. Stress-induced bacterial tolerance and persisters can undermine antimicrobial activities under laboratory conditions, but their quantitative effects under physiological conditions remain unclear1,2. Here we determined constraints on clearance of Salmonella by antimicrobials in infected mice and tissue-mimicking chemostats. The antibiotics enrofloxacin and ceftriaxone exhibited poor anti-Salmonella activity under both conditions, primarily owing to severe nutrient starvation, which restricted Salmonella replication3–5. Other infection-associated conditions, such as acidic pH, glucose, oxidative stress, nitrosative stress, antimicrobial peptides, osmolarity, oxygen limitation, carbon dioxide and carbonate, as well as drug efflux, toxin–antitoxin modules and cell size had limited effects. A subset of resilient Salmonella appeared as a key obstacle for clearance by enrofloxacin, based on the biphasic decline of Salmonella colony-forming units. However, these data were misleading, because colony formation was confounded by extensive post-exposure killing. More accurate single-cell, real-time assays showed uniformly slow damage, indicating high resilience across the entire Salmonella population. The resulting extensive survival of bulk bacteria minimized the effect of hyper-resilient persisters. Thus, starvation-induced general resilience of Salmonella was the main cause of poor antibiotic clearance. These findings highlight the importance of quantifying antibiotic activity with real-time, single-cell assays under physiological conditions. Experiments in infected mice and tissue-mimicking chemostats show that resilience of Salmonella against antimicrobial compounds is largely a result of starvation-induced general resilience rather than survival of a small subset of hyper-resilient cells."

 Synthetic lethality exploits the genetic vulnerabilities of cancer cells to enable a targeted, precision approach to treat cancer1. Over the past 15 years, synthetic lethal cancer target discovery approaches have led to clinical successes of PARP inhibitors2 and ushered several next-generation therapeutic targets such as WRN3, USP14, PKMYT15, POLQ6 and PRMT57 into the clinic. Here we identify, in human cancer, a novel synthetic lethal interaction between the PELO–HBS1L and SKI complexes of the mRNA quality control pathway. In distinct genetic contexts, including 9p21.3-deleted and high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) tumours, we found that phenotypically destabilized SKI complex leads to dependence on the PELO–HBS1L ribosomal rescue complex. PELO–HBS1L and SKI complex synthetic lethality alters the normal cell cycle and drives the unfolded protein response through the activation of IRE1, as well as robust tumour growth inhibition. Our results indicate that PELO and HBS1L represent novel therapeutic targets whose dependence converges upon SKI complex destabilization, a common phenotypic biomarker in diverse genetic contexts representing a significant population of patients with cancer.

 Understanding the collective quantum dynamics of non-equilibrium many-body systems is an outstanding challenge in quantum science. In particular, dynamics driven by quantum fluctuations are important for the formation of exotic quantum phases of matter1, fundamental high-energy processes2, quantum metrology3,4 and quantum algorithms5. Here we use a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays to experimentally study collective dynamics across a (2+1)-dimensional Ising quantum phase transition. After crossing the quantum critical point, we observe a gradual growth of correlations through coarsening of antiferromagnetically ordered domains6. By deterministically preparing and following the evolution of ordered domains, we show that the coarsening is driven by the curvature of domain boundaries, and find that the dynamics accelerate with proximity to the quantum critical point. We quantitatively explore these phenomena and further observe long-lived oscillations of the order parameter, corresponding to an amplitude (‘Higgs’) mode7. These observations offer a viewpoint into emergent collective dynamics in strongly correlated quantum systems and non-equilibrium quantum processes.

 The North Pontic Region was the meeting point of the farmers of Old Europe and the foragers and pastoralists of the Eurasian steppe1,2, and the source of migrations deep into Europe3–5. Here we report genome-wide data from 81 prehistoric North Pontic individuals to understand the genetic makeup of its people. North Pontic foragers had ancestry from Balkan and Eastern hunter-gatherers6 as well as European farmers and, occasionally, Caucasus hunter-gatherers. During the Eneolithic period, a wave of migrants from the Caucasus–Lower Volga area7 bypassed local foragers to mix in equal parts with Trypillian farmers, forming the people of the Usatove culture around 4500 bce. A temporally overlapping wave of migrants from the Caucasus–Lower Volga blended with foragers instead of farmers to form Serednii Stih people7. The third wave was the Yamna—descendants of the Serednii Stih who formed by mixture around 4000 bce and expanded during the Early Bronze Age (3300 bce). The temporal gap between Serednii Stih and the Yamna is bridged by a genetically Yamna individual from Mykhailivka, Ukraine (3635–3383 bce), a site of archaeological continuity across the Eneolithic–Bronze Age transition and a likely epicentre of Yamna formation. Each of these three waves of migration propagated distinctive ancestries while also incorporating outsiders, a flexible strategy that may explain the success of the peoples of the North Pontic in spreading their genes and culture across Eurasia3–5,8–10.

 Cancer genome alterations often lead to vulnerabilities that can be used to selectively target cancer cells. Various inhibitors of such synthetic lethal targets have been approved by the FDA or are in clinical trials, highlighting the potential of this approach1–3. Here we analysed large-scale CRISPR knockout screening data from the Cancer Dependency Map and identified a new synthetic lethal target, PELO, for two independent molecular subtypes of cancer: biallelic deletion of chromosomal region 9p21.3 or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H). In 9p21.3-deleted cancers, PELO dependency emerges from biallelic deletion of the 9p21.3 gene FOCAD, a stabilizer of the superkiller complex (SKIc). In MSI-H cancers, PELO is required owing to MSI-H-associated mutations in TTC37 (also known as SKIC3), a critical component of the SKIc. We show that both cancer subtypes converge to destabilize the SKIc, which extracts mRNA from stalled ribosomes. In SKIc-deficient cells, PELO depletion induces the unfolded protein response, a stress response to accumulation of misfolded or unfolded nascent polypeptides. Together, our findings indicate PELO as a promising therapeutic target for a large patient population with cancers characterized as MSI-H with deleterious TTC37 mutations or with biallelic 9p21.3 deletions involving FOCAD.

 Enhanced weathering (EW) with agriculture uses crushed silicate rocks to drive carbon dioxide removal (CDR)1,2. If widely adopted on farmlands, it could help achieve net-zero emissions by 20502–4. Here we show, with a detailed US state-specific carbon cycle analysis constrained by resource provision, that EW deployed on agricultural land could sequester 0.16–0.30 GtCO2 yr−1 by 2050, rising to 0.25–0.49 GtCO2 yr−1 by 2070. Geochemical assessment of rivers and oceans suggests effective transport of dissolved products from EW from soils, offering CDR on intergenerational timescales. Our analysis further indicates that EW may temporarily help lower ground-level ozone and concentrations of secondary aerosols in agricultural regions. Geospatially mapped CDR costs show heterogeneity across the USA, reflecting a combination of cropland distance from basalt source regions, timing of EW deployment and evolving CDR rates. CDR costs are highest in the first two decades before declining to about US$100–150 tCO2−1 by 2050, including for states that contribute most to total national CDR. Although EW cannot be a substitute for emission reductions, our assessment strengthens the case for EW as an overlooked practical innovation for helping the USA meet net-zero 2050 goals5,6.

 Topological wave structures, such as vortices1–6, polarization textures7–11 and skyrmions12–19, appear in various quantum and classical wave fields, including optics and acoustics. In particular, optical vortices have found numerous applications20,21, ranging from quantum information to astrophysics. Furthermore, both optical and acoustic structured waves are crucial in the manipulation of small particles22–25, from atoms to macroscopic biological objects. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in structured water surface waves, which can be notable analogues of quantum, optical and acoustic wave systems26–29. However, topological water-wave forms, especially their ability to manipulate particles, have not yet been demonstrated. Here we describe the controllable generation of topological structures, namely wave vortices, skyrmions and polarization Möbius strips, in gravity water waves. Most importantly, we demonstrate the efficient manipulation of subwavelength and wavelength-order floating particles with topologically structured water waves. This includes trapping the particles in the high-intensity field zones and controlling their orbital and spinning motion due to the orbital and spin angular momenta of the water waves. Our results reveal the water-wave counterpart of optical and acoustic manipulation, which paves the way for applications in hydrodynamics and microfluidics.

 The hypothalamus is a brain region that plays a key role in coordinating fundamental biological functions1. However, our understanding of the underlying cellular components and neurocircuitries have, until recently, emerged primarily from rodent studies2,3. Here we combine single-nucleus sequencing of 433,369 human hypothalamic cells with spatial transcriptomics, generating a comprehensive spatio-cellular transcriptional map of the hypothalamus, the ‘HYPOMAP’. Although conservation of neuronal cell types between humans and mice, as based on transcriptomic identity, is generally high, there are notable exceptions. Specifically, there are significant disparities in the identity of pro-opiomelanocortin neurons and in the expression levels of G-protein-coupled receptors between the two species that carry direct implications for currently approved obesity treatments. Out of the 452 hypothalamic cell types, we find that 291 neuronal clusters are significantly enriched for expression of body mass index (BMI) genome-wide association study genes. This enrichment is driven by 426 ‘effector’ genes. Rare deleterious variants in six of these (MC4R, PCSK1, POMC, CALCR, BSN and CORO1A) associate with BMI at population level, and CORO1A has not been linked previously to BMI. Thus, HYPOMAP provides a detailed atlas of the human hypothalamus in a spatial context and serves as an important resource to identify new druggable targets for treating a wide range of conditions, including reproductive, circadian and metabolic disorders. HYPOMAP integrates single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic data to create a comprehensive spatio-cellular map of the human hypothalamus."

 A hallmark of pulmonary fibrosis is the aberrant activation of lung fibroblasts into pathological fibroblasts that produce excessive extracellular matrix1–3. Thus, the identification of key regulators that promote the generation of pathological fibroblasts can inform the development of effective countermeasures against disease progression. Here we use two mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis to show that LEPR+ fibroblasts that arise during alveologenesis include SCUBE2+ alveolar fibroblasts as a major constituent. These alveolar fibroblasts in turn contribute substantially to CTHRC1+POSTN+ pathological fibroblasts. Genetic ablation of POSTN+ pathological fibroblasts attenuates fibrosis. Comprehensive analyses of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data reveal that RUNX2 is a key regulator of the expression of fibrotic genes. Consistently, conditional deletion of Runx2 with LeprcreERT2 or Scube2creERT2 reduces the generation of pathological fibroblasts, extracellular matrix deposition and pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, LEPR+ cells that include SCUBE2+ alveolar fibroblasts are a key source of pathological fibroblasts, and targeting Runx2 provides a potential treatment option for pulmonary fibrosis.

 The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly evolved over short timescales, leading to the emergence of more transmissible variants such as Alpha and Delta1–3. The arrival of the Omicron variant marked a major shift, introducing numerous extra mutations in the spike gene compared with earlier variants1,2. These evolutionary changes have raised concerns regarding their potential impact on immune evasion, disease severity and the effectiveness of vaccines and treatments1,3. In this epidemiological study, we identified two distinct patterns in the protective effect of natural infection against reinfection in the Omicron versus pre-Omicron eras. Before Omicron, natural infection provided strong and durable protection against reinfection, with minimal waning over time. However, during the Omicron era, protection was robust only for those recently infected, declining rapidly over time and diminishing within a year. These results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 immune protection is shaped by a dynamic interaction between host immunity and viral evolution, leading to contrasting reinfection patterns before and after Omicron’s first wave. This shift in patterns suggests a change in evolutionary pressures, with intrinsic transmissibility driving adaptation pre-Omicron and immune escape becoming dominant post-Omicron, underscoring the need for periodic vaccine updates to sustain immunity. Two distinct patterns in the protective effect of natural infection against reinfection in the Omicron variant versus pre-Omicron eras show that SARS-CoV-2 immune protection is shaped by dynamic interaction between host immunity and viral evolution."

 Bacteriophages use diverse mechanisms to evade antiphage defence systems. ΦKZ-like jumbo phages assemble a proteinaceous, nucleus-like compartment that excludes antagonistic host nucleases and also internalizes DNA replication and transcription machinery1–4. The phage factors required for protein import and the mechanisms of selectivity remain unknown, however. Here we uncover an import system comprising proteins highly conserved across nucleus-forming phages, together with additional cargo-specific contributors. Using a genetic selection that forces the phage to decrease or abolish the import of specific proteins, we determine that the importation of five different phage nuclear-localized proteins requires distinct interfaces of the same factor, Imp1 (gp69). Imp1 localizes early to the nascent phage nucleus and forms discrete puncta in the mature phage nuclear periphery, probably in complex with direct interactor Imp6 (gp67), a conserved protein encoded in the same locus. The import of certain proteins, including a host topoisomerase, additionally requires Imp3 (gp59), a conserved factor necessary for proper Imp1 function. Three additional non-conserved phage proteins (Imp2 and Imp4/Imp5) are required for the import of two queried nuclear cargos (nuclear-localized protein 1 and host topoisomerase, respectively), perhaps acting as specific adaptors. We therefore propose a core import system that includes Imp1, Imp3 and Imp6, with multiple interfaces of Imp1 licensing transport through a protein lattice. This study uncovers a highly conserved jumbo phage protein, Imp1, that possesses multiple interfaces to license protein import into a proteinaceous nucleus-like compartment, using a genetic selection that forces the phage to decrease or abolish the import of specific proteins."

 Many children from low-income backgrounds worldwide fail to master school mathematics1; however, some children extensively use mental arithmetic outside school2,3. Here we surveyed children in Kolkata and Delhi, India, who work in markets (n = 1,436), to investigate whether maths skills acquired in real-world settings transfer to the classroom and vice versa. Nearly all these children used complex arithmetic calculations effectively at work. They were also proficient in solving hypothetical market maths problems and verbal maths problems that were anchored to concrete contexts. However, they were unable to solve arithmetic problems of equal or lesser complexity when presented in the abstract format typically used in school. The children’s performance in market maths problems was not explained by memorization, access to help, reduced stress with more familiar formats or high incentives for correct performance. By contrast, children with no market-selling experience (n = 471), enrolled in nearby schools, showed the opposite pattern. These children performed more accurately on simple abstract problems, but only 1% could correctly answer an applied market maths problem that more than one third of working children solved (β = 0.35, s.e.m. = 0.03; 95% confidence interval = 0.30–0.40, P < 0.001). School children used highly inefficient written calculations, could not combine different operations and arrived at answers too slowly to be useful in real-life or in higher maths. These findings highlight the importance of educational curricula that bridge the gap between intuitive and formal maths.

 Personalized cancer vaccines (PCVs) can generate circulating immune responses against predicted neoantigens1–6. However, whether such responses can target cancer driver mutations, lead to immune recognition of a patient’s tumour and result in clinical activity are largely unknown. These questions are of particular interest for patients who have tumours with a low mutational burden. Here we conducted a phase I trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02950766) to test a neoantigen-targeting PCV in patients with high-risk, fully resected clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC; stage III or IV) with or without ipilimumab administered adjacent to the vaccine. At a median follow-up of 40.2 months after surgery, none of the 9 participants enrolled in the study had a recurrence of RCC. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. All patients generated T cell immune responses against the PCV antigens, including to RCC driver mutations in VHL, PBRM1, BAP1, KDM5C and PIK3CA. Following vaccination, there was a durable expansion of peripheral T cell clones. Moreover, T cell reactivity against autologous tumours was detected in seven out of nine patients. Our results demonstrate that neoantigen-targeting PCVs in high-risk RCC are highly immunogenic, capable of targeting key driver mutations and can induce antitumour immunity. These observations, in conjunction with the absence of recurrence in all nine vaccinated patients, highlights the promise of PCVs as effective adjuvant therapy in RCC.

 The precise control of mechanochemical activation within deep tissues using non-invasive ultrasound holds profound implications for advancing our understanding of fundamental biomedical sciences and revolutionizing disease treatments1–4. However, a theory-guided mechanoresponsive materials system with well-defined ultrasound activation has yet to be explored5,6. Here we present the concept of using porous hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) as toolkits for focused ultrasound (FUS) programmably triggered drug activation to control specific cellular events in the deep brain, through on-demand scission of the supramolecular interactions. A theoretical model is developed to potentially visualize the mechanochemical scission and ultrasound mechanics, providing valuable guidelines for the rational design of mechanoresponsive materials to achieve programmable control. To demonstrate the practicality of this approach, we encapsulate the designer drug clozapine N-oxide (CNO) into the optimal HOF nanocrystals for FUS-gated release to activate engineered G-protein-coupled receptors in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of mice and rats and hence achieve targeted neural circuit modulation even at depth 9 mm with a latency of seconds. This work demonstrates the capability of ultrasound to precisely control molecular interactions and develops ultrasound-programmable HOFs to non-invasively and spatiotemporally control cellular events, thereby facilitating the establishment of precise molecular therapeutic possibilities.

 Dense crowds form some of the most dangerous environments in modern society1. Dangers arise from uncontrolled collective motions, leading to compression against walls, suffocation and fatalities2–4. Our current understanding of crowd dynamics primarily relies on heuristic collision models, which effectively capture the behaviour observed in small groups of people5,6. However, the emergent dynamics of dense crowds, composed of thousands of individuals, remains a formidable many-body problem lacking quantitative experimental characterization and explanations rooted in first principles. Here we analyse the dynamics of thousands of densely packed individuals at the San Fermín festival (Spain) and infer a physical theory of dense crowds in confinement. Our measurements reveal that dense crowds can self-organize into macroscopic chiral oscillators, coordinating the orbital motion of hundreds of individuals without external guidance. Guided by these measurements and symmetry principles, we construct a mechanical model of dense-crowd motion. Our model demonstrates that emergent odd frictional forces drive a non-reciprocal phase transition7 towards collective chiral oscillations, capturing all our experimental observations. To test the robustness of our findings, we show that similar chiral dynamics emerged at the onset of the 2010 Love Parade disaster and propose a protocol that could help anticipate these previously unpredictable dynamics.

 Linear conducting polymers show ballistic transport, imposed by mobile carriers moving along the polymer chains1,2, whereas conductance in the extended dimension, that is, between polymer strands or layers, remains weak due to the lack of intermolecular ordering and electronic coupling3–5. Here we report a multilayer-stacked two-dimensional polyaniline (2DPANI) crystal, which shows metallic out-of-plane charge transport with high electrical conductivity. The material comprises columnar π arrays with an interlayer distance of 3.59 Å and periodic rhombohedral lattices formed by interwoven polyaniline chains. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy reveals significant electron delocalization in the 2DPANI lattices. First-principles calculations indicate the in-plane 2D conjugation and strong interlayer electronic coupling in 2DPANI facilitated by the Cl-bridged layer stacking. To assess the local optical conductivity, we used terahertz and infrared nanospectroscopy to unravel a Drude-type conductivity with an infrared plasma frequency and an extrapolated local d.c. conductivity of around 200 S cm−1. Conductive scanning probe microscopy showed an unusually high out-of-plane conductivity of roughly 15 S cm−1. Transport measurements through vertical and lateral micro-devices revealed comparable high out-of-plane (roughly 7 S cm−1) and in-plane conductivity (roughly 16 S cm−1). The vertical micro-devices further showed increasing conductivity with decreasing temperature, demonstrating unique out-of-plane metallic transport behaviour. By using this multilayer-stacked 2D conducting polymer design, we predict the achievement of strong electronic coupling beyond in-plane interactions, potentially reaching three-dimensional metallic conductivity6,7.

Mi,Thermalization and criticality on an analogue–digital quantum simulator,"A hybrid analogue–digital quantum simulator is used to demonstrate beyond-classical performance in benchmarking experiments and to study thermalization phenomena in an XY quantum magnet, including the breakdown of Kibble–Zurek scaling predictions and signatures of the Kosterlitz–Thouless phase transition. 
 Understanding how interacting particles approach thermal equilibrium is a major challenge of quantum simulators1,2. Unlocking the full potential of such systems towards this goal requires flexible initial state preparation, precise time evolution and extensive probes for final state characterization. Here we present a quantum simulator comprising 69 superconducting qubits that supports both universal quantum gates and high-fidelity analogue evolution, with performance beyond the reach of classical simulation in cross-entropy benchmarking experiments. This hybrid platform features more versatile measurement capabilities compared with analogue-only simulators, which we leverage here to reveal a coarsening-induced breakdown of Kibble–Zurek scaling predictions3 in the XY model, as well as signatures of the classical Kosterlitz–Thouless phase transition4. Moreover, the digital gates enable precise energy control, allowing us to study the effects of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis5–7 in targeted parts of the eigenspectrum. We also demonstrate digital preparation of pairwise-entangled dimer states, and image the transport of energy and vorticity during subsequent thermalization in analogue evolution. These results establish the efficacy of superconducting analogue–digital quantum processors for preparing states across many-body spectra and unveiling their thermalization dynamics. A hybrid analogue–digital quantum simulator is used to demonstrate beyond-classical performance in benchmarking experiments and to study thermalization phenomena in an XY quantum magnet, including the breakdown of Kibble–Zurek scaling predictions and signatures of the Kosterlitz–Thouless phase transition."

 Expanding the performance of field-effect devices is a key challenge of the ever-growing chip industry at the core of current technologies1. Non-volatile multiferroic transistors that control atomic movements rather than purely electronic distribution are highly desired2. Recently, a field-effect control over structural transitions was achieved in commensurate stacking configurations of honeycomb van der Waals (vdW) polytypes by sliding boundary strips between oppositely polarized domains3–6. This ferroelectric hysteretic response, however, relied on pre-existing dislocation strips between relatively large micron-scale domains, severely limiting practical implementations3,7,8. Here we report the robust electric switching of single-domain polytypes in nanometre-scale islands embedded in super-lubricant vdW arrays. We etch cavities into a thin layered spacer and then encapsulate it with functional flakes. The flakes above/under the lattice-mismatched spacer sag and touch at each cavity to form islands of commensurate and metastable polytype configurations. By imaging the polarization of the polytypes, we observe nucleation and annihilation of boundary strips and geometry-adaptable ferroelectric hysteresis loops. Using mechanical stress, we further control the position of boundary strips, modify marginal twist angles and nucleate patterns of polar domain. This super-lubricant arrays of polytype (SLAP) concept suggests ‘slidetronics’ device applications such as elastic-coupled neuromorphic memory cells and non-volatile multiferroic tunnelling transistors and programmable response by designing the size, shape and symmetry of the islands and of the arrays9. By etching cavities into a thin lubricant spacer and encapsulating it with functional flakes, electric and mechanical switching of single-crystal, van der Waals stacking configurations is demonstrated."

 The integration of Indigenous perspectives and knowledge with biomedical approaches in neurosciences can significantly broaden the understanding of the human brain and mind. Drawing upon the writings of Elders in Canada, we refer to this integration as Two-Eyed Seeing or Etuaptmumk. We discuss how Two-Eyed Seeing and other dual perspectives can bring both breadth of knowledge and humility to the development of research and clinical practices for brain health. In this forward-looking discussion, we include both traditional academic and non-academic traditions and the work of Indigenous scholars on methodologies, life, health, culture, language and history. To describe challenges and consider solutions, we offer broad strategies for allyship, humility and universalism and situate them in four specific examples pertaining to disability, suicide, migration and the environment. We further advance the power of Two-Eyed Seeing in the context of new considerations for communication and public engagement. Two-Eyed Seeing, per se, is only one approach, but as neuroscience becomes ever more global, inclusive and ethically proactive, it must universally see the world of brain and mental health through the eyes of both reductionism and holism. Combining Indigenous insights with neuroscience methods through Two-Eyed Seeing can broaden the understanding of brain function and mental wellbeing by merging reductionist and holistic perspectives across various domains, while promoting allyship, humility and inclusive communication."

 Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) show potential to prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in humans1. However, there are limited data on the antibody concentrations required to prevent infection. Clinical trials of bNAb prophylaxis have demonstrated partial efficacy2, but the sampling frequency typically does not allow precise timing of infection events and concurrent antibody levels. Here, using simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of rhesus macaques, we show that although potent bNAbs can delay the onset of acute viremia, subclinical infections occur while bNAb levels remain high. Serial SIV challenge of monkeys given partially and fully neutralizing bNAbs revealed that ‘viral blips’—low and transient plasma viremia—often occur while serum bNAb concentrations are well above currently accepted protective levels. To understand the precise timing of the infections resulting in such blips, we performed plasma viral sequencing on monkeys that were serially challenged with genetically barcoded SIV after bNAb administration. These analyses showed that subclinical infections occurred in most animals that were given potent bNAb prophylaxis. These subclinical infections occurred while antibody concentrations were 2- to 400-fold higher than the levels required to prevent fully viremic breakthrough infection. This study demonstrates that immunoprophylaxis can mask subclinical infections, which may affect the interpretation of prophylactic HIV-1 bNAb clinical trials.

 Recent discoveries from time-domain surveys are defying our expectations for how matter accretes onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The increased rate of short-timescale, repetitive events around SMBHs, including the recently discovered quasi-periodic eruptions1–5, are garnering further interest in stellar-mass companions around SMBHs and the progenitors to millihertz-frequency gravitational-wave events. Here we report the discovery of a highly significant millihertz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in an actively accreting SMBH, 1ES 1927+654, which underwent a major optical, ultraviolet and X-ray outburst beginning in 20186,7. The QPO was detected in 2022 with a roughly 18-minute period, corresponding to coherent motion on a scale of less than 10 gravitational radii, much closer to the SMBH than typical quasi-periodic eruptions. The period decreased to 7.1 minutes over 2 years with a decelerating period evolution (

             greater than zero). To our knowledge, this evolution has never been seen in SMBH QPOs or high-frequency QPOs in stellar-mass black holes. Models invoking orbital decay of a stellar-mass companion struggle to explain the period evolution without stable mass transfer to offset angular-momentum losses, and the lack of a direct analogue to stellar-mass black-hole QPOs means that many instability models cannot explain all of the observed properties of the QPO in 1ES 1927+654. Future X-ray monitoring will test these models, and if it is a stellar-mass orbiter, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) should detect its low-frequency gravitational-wave emission. A millihertz frequency X-ray quasi-periodic oscillation has been observed near the innermost orbit of an actively accreting supermassive black hole and its frequency has evolved significantly over 2 years, a phenomenon that is difficult to explain with existing models."

 When emotions occur in groups, they sometimes impact group behavior in undesired ways. Reducing group’s emotions with emotion regulation interventions can be helpful, but may also be a challenge, because treating every person in the group is often infeasible. One solution is to treat a fraction of a group, and then hope the effect of the treatment will spread to other group members. To test the viability of this option, we designed an experiment to examine the impact of emotion regulation applied to different proportions of groups of six Israeli participants (N = 2659) who shared real-time responses to negative emotions-inducing political stimuli. Before interacting with each other, we treated different proportions of each group with an emotion regulation intervention called cognitive reappraisal, which involved teaching participants to reinterpret events to reduce negative emotions. The results showed that as the proportion of participants who received the treatment increased, there was a reduction in emotions within the non-treated participants. Furthermore, targeting above 40% of participants resulted in reliable group emotional change. Using semantic projection analysis, we validated the contagion of reappraisal language. These findings shed light on the conditions that enable collective emotion regulation. Here the authors show that an emotion regulation intervention for reducing negative intergroup emotions in conflicts can decrease negative emotions not only in treated participants but also in nontreated participants through emotion regulation contagion."

 The lysosome-targeting chimera (LYTAC) strategy provided a very powerful tool for the degradation of membrane proteins. However, the synthesis of LYTACs, antibody-small molecule conjugates, is challenging. The ability of antibody-based LYTACs to penetrate solid tumor is limited as well, especially to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Here, we propose a covalent chimeric peptide-based targeted degradation platform (Pep-TACs) by introducing a long flexible aryl sulfonyl fluoride group, which allows proximity-enabled cross-linking upon binding with the protein of interest. The Pep-TACs platform facilitates the degradation of target proteins through the mechanism of recycling transferrin receptor (TFRC)-mediated lysosomal targeted endocytosis. Biological experiments demonstrate that covalent Pep-TACs can significantly degrade the expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells, dendritic cells and macrophages, especially under acidic conditions, and markedly enhance the function of T cells and tumor phagocytosis by macrophages. Furthermore, both in anti-PD-1-responsive and -resistant tumor models, the Pep-TACs exert significant anti-tumor immune response. It is noteworthy that Pep-TACs can cross the BBB and prolong the survival of mice with in situ brain tumor. As a proof-of-concept, this study introduces a modular TFRC-based covalent peptide degradation platform for the degradation of membrane protein, and especially for the immunotherapy of brain tumors. LYTAC strategies often face challenges in solid tumor penetration and synthesis.

 Soft porous crystals, recognized as the third generation of smart porous materials, can undergo structural deformations in response to external stimuli, such as temperature, pressure, and guest molecules. Currently, the dynamic phase transformations of soft porous crystals are predominantly determined through quantitative modeling based on gas adsorption and powder X-ray diffraction. Herein, we investigate the single-crystal-to-single-crystal structural transformation of covalent organic soft porous crystal modeled on COF-300 and identified nine distinct conformational isomers induced by different guest molecules at room and high temperatures. Notably, COF-300 can maintain its single-crystal structure even at 280 °C and efficiently absorbs polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in their molten state. The kinetics of structural transformations among conformational isomers are investigated by combining PXRD and theoretical calculations. The structural transformation from a high-energy state to a low-energy state is a rapid, energetically favorable process, while the reverse transformation is a slow process driven by concentration gradients.

Here, authors show that loss of Brd7 promotes an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that drives breast cancer metastatic reawakening from dormancy in the lung. 
 Metastasis in cancer is influenced by epigenetic factors. Using an in vivo screen, we demonstrate that several subunits of the polybromo-associated BAF (PBAF) chromatin remodeling complex, particularly Brd7, are required for maintaining breast cancer metastatic dormancy in the lungs of female mice. Brd7 loss induces metastatic reawakening, along with modifications in epigenomic landscapes and upregulated oncogenic signaling. Breast cancer cells harboring Brd7 inactivation also reprogram the surrounding immune microenvironment by downregulating MHC-1 expression and promoting a pro-metastatic cytokine profile. Flow cytometric and single-cell analyses reveal increased levels of pro-tumorigenic inflammatory and transitional neutrophils, CD8+ exhausted T cells, and CD4+ stress response T cells in lungs from female mice harboring Brd7-deficient metastases. Finally, attenuating this immunosuppressive milieu by neutrophil depletion, neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) inhibition, or immune checkpoint therapy abrogates metastatic outgrowth. These findings implicate Brd7 and PBAF in triggering metastatic outgrowth in cancer, pointing to targetable underlying mechanisms involving specific immune cell compartments.

 Over the period 1979-2022, European surface air temperatures warmed around three times as fast as the global mean temperatures in both winter and summer. Here we define “excess” European warming as the difference between the rate of European regional warming and the rate of global warming and investigate the causes. Using a simple observation-based method, we estimate that around 40% ± 39% (in winter) and 29% ± 10% (in summer) of excess European warming is “dynamical” - attributable to changes in atmospheric circulation. We show that the rate of European warming simulated in CMIP6 models compares well with the observations, but only because these models warm too fast in the global mean; excess European warming is underestimated, particularly in winter. The CMIP6 models simulate well the magnitude of the thermodynamic component of excess European warming since 1979 in both winter and summer, they suggest only a weak dynamical contribution in the multi-model mean. The models suggest greenhouse gas-induced warming made the largest contribution to excess thermodynamic warming in winter, whereas changes in anthropogenic aerosols made the largest contribution in summer. They also imply a substantially reduced future rate of excess European warming in summer. However, the failure of current models to simulate observed circulation trends (either as a forced response or as a combination of forced response and internal variability) also implies large uncertainty in future rates of European warming."

 The influence of the thermodynamic forcing of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) on the Asian summer monsoon remains controversial because the role of elevated heating across the TP remains unclear at multiple time scales. At the extended-range scale, the boundary forcing is more important than the initial field in the forecast process. In this study, we investigated the role of subdaily thermodynamic forcing across the TP in generating 30-day predictions of precipitation in East Asia by conducting a series of hindcast experiments. The surface potential vorticity forcing was used to identify typical years when the TP forcings were extremely strong or weak. The results indicated that the subdaily thermal forcing of the TP was very important for improving the East Asian precipitation forecast accuracy, especially for predictions longer than 14 days in June 2022, when diffusion heating is very strong and can develop over the TP. In such a case, the corrected TP heating could not only correct for low-level water vapor transport but also modular uplevel circulation, which could propagate downstream, thus favoring the correct prediction of precipitation over East Asia. However, in the other cases, the individual influences of thermal perturbations across the TP are not the only important factors. These findings reveal ways to improve the extended-range forecast skill over East Asia."

 A mysterious air pollution event occurred in south China on April 1–2, 2024, despite the prevailing southerly airflow that is typically associated with clean air. Here, we identified the source of this event using a multi-scale data system that combines large-scale monitoring and modeling data with advanced measurements of aerosol chemical compositions in Hong Kong. Large-scale satellite measurements and chemical transport modeling detected the transboundary transport of a volcanic plume originating from the Taal volcano in the Philippines. Unusually high levels of sulfate (reaching 75% of fine particulate matter) and phosphorus (up to 93 ng/m³) in Hong Kong supported this finding. These analyses prompted the development of a real-time chemical-wind index to identify the occurrence of air pollution associated with volcanic emissions. Our results highlight the value of integrating multi-scale real-time data capabilities to promptly attribute air pollution events to their sources and protect at-risk populations.

 Understanding the behavior of large earthquakes over multiple seismic cycles is limited by short time spans of observations compared to recurrence intervals. Most of large instrumentally-recorded earthquakes have occurred on faults lacking well-documented histories of past events. The 2023 Mw 7.8–7.7 Kahramanmaraş earthquake doublet is exceptional as it ruptured multiple segments of the East Anatolian Fault (EAF) system, where historical records of devastating earthquakes span over two millennia. Here, we use historical earthquake records, measurements of interseismic deformation, and published slip models of the 2023 events to evaluate the recurrence patterns of large earthquakes. We compare slip deficit that accrued on each fault segment since the respective penultimate events to the average coseismic slip of the 2023 doublet. We find that the coseismic slip equaled to or exceeded the accumulated slip deficit, suggesting that the slip-predictable recurrence model applies as a lower bound on strain release during the Kahramanmaraş earthquakes.

 The rapid and large-scale invasion of Spartina alterniflora has led to extensive biodiversity loss and the degradation of essential ecosystem services, particularly in mangroves. Recent studies have shown that the landscape pattern of mangroves is a key indicator of whether Spartina alterniflora can successfully invade. Therefore, assessing the risk of S. alterniflora invasion from the perspective of mangrove landscape patterns is crucial. This study utilizes drone imagery to extract the spatial distribution of mangroves and S. alterniflora in the Jiulong Estuary. Using an interpretable machine learning model, the relationship between mangrove landscape patterns and S. alterniflora coverage was studied at three plot sizes (10 m, 20 m, 30 m). The results show that: (1) The interpretable machine learning model constructed based on UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) big data can assess S. alterniflora coverage through mangrove landscape patterns. The validation set achieved good results with Adjusted R2 (>0.974), MAE (Mean Absolute Error) (<4.8), and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) (<7) across the three plot sizes, though the SMAPE (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error) indicator was relatively poor (>20 %). (2) At all three plot sizes, mangrove coverage, mangrove tree height, average patch perimeter, patch density, landscape shape index, and edge density significantly impacted the suppression of S. alterniflora coverage by mangroves. However, the relative importance of these indicators changes with increasing spatial granularity. (3) The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) Value of the model revealed the nonlinear response of S. alterniflora coverage to changes in mangrove coverage: mangrove coverage inhibits S. alterniflora growth between 41 %–64 %, and completely suppresses it above 65 %. This study effectively assesses the extent of mangrove invasion by S. alterniflora and provides clear spatial evidence of the threshold for mangrove coverage to suppress S. alterniflora growth. It emphasizes that rationally regulating mangrove distribution through landscape indices will more effectively resist the invasion of S. alterniflora."

 Optical remote sensing of soil and vegetation moisture index is widely recognized as a vital indicator for monitoring soil moisture and drought stress. Nevertheless, the traditional soil and vegetation moisture index does not adequately capture enough higher-order relations between spectral channels, leading to limited sensitivity to soil moisture variations in certain value ranges and difficulties in reconciling discrepancies in soil moisture numerical distribution across temporal and spatial scales. In this paper, based on the concept of kernel method, a new soil and vegetation moisture index, Kernel Normalized Difference Moisture Index (kNDMI), was formulated to capture more spectral channel information. Global kNDMI were calculated using MODIS spectral reflectance product. The effectiveness of kNDMI in responding to moisture and drought was evaluated using the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) dataset, the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) dataset, and meteorological reanalysis data. Results demonstrated that: 1) The kNDMI significantly outperforms traditional remote sensing moisture indices in global soil moisture monitoring on the temporal scale, particularly in monitoring SMAP soil moisture dataset. The performance improvement of kNDMI compared to the best traditional index ranges from 107.1 % to 127.8 %, with the most notable advantages observed in mid-to-high latitude regions and areas with moderate vegetation cover, such as croplands, shrublands, and grasslands. 2) The average spatial correlation between kNDMI and CCI soil moisture exceeds that of the best traditional moisture index, Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII SWIR3-based), by approximately 0.02 to 0.04. However, kNDMI's performance in capturing SMAP's spatial distribution is slightly inferior to that of NDII (SWIR3-based). 3) kNDMI proves to be more effective than traditional moisture indices in monitoring short-term meteorological droughts on 1- to 3-months scale. Furthermore, kNDMI significantly outperforms traditional indices in soil drought monitoring, showing an improvement range of 59.09 % to 169.37 %. 4) The optimal sigma parameter for kNDMI on the temporal scale exhibits adaptive characteristics related to the dryness of the pixels; the drier the pixel, the more its numerical distribution resembles a smoother Gaussian Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. The maximum parameter setting method, which combines the advantages of both adaptive and fixed parameters, yields the best performance in the kNDMI tuning process on global scale."

 Gross primary productivity (GPP) is more accurately estimated by total canopy solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIFtotal) compared to raw sensor observed SIF signals (SIFobs). The use of two-leaf strategy, which distinguishes between SIF from sunlit (SIFsunlit) and shaded (SIFshaded) leaves, further improves GPP estimates. However, the two-leaf strategy, along with SIF corrections for bidirectional effects, has not been applied to transpiration (T) estimation. In this study, we used the angular normalization method to correct the bidirectional effects and separate SIFsunlit and SIFshaded. Then we developed SIFsunlit and SIFshaded driven semi-mechanistic and hybrid models, comparing their T estimates with those from a SIFobs driven semi-mechanistic model at both site and global scales. All three types of SIF-driven T models integrate canopy conductance (gc) with the Penman-Monteith model, differing in how gc is derived: from a SIFobs driven semi-mechanistic equation, a SIFsunlit and SIFshaded driven semi-mechanistic equation, and a SIFsunlit and SIFshaded driven machine learning model. When evaluated against partitioned T using the underlying water use efficiency method at 72 eddy covariance sites and two global T remote sensing products, a consistent pattern emerged: SIFsunlit and SIFshaded driven hybrid model > SIFsunlit and SIFshaded driven semi-mechanistic model > SIFobs driven semi-mechanistic model. The SIFsunlit and SIFshaded driven hybrid model demonstrated a notable proficiency under high vapor pressure deficit and low soil water content conditions. The SIFobs driven semi-mechanistic model tends overestimate T at low T values, and this issue is significantly alleviated by the SIFsunlit and SIFshaded driven semi-mechanistic and hybrid models. Our findings demonstrate that correcting the bidirectional effects and using the two-leaf strategy on GPP estimation can improve T estimation and provide a new global T product incorporating vegetation physiological signal."

 The availability of high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery has facilitated forestry attribute estimation at the individual tree level. However, producing accurate tree crown delineations for practical applications remains challenging, particularly in mixed forests with overlapping tree crowns. In this study, we propose an individual tree crown delineation method leveraging the StarDist model to improve the delineation accuracy in mixed forests. The StarDist model captures tree crown shapes uniquely through star-convex polygons, which are predicted by the U-Net architecture. The final tree crowns are determined by applying non-maximum suppression (NMS) to all identified star-convex polygons. Performance evaluation on two mixed forest areas reveals a delineation accuracy exceeding 92%, notably outperforming the widely used deep learning model MASK R-CNN by over 6%. In terms of tree crown areas estimation, the R2 for both testing areas is higher than 0.85 for both testing areas. Moreover, the evaluations on precision, recall, and F1-score demonstrate that the proposed model can generate tree crowns fitting well with the true crowns. This study marks the first utilization of the StarDist model for tree crown delineation in mixed forests. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the StarDist model for accurately delineating individual tree crowns, thereby advancing the field of forestry research."

 Land surface phenology (LSP) metrics derived from remote sensing are widely used to monitor vegetation phenology over large areas and to characterize how the growing seasons of terrestrial ecosystems are responding to climate change. Until recently, however, most LSP studies relied on coarse spatial resolution sensors, which makes assigning direct linkages between LSP metrics and ecological processes and properties challenging due to scale mismatches and because substantial variation in phenology and ecological properties are often present at sub-pixel scale in coarse resolution LSP metrics. In this study, we leverage publicly available LSP data products with three orders of magnitude difference in spatial resolution derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, 500 m), Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS, 30 m), and PlanetScope (3 m) imagery to examine and characterize the nature, magnitude, and sources of the agreement and disagreement in LSP metrics across spatial scales. Our results provide three key conclusions: (1) LSP metrics from three sensors showed consistently high cross-scalar agreement across sites (r2 = 0.70–0.97), suggesting that they all effectively capture geographic variation in LSP; (2) within-site cross-scalar agreement between LSP metrics was systematically lower relative to agreement across sites, but mean absolute differences were consistent across and within sites (generally <14 days for day of year-based metrics, with a few exceptions); and (3) local-scale composition and heterogeneity in land cover is a key factor that controls cross-scalar agreement in LSP metrics. In particular, we found that site-level heterogeneity in land cover (measured via entropy) and the proportion of evergreen versus deciduous land cover types explain up to half of site-to-site variance in local-scale cross-scalar agreement in LSP metrics. Results from this study support the internal consistency and quality of the three LSP data products examined, and more generally, provide guidance regarding the choice of spatial resolution for different applications and land cover conditions, and yield new insights related to how LSP observations scale across different sensors and spatial resolutions."

 Cloud top and base height (CTH and CBH) are essential in understanding the role of clouds on the weather and climate systems and improving radiation and precipitation simulations. However, inferring accurate cloud heights from passive satellite observations remains more challenging, especially for CBH. This study developed an effective and convenient method for estimating cloud heights for different cloud types on a global scale. The method is based on the mean lapse rate from surface to cloud top (Γct), the lapse rate within (Γcb1) and below cloud (Γcb2), which are calculated from collocated active and passive satellite observations. The CTH and CBH can be easily derived based on cloud top temperature (CTT), surface temperature (ST), surface height (SH), Γct, Γcb1 and Γcb2. The lapse rate method was applied to polar-orbiting and geostationary passive satellites and the performances were evaluated using cloud heights measurements from CloudSat and CALIPSO satellite. Overall, our retrieval results can achieve high accuracy and stability in estimating both CTH and CBH. For example, our CTH results have significantly improved the retrieval accuracy, with mean bias error (MBE) is 0 km and R is 0.96, and the absolute bias error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) are reduced from 1.12 km and 1.72 km to 0.85 km and 1.33 km, respectively, compared with the MODIS CTH product. Our CBH retrieval results based on MODIS CTT and ST also agree well with CloudSat and CALIPSO observations, the R is 0.91 and the MAE, MBE and RMSE are 0.73 km, 0 km and 1.26 km, respectively. The cloud geometric thickness derived from the cloud heights retrieval results also agrees well with the active satellite observations (MAE = 0.97 km, MBE = 0 km, RMSE = 1.44 km and R = 0.91). In addition, the good performance of cloud heights retrieval during night and for geostationary satellites can further illustrate the excellent accuracy and strong applicability of the lapse rate method. Specifically, compared with SatCORPS Himawari-8 product, the MAE and RMSE of CTH (CBH) are reduced by 41.5 % (44.2 %) and 39.4 % (36.6 %), respectively. These statistical results confirm that our method has comparable performance to other algorithms (e.g., machine learning and other empirical methods), in the meantime, exhibiting the advantages of simplicity and less input parameters. In addition, the lapse rate method can also be employed to provide a supplemental criterion on determining cloud layers from radiosonde data."

 With the increasing influence of climate and socio-economic changes, crown fires are becoming the main concern of fire managers and civil protection authorities in Europe. Evaluating and mitigating the negative impacts of these fires requires better tools to identify high-risk areas. Prevention and management strategies for crown fires require accurate and cost-effective tools that can parameterise fuel properties. Here, we use a multi-sensor approach integrating satellite Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) observations from the Global Ecosystems Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) sensor, with other remote sensing imagery and biophysical variables to provide spatially-explicit estimates of two key descriptors of crown fire behaviour – canopy fuel load (CFL) and canopy bulk density (CBD) – over the entire European territory at 1 km2 grid resolution.GEDI L1B and L2A level footprints were used to estimate Leaf Area Density, from which CFL and CBD were subsequently derived. The approach was assessed by applying it to regions of the United States, where bioclimatic conditions are similar to those in Europe, and for which LANDFIRE CBD maps are available (CBD r = 0.6–0.86 and RMSE = 33.1–59.6 %). We then extrapolated the estimates to European areas not covered by GEDI using machine learning models with multispectral (Landsat 8) and radar (Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar sensor – PALSAR) imagery, and biophysical variables (CFL r = 0.85 and RMSE = 12.98 %; CBD r = 0.75 and RMSE = 21 %). Pixel-level uncertainty for the spatial extrapolation was also estimated.The new wall-to-wall maps of crown fuel properties (https://doi.org/10.21950/Z6BWQG) provide new insights into the potential for fire risk prevention in Europe, which together with climate and socio-economic models, would greatly improve the prioritisation of management areas and the targeting of mitigation measures in strategic areas to reduce wildfire risk."

 The learning-based integration of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imagery is known to be effective in promoting the accuracy of wetland land-cover classification. However, the distribution of wetland categories is characterized as spatially heterogeneous and highly dynamic. It remains a challenge to fuse the inherent characteristics of optical and SAR data by exploiting their discriminative feature representations for delineating wetland landscapes. To fully integrate the complementary information among optical and SAR data, a dual-branch deep network is proposed for mapping hierarchical wetland characteristics, which is referred to as HiWet-DBNet. Within the network, two parallel branches are designed to collaboratively learn the spatial, spectral or polarized, and temporal dependencies in the optical image and SAR image time series, respectively. Inspired by the relationships of deep and shallow features, the intra-layer features are fused across the branches to generate the multi-level wetland mapping results (i.e., general wetland land cover, and wetland vegetation types). The proposed method was tested on the Poyang Lake wetland in China using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery. The evaluation results show that the overall accuracy of HiWet-DBNet reaches 88.51% and 88.61% in the dry and wet seasons, which is superior to the other solutions with only a single data source or insufficient fusion of multi-modal features.

 Urban shrinkage has become a critical global issue, influencing the sustainable development of cities across social, economic, and environmental dimensions. In Japan, which is characterized by an aging population and low birth rate, this phenomenon has now extended to metropolitan areas, presenting new challenges for urban sustainability. Although many studies have been conducted regarding urban decline in rural regions, the shrinkage dynamics within Japan’s major cities are poorly understood. Addressing this knowledge gap is crucial for devising targeted urban-planning strategies that ensure the long-term viability of urban areas. Here, we integrated Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership–Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite nighttime light data with WorldPop population data to examine the patterns of urban shrinkage from 2012 to 2020 in Japan’s four largest metropolitan areas: Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, and Fukuoka. Using Theil–Sen median trend analysis and K-means clustering, we developed a method to quantify both shrinking and growing areas within these regions. It was found that Tokyo exhibited the highest urban vitality, with minimal shrinkage, whereas Nagoya and Osaka faced greater declines.

 Understanding dynamics of urban land-use is crucial for comprehending urban spaces and evaluating planning strategies. A range of data-driven models based on the representation learning of multiple data sources have focused on extracting spatially explicit characteristics at the feature level for urban function inference. However, they commonly pay no attention to the systematic relationships between urban land-use and transportation as the core components of urban systems. Consequently, while performing relatively well in urban land-use recognition, these models cannot transfer across various urban tasks and have almost no generalizability in integrated urban modeling. Guided by the theory of integrated land-use and transport modeling, this study proposes a multi-modal deep learning model to leverage the systematic relationships between urban components. First, spaces of urban places, urban forms, urban flows, and urban locations are conceptualized from the interactions between land use and transportation systems and represented by multi-source heterogeneous spatial features. Second, to account for both direct and indirect interactions in these spaces, a Deep & Wide network is introduced to fuse different modalities of spatial features. Using Shenzhen city as a testbed, extensive experimental results show that our approach improves accuracy by 13.3% compared to state-of-the-art models. We further validate the superior generalizability of our approach across various urban tasks, such as predicting urban land-use, housing prices, and population density, over other baselines. Enabling such a doubly-informed framework of urban theory and AI, this study provides a pilot demonstration for the new scientific paradigm of AI for Urban Science and Modeling."

 Influenced by lockdown policies and anomalies in human activities, emergencies such as pandemic significantly altered the urban thermal environment. However, the spatiotemporal heat anomaly changes across and within cities during emergencies and their drivers have not been fully investigated. This study quantified the changes in the urban thermal environment in China before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on z-scores and multiscale geographically weighted regression models, heat anomaly changes and transfer patterns of different land uses in cities with varying degrees of pandemic impact and drivers were estimated. During the entire year, we found that although the pandemic significantly reduced surface urban heat island intensity during 5 % to 35 % of days, it did not change significantly throughout 2020. During the first-level public health emergency response, the land surface temperatures of residential and commercial lands notably affected by the pandemic decreased by −0.195°C and −0.371°C, and the shifting of strong heat anomaly zones in industrial lands increased heat anomaly and no heat anomaly zones by 6.1 % and 1.4 %, respectively. Furthermore, thermal anomalies were highly correlated with changes in biophysical parameters during the pandemic.

 Extracting and analyzing water resources in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is crucial for flood management and environmental resource planning due to the ability to monitor ground all-weather and all-time. However, extracting water entirely from high-resolution SAR images in diverse scenarios is challenging due to variable water shapes, many low-intensity land covers similar to water, and scarce labels. In this article, a BackScatter-Guided Weakly Supervised Learning (BSG-WSL) framework based on image-level labels is proposed for water extraction with the requirement of high generalization and low labeling. In BSG-WSL, a BackScatter-Guided Network (BSGNet) is proposed, where the backscatter information of water is used to guide the feature extraction process, yielding precise Class Attention Maps (CAMs) of water. Then, a morphological pseudo-label optimization algorithm is designed to employ CAMs to generate high-quality pseudo-labels. Finally, a confidence cross-entropy loss is introduced to utilize pseudo-labels to train the extraction model and achieve precise water extraction in different scenarios. Experiments on three datasets of SAR images from the GF-3 and Sentinel-1B satellites verify that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other weakly supervised methods based on image-level annotations."

 Global warming has accelerated glacier retreat, subsequently leading to the formation of glacial lakes in high-altitude mountainous regions. These lakes represent emerging ecological water systems and could potentially pose significant hazards. Observations of these systems are constrained by their remote locations and the lack of cost-effective monitoring methods, resulting in limited understanding of their dynamics. In this study, we synchronized surveillance monitoring with in-situ water quality measurements at a typical high-altitude glacial lake on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. We aim to use images from surveillance cameras to estimate the turbidity parameter, a key indicator of changes in the water environment and the impacts of climate change on high-altitude ecosystems. We segmented RGB images and applied regression modeling with field-measured water turbidity data, and then used deep learning models to accurately estimates turbidity levels and their changes. Our study demonstrates the potential of RGB imagery and deep learning for the long-term, continuous, and high-resolution monitoring of water quality in remote glacial lakes.

 Drought-induced tree mortality has increasingly expanded worldwide under the influence of climate warming, with China’s Loess Plateau (CLP) emerging as a critical hotspot for such impacts. As one of the most active tree-planting regions globally, the CLP primarily aims to achieve soil and water conservation despite facing challenges such as limited rainfall and frequent extreme drought events. However, accurate identification of standing dead trees (SDTs) within plantations using remote sensing techniques remains underexplored, and the spatial distribution patterns of SDTs across the CLP are poorly understood. Therefore, this study leveraged unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing to capture high-resolution RGB images of Robinia pseudoacacia plantations. These images were then integrated with a comprehensive evaluation of multiple detection algorithms, including Faster R-CNN, EfficientDet, YOLOv4, YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and a novel model, YOLOv9-ECA. Particularly, the YOLOv9-ECA was developed by incorporating the ECA module into key network layers to enhance channel dependency modeling and improve feature representation for SDTs detection. Its merit lies in adaptively reweighting feature channels, enabling efficient detection in resource-constrained environments. As expected, the YOLOv9-ECA model demonstrated significant advancements, achieving a detection speed of 123.5f/s, a mAP of 97.8%, and an F1 score of 0.97, outperforming other models in both detection efficiency and accuracy. Subsequently, the model was employed to quantify the spatial distribution of SDTs across the CLP by estimating the number of dead trees per unit area. Results revealed an increasing trend in the number of dead trees per unit along decreasing precipitation gradients, emphasizing the vulnerability of Robinia pseudoacacia plantations in drier regions. Additionally, the number of dead trees per unit varied with slope aspect, with sunny slopes exhibiting the highest values and shady slopes the lowest. This study highlights the potential of YOLOv9-ECA as a powerful tool for the efficient detection of SDTs, offering insights for the sustainable management of Robinia pseudoacacia plantations on the CLP and holding potential applicability to similar environments globally."

However, the scarcity and uneven distribution of urban measurement samples pose significant challenges to accurately estimating UTCH on a large scale in complex urban environments. To address this issue, this study utilized ICESat-2 photon spot height data as reference samples, in conjunction with high-resolution GF-2 remote sensing data, to estimate UTCH. To achieve UTCH mapping at a resolution of 4 m, a synergistic model integrating data from the GF-2 and ICESat-2 grid-based canopy height was constructed using the Random Forest technique. The model’s performance was evaluated using 111 urban tree canopy height samples collected across different urban areas. The experimental results demonstrated a moderate correlation between estimated and actual canopy heights, with a coefficient of determination (R) = 0.53, root mean square error (RMSE) = 2.9 m, and mean absolute error (MAE) = 2.04 m. Texture information, the red band, and MNDVI are key indicators for determining UTCH, with contribution percentages of 25.29 %, 13.7 %, and 25.75 %, respectively.

 Understanding the sources and formation processes of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is crucial for improving urban air quality and public health. This study provides a real-time analysis of PM2.5-bound water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) and related carbonaceous species during winter, spring, and summer periods in 2023–2024, aiming to identify their major sources in central Los Angeles. Using advanced online monitoring equipment, including a Sunset Laboratory EC/OC analyzer and a custom-developed setup including a total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer coupled with a particle collection system, we obtained hourly measurements of organic carbon (OC), its fractions (OC1-OC4, based on volatility), elemental carbon (EC), and WSOC. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) identified three principal PM2.5 sources: vehicular emissions, secondary organic carbon (SOC) formation influenced by nighttime aqueous-phase chemical processes, and SOC formation driven by daytime photochemical reactions. Vehicular emissions dominated EC levels, accounting for 86–95% across seasons. This factor also had high contributions from nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) (75–82%), vehicle counts (approximately 85%), and OC1 (51–83%), reflecting the persistent influence of traffic emissions. Nighttime SOC formation was significant in winter, with WSOC and OC4 contributing 58% and 40% to this factor. In contrast, daytime photochemical SOC formation was prominent in summer, with WSOC and OC4 contributing 63% and 47%, and ozone loading up to 89%, reflecting increased photochemical activity. Spring exhibited a mix of aqueous and photochemical SOC formation, with similar contributions from WSOC (38-35%) and OC4 (35-33%), reflecting the transitional season's mixed SOC formation mechanisms. Diurnal profiles revealed that primary emissions peaked during morning rush hours, while secondary formation processes elevated OC levels at night in winter and during afternoons in summer. The EC tracer method corroborated these findings by estimating primary and secondary organic carbon levels, highlighting significant seasonal and diurnal variations in carbonaceous aerosols. These results emphasize the need for targeted strategies addressing both primary emissions and the precursors of secondary aerosol formation, to improve air quality in Los Angeles."

 The aerosol fine mode fraction (FMF), which quantitatively describes the fine mode aerosol optical depth (FAOD) as a proportion of the total AOD, is difficult to obtain through remote sensing retrieval. The Chinese advanced Particulate Observing Scanning Polarimeter (POSP) can achieve multispectral polarimetric observation from ultraviolet (UV) to short-wave infrared (SWIR), making it sensitive to aerosol particle size and expected to enhance the capability of FMF retrieval. In this paper, an FMF retrieval model based on an ensemble neural network (ENN) is proposed, which fully exploits the relationship between multi-spectrally polarimetric data of POSP and FMF parameter, and realizes the high-precision as well as spatiotemporal continuous FMF retrieval. The validation shows that the retrieved FMF is in high agreement with AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) FMF, and the retrieval accuracy increases as AOD increase. By analyzing the importance of the input parameters, it is found that the polarimetric measurement at 865 nm is the most important for FMF retrieval, and the average importance of the polarimetric measurement is the highest. By comparing the global seasonal FMF and FAOD for 2022, as well as cases of forest fires and dust, it can be observed that POSP FMF accurately captures the distribution of fine and coarse aerosol particles, aligning well with real-world conditions. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in FMF retrieval."

 Historical air pollutants data are essential for assessing health effects of air pollution exposure across the life course or early life. In the United Kingdom (UK), a lack of high-quality data sources, including emission data, has resulted in limited research on historical air pollution exposure and the health effects. This study aimed to address this gap by developing Weather Research and Forecast (WRF)- Community Multiscale Air Quality modeling system (CMAQ) for particulate matters (PM), gaseous pollutants, and chemical compositions of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at an annual level and 10 km resolution. The root mean squared error (RMSE) (normalized mean bias, NMB) between predictions from models and measurements from monitoring stations in 2010 was 4.09 (−0.10) for PM2.5, 6.34 (−0.22) for PM10, 17.49 (−0.24) for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), 4.02 (0.13) for sulfur dioxide (SO2), and 9.2 (0.11) for ozone (O3) at annual level, and the predicting accuracy was consistent at annual level. The WRF-CMAQ could capture spatiotemporal patterns of the air pollutants. High concentrations of particulate matters and gaseous pollutants, except for ozone, tended to occur in UK densely populated cities such as Greater London. The Humber River estuary and the Mersey River port area had higher concentrations of SO2. O3 showed a geographical distribution that was higher in rural areas and lower in urban areas. The annual changes showed most of the areas of UK experienced a reduction of air pollution since 1990, with the exception of O3 concentrations. Therefore, this research model could provide high-quality historical exposure data on air pollution, supporting future epidemiological studies on the impact of air pollution on the life course health effects in the UK."

 Estimation of the smoke emissions released by wildfires has become a significant concern in the context of atmospheric environment and global climate change, in which satellite-borne optical remote sensing plays an important role. Previous studies have utilized the satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) algorithm to estimate the wildfire-related total particulate matter emissions (TPM). However, this “top-down” approach is often impeded by false or missed detection due to extensive cloud cover and smokes with high concentrations, resulting in an underestimation of TPM. To address these limitations, this study proposes a new ultraviolet (UV)-based methodology for the identification and quantification of wildfire smokes from satellite platforms. The spectral characteristics of smoke plumes and different cloud types, including cirrus and cumulus clouds, are characterized by China's Haiyang-1C/D (HY-1C/D) satellites within both UV and visible wavelengths. Specifically, the 355 nm UV band displays a strong absorption pattern associated with smoke plumes. Based on this diagnostic spectral feature, an ultraviolet smoke index (UVSI) is developed, which can mitigate the impact of high background heterogeneity. Moreover, in comparison with the MODIS AOD algorithm, the UVSI index can not only improve the precision of smoke detection, especially for smokes with high concentrations, but also demonstrate a strong correlation with AOD at the numerical level. Accordingly, this study proposes the use of UVSI in place of AOD for TPM estimation. Combined with the fire radiative energy (FRE) measured by GOES-R satellite, the smoke emission coefficient (Ce) can be determined, which is 34.37 g MJ−1 for the September 2020 burning season in North America.

10.1016/j.atmosenv.2025.121080,False,Atmospheric Environment,这篇研究论文主要关注的是个人通勤过程中接触细颗粒物（PM2.5）与炎症和氧化应激之间的关系。研究在COVID-19疫情前后三个阶段，招募了200名健康参与者，比较了不同通勤方式（地铁、电动车、步行）下PM2.5的暴露水平以及炎症和氧化应激指标（IL-6和8-OHdG）的变化。结果显示，电动车通勤者的PM2.5暴露水平最高，而地铁通勤者最低。疫情期间，由于强制佩戴口罩，地铁和步行通勤者PM2.5与健康指标之间的关联性减弱。该研究主要通过实地测量个人的PM2.5暴露水平以及生理指标来进行，并没有涉及到大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析等。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术关联性较弱。,"['PM2.5', 'air pollution', 'human health', 'inflammation', 'oxidative stress']",Yueh-Lun Lee;Kai-Jen Chuang;Gui-Bing Hong;Hua-Wei Chen;Hsiao-Chi Chuang;Wan Puteh Sharifa Ezat;I-Jung Liu,"Personal exposure to fine particles, inflammation and oxidative stress among commuters before, during and after COVID-19 outbreak in Taipei","•People are required to wear masks when commuting to work during COVID-19. •Commuters exposed to less fine particles by wearing masks during COVID-19. •Commuters experience less inflammation and oxidative stress by wearing masks during COVID-19. •Commuters using a scooter inhale higher levels of fine particles than walking or taking a subway. 
 The association between fine particles exposure and adverse health effects during commuting has been reported in previous studies. However, knowledge about whether wearing masks has a protective effect on commuters’ air pollution exposure and related health effect is still limited. Therefore, the present study recruited 200 healthy participants in Taipei before, during and after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. All participants were required by law to wear masks when going out during the COVID-19 epidemic. Each participant was classified by his/her own commuting style, including subway, scooter, and walking. Three repeated measurements of inflammation marker, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and oxidative stress marker, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in sputum and urine, particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5), temperature, and humidity were conducted for each participant during commuting. Mixed-effects models were used to investigate the association of PM2.5 with IL-6 or 8-OHdG in sputum or urine before, during and after the COVID-19 epidemic. The study results showed that personal PM2.5 exposure level (Mean ± standard deviation) was highest in the scooter group (52.1 ± 22.3 μg/m3) but lowest in the subway group (22.6 ± 9.7 μg/m3). Personal exposure to PM2.5 was associated with increased IL-6 or 8-OHdG in sputum or urine before and after the COVID-19 epidemic among all groups. The effect of PM2.5 on IL-6 or 8-OHdG in sputum or urine was not statistically significant in subway group or walking group during the COVID-19 epidemic. By naturally observing the phenomenon of commuters wearing masks before, during and after the COVID-19 epidemic, we suggest that wearing masks during commuting could be one of the preventive measures to reduce air pollution exposure."

 PM10 emission from livestock houses is a major contributor to the ambient PM10 mass concentrations in many industrialized countries. Measurement methods developed for stationary source PM10 emissions (e.g., EN 13284) are often unsuitable for application in livestock houses whereas methods for ambient air based on impaction pre-separators (e.g., EN 12341) are vulnerable to particle bouncing and overloading. In the past, a gravimetric reference method of EN 12341 (IPS) has been modified by incorporating a cyclone as pre-separator (CPS).The aim of this study was to investigate the equivalence of the modified version of the reference method used in livestock houses. Previous studies comparing the CPS and IPS reported a high variation in the relationship between these two samplers. This study examines the effect of different livestock categories on this relationship, as differences in particle size distributions associated with different livestock categories, are expected to influence the relationship between these two methods. Both CPS and IPS were applied in this study across multiple livestock houses of 3 livestock categories (fattening pigs, laying hens, broilers). Additionally, a meta-analysis was conducted, incorporating data from previous studies on gravimetric measurements of PM10, to establish a calibration function for measurements obtained using the CPS.This study concludes that the observed performance of the CPS is higher than the IPS in terms of between sampler uncertainty. Furthermore, the relationship between PM10 measurements with the IPS and CPS has been shown to be different for different livestock categories. The accuracy of CPS measurements relative to IPS measurements improves significantly when livestock category-specific calibration functions are applied, rather than using generic calibration functions. The necessity for livestock category-specific calibration of the CPS in relation to the IPS is also supported by the results of the meta-analysis."

 The study investigated the bioaerosol load and associated possible health risks at diverse macro-environments in the middle Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) region. The seasonal bioaerosol load investigations showed summer and monsoon seasons having higher concentrations than winter and post-monsoon seasons in outdoor environments. Besides meteorological factors (temperature and RH), the cytotoxic effect of PM2.5 was seen on ambient bioaerosol concentrations (R = −0.97, p < 0.05). This adverse effect of PM2.5 on bioaerosols was also validated in lab studies on model organism Escherichia coli. The results demonstrated bacteriostatic effects in used range of concentrations. Although lethal concentration (LC50) was not reached even at PM2.5 treatment of 80 μg/ml, a concentration-dependent inhibition of bacterial cell viability was observed.Furthermore, the health risk associated with bioaerosol exposure in the region was very high. The calculated hazard ratio was greater than one at all IGP locations, with very high potential of infection in polluted city center compared to pristine city outskirts. Higher hospital visits related to pulmonary infections by the people was reported in the city center compared to the city outskirts. The Gram-negative bacteria was found to be more closely associated with respiratory problems in the exposed population. The detailed investigations found pathogenic bacteria, particularly those associated with the genera Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, and Enterobacteriaceae, to be prominent in the ambient air. Simultaneously, seven fungal genera were identified, with Aspergillus and Penicillium being most prevalent in the region."

 The effects of temperature on the yield and composition of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formed from the oxidation of n-dodecane by Cl atoms under high-NO conditions were investigated. The SOA yields at 298 K, 288 K, and 278 K were 71.11%, 81.21%, and 98.73%, respectively, indicating that a decrease in temperature leads to an increase in SOA yield. The compositions of SOA were studied at 298 K and 278 K. At both temperatures, nitrogen-containing products were the main components. However, lower temperatures lead to the formation of more nitrogen-containing products, suggesting that lower temperatures accelerate multi-generational reactions. These results are crucial for assessing the formation and evolution of SOA in the atmosphere, especially under low temperature conditions, such as during the winter season. In addition, this study not only advances our understanding of Cl atoms as atmospheric oxidants, but also provides key parametric data for refining aerosol formation models, thereby deepening insights into the interaction between atmospheric pollution and climate change."

The experiments were performed in a 480L glass multipass reactor with in situ FT-IR detection. The main products identified and quantified includes (in molar yield %): succinic anhydride (68 ± 2), propanoic acid (25 ± 1), acetaldehyde (59 ± 1), formaldehyde (10 ± 1) and acetic anhydride (26 ± 2) in the Cl atoms with γ-caprolactone reaction. Meanwhile, butanoic acid (26 ± 1), succinic anhydride (70 ± 2), propanaldehyde (63 ± 1) and propanoic acid (11 ± 1) were identified and quantified for Cl atoms with γ-heptalactone reaction. In addition, a chemical mechanism has been proposed taking into account the identified and quantified products. The mechanistic provided by the identified products, reveals that the degradation mechanisms can proceed either through ring opening or oxidation pathways. In these sense, the opening path leads to the carboxylic acids formation and the oxidation forms succinic anhydride. The succinic anhydride quantification, as the major product in both reactions, suggests that the oxidation ring is the most relevant channel in the reactions studied. Considering that the identified acids and anhydrides are of atmospheric importance, due to their potential for acidification of the troposphere and the atmospheric implications have been discussed."

 We construct a continuous 24-h daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5) record with 2 × 2 km2 resolution over eastern China, South Korea, and Japan for 2011–2022 by applying a random forest (RF) algorithm to aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) I and II satellite instruments. This record uniquely covers a 12-year period of rapid change in air quality in East Asia. The RF uses PM2.5 observations from the national surface networks as training data. PM2.5 network data starting in 2015 in South Korea are extended to pre-2015 with a RF trained on other air quality data available from the network including PM10. PM2.5 network data starting in 2014 in China are supplemented by pre-2014 data from the US embassy and consulates. Missing AODs in the GOCI data are gap-filled by a separate RF fit. We show that the resulting GOCI PM2.5 dataset is successful in reproducing the surface network observations including extreme events, and that the network data in the different countries are representative of population-weighted exposure. We find that PM2.5 peaked in 2014 (China) and 2013 (South Korea, Japan), and has been decreasing steadily since those respective years with no region left behind. We quantify the population in each country exposed to annual PM2.5 in excess of national ambient air quality standards and how this exposure evolves with time. The long record for the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) shows a steady decrease from 2013 to 2022 that was not present in the first five years of AirKorea network PM2.5 measurements. Mapping of an extreme pollution event in Seoul with GOCI PM2.5 shows a predicted distribution indistinguishable from the dense urban network observations, while our previous 6 × 6 km2 product smoothed local features. Our product should be useful for public health studies where long-term spatial continuity of PM2.5 information is essential."

 The Ambient Ion Monitor-Ion Chromatography (AIM-IC) system has been widely used for simultaneously monitoring gases and particles in the continental atmosphere. However, its application in marine atmospheres still faces significant challenges. These challenges include dew evaporation on ship surfaces, wave-breaking effects, and emissions from on-ship activities such as seafood cooking, etc., which may result in the AIM-IC reporting artificially high concentrations of basic gases. Here, we report an unexpected but repeated high field blank in the measurement of sticky basic gases - NH3 and alkylamines - during cruises over the Northwest Pacific from 2021 to 2023. The high field blank was identified to be derived from the sampling tube and/or the AIM-IC system, rather than from leakage at sampling tube junctions. It was possibly introduced by emissions of ship combustion, loading activities in the container, and human activities within the cabin, etc., during the cruise campaigns. This issue is expected to occur widely in ship-based marine measurements of sticky basic gases, to varying extents, and restricts the use of the related data. To address this, we developed an approach to exhaustedly subtract the field blank, and the corrected concentrations of the species represent the lower limit of the real signal values. The field-blank-subtracted concentrations of atmospheric ammonia over the Northwest Pacific were 0.3 ± 0.3 μg m−3 in 2021, 0.4 ± 0.3 μg m−3 in 2022, 0.2 ± 0.3 μg m−3 in 2023.

A conventional relative-rate technique was used to determine the rate coefficient: k(OH+nerol)= (1.6 ± 0.2) x 10−10, in units of cm3 molecule−1s−1. The kinetic result is compared with the value estimated by the structure-reactivity relationship (SAR) method and with the experimental value reported in the literature for its isomer.

 The application of diverse methods/tools (satellite data, ground-based monitoring and dispersion modelling) for quantitative assessment of air pollution has created a critical challenge for policymakers, in understating the actual stubble burning contribution in North Indian states including Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and western Uttar Pradesh. Considering the variations in monitoring sites, quantified emissions, satellite data resolutions, parameterization schemes, meteorology and/or adopted models, huge differences in the source contribution are reported. Considering these ambiguities, the present study is an attempt to review the studies revealing actual paddy stubble burning contribution to air quality of Delhi conducted year 2015 onwards; one year before the severe episodic smog event of November 2016. A total of 114 articles were searched using different keywords for subsequent in-depth analysis. The biomass burning share was broadly studied for winter, summer and post-monsoon seasons. Further, to understand the season-specific nature of the paddy stubble burning activity, the analysis was restricted to post-monsoon months. A co-occurrence keyword network analysis was performed based on which biomass/stubble burning related studies were divided into three clusters based on i) source apportionment using receptor modeling, ii) satellite data (AOD values coupled with ground-based observation and wind back trajectory and, iii) regional scale chemical transport modeling approach. Some studies were generalized displaying correlation patterns, some used only fire count data and correlated with AOD while some used either satellite data or regional scale models. Learning from the gap analysis of the reviewed studies led to the development of an integrated assessment protocol to quantify the stubble-burning contribution in the region."

The increased PM concentrations in urban regions have degraded air quality with adverse health impacts. The low-cost sensor (LCS) has the advantage of being deployable in dense numbers for real-time PM measurements. The fine PM (PM2.5) concentrations were recorded at various sites across Jaipur city using LCS from March-2022 to February-2023. The LCS detects PM2.5 concentrations in outdoor ambient at high temporal resolution of 1-min (averaged hourly). The accuracy of LCS data was evaluated seasonally and coefficients of determination (R2) were found to have good agreement with 1:1 slope. The measured PM2.5 concentrations are dominantly influenced by site-specific activities like commercial, industrial, residential and traffic. The heterogeneity of PM2.5 concentrations between sites portrays high spatial divergence (coefficient of divergence >0.2). Pearson's correlation test was conducted to examine the association between PM2.5 concentration and wind speed. Higher wind showed negative correlation with average PM2.5 concentration due to dispersion of the particles. Seasonal analysis showed low correlation at upwind sites (outskirts (0.07–0.13)) compared to downwind locations (in-city (0.10–0.24) and outskirts (0.08–0.24)).

The daily averages of longwave radiative heating at the surface compensated for 34.2%, 39.0%, and 43.1% of shortwave cooling under light, moderate, and heavy dust conditions, respectively. The net radiative forcing efficiencies (NRFE) were −30.2, 42.5, and 12.3 W m−2 AOD−1 at the surface, in the atmosphere, and at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), respectively. The maximum shortwave heating rates (SHR) of dust aerosols below 500 m were 0.7, 1.1, and 2.1 K day−1 for light, moderate, and heavy dust conditions, respectively. Under conditions of heavy dust presence, the SHR attained 1.7 K day−1 at an altitude of 3 km, resulting in alterations to the initial thermal configuration of the atmosphere and surface temperature. The maximum surface temperature recorded in heavy dust conditions was 8.6 °C (5.9 °C) lower than the temperatures observed in light dust (moderate dust) conditions. The results contribute to a deeper comprehension of how dust aerosols influence the radiation budget within the Earth's atmospheric system in Central Asia."

 The planetary boundary layer (PBL) structure significantly impacts the vertical distribution of atmospheric pollutants. As PM2.5 and O3 are the most important atmospheric pollutants in the Yangtze River Delta, clarifying the vertical structure evolution characteristics within the PBL is crucial for understanding the atmospheric pollution formation mechanism. Via PBL vertical soundings in Nanjing from May 26 to June 16, 2018, the vertical pollutant structure under three pollution types (O3 pollution, PM2.5 pollution, and PM2.5–O3 composite pollution) is examined. The vertical structures of the different pollutants under the three pollution types vary. The O3 concentration increases with height below 900 m under the three pollution types, following composite type > O3 type > PM2.5 type. The O3 concentration suddenly decreases from 900 to 1500 m under the influence of the boundary layer top. The PM2.5 concentration under the three pollution types decreases with height, with the highest concentration below 850 m, but the difference decreases with height. The PM2.5 concentration above 200 m under the O3 pollution type is greater than the composite pollution type. The vertical BC concentration changes under the three pollution types are similar to those in PM2.5, both decreasing with height. The BC concentration differences among the pollution types are greater below 450 m, approximately 1937 ng/m³, while above 450 m, the differences are relatively small, around 576 ng/m³, accounting for about 30 % of the difference below 450 m. The diurnal vertical O3 and BC profile changes are similar across the different pollution types. Overall, the O3 concentration increases by 1.9 times with height, while the BC concentration decreases by 0.48 times. In the PM2.5 pollution type, PM2.5 shows significant cross-layer transport at the boundary layer top following the boundary layer's diurnal variation. The vertical pollutant structure differences at different O3 pollution stages are small, mainly in terms of concentration, with the order being stable stage > reduction stage > increasing stage. At 11:00, the O3 concentration at the increasing stage is much greater than in the other two stages. The PM2.5 concentration difference is large in different stages, especially from 14:00 to 20:00, with small BC differences."

 The Advanced Himawari Imager carried by the Himawari-8/9 geostationary satellite provides an effective tool for high-temporal-resolution aerosol monitoring with 10-min temporal resolution. Aerosol optical depth (AOD), as a crucial parameter for characterizing aerosols, is typically retrieved using physical-based algorithms that rely on prior assumptions about surface reflectance and aerosol models. However, these assumptions may not satisfy the complex land and atmospheric circumstances. This study develops a new AOD retrieval algorithm that improves the accuracy of surface reflectance and aerosol model by leveraging the time-series geostationary observations and aerosol properties clustered from precise ground-based measurements. AOD retrievals for 2022 to 2023 were conducted for southern China (mainly in Guangdong province), and validated against ground measurements from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) and Sun-sky radiometer Observation NETwork (SONET). The results are also compared with aerosol products from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The retrieval results showed high consistency with AERONET/SONET, achieving a correlation coefficient of 0.74, RMSE of 0.18, and over 52 % of retrievals within the expected error envelopes (EE) of ±(0.05 + 15 %). In comparison, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) AOD products have a lower correlation coefficient of 0.232, RMSE of 0.330, and only about 30 % of retrievals within the EE of ±(0.05 + 15 %). Furthermore, the proposed algorithm outperforms MODIS in terms of accuracy over their common retrievals. The algorithm based on a newly developed scattering scheme improves the retrieval accuracy at different times and can show aerosol diurnal variations in south China."

 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their derivatives (oxy-PAHs and nitro-PAHs) are released during the biomass combustion process, both in the exhaust gas and bound to the particulate matter (PM). The composition of PAHs, including the number of carbon atoms and their molecular weight, is directly related to their toxicity. The aim of this work was to determine the PM-bound emission of the 16 EPA priority PAHs and some of their nitrated and oxygenated derivatives from the combustion of exhausted olive cake (EOC) and almond shell (AS) in a domestic boiler at two loads, nominal (55 kW) and partial (24 kW). In addition, pine pellet (P) was investigated as a reference fuel. Total PAHs emissions ranged from 1.7 to 8.4 μg/kg and from 5.7 to 357.8 μg/kg at nominal and partial load, respectively. While AS was the most PAHs-forming fuel at nominal load, EOC caused the highest emission at low load. The influence of the boiler load was quite relevant regarding the molecular weight of PAHs bound to PM. At nominal load, EOC and AS were dominated by low molecular weight compounds (LMW) and high molecular weight compounds (HHW), respectively, while at partial load medium molecular weight (MMW) PAHs gained importance for AS (59 %) and EOC PM were clearly dominated by high molecular weight PAHs (99 %). The higher unburned matter at partial load led to higher oxy and nitro-PAHs concentrations for the three biomass fuels, being in all cases 3 to 4 orders of magnitude lower than their derivative PAHs. EOC at partial load presented the highest value of KEsum and therefore its use in a modular boiler is less recommended from the health risk point of view."

 Understanding drought trends under climate change is critical for effective water resources management. Given the complex nature of droughts, relying solely on a single variable for drought analysis might not be adequate for promptly and reliably detecting drought conditions. This study introduces a comprehensive approach to drought monitoring and projection under climate change. The methodology assesses drought conditions by considering different key factors such as soil moisture, precipitation, runoff, relative humidity and (unmet) water demands. By considering these variables, the study aims to provide a more holistic understanding of drought dynamics. To achieve this, a range of indices are used including the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI), the Standardised Soil Moisture Index (SSI), the Standardised Relative Humidity Index (SRHI), the Standardised Runoff Index (SRI), the Multivariate Standardised Drought Index (MSDI), the Inflow-Demand Reliability Indicator (IDRI), the Water Storage Resilience Indicator (WSRI) and the Multivariate Standardised Reliability and Resilience Index (MSRRI). Furthermore, the study employs a (non-)parametric set of copula functions to analyze compound drought events, which consider the interconnected nature of different drought characteristics. These indicators detect drought onset, persistence, and spatial extent over Europe for different future climate scenarios, using data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). The study explores future climatic changes and their potential impact on drought patterns, comparing them with historical data. Results indicate that drought estimates vary significantly across different locations, time periods, and types of drought. The study captures this complexity and provides a more nuanced and resilient framework for understanding drought risks across different contexts. For example, results show that in Dublin, Ireland, the used climate scenarios project general wet meteorological conditions until 2050 (SPI > 0). However, extreme hydrological droughts are anticipated during the time based on SRI (SRI = -1.8). In addition, considering MSRRI, more socio-economic droughts are expected for Dublin by 2050. This study serves as a valuable resource for hydrologists, policymakers, and risk managers, offering guidance on understanding drought dynamics and informing decision-making processes related to drought prevention and mitigation strategies."

 Meteorological droughts will become the principal factor driving compound hot-dry events and analysis thereof is therefore fundamental with regard to understanding future climate patterns. The average citizen knows little of geometry, but it plays an essential role in the characteristics of the droughts, by means of “fractional lengths”. We analyzed the fractality of the meteorological droughts under the most recent climate change scenarios. A temporal fractality measure based upon the Cantor set reveals consensual changes in the behavior of droughts worldwide. Most regions will undergo a slight increase in fractality (up to +10 % on average), particularly associated with an acceleration of the hydrological cycle and the Hadley cell expansion, with a shift towards the higher latitudes of the tropical edge in both hemispheres. Geometrical measures were applied to the dry spells (<1 mm) at a daily scale simulated by the SSP2–4.5 and SSP5–8.5 scenarios from 10 different Earth System Models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). The historical experiment was used as a baseline (1981–2010) and also compared to the ERA5 reanalysis. The results show an increasingly concentrated or uneven distribution of droughts in mid-latitudes towards the end of the century, becoming more intense the more pessimistic the scenario selected. Simultaneously, the polar regions might benefit from more regular precipitation patterns. Other inequality measures, such as the indices of Gini and Monjo, showed similar results. In general terms, the earth's climate will be more fractal in the rainfall-related patterns, which likely means that the consequences will be more catastrophic for the human population."

 The Tibetan Plateau (TP) plays a crucial role in regional and global climate dynamics, making accurate precipitation data essential for meteorological studies. However, owing to the complex terrain and sparse observations, precipitation data are inadequate, particularly at the hourly scale, which hinders precise climate modeling and forecasting. To address this, we evaluate three precipitation products—IMERG, CMORPH, and TPHiPr—against observations from 84 rain gauges during summer from 2007 to 2018. Using traditional evaluation metrics and event-based error decomposition, we quantify each error component's contribution to the total bias. Our results show that at the hourly scale, IMERG outperforms CMORPH and TPHiPr, exhibiting the highest correlation with rain gauge data (CC = 0.43) and strong detection ability (POD = 0.58), although TPHiPr performs better at the daily scale. IMERG and CMORPH capture the diurnal cycle of precipitation frequency, but all three products significantly overestimate the precipitation frequency at noon. Additionally, all datasets tend to overestimate light rain and underestimate heavy rain, although IMERG and CMORPH demonstrate stronger detection of heavy rain (>2.6 mm/h) than light rain (0.1–0.2 mm/h). Notably, IMERG tends to detect precipitation events that start and end earlier than observed, with errors in the 0.1–0.2 mm/h intensity range contributing 31.8 % to the total bias. While IMERG performs better than CMORPH and TPHiPr at the hourly scale over the TP, challenges remain in detecting weak precipitation. By highlighting the limitations and strengths of these products, our study provides valuable insights to improve satellite-based precipitation estimates and support better climate modeling and forecasting in this vital region."

 Drought is a common and severe natural hazard worldwide. Understanding its triggering mechanisms is pivotal for comprehending its propagation. However, the triggering mechanisms of multitype drought propagation in diverse climate regions remain unclear. This study presents the first exploration of the triggering mechanisms of multitype drought propagation in the different climate regions of China. ECMWF reanalysis 5th generation and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data were utilized. Drought indices were applied to describe meteorological drought, hydrological drought, agricultural drought, and vegetation drought. The copula function and run theory were employed to estimate the propagation thresholds of multitype drought. The results revealed that (1) the Frank, Gumbel, and Student-t copula functions were optimal for combining different drought types. The generalized Pareto (GP) distribution, Weibull distribution (WBL), and logarithmic normal distribution (Log) were best for describing different types of drought characteristics. (2) The propagation thresholds for meteorological to hydrological and agricultural drought were lower than those for agricultural to hydrological drought. The propagation thresholds for agricultural to hydrological drought were notably greater in the temperate humid and subhumid region in Northeast China (SR-3) and the warm-temperate humid and subhumid region in North China (SR-4). (3) Vegetation drought was more difficult to trigger in forests and deserts than in grasslands and croplands. Vegetation drought was more difficult to trigger in the temperate and warm-temperate desert of northwestern China (SR-1) and the tropical humid region in South China (SR-7).

 This work examines a persistent dust event over the Middle East (29 June - 5 July 2011), the vertical dust cross-sections and associated radiative effects, via the synergy of satellite observations, reanalyses and two regional high-resolution models (WRF-Chem and RegCM4). The model's evaluation showed a generally better performance of WRF-Chem in aerosol optical depth (AOD) simulations, but with notable biases against satellite and reanalysis data. The dust storm started from the Tigris-Euphrates plains, passed over Kuwait, and affected the Persian Gulf and east Saudi Arabia. The dust plumes were further escalated with dust emissions from the Rub-Al-Khali and Oman Deserts, while they mixed over the Arabian Sea with dusty air masses coming from southwest Asia. Shamal wind over the alluvial Iraqi plains and the Persian Gulf, combined with strong monsoon southwesterlies over the Arabian Sea and northern Levar wind over SW Asia facilitated dust emissions from various sources. In addition, dust outflow from East Africa to Arabia caused a surface shortwave (SW) radiation reduction of ∼100–110 W m− 2 in the southern Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Oman shorelines. Over the northern Arabian Sea, south Red Sea and Gulf of Aden the net (SW + LW) surface radiative effect ranged from −60 to −80 W m−2. A thick dust plume caused higher SW radiative effects over the southern Caspian Sea (−170 W m−2), with a net forcing of −140 W m−2. The dust radiative cooling resulted in reduction in surface temperature (−1 °C to −2 °C) over the major dust-affected areas. Longwave (LW) radiative forcing (up to 50 W m−2) was simulated over the desert regions due to coarse dust. This study highlights notable differences in dust source functions, emission rates, and dust loading between the reanalysis, satellite datasets and model simulations, which may result in important biases in dust radiative effects."

 A total of 75 outdoor PM10, PM2.5, and PM1 samples from 14 schools, and 9 samples from potential local emission sources, were collected and analysed for their metallic content and lead (Pb) isotope ratios in 2 seasonal campaigns in Tarragona (Catalonia, Spain) to identify and apportion contamination sources and to assess associated health risks. Lead was predominantly found in PM1, and although its levels were below air quality standards, its Enrichment Factors (EF), along with those of other potentially toxic elements (Cd, Cr, Cu and Sb), indicated extremely severe enrichment in all PM sizes. Seasonal differentiation in Pb enrichment was particularly significant in PM1 during the cold campaign. This suggests an anthropogenic origin, mainly from combustion processes such as road traffic and a municipal solid waste incinerator, as supported by profiles of other metals (Cu, V and Zn) and the spatial distribution of the EFPb, respectively. Non-radiogenic Pb isotope ratios (208Pb/204Pb and 206Pb/204Pb) indicated a geogenic origin in some PM10 samples, based on their similarity to the geochronology of specific Spanish ore samples. However, radiogenic ratios (208Pb/207Pb and 206Pb/207Pb) pointed to coal-fired electrical plants (EGUs) and road traffic as the sources of the majority of the samples. These findings were corroborated by EF spatial distribution maps and by our previous study coupling air masses back trajectories with C and N isotopes in the same PM samples. Bayesian mixing models using both 204Pb- and 207Pb-normalised Pb isotope ratios estimated sources' contributions as follows: i) municipal solid waste incinerator (at least 10 % in PM10 and up to 60 % in both PM2.5 and PM1); ii) road traffic (up to 40 % for all size fractions); iii) coal-fired EGUs (around 20 % for all size fractions); and iv) geogenic particles (<10 % for all size fractions). Despite this strong contribution of anthropogenic sources, the potential health impacts of potentially toxic elements exposure were low, i.e., 3 additional cancer cases for adults per million of people due to Pb exposure, which nonetheless is comparable to levels observed in cities with populations 30 or more times larger than that of Tarragona."

 The turbulent exchanges between the land surface and atmosphere, crucial for global climate change and atmospheric circulation, are typically represented through bulk formulae based on Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST), using simple regression as a function of the non-dimensional stability parameter derived from limited field experiments, which leaves large uncertainties. Recently, machine learning is anticipated as an alternative or complement to bulk algorithms, leveraging its ability to detect nonlinear relationships in large datasets without constraints from the similarity relationships and self-correlations prescribed in MOST. However, there are still unresolved problems and gaps, even though common models like random forest and neural networks can be directly applied. This study proposes a hybrid approach for improved estimation of surface turbulent flux, consisting of meta-learner estimation, interpretable model selection, and adaptive model integration. Motivated by understanding how different machine learning algorithms perform as surface-layer flux estimators and further exploring how to utilize results from multiple meta-learners for better estimations, the method starts with eight different machine learning algorithms. Then, a combination of Elastic Net and Shapley Additive Explanations is developed as an interpretable model selection module, followed by an adaptive model integration using AdaBoost and extreme learning machine. Experiments at the continuous observation station in the Horqin Sandy Land area, Inner Mongolia, China, demonstrate that the proposed system delivers reliable and stable performance, significantly reducing estimation bias of three scaling parameters, with root mean square error reductions of 43.16 %–56.97 % compared to MOST, and outperforming the best single machine learning model with additional error reductions of 4.24 %–7.90 %."

 On 15 April 2016, a destructive tornado impacted the town of Dolores, in the Department of Soriano, southwestern Uruguay (SWUY), resulting in one of the most damaging, single-event weather disasters in Uruguay's history. Remarkably, another strong tornado hit Dolores less than four years earlier on 6 December 2012, causing damage in the south portion of the town. This study investigates the Dolores tornado cases in order to document and compare them, with emphasis on the synoptic- and mesoscale environments that led to the two events. It is shown that both tornadoes occurred far downstream of upper-level troughs, under strong mid- and high-level northwesterly winds, and in warm sectors north of warm fronts in southern Uruguay. Key to the development of the tornadic storms was the presence of northwesterly low-level jets that were instrumental in building up conditional instability and low-level shear for tornadic supercells. Based on the the presence of enhanced lines of cumulus clouds noted on visible satellite imagery, it is speculated that local breeze circulations at the northern edge of the Parana river delta or outflow boundaries may have played a role in fostering storm initiation near the Argentina-Uruguay border, although the available data is insufficient to allow for in-depth analyses of these features. Reanalysis-derived soundings reveal that, upon formation, the storms developed in environments characterized by robust conditional instability, deep-layer shear, low-level helicity, low lifting condensation levels, and weak-to-modest convective inhibition, all ingredients favorable for supercell tornado development. This study stresses the need for more research addressing tornadoes in Uruguay and proposes some avenues for future research."

 Live microorganisms dispersed through rain and snow can significantly impact urban environments, ecology and agricultural safety. The understanding of microbial interactions and ecological roles in rain and snow still remains unclear. In this study, samples from total 58 rain and snow events were collected in Xi'an, China, followed by determining the concentration, activity, and community structure of microbes. Co-occurrence networks were used to reveal interactions between microorganisms, and the functional genes within bacterial and fungal communities were also predicted. Results suggested a global trend of decreasing microbial concentrations in rain or snow with increasing latitude, while Xi'an shows a moderate level in comparison. The seasonal pattern of microbial concentration was opposite to that of activity and was significantly influenced by meteorological events. The predominant bacterial phyla were Proteobacteria (64.01 %), Bacteroidota (14.87 %), Actinobacteriota (4.50 %), while the dominant fungal phyla were Ascomycota (48.16 %) and Basidiomycota (44.40 %) in rain and snow. At the genus level, the relative abundance of dominant microbes in rain and snow was significantly correlated with the concentration of water-soluble inorganic ions. Additionally, the microbial profiles in rain exhibited significant differences between conditions with and without dust influence. Co-occurrence networks of microbes were complex, with cooperative relationships predominating. Furthermore, functional genes analysis indicated that metabolic pathways dominated bacterial communities, while plant pathogens and parasites comprised 50 % of the fungi across all seasons. These results may not only enrich our understanding of microbial seasonal dynamics in rain and snow but also highlight critical pathways through which microorganisms potentially affect ecological resilience and agricultural productivity."

 The occurrence of severe pollution events is not merely ascribed to internal emission sources but is also influenced by atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). This study examined how variations in ABL affect the pollution formation, accumulation, and dispersion in the mountainous Mongolian Plateau under three distinct atmospheric conditions. Quantitative analyses were performed on particulate matter (PM) and micro-scale meteorological parameters within the ABL. The findings suggest that the convergence of local southwest and southeast winds with northerly winds from the northern mountainous area, in combination with clockwise wind shear within the ABL, can result in explosive PM growth. The persistent transport of southerly airflow near the surface is primarily accountable for the long-term and stable increase in pollutants. Furthermore, low near-surface wind speed (WS), low atmospheric boundary layer height (BLH), high relative humidity (RH), and temperature inversion (TI) are crucial factors contributing to the explosive growth of pollution. Strong northwesterly winds and turbulence directly facilitate pollution dissipation. Turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and friction velocity (u⁎) both exhibit a nonlinear negative correlation with near-surface PM concentration. At an altitude of 50 m, TKE and u⁎ have the most significant impact on PM concentration, with R (Pearson correlation coefficient) of −0.81 and − 0.79 (−0.50 and − 0.17), respectively. Controlling PM2.5 concentration below 75 μg/m3 can rapidly increase TKE and u⁎, with values exceeding 2.1 m2/s2 and 0.8 m/s, thereby significantly enhancing the atmosphere's self-cleaning capacity. When TKE or u⁎ rises above 3.8 m2/s2 or 1.4 m/s, the PM2.5 concentration generally decreases to below 30 μg/m3. TKE and u⁎ above an altitude of 500 m have negligible effects on surface PM."

 Secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA) and secondary organic aerosols (SOA) are major components of atmospheric particulate matter, however, their exact formation pathways are variable during haze evolution and need to be further clarified. To fully elucidate the characteristics of sulfate, nitrate and secondary organic carbon (SOC) and compare their roles in haze formation, PM2.5 samples were collected in downtown Beijing in four seasons, and PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 samples were collected over the severe haze episodes in winter and spring of 2017. The sulfur oxidation ratio (SOR), nitrogen oxidation ratio (NOR), and SOC/OC ratio were used to indicate the formation intensity of the respective secondary species. Based on the correlation analysis between secondary transformation ratios and their influencing factors, we found that relative humidity (RH) played a dominating role in NO3− formation and partitioning in the aerosol phase throughout the year, while SOR and SOC/OC were highly dependent on both O3 and RH. Different from the monotonic increase of SOR and NOR with RH, the SOC/OC ratio first increased and then decreased with increasing RH. The severe haze episode in winter was characterized by simultaneously enhanced secondary production of SO42−, NO3− and SOC. Whereas, the haze event in spring was featured by dramatically enhanced NO3− concentration, signifying the uniquely high contribution of nitrate to haze formation in spring."

 Solar radiation is a key driver of many physical, chemical and biological processes in Antarctic ecosystems and the main component of the surface energy budget. The downward shortwave radiation (DSR) flux varies greatly in the Antarctic Peninsula region due to cloud cover changes, resulting from climate differences between eastern and western coasts. The DSR intensity was measured using A-class pyranometers at the J.G. Mendel (JGM) station located on the northeastern part of the Antarctic Peninsula and at the King Sejong (KSJ) station located on the western part for the period 2011–2016. The influence of the cloud cover on the DSR flux was evaluated using the cloud modification factor calculated for both stations. The effect of surface pressure, water vapour, albedo, cloud cover, ozone and solar zenith angle was examined using partial correlation. We found a 29 %-higher DSR intensity at the JGM station, while the cloud cover was higher at the KSJ station, with a 28 %-lower cloud modification factor compared with the JGM station. At both stations, the DSR variability was affected mainly by the solar zenith angle, followed by cloud cover at the JGM station, whereas the influence of cloud cover and water vapour was similar at the KSJ station. The effect of the albedo was significant for most of the year at the JGM station but only in the winter at the KSJ station. These results reveal significant differences in climate conditions between the western and eastern coasts, which are reflected in local atmospheric and cryospheric processes."

 This study provides the first evaluation of the detection capabilities of the FY-3G dual-frequency Precipitation Measurement Radar (PMR) using storm top observations. Additionally, the impact of the GPM-CO orbit boost in November 2023 on Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) observations is assessed from the perspective of the PMR. The minimum detectable radar reflectivities for the FY-3G Ku- and Ka-band radars were determined to be 12.03 dBZ and 8.60 dBZ, respectively. Notably, the better sensitivity of the FY-3G Ka-band radar enabled the detection of more and higher storm tops and significantly reduced the misidentification of the melting layer as the storm top compared to the GPM Ka-band Precipitation Radar (KaPR). At the same time, the PMR is more significantly affected by ground clutter, partly as a trade-off for its enhanced sensitivity, compared to the DPR. This increased susceptibility necessitates more rigorous ground validation of its near-surface precipitation retrieval. The sensitivity degradation of the KaPR resulting from the GPM-CO orbit boost further intensifies the underestimation of snow dual-frequency ratio (DFR) measurements, resulting in an increased classification of precipitation as convective by the DFRm method. Our results are expected to illuminate future algorithm development and data comparisons of FY-3G and GPM-CO radars."

Particularly, BAMs and activated CD11c+microglia localized near β amyloid (Aβ) plaques exhibited a pronounced lipid-associated gene signature and a high LD load. Having observed that elevated intracellular LD content correlated inversely with microglial phagocytic activities, we subsequently inhibited LD formation specifically in CX3CR1+brain macrophages using an inducible APP-KI/Fit2iΔMφtransgenic mouse model. We demonstrated that reducing LD content in microglia and CX3CR1+BAMs remarkably improved their phagocytic ability. Furthermore, lowering microglial LDs consistently enhanced their efferocytosis capacities and notably reduced Aβ deposition in the brain parenchyma.

These features are thought to promote the formation and maintenance of an “open” chromatin environment that is suitable for transcription. However, recent reports have drawn conflicting conclusions about whether these histone modifications depend on active transcription. To further interrogate this relationship, we inhibited transcription initiation using triptolide, which triggered degradation of RNA polymerase II, and examined the impact on histone modifications. Transcription initiation was not required for either hormone-induced or steady-state active histone modifications at transcription start sites (TSSs) and enhancers. Rather, blocking transcription initiation increased the levels of histone acetylation and H2AZ incorporation at active TSSs. P300 activity was dispensable for this effect, but inhibition of histone deacetylases masked the increased acetylation. Together, our results demonstrate that active histone modifications occur independently of transcription. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the process of transcription coordinates the removal of these modifications to limit gene activity."

Analysis of cod otoliths recovered during archaeological excavations of Icelandic fish processing sites revealed that cod in the 10th to 12th centuries were 25% larger and up to 300% older than modern, despite slower density-dependent growth rates attributed to the sixfold increase in abundance.

Here, the results of succinylome, subcellular localization, and protein interaction analysis show that non-succinylated insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) localizes in the cytoplasm, binds to insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2-like), and degrades it. When the metamorphosis is initiated, 20E up-regulated carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (Cpt1a) through transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 15 (KLF15), thus increasing the level of IDE succinylation on K179. Succinylated IDE translocated from cytoplasm to nucleus, combined with ecdysone receptor to promote 20E signaling pathway, causing larval tissue destruction, while IGF-2-like was released to promote adult tissue proliferation.

Notably, activation of immune signaling by a bacterial flagellin peptide nullified kC9’s effects on stomatal development.

Variations in MVE abundances among IMPBs, particularly the two volatile-depleted NC and CC IMPBs (IVA and IVB), reflect secondary volatile loss after disruption of their parent bodies. Consequently, MVE depletion in terrestrial planets is more closely linked to the protracted history of MVE loss during planetesimal collisions rather than incomplete condensation or MVE loss during planetesimal differentiation."

Streicker;Mafalda Viana,Dynamics of influenza transmission in vampire bats revealed by longitudinal monitoring and a large-scale anthropogenic perturbation,"Interrupting pathogen transmission between species is a priority strategy to mitigate zoonotic threats. However, avoiding counterproductive interventions requires knowing animal reservoirs of infection and the dynamics of transmission within them, neither of which are easily ascertained from the cross-sectional surveys that now dominate investigations into newly discovered viruses. We used biobanked sera and metagenomic data to reconstruct the transmission of recently discovered bat-associated influenza virus (BIV; H18N11) over 12 years in three zones of Peru. Mechanistic models fit under a Bayesian framework, which enabled joint inference from serological and molecular data, showed that common vampire bats maintain BIV independently of the now assumed fruit bat reservoir through immune waning and seasonal transmission pulses. A large-scale vampire bat cull targeting rabies incidentally halved BIV transmission, confirming vampire bats as maintenance hosts. Our results show how combining field studies, perturbation responses, and multi-data–type models can elucidate pathogen dynamics in nature and reveal pathogen-dependent effects of interventions."

Although nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods such ast-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) have been developed, their implementation in simple biological circuits remains unclear. Here, we develop a biologically plausible dimensionality reduction algorithm compatible witht-SNE, which uses a simple three-layer feedforward network mimicking theDrosophilaolfactory circuit. The proposed learning rule, described as three-factor Hebbian plasticity, is effective for datasets such as entangled rings and MNIST, comparable tot-SNE. We further show that the algorithm could be working in olfactory circuits in Drosophila by analyzing the multiple experimental data in previous studies. We lastly suggest that the algorithm is also beneficial for association learning between inputs and rewards, allowing the generalization of these associations to other inputs not yet associated with rewards."

Grover;Paolo Valentini;Nicholas Bisek,Ab initio investigation of a hypersonic double cone experiment,"This article presents a direct molecular simulation (DMS) of a reactive Mach 8.2 oxygen flow over a double cone geometry. The free stream conditions and article configuration generate a flow with thermal and chemical nonequilibrium, which are common attributes of hypersonic flight. This scenario was first studied experimentally at Calspan University of Buffalo Research Center’s test facility. DMS is a particle method that uses quantum mechanically derived interaction potentials to simulate molecular collisions within a flow field. Since these interaction potentials are the only modeling inputs used in the simulation, all flow features can solely be attributed to the ab initio potential energy surfaces. Hence, providing a comparison of a hypersonic ground test and numerical data anchored to quantum mechanics. The fundamental nature of DMS is leveraged to investigate molecular level mechanisms prevalent in the flow, and comparisons with lower fidelity simulations are presented to highlight the role of these first principles calculations as benchmark solutions."

Previous assessments of temperature-related mortality, however, lack a comprehensive analysis of distinct impacts of temperature change across different timescales and characteristics. Using a longitudinal survey of 27,233 elderly Chinese citizens from 2005 to 2018, we establish connections between rising temperatures, temperature variability, and extreme heat with increased mortality risk, assessed through four annual metrics that combine temperature and humidity. The intensity and prolonged duration of extreme heat are found to have the greatest impact on mortality risk. Furthermore, by identifying heterogeneous impacts based on location, sex, age, obesity, income, and diet, we reveal the pathways through which temperature metrics are likely to influence mortality risk. Our study highlights the compound effects of rising temperatures for elderly populations, and it could be expanded to other countries and regions experiencing similar challenges due to an aging population experiencing warming conditions."

However, it has proven challenging to realize an SMS in which a large exchange couplingJis transmitted between conduction electrons and localized spins. Furthermore, most systems have carrier mean free pathslmfpshorter than their spin moiré lattice constantaspin, inhibiting miniband formation. Here, we discover that the layered magnetic semimetal EuAg4Sb2overcomes these challenges by forming an interface withJ~ 100 milli–electron volts transferred between a Eu triangular lattice and anionic Ag2Sb bilayers hosting a two-dimensional electron band in the ballistic regime (lmfp>>aspin). The system realizes an SMS withaspincommensurate with the Fermi momentum, leading to a marked quenching of the transport response from miniband formation. Our findings demonstrate an approach to magnetically engineering moiré superlattices and a potential route to an emergent spin-driven quantum Hall state."
