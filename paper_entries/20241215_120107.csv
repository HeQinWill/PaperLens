This study bridges a crucial gap in understanding the impact of the membrane spatial charge distribution on ion-selective separation. We developed two types of mixed-charge membranes with similar pore sizes but distinct longitudinal and horizontal distributions of oppositely charged domains. The charge-mosaic membrane, synthesized and utilized for ion fractionation for the first time, achieved an exceptional water permeance of 15.4 LMH/bar and a Li/Mg selectivity of 108, outperforming the majority of published reports. Through comprehensive characterization, mathematical modeling, and machine learning methods, we provide evidence that the spatial charge distribution dominantly determines ion selectivity. The charge-mosaic structure excels by substantially promoting ion selectivity through locally enhanced Donnan effects while remaining unaffected by variations in feedwater concentration. Our findings not only demonstrate the applicability of charge-mosaic membranes to precise nanofiltration but also have profound implications for technologies demanding advanced ion selectivity, including those in the sustainable water treatment and energy storage industries."

This study quantified the effect of typical aftertreatment technologies (China VI) on diesel engine-emitted I/SVOCs, related secondary organic aerosol (SOA), and toxic effects. The equipped aftertreatment devices could mitigate the emission factors (EFs) by 70.8 ± 3.4 to 82.5 ± 20.9% for I/SVOCs, 72.7 ± 18.6 to 77.5 ± 4.2% for SOA production, and 75.7 ± 9.3 to 82.4 ± 9.2% for toxic equivalent quantity (TEQ). Aftertreatment units are better for removing alkanes, benzenes, and ketones. The TEQ from the cold-start cycle is 1.3- to 5.7-fold higher than that from the hot-start cycle. In contrast, the EFs of ship-emitted I/SVOCs are 3.7- to 5.3-fold higher than those of diesel vehicles equipped with an aftertreatment system when burning the same fuel, leading to 2.1- to 3.0-fold higher SOA production and 3.1- to 6.7-fold TEQ.

One currently proposed fundamental mechanism is lithospheric foundering and loss of dense material into the mantle. A type locality is the young extinct arc forming the Sierra Nevada, California. Here, we image a distinct anisotropic shear layer below the crust‐mantle boundary using receiver functions. The sense of shear is consistent with west‐ to southwestward removal of lithosphere. The shear signal is strongest in the southern Sierra, where lithospheric foundering was proposed to have concluded several million years ago, and is deeper and less pronounced in the central Sierra, where ongoing lithospheric foundering is corroborated by a band of unusually deep (40+ km) seismicity along the western foothills.

Quantifying the effects of anthropogenic climate change on extreme heat has remained challenging, in part due to the short observational record. Here, we isolate the most slowly varying component of the frequency at which the historical 90th and 99th percentiles were exceeded in observational records from 1955 to 2021 by using a statistical method called low‐frequency component analysis. The emerging spatiotemporal signal in the changing frequency of temperature extremes can be attributed to a shift of the temperature distribution by local warming of the annual‐mean daily maximum temperature. The shift explains over 80% of the interannual variability in the frequency at which the historical 90th percentile is exceeded in the tropics and up to 50% in higher latitudes.

In this study, we investigate the Na+ $N{a}^{+}$ circulation, distribution, and its influence on global magnetospheric convection with a two‐fluid MHD model, which is coupled with an empirical sodium exosphere profile as the source of Na+ $N{a}^{+}$. In particular, we aim to investigate if the dawn‐dusk asymmetries in Na+ $N{a}^{+}$ distributions near the equator can be driven by internal mechanisms within the magnetosphere. Our findings indicate that (a) the observed dawn‐dusk asymmetric Na+ $N{a}^{+}$ distributions can be driven by the separation of H+ ${H}^{+}$ and Na+ $N{a}^{+}$ flows, and (b) the Hall‐driven global convection preferentially transporting Na+ $N{a}^{+}$ ions to the morning sector."

Our study reveals that changes in summer surface winds have accelerated AG warming and weakened it in the SOO, reducing the density gradient and water exchange between the two seas during late summer. This has led to nutrient buildup, increased productivity, and heightened deoxygenation and acidification in the AG.

We use aerosol properties, vertical velocity fluctuations, and meteorological states from the ACTIVATE field observations (2020–2022) as predictors to estimate Nc ${N}_{c}$. We show that the campaign‐wide Nc ${N}_{c}$ can be successfully predicted using machine learning models despite the strongly nonlinear and multi‐scale nature of ACI. However, the observation‐trained machine learning model fails to predict Nc ${N}_{c}$ in individual cases while it successfully predicts Nc ${N}_{c}$ of randomly selected data points that cover a broad spatiotemporal scale.

A proposed mechanism is changes in tropical lower stratospheric upwelling rates and static stability caused by QBO and solar UV effects on extratropical wave forcing of the stratospheric residual meridional circulation (the Brewer‐Dobson circulation). The extent to which this mechanism, which operates only in boreal winter and enhances similar effects of the QBO‐induced meridional circulation, is simulated in a series of GCMs participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) is investigated. The models are found to be often lacking complete representation of several elements of the mechanism, with particular issues being QBOs that are westerly biased and weak in the lower stratosphere, insufficient solar or QBO modulation of extratropical wave activity (the Holton‐Tan effect), too weak reductions in equatorial tropopause static stability in response to extratropical wave forcing, and MJOs that in some cases do not respond to these reductions. Through bypassing many of these deficiencies via data selection, it is demonstrated that effects on the MJO that resemble those found in observations (strengthening of the MJO following early winter sudden stratospheric warmings and during easterly QBO winters) can be simulated by a subset of the models. This supports operation of the proposed mechanism, and points to needed model improvements, although caveats exist and further work is needed."

It is now recognized that the Bowen ratio (β) implicit in the PT model is too sensitive to temperature. The model also requires the surface net radiation (Rn) as input even though Rn is not an independent external forcing. The maximum evaporation model (MEM) proposed by Yang and Roderick (2019, https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.3481) is a potential candidate for replacing the PT model. Past studies have evaluated the MEM for land ecosystems and for the global ocean. This study represents the first evaluation of the MEM for inland waterbodies. Results are based on eddy‐covariance observation at a large lake and at a small fishpond. Although there were complex error structures and error compensation patterns among its intermediate variables, the MEM was able to reproduce the observed monthly (R2 > 0.95) and interannual variability (R2 > 0.78) in the lake latent heat flux. A key assumption of the MEM, that the incoming and outgoing longwave radiation is coupled, was a reasonable approximation at both the monthly and the annual time scale for the large lake and at the monthly time scale for the small fishpond. This assumption allows the MEM to treat Rn as an intermediate variable instead of a prescribed forcing. These results support the MEM as an alternative to the PT model at locations where Rn measurements are not available. In situations where Rn data is available, a revised PT model with reduced β temperature sensitivity is recommended."

In August 2022, unprecedented heatwaves struck central China and west Russia concurrently, resulting in severe energy crisis, numerous financial losses, and fatalities. Through synoptic‐scale analysis, we identify a pivotal role of recurrent Rossby wave packets (RRWPs) in shaping the event by repeatedly forming ridges and troughs over the same key areas. In this study, we further extend the investigation of the influence of RRWPs on heatwave occurrences in these two targeted regions over the past 44 years. Using a self‐organizing map to identify the RRWP patterns, we find that RRWPs with ridges over central China are closely associated with a marked increase in heatwave probabilities in both central China and western Russia. Specifically, the regional‐mean likelihood of heatwaves increases by factors of 3.0 and 2.6, respectively, relative to the climatology. Notably, the effect of RRWPs on the occurrence of concurrent heatwaves across both regions is more pronounced than on regional events alone. For example, during RRWPs, the likelihood of concurrent heatwaves affecting at least 20% of both target regions exceeds 10 times the climatological average. Our findings underscore the significant role of RRWPs in triggering concurrent Eurasian heatwaves and suggest promising synoptic predictability for such extreme events."

This study identifies critical features associated with PEPEs during boreal summer in this region, such as both cool land surface and air at 850 hPa, indicating strong land‐atmosphere interactions. Vertical soil water flow (VSWF) significantly affects near‐surface soil hydro‐thermodynamics and can potentially enhance the PEPEs' simulation. However, VSWF is often ignored in land surface models. To improve the simulation of PEPEs, the VSWF term is incorporated into the soil heat transfer equation within the Noah‐MP model coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting model, improving the simulation of PEPEs. Further analysis reveals that incorporating VSWF strengthens the cold features of PEPEs and improves precipitation simulation. Detailed examination shows that incorporating VSWF induces a secondary circulation anomaly and a positive geopotential height anomaly in Southeast China compared to simulations without VSWF. The southeast flank of the anticyclone anomaly reduces water vapor transport, while the northwest flank enhances it. Additionally, the geopotential height anomaly triggers adjustments in downstream regions of Southeast China, depending on changes in downstream circulation patterns of PEPEs. This research contributes to a better understanding of land‐atmosphere interactions, particularly the effects of VSWF on PEPEs in Southeast China."

Tian, Zhang, Klein, & Schumacher, 2021, https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13122309, 2022, https://doi.org/10.1029/2021gl097070). To validate this algorithm, the framework employs ground‐based ceilometer measurements from North Alabama (NA) where ShCu populations are prevalent. This study first generates clear‐sky surface reflectance maps at NA and identifies ShCu pixels with a detection threshold using Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) reflectance data. The obtained cloud fractions (CFs) are then compared against CFs from a ground‐based ceilometer, considering factors such as observed area differences, satellite parallax issue, and systematic biases. We found that with a detection threshold (∆R) of 0.05, the ShCu detection algorithm is effective for NA, enabling the reproduction of hourly ShCu CFs using GOES. Our framework is straightforward and easily repeatable to evaluate the effectiveness of a ∆R threshold for detecting ShCu clouds in various geographic regions where ceilometers are deployed. This satellite detection of ShCu provides a crucial regional context for ground‐based measurements, facilitating the tracking of convection initiation and its coupling with land surface conditions. Integrating localized ground‐based and regional satellite data will enhance our ability to conduct thorough studies of cloud morphology and land‐atmosphere interactions in North Alabama."

 Remote sensing of solar-induced vegetation chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has a rich history of more than 50 years of research covering active and passive techniques from leaf, canopy, and satellite scale. Current satellite-derived SIF products primarily focus on the far-red spectral range, with variations in techniques dependent on sensor capabilities. However, these retrieval methods often rely on parametric spectral models and are constrained to narrow absorption regions. In this paper, we introduce a novel Bayesian retrieval technique, referred to as SIFFI (Siffi Is For Fluorescence Inference), designed for the flexible and robust estimation of spectrally resolved fluorescence spectra. SIFFI utilizes spectral representations for both fluorescence and surface reflectance, enabling its application to distinct spectral ranges, e.g., red, far-red, and full spectral range. Also, its applicability extends to top-of-canopy (TOC) and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) measurements, with the latter being possible when auxiliary information about the atmospheric state is available. For the assessment of SIFFI, we performed an extensive proof-of-concept simulation exercise involving diverse scenarios that integrated measured leaf-level fluorescence and reflectance signals, propagated them to the TOC and TOA levels, and perturbed the resultant signal with instrument Gaussian noise to simulate realistic conditions. Additionally, we extend our assessment exercise to TOC measurements acquired by a fluorescence box (FloX) instrument during two diurnal cycles on sunlit and cloudy conditions. In all the TOC cases, simulations- and measured-based scenarios, we compared our SIF estimates with the results from two well-established methods: the improved Fraunhofer line discrimination method (iFLD) and the Spectral Fitting (SpecFit) method covering the full fluorescence spectra. Notably, our results highlight the versatility and accuracy of SIFFI in estimating spectrally resolved fluorescence, achieving Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values of 0.07 (0.09) [mW/(m2srnm)] in the TOC (TOA) simulation scenarios, improving the SpecFit method estimates, and being aligned with the iFLD method results at the oxygen bands. SIFFI represents a significant advancement in SIF retrieval, providing a robust approach that exploits the full spectral information from the red to the near-infrared regions."

 Hydraulic traits mediate trade-offs between growth and mortality in plants yet characterizing these traits at the community level remains challenging, particularly in the Amazon, where they vary widely across species and environments. While previous studies have used reflectance-based estimates, hydraulic traits, which arise from wood and/or whole-plant anatomy and physiology, have not been comprehensively explored.For the first time, we comprehensively investigated the use of leaf reflectance to predict hydraulic traits alongside leaf functional traits in tropical evergreen and deciduous trees. For 196 Amazonian trees, we measured water potential, leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf reflectance, hydraulic conductivity curves (e.g., P50), and wood density (WD). We examined the relationships between leaf reflectance and traits using partial least square regression (PLSR).Our findings indicate that leaf reflectance accurately predicts variation in LMA (R2 = 0.8), and reasonably estimates xylem water potential (R2 = 0.51) and WD (R2 = 0.52). However, P50 predictions were much less reliable (R2 = 0.27), with water absorption bands greatly influencing the PLSR model. Leaf phenological strategy had little impact on the results.These findings suggest that reflectance-based remote sensing could monitor water status and forest carbon dynamics through water potential and wood density, respectively. However, our case study applying the PLSR approach to hyperspectral canopy spectra to predict wood density revealed challenges to upscaling. Despite these limitations, remote sensing of forest hydraulic traits at scale could enhance our understanding of drought vulnerability and carbon dynamics in Amazonian forests, with significant implications for conservation."

 Soil and vegetation temperatures are crucial for various fields, including ecology, agriculture, and climate change. However, there remains a lack of entirely observation-based global datasets for these two component temperatures. To fill this gap, this study developed a multisource data Fusion-based global surface Soil and Vegetation Temperature retrieval method (FuSVeT). This novel method not only utilizes temporal and spatial information from MODIS data by adopting a temperature cycle model to capture temporal variation and using adjacent pixels to consider spatial differences and increase the number of equations solved, but also leverages ERA5-Land data to reduce unknown parameters, effectively compensating for the limitations of satellite observations. Its performances were comprehensively evaluated with simulated data, high-resolution satellite products, and in situ measurements, demonstrating competitive accuracy with root mean square errors below 2 K and Biases of under 1 K in most cases. Compared to previous retrieval method that relies solely on satellite-based temporal and spatial information, FuSVeT present enhanced accuracy, more complete spatial coverage, and improved computational efficiency, making it more applicable for global soil and vegetation temperature mapping. Using this method, we generated global 0.05° monthly mean soil and vegetation temperatures for January and July 2020. These data can capture more pronounced temperature heterogeneities within biomes than existing soil temperature products, indicating its superiority for global analyses. Importantly, FuSVeT can also be applied to satellite observations with higher spatiotemporal resolution, holding significant potential for providing accurate, long-term, global maps of surface soil and vegetation temperatures."

 Bamboo forests are natural habitat for the giant panda which is one of the most vulnerable mammal species. In structurally complex natural forests, bamboos are normally located under the canopy of taller trees, which makes them difficult to be quantified accurately. Although Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technologies have been well established as the effective tool for forest structure assessment, the use of LiDAR to assess understory bamboo in structurally complex natural forests is less well known. We present a novel vertical vegetation classification (VVC) approach to map the structure of understory bamboos for giant panda forage in natural forests. An optimized demarcation point identification (DPI) model was developed for stratifying different vertical layers from coarse to fine scales. Three-dimensional understory bamboo point clouds were successfully isolated from the forest point cloud, then bamboo structure predictive models were developed through understory bamboo point cloud metrics and applied over the entire study area to generate spatially continuous maps of understory bamboo structure. Our results indicate that the isolation of the understory bamboo point cloud using the developed VVC approach performs well and has small bias, the extracted maximum height is close to field-measured maximum height (R2 = 0.77, rRMSE = 15.02 %). Height-related metrics have higher correlations with bamboo structure (mean natural and true height, basal diameter, and total aboveground biomass) than other metrics (r > 0.8), and understory bamboo structures are estimated with relatively high accuracy (R2 = 0.84 – 0.91, rRMSE = 10.87 – 29.41 %). We also find varying effects of topography on the spatial distribution of different understory bamboo species. This study demonstrates the benefits of utilizing LiDAR data to ascertain fine-scale understory bamboo resources, providing critical supports for giant panda habitat assessment and conservation."

 The boreal forest surrounds the Arctic region and is the most extensive ecosystem on Earth; one-third of its soil is influenced by permafrost and accompanying wetlands. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology has been widely utilized to monitor ground surface deformation in Arctic tundra and alpine grassland permafrost environments; however, its application in boreal forest areas is limited due to dense canopy cover and severe interferometric decorrelation. This study investigates the application of C-band InSAR to ground surface deformation monitoring in a southern boreal forest environment at Genhe River watershed in the northern part of the Greater Khingan Mountains, Northeast China. The analysis revealed that freezing-season interferograms have higher interferometric qualities and are more suitable for deformation monitoring. An InSAR pair correction and stacking algorithm was developed for retrieving extensive freezing-season deformation which could maximize the use of low-quality InSAR pairs, and reduce the effects of the snow depth phase and atmospheric distortions. The retrieved multiannual freezing-season deformation ranged from –32.8 mm to 129.1 mm. The uplift regions clearly indicate the extent of low-lying wetlands, which are influenced by frost heave caused by freezing soil water. Additionally, the “subsidence” areas correspond to farmland and evergreen coniferous forest regions in the study area, where liquid water content is higher than in other land cover types, thus resulting in a longer optical path for the radar signal. This study presents the first systematic analysis of applying C-band InSAR to ground surface deformation monitoring in the southern boreal forest environment. The retrieved seasonal deformation and deformation processes have a high potential for identifying wetlands, differentiating between forest types, and providing valuable insights into the hydrothermal conditions and dynamics of the boreal ecosystem."

In this study, we analyzed the impact of initial intensity error on the simulated TC tracks based on 1128 simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for TCs in the western North Pacific between June and November from 2006 to 2018. Results show that the initial TC intensities were largely underestimated compared to observations. In TC cases with the initial intensity error below −10 m s−1, the simulated track position errors (TPEs) were notably greater than TCs in other cases with smaller absolute initial intensity errors. To quantify the positive impact of the improved initial TC intensity on the track simulations, we conducted additional simulations with the dynamical initialization (DI) scheme to enhance the initial TC intensity. Compared to the simulations without the DI scheme, the simulations with the DI scheme performed better in simulating TC tracks, with a 20.3 % reduction in TPE at 72-h. The improvement was understood based on the potential vorticity tendency diagnostic analysis. Results show that the TC motion in the simulations with the DI scheme was controlled by both horizontal and vertical advections, while that without the DI scheme was dominated by horizontal advection only, especially in the early stage of simulations when the TC intensity was considerably underpredicted.

 Brown Carbon (BrC) is an organic component of aerosols with light-absorbing characteristics that have crucial consequences in atmospheric warming and the climate system, yet it carries significant uncertainty. This uncertainty is due to its non-static optical properties which provide a significant challenge in the measurement of the perturbation caused by them in the Earth radiation budget. The unpredictability in optical properties is because of the continuous formation of Secondary BrC and decay of existing BrC influenced by various physicochemical and meteorological factors in the ambient atmosphere. The dynamic behaviour of these chromophores can be impacted by the aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) and atmospheric acidity via influencing its atmospheric chemistry of formation and decay. The objective of this research is to investigate how the ALWC and acidity in terms of pH affect the BrC optical properties in the rarely examined Eastern part of India during extreme winters. Utilizing a thermal-optical carbon analyzer, the optical characteristics of BrC were estimated. The ISORROPIA II, thermodynamic model was employed to simulate ALWC and aerosol pH, yielding a mean pH value of 3.30 ± 0.16 for the study duration. The study provides the first in-field evidence of a linear increase of absorption coefficient with increasing pH or decreasing aerosol acidity in the ambient atmosphere. A 39.6 Mm−1 increase in absorption coefficient per unit increase in pH, shows that aerosol pH is one of the decisive elements influencing BrC chemistry. The results also showed the inverse relation of the absorption coefficient with ALWC. The findings indicate the sensitivity of BrC chemistry towards aerosol acidity and ALWC in the ambient atmosphere and its importance while evaluating BrC absorption."

 Atmospheric electric filed (AEF) measured at the earthʼs surface varies in time and space in an irregular manner, which makes interpreting the results of such measurements a challenging task. Simultaneous measurements of the AEF using several sensors make it possible to study the spatiotemporal structure of AEF variations associated with local sources. In one dimension there is an optimal placement of sensors along a straight line with distances between them that are proportional to the divisions in the Golomb ruler such that, with a fixed number of sensors, there is a maximum possible number of different pairwise distances. An array of 7 electric field mills in a line and one more at a distance greater than the total length of the Golomb ruler was used to obtain simultaneous observational data set and estimate temporal and spatial autocorrelation functions of AEF variations in the range of distances 2.5–400 m and frequency range 10−3–1 Hz. In addition, to quantitatively describe and interpret the obtained dependences, the autocorrelation functions of the electric field created over a conducting plane by extended one-dimensional random Gaussian charge distribution with exponential autocorrelation function are analyzed. It is found that autocorrelation functions of observed and modeled electric field can be approximated by incomplete gamma functions with parameters depending on the height of charges and the correlation radius in charge distribution. The integral scales of AEF variations of local nature are examined depending on the same parameters, and the time integral scale is found to be inversely depends on the density of zeros of standardized time series of the AEF.

The spatial shift is from the western portion of continental Canada during 2005–2013 to the eastern Canada with a maritime environment during 2014–2022. With increase of hail severity, the hail activities increase from the colder period 2005–2013 to the warmer period 2014–2022. Our composite analyses show that over the continental Canada, the hail activities are enriched through thermodynamically driven convective instability and precipitable water associated with the warming climate, as well as dynamically driven processes such as vertical wind shear and vertically integrated water vapor flux convergence. Over the maritime Canada with the colder condition, the hail activities are enhanced by dynamically driven moisture advection and convergence as well as vertical wind shear, thermodynamically driven process of precipitable water, and partially due to convective instability. This research promotes our understanding of climate change impact on hail activities, shedding lights on long-term hail projection, adaptation, and mitigation strategies."
