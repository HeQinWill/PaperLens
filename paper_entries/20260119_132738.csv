Although marine microorganisms mediate OC degradation during macroalgal decay, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. This study employed an integrated multiomics approach (amplicon sequencing, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics) to investigate microbial regulation of OC degradation and coupled nutrient cycling in coastal sediments with and without decomposing Sargassaceae. Total carbon in sediments increased by over 33% in the Sargassaceae area. Microbial α-diversity in the Sargassaceae area decreased significantly (p < 0.05), while processes linked to OC degradation, carbohydrate metabolism, nitrate (NO3–) reduction, inorganic phosphorus utilization, and sulfur metabolism were significantly upregulated (p < 0.05). Accordingly, gene expression and extracellular hydrolase activities targeting key biopolymers (i.e., cellulose, hemicellulose, starch, and chitin) were significantly upregulated (p < 0.05) in the area with Sargassaceae. Metabolism reconstruction of metagenome-assembled genomes identified Vibrio, Pseudoalteromonas, Alteromonas, and Exiguobacterium_A as primary OC degraders, with genomic capacities enriched in NO3– reduction and assimilatory sulfate reduction. Key environmental drivers─including the C/N ratio, dissolved organic carbon, total dissolved nitrogen (DON), and NO3–─shaped microbial metabolic activities during macroalgal decomposition. Our finding demonstrates that microbially driven OC degradation is a pivotal process coupled with nutrients cycling, advancing the mechanistic understanding of microbial carbon processing and its biogeochemical linkages during macroalgal decomposition in coastal ecosystems."

However, this paradigm may be oversimplified. In a cross‐latitude survey conducted in the northwestern Pacific Ocean (155°E, 28.5°N–41.5°N), bulk DOC concentrations were found to be relatively constant below 1,000 m with little variation across latitude. Despite this stability, compound‐specific analyses revealed unexpectedly high abundance of hydrolyzable amino acids, up to 1.1% of DOC, at depths of 1,000–4,000 m between 30°N and 36°N. This amino acid enrichment, doubling the typical levels observed in other deep‐sea basins and comparable to upper ocean values, reflected episodic inputs of semi‐labile DOC likely derived from actively settling fresh particles. These findings reveal hidden reservoirs of bioavailable DOC in the deep ocean, a feature not captured by bulk analysis, challenging the conventional view of deep‐sea DOC as predominantly refractory and stable."

Here, we demonstrate that Late Quaternary lake‐water unloading is a primary driver of fault slip and rift asymmetry in southern Tibet. Since the last interglacial (∼116 ka), significant water‐level drops of large lakes have induced crustal rebound and Coulomb stress changes. At Nam Co Lake, a ∼130 m drop produced ∼0.1 MPa of stress change, preferentially reactivating the adjacent fault and contributing ∼15 m of vertical displacement ∼23% of the total near Damxung. Likewise, the southern lakes (Yamzho Yumco and Puma Yumco) caused ∼70 m of vertical displacement on the adjacent fault. We establish that climatically‐controlled lake unloading can directly shape continental rifting by selectively enhancing fault slip on the lake‐bounding side of the rift, thereby amplifying its structural asymmetry. This highlights a significant, quantifiable role of surface processes in actively shaping tectonic deformation."

Lamb,"Flocculated Silt, Not Clay, Dominates River Suspended Sediment Load","River mud builds fertile floodplains, combats land loss due to sea level rise, and buries vast amounts of organic carbon. These processes rely on mud settling velocity, which is set by the grain size, mineralogy, and flocculation state of mud. Here we determined these factors using a suspended sediment data compilation from lowland rivers and new measurements from the Wax Lake Delta. Results show that rivers transport mostly silt‐sized grains (∼77% by mass). Although flocculation is classically associated with clay minerals, surprisingly most silt is flocculated (∼88%). Clay minerals dominate the clay size class (<2 μm) as expected, but this size is only a small percentage of the load (2.4%). Clay minerals are sparse among flocculated sediment (∼17%), implying that physical trapping of grains and binding by organic matter instead drive mud flocculation. Flocculated silt dominates river sediment load (∼62%), indicating a new paradigm for river sediment transport."

Here, we present the first planktic foraminifera iodine‐to‐calcium records in two Arabian Sea sediment cores: one located within the core of the modern OMZ in the north and other on its southeastern flank, enabling us to infer the lateral extent of the OMZ across the last glacial cycle. Our results indicate persistently stronger deoxygenation in the northern Arabian Sea throughout the last glacial cycle. The OMZ expanded southward during the Last Glacial Maximum—likely driven by reduced ventilation and increased productivity from enhanced winter mixing of nutrients. During deglaciation, it retreated northward as southern‐sourced intermediate waters intruded and productivity declined. We suggest that changes in ventilation and productivity, rather than water temperature, exerted the dominant control on Arabian Sea OMZ variability."

In the rapidly warming Arctic Ocean (AO), however, the contemporary distribution patterns and decadal variability of aerosol TE deposition remain poorly constrained, representing a critical gap in our understanding of current and future Arctic environmental changes. Here, we present extensive shipboard observations of 13 aerosol TEs across the AO during summer 2024. TE concentrations and the enrichment levels of these anthropogenic TEs rank among the lowest globally observed in the AO. The comparable or even elevated mineral‐ dominated TE concentrations and deposition fluxes (Al, Fe) in the Central AO than Peripheral AO challenge current dust models, potential influenced by sea ice/snow resuspension. Coal combustion (As, Se), non‐exhaust vehicular emissions (Ni, Cr), and metallurgical activities (Zn) emerged as primary anthropogenic sources, with detectable anthropogenic imprint even in mineral‐dominated TEs (e.g., Fe, Mn). Decadal comparisons with historical records revealed a near ten‐fold reduction in Pb and Cd enrichment, contrasting with a near‐doubling of V enrichment driven by intensified Arctic shipping. Moreover, the distinct aerosol Fe/Al fractionation between this study and historical observations likely arises from mixing inputs of anthropogenic Fe‐rich particles and permafrost‐derived Fe‐depleted weathering products, which amplify uncertainties in Fe flux estimations derived from dust proxy approaches. This study provides advance understanding of aerosol TE dynamics in the warming Arctic and provide critical constraints for polar biogeochemical cycles."

Salon,Synoptic Features Driving the CO2 Sink in the Mediterranean Sea in Winter,"The Mediterranean Sea is a weak sink for the atmospheric CO2 with the October‐March extended winter season characterized by the occurrence of high CO2 sink events. Here, we analyzed state‐of‐the‐art ocean and atmospheric reanalyses and observational data sets to investigate the variability of the winter sink and its relation with synoptic atmospheric features crossing the region in the period 1999–2020. High CO2 sink events are identified using classical extreme event approach with fixed threshold (95p) based on the CO2 daily flux distribution. First, we showed that these events are driven by large‐scale atmospheric configurations that produce stronger‐than‐average wind speed and colder‐than‐average 2 m and sea surface temperature patterns in the region. Second, a co‐location analysis was applied to assess the probability to detect an extra‐tropical cyclone at a fixed distance from the location of the events showing that the larger the event's magnitude, the higher the probability. In most of the cases, these cyclones originate within the Mediterranean region and are usually deeper, bigger in terms of size and characterized by a stronger circulation with respect to the systems that usually cross the region. By establishing a statistical relationship between high CO2 sink events and synoptic atmospheric activity, we emphasize the potential influence of the cyclone activity on the carbon budget of the Mediterranean Sea."

Ruijsch;A. J. Teuling;C. M. Taylor;G. J. Steeneveld;R. W. A. Hutjes,Clustered Land Restoration Projects Increase Cloud Formation in West African Drylands,"Land restoration projects are implemented across Africa to combat land degradation and climate change. By changing the vegetation cover, these projects can potentially impact cloud formation through changes in energy and water partitioning between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere. In West Africa, satellite observations have shown an increase in cloud formation over restored areas. However, even though the spatial arrangement of restored areas differs between regreening approaches, such as farmer‐managed natural regeneration, area protection or reforestation, it is unknown how the spatial pattern of restoration projects impacts cloud formation. In this study, we use the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) mesoscale atmospheric model to determine how land restoration affects cloud formation for a case study at the border of the transnational W‐Arly‐Pendjari national park complex, with a sharp boundary between forest and grassland. First, we carry out a sensitivity analysis to determine the underlying mechanisms of cloud formation over forest regions, after which we run 27 land restoration scenarios with low (21%), intermediate (43%), and high (85%) forest cover and varying spatial clustering to assess the impact of land restoration patterns on cloud formation. The results highlight that an intermediate forest cover with higher clustering increases cloud formation due to stronger mesoscale circulation. A small scale heterogeneity in forest cover or a high forest cover, on the other hand, inhibits cloud formation. Because clouds play an important role in the Earth's water and energy balance, these results provide important insight into how projects can be designed to increase their climate benefits."

However, the spatiotemporal variations in ALWC and aerosol pH, along with their impacts on SIA formation, remain poorly understood. Based on a‐year‐long field observations of aerosol chemical components, ALWC and aerosol pH for Lanzhou and Beijing were calculated using ISORROPIA II. Aerosol liquid water content in Lanzhou was highest in winter and lowest in summer (17.2 vs. 3.30 μg m−3), opposite to that of Beijing (10.6 vs. 22.9 μg m−3). Aerosol pH in both cities was highest in winter and lowest in summer (4.68 vs. 2.96 in Lanzhou, 5.34 vs. 2.88 in Beijing). Machine learning identified TNH3 (NH4+ + NH3), SO42−, NO3−, relative humidity (RH), and temperature as crucial factors influencing ALWC and aerosol pH in both cities, while Mg2+ and Cl− were unique factors influencing pH in Lanzhou during summer and winter, respectively. During pollution periods, the effect of ALWC on enhancing heterogeneous and aqueous‐phase reactions for SIA formation was more pronounced in Beijing than in Lanzhou, as elevated ALWC levels provided more reaction medium and facilitated solid‐to‐liquid phase transitions. Additionally, elevated pH notably enhanced aqueous‐phase sulfate production via the O3 oxidation pathway in winter in both cities and via the H2O2 oxidation pathway in summer in Beijing. This study highlights the heterogeneity of ALWC and pH, along with their distinct impacts on SIA formation, which should be considered in atmospheric models to improve predictions of secondary aerosol formation and better assess the associated environmental and climatic effects."

Here we investigate the size‐resolved microphysical and optical properties of aerosols in an urban area of the northern TP using a tandem system of a differential mobility analyzer, a condensation particle counter, and a single particle soot photometer. Under the 2021 summer conditions, the average particle number size distribution follows a lognormal pattern, peaking at ∼70 nm. Refractory black carbon (rBC) aerosols constitute 17.7% of the total particle population in the 100–750 nm mobility diameter (Dmob) range, with their proportion rising to over 50% for Dmob > 500 nm. Most rBC particles are externally mixed, while only 12.2% are thickly coated with non‐refractory materials. Externally mixed rBC particles show strong non‐sphericity, with a dynamic shape factor increasing from 1.8 at 115 nm to 2.8 at 750 nm, consistent with aggregate structures. In contrast, thickly coated rBC particles are nearly spherical, with coating thickness increasing with size. The total rBC mass estimated from size‐resolved measurements closely matches bulk rBC mass directly measured. rBC‐free particles exhibit slight non‐sphericity, with shape factor positively correlated with refractive index, likely due to dust contributions. Bulk scattering coefficients derived from size‐resolved data match those estimated under the well‐mixed spherical assumption. However, the later scheme—lacking observational constraints on morphology and mixing state—overestimates absorption by over a factor of three, thereby underestimating the single‐scattering albedo. These results provide key constraints for improving aerosol radiative forcing estimates and advancing understanding of aerosol–climate interactions over the TP."

Here, using field observations and model simulations, we explored ALWC at a subtropical coastal site in Shenzhen. We employed a multipath ALWC calculation framework for a comprehensive closure study of ALWC and quantified the contribution of organic matter to ALWC. Results showed average ALWC during the observation period was 8.8 μg m−3 nearly equivalent to the dry aerosol mass. Unexpectedly, organics—accounting for over 70% of the total mass concentration of PM2.5—contributed an average of 42% ± 15% to ALWC, representing the highest contribution reported to date in similar studies. This demonstrated that neglecting the organic compounds significantly underestimate ALWC, as was further revealed consequently reducing aerosol extinction capacity by approximately 17.2%. Unlike previous assumptions, we found that organic contribution highly depends on their hygroscopicity (κorg) not mass fraction or ambient humidity. Our study highlights the significant role of organics in regulating aerosols liquid water content urging their inclusion in air quality and climate simulation models with the implementation of carbon reduction strategies."

 Gantry-equipped facilities are used in a wide range of research fields, for instance geomorphology. Such setups allow for frequent and comprehensive measurements from sensors mounted on gantries or in fixed overhead position. These measurements often require high spatial and relative accuracy because of small scale morphology. Our objective is to develop high-performance data processing methods for our 20 by 3 m laboratory facility that is used for physical scale experiments on coastal morphology. We compare new and existing methods through quantification of spatial and relative errors in DEMs. Our new data processing methods incorporate SfM photogrammetry and computer graphics using a “base model” of our facility under idealized conditions. With this base model, we are able to successfully align all sensor outputs, creating large and geometrically consistent timeseries of orthomosaics and DEMs. Furthermore, the base model geometry provides for a gridded laserscan processing method, incorporating fixed extrinsic, intrinsic and distortion parameters of the sensors along the gantry. Compared to SfM photogrammetrically constructed DEMs, this new method shows greatly improved relative accuracy (0.74 mm compared to 0.97–4.18 mm) and spatial accuracy (2.13 mm compared to 2.39–8.25 mm). Moreover, we show that variations of extrinsic parameters of laserscan equipment along the gantry survey are significant, while these parameters are often assumed to be constant. Our improved methods may open up new research questions in experimental geomorphology and can be applied to other facilities, research fields and industries."

 Building height is critical for understanding urban morphology and promoting sustainable growth. Although numerous approaches using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical images have been proposed for estimating building height, two key challenges remain: 1) neglecting edge characteristics results in inaccurate building boundary delineation; and 2) failure to capture both global and local context reduces height estimation reliability. To address these limitations, a novel edge-aware and locally-aggregated Mamba model is proposed, namely EL-Mamba. In this model, an edge-aware module is designed to enhance building boundary representation through multi-scale Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filtering. Additionally, a local aggregation strategy is integrated into Mamba’s global scanning mechanism, which enables the network to effectively capture global and local context. Building height data from Wuhan and the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region in China is selected to evaluate EL-Mamba’s performance. The results indicate that compared to the four existing methods, EL-Mamba achieves the lowest root mean square error (RMSE), with values of 4.963 and 5.358 on the Wuhan and YRD datasets, respectively. Furthermore, EL-Mamba exhibits high computational efficiency and reliable generalization capability, indicating its significant potential for application in large-scale areas. Our implementation is available at: https://github.com/ohXu/EL_Mamba."

 This study investigates six indoor micro-environments on a residential university campus to assess the impact of sources/activities, occupancy, and ventilation on aerosol properties. Particle number concentration and size distributions were measured using an aerodynamic particle sizer (APS), along with CO2 levels, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Average PM10 concentrations were within WHO limits (45 μg m−3), with a 2-fold increase in PM mass in the administrative office due to higher occupancy. PM mass also increased by 2–5 times in naturally ventilated spaces compared to mechanically ventilated classrooms and hostel rooms. Similar patterns were observed in mess and canteen areas, where fine aerosol levels were higher. Although cooking activity in the kitchen led to high VOC concentrations (∼7 ppm), this did not significantly affect particle mass due to sub-micron dominance. Furthermore, infiltration of outdoor aerosol was evident in hostel rooms and classrooms, where the loss rates of coarser particles were higher. Despite the hostel room's larger room surface area-to-volume ratio and lower ventilation, the total PM concentration was higher than in the classrooms due to additional indoor sources. The highest PM exposure and respiratory deposition occurred in environments affected by outdoor infiltration, such as hostel rooms and classrooms with open windows. Based on International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) model, the highest mass deposition occurred in the head airways (71–81 %), followed by the pulmonary (12–22 %) and the lung (6–7 %) airways. Our findings highlight that PM concentration and deposition are influenced by multiple factors in each micro-environment, emphasizing the need for comprehensive IAQ assessments in building design."

Qomolangma (Everest) using the tethered balloon,"•The first tethered-balloon aerosol measurements were taken at Mt. Qomolangma, China. •The main sources of high-altitude aerosols were North Africa and South Asia. •The ∼6 km a.s.l. marked the boundary between local/regional and remote aerosol source. 
 The vertical distribution of aerosols is crucial for constraining their sources and transport mechanisms. However, high-precision in situ aerosol measurements remain limited in high-altitude regions. Here, we present the first high-resolution in situ vertical profiles of aerosol number concentration (Na) obtained from a tethered balloon at the Qomolangma (Mt. Everest) Station (QOMS) from May 14 to 26, 2022. Fourteen vertical profiles were categorized into three types using K-means clustering analysis: (I) high-altitude single-peak profiles, (II) linearly decreasing profiles, and (III) surface-accumulation profiles. Type I was associated with long-range transport of aerosols from North Africa and South Asia via the westerly jet stream and the South Asian monsoon, respectively, with a peak aerosol number concentration reaching 110 cm−3. Types II and III were related to the diurnal evolution of planetary boundary layer, dominated by local emissions. In Type III, the combined effects of a shallow planetary boundary layer and strong temperature inversions (inversion layer intensity: 0.26 °C per 100 m) led to the accumulation of aerosols near the surface, resulting in a surface aerosol number concentration of 203 cm−3. Analyses of effective diameter and backward trajectory models revealed a clear vertical stratification of aerosol sources, with ∼6 km a.s.l. acting as a critical boundary: Below this altitude, aerosols were mainly originated from local and regional (South Asia) sources, exhibiting a bimodal particle volume size distributions with peaks at 0.45 μm and 2 μm, while above it, they were dominated by remote sources from North Africa and the Middle East, showing a unimodal particle volume size distributions. These results advance understanding of vertical aerosols distributions over the southern Tibetan Plateau, and highlight the importance of altitude-dependent source and transport processes in assessing aerosol–climate interactions."

 In this work, aerosol absorption and scattering properties were investigated to gather additional information on aerosol types and sources. During a one-year campaign in Milan (Italy), a multi-wavelength aethalometer and a nephelometer were operated in parallel. Scattering coefficients are in general scarcely available at urban sites and this was the very first dataset for Milan and, more generally, for an urban site in the Po valley which is a well-known pollution hot-spot in Europe.Time patterns of the absorption and scattering coefficients throughout the year were investigated and Absorption/Scattering Ångström Exponents (AAE and SAE, respectively) were also computed to relate the optical properties to fossil vs. wood fuel combustion emission sources and to small vs. large particle size. The average daily trends for the absorption coefficients reflected the behaviour of the sources, with peaks in the morning due to traffic emissions observed in all seasons, and high values during the night as a consequence of lower mixing heights and, in winter, of domestic heating emissions, too.To gain knowledge about aerosol types and origin an innovative cluster analysis approach using AAE and SAE led to the identification of different aerosol types; this is an easy-to-implement approach which could be applied in monitoring networks for near-real time aerosol types identification. Moreover, episodes affected by specific aerosol types (i.e., fire event, desert dust air mass transport…) were singled out applying a more refined approach combining five intensive optical parameters."

 Accurate knowledge of precipitation at high spatio-temporal resolution is essential for climate studies and hydrological applications, particularly in mountainous regions where traditional models often underperform due to coarse resolution and sparse observational networks. In this study, we present a machine learning-based approach to enhance ERA5 reanalysis precipitation estimates using the satellite-derived IMERG (Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM) product as a reference. We focus on the Greater Alpine Region (GAR), using extreme gradient boosting combined with Shapley additive explanations to identify the most influential ERA5 variables. This method enables the creation of a new daily rainfall dataset, ML-IMEX-GAR (Machine Learning IMERG backward-EXtended precipitation dataset over GAR), at IMERG’s spatial resolution for the historical period 1960–2000.Compared to ERA5, ML-IMEX-GAR reduces the spatiotemporal RMSD against IMERG by approximately 14%, and achieves strong agreement with in-situ observational monthly data, with an R2 of 0.87. These findings demonstrate the potential of machine learning to correct reanalysis biases, improve historical precipitation reconstructions, and support climate change research in data-scarce, complex terrains."
