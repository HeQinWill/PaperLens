J. van Hinsbergen,Slow True Polar Wander Around Varying Equatorial Axes Since 320 Ma,"True polar wander (TPW), the rotation of the solid Earth relative to the spin axis, is driven by changes in the Earth's moment of inertia induced by mantle convection and may have influenced past climate and life. Long‐term TPW is typically inferred from large polar shifts in paleomagnetic apparent polar wander paths or computed directly by rotating them in a mantle reference frame. However, most apparent polar wander paths do not incorporate uncertainties in paleomagnetic data, which may bias estimates of TPW. Here, we provide new quantitative estimates of TPW since 320 Ma by placing a recent global apparent polar wander path corrected for age bias and with improved uncertainty quantification in existing mantle reference frames. We find large amplitude (>10°) but slow TPW rotations that predominantly occurred about two equatorial axes that are approximately orthogonal. During the Triassic and Jurassic, a ∼24° TPW oscillation occurred about an axis at ∼15°W, close to the present‐day TPW axis at ∼10°E. In contrast, the TPW axis was located at ∼85°E during a smaller oscillation (∼6–10°) over the past ∼80 Ma, as well as between 260 and 320 Ma. We propose that these varying TPW axes reflect changes in the distribution and flux of subduction in the Tethyan and Pacific realms. We find no evidence for previously postulated fast (>1°/Ma) TPW oscillations in the Cretaceous and Late Jurassic. Finally, we propose that calibrating mantle convection models against reconstructed TPW will improve our understanding of mantle dynamics and the drivers of TPW itself."

Connectivity is dynamic and modulated by climate variability, but its evaluation with traditional tools remains elusive over spatio‐temporal scales of climate interest. Here machine learning helps exploring large‐scale connectivity in the WCR over nearly three decades.

Currently, physical dispersion models and satellite observations are the primary methods used to forecast and monitor volcanic ash clouds, but each has limitations. Leveraging their respective advantages and effectively integrating physical dispersion models and satellite data are key to improving the accuracy of volcanic ash dispersion forecasts. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) can be used to optimize model predictions of volcanic ash dispersion by assimilating observational data, thereby combining the complementary benefits of predictions and observations. In this study, an EnKF‐based data assimilation method is presented that combines satellite observations with a volcanic ash dispersion model (HYSPLIT) to further improve the accuracy of volcanic ash dispersion predictions. The eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull (Iceland) during May 2010 were used to evaluate the performance of this approach. The results indicate that the forecasts optimized using data assimilation show marginal improvements in the accuracy of the spatial distribution, mass loading, and cloud top height of the ash cloud at times even outperforming the corresponding satellite retrievals. This method addresses the issue of insufficient model initialization accuracy and continuously optimizes predictions through the ongoing assimilation of satellite observations, thereby enhancing the accuracy of model predictions."

Williams,The Seasonal Variation of the Direct Current Global Electric Circuit: 2. Further Analysis Based on Simulations,"Both simulations and measurements indicate the existence of stable annual behavior of the global electric circuit (GEC) intensity, but the exact pattern of variation is very difficult to reliably determine. Here we present further analysis of this problem using the results of ionospheric potential (IP) simulations with two different models of atmospheric dynamics. From a theoretical perspective, the annual variation of the GEC is eventually determined by seasonal changes in the distribution of convection, associated with the annual cycle of insolation. Simulations clearly demonstrate that the contribution to the IP from the vicinity of the equator has two maxima following the equinoxes, whereas the contribution of nonequatorial latitudes in each hemisphere has one maximum during the local summer. The resulting seasonal variation of the GEC, being the sum of three clear patterns offsetting each other, is rather subtle, and its prediction in simulations may vary depending on the model and IP parameterization. It is likely that the actual seasonal variation of the diurnal mean GEC intensity has one pronounced maximum during the Northern Hemisphere summer and one pronounced minimum during the Northern Hemisphere winter, in agreement with potential gradient measurements in Antarctica and in agreement with the larger portion of the Northern Hemisphere occupied by land. Physical parameters characterizing convection do not provide a very good measure of contributions to the IP, notably overestimating the role of equatorial latitudes; by including surface air temperature in the IP parameterization, one can achieve a better agreement between simulations and observations."

Understanding the emission reduction pathway under SI influence is crucial for achieving long‐term O3 attainment. However, the role of SI in tropospheric O3 pollution in China remains poorly understood. To develop effective O3 control strategies, we employed a localized comprehensive air quality model and the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model. We found that SI contributions vary seasonally, peaking in spring at lower latitudes and then delays northward progressively as latitude increases, with peak SI contributions at higher latitudes occur in June. Spatially, SI impacts surface O3 most in high‐latitude regions, decreasing with lower latitudes. As O3‐laden air reaches the surface, O3 control strategies become less effective, necessitating additional emission reductions. As SI contributions increase, the optimal emission reduction pathway shifts: for the Beijing‐Tianjin‐Hebei and Pearl River Delta regions during the spring seasons from 2020 to 2023, it changes from “VOC only” to “NOx only” at thresholds of 13.57 and 8.39 ppb, respectively. For Yangtze River Delta, Fenwei Plain, and Chengyu, the “VOC only” path remains optimal. This study provides valuable insights for policymakers to develop effective strategies to mitigate SI's negative effects."

Mejia,Mesoscale Convective Systems Tracking Method Intercomparison (MCSMIP): Application to DYAMOND Global km‐Scale Simulations,"Global kilometer‐scale models represent the future of Earth system modeling, enabling explicit simulation of organized convective storms and their associated extreme weather. Here, we comprehensively evaluate tropical mesoscale convective system (MCS) characteristics in the DYAMOND (DYnamics of the atmospheric general circulation modeled on non‐hydrostatic domains) simulations for both summer and winter phases. Using 10 different feature trackers applied to simulations and satellite observations, we assess MCS frequency, precipitation, and other key characteristics. Substantial differences (a factor of 2–3) arise among trackers in observed MCS frequency and their precipitation contribution, but model‐observation differences in MCS statistics are more consistent across trackers. DYAMOND models are generally skillful in simulating tropical mean MCS frequency, with multi‐model mean biases ranging from −2%–8% over land and −8%–8% over ocean (summer vs. winter). However, most DYAMOND models underestimate MCS precipitation amount (23%) and their contribution to total precipitation (17%). Biases in precipitation contributions are generally smaller over land (13%) than over ocean (21%), with moderate inter‐model variability. While models better simulate MCS diurnal cycles and cloud shield characteristics, they overestimate MCS precipitation intensity and underestimate stratiform rain contributions (up to a factor of 2), particularly over land, albeit observational uncertainties exist. Additionally, models exhibit a wide range of precipitable water in the tropics compared to reanalysis and satellite observations, with many models showing exaggerated sensitivity of MCS precipitation intensity to precipitable water. The MCS metrics developed here provide process‐oriented diagnostics to guide future model development."

This study, based on the observations from the 2022 CFACT (Cold Fog Amongst Complex Terrain) field study in the Heber Valley of northern Utah, demonstrates an interconnection between turbulence and the occurrence of NPF. Using a spatially distributed boundary layer instrumentation, a novel feature of CFACT, three case studies depict unique boundary layer conditions that modulate the development of NPF characterized by sustained turbulence and weak intermittent turbulence. Quantitative analysis using in situ measurements and derived variables demonstrate that periods of weak intermittent turbulence hinder particle growth, whereas sustained turbulence helps modulate NPF. These findings provide new insights into the physical drivers of NPF, underscoring the role of turbulence in impacting particle formation with the ABL."

This study investigates how the SPV prolongs the persistence of the NAM on the subseasonal timescales during winter. Our results suggest that the quasi‐geostrophic refractive index (RI) at the high latitudes of mid‐to‐upper troposphere (HL‐MTUT) may serve as a critical mediator in this process. Specifically, the preestablished SPV anomaly can persistently alter the RI at HL‐MTUT through directly modifying the vertical curvature of zonal wind in this region. The RI anomaly at HL‐MTUT, which reflects changes in the waveguide properties of zonal flow, can affect the meridional propagation of tropospheric eddies and is a key factor in the eddy‐zonal flow interactions associated with the NAM. Acting as a mediator, the HL‐MTUT RI will transmit the persistent anomalous signal of the SPV, which has a longer timescale compared to tropospheric variability, into the intrinsic dynamic processes of NAM. Consequently, the SPV will prolong the persistence of NAM. The above mechanism is further supported by a comparison of active‐SPV and inactive‐SPV years: In active‐SPV years, a greater persistence of the NAM is accompanied by a correspondingly greater persistence in both the vertical curvature of zonal wind and the RI at HL‐MTUT."

The concentrations of the three saccharides, upon normalization by BB‐derived potassium, displayed a distinct and consistent depletion during daytime hours from 08:00 to 16:00, which follows an exponential decay pattern. We calculated individual daytime decay rate constants of the three saccharides by utilizing their day‐by‐day decay kinetics.

Compelling evidences have shown that N2O emissions are temperature dependent, offering insights into their intrinsic temperature sensitivity. However, when extrapolating from laboratory‐controlled to field‐ambient conditions, it remains unclear how this temperature sensitivity varied across cropland fields subject to diverse environmental and anthropogenic constraints. We performed a comprehensive meta‐analysis of 144 field‐warming observations worldwide, aiming to address the magnitude, heterogeneity, and drivers of such apparent temperature sensitivity. The results showed that mean growing‐season field‐scale N2O emissions were not strongly temperature dependent with low averaged activation energy (0.32 eV) compared with that of laboratory‐scale observations (0.62 eV). At site levels, the spatial variation in such temperature sensitivity was primarily driven by the interactions of nitrogen fertilization, edaphic, and climatic variables. This analysis also identified a crucial yet frequently overlooked role of soil pH in nonlinearly modulating such temperature sensitivity. Our findings provide evidence for understanding nitrogen and climate feedback by capturing the soil‐climate‐management constrained warming response and highlight the importance of incorporating these constraints into models to improve prediction accuracy."

Using this approach, we investigate the concurrent effects of the 2019 European summer drought and an increase in extreme heat days under RCP2.6 (mitigation scenario) and RCP8.5 (business‐as‐usual scenario) on land‐atmosphere interactions, evaporative cooling potential, and bioclimatic conditions in Innsbruck, Austria. Results indicate that water‐limiting conditions such as those from summer 2019 impair evaporative capacities of ecological systems and augment diurnal and nocturnal heat transfer between the soil, surface and atmosphere in the city, if not irrigated extensively. Combined with the projected increase in daily maximum temperature of extreme heat days by 3.9 K under RCP8.5, we see the development of extreme human heat stress, with a mean Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) exceeding 38°C across the study area. Additionally, we found that maintaining a prevailing evaporative cooling effect over an area requires a degree of surface sealing less than 11% and unrestricted water supply.

 The interplay between strong long-range interactions and the coherent driving contribute to the formation of complex patterns, symmetry, and novel phases of matter in many-body systems. However, long-range interactions may induce an additional dissipation channel, resulting in non-Hermitian many-body dynamics and the emergence of exceptional points in spectrum. Here, we report experimental observation of interaction-induced exceptional points in cold Rydberg atomic gases, revealing the breaking of charge-conjugation parity symmetry.

We record the area enclosed by hysteresis loops and investigate the dynamics of hysteresis loops. The reported exceptional points and hysteresis trajectories in cold Rydberg atomic gases provide valuable insights into the underlying non-Hermitian physics in many-body systems, allowing us to study the interplay between long-range interactions and non-Hermiticity.

However, current chemical vapor deposition (CVD) graphene-based barrier films can not provide sufficient moisture barrier performance, suggesting a lack of understanding in mechanism that dominates water diffusion in/through graphene stacks. Herein, we fabricate large-area graphene barrier films with a record-low water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of 5 × 10−5 g/(m2·day), two orders of magnitude lower than previous works, in which two stacked Janus graphene films are intercalated by toluidine blue O (TBO) sub-monolayer: one side of graphene is decorated with fluorine- and oxygen-containing groups to allow crack-free transfer, while the other side is functionalized with hydroxyl groups to trap water. The intercalated TBO further blocks water transport due to a strong water-TBO interaction.

 Accurate snow cover parameter assessment and mapping at a fine resolution can have profound implications for our understanding of the planet’s water balance and energy dynamics. Passive microwave (PMW) remote sensing is among the most effective methods for snow depth (SD) retrieval. However, significant uncertainties persist in SD retrieval and mapping due to snow characteristic variations, forest canopy interference, and low spatial resolution of PMW. To overcome these limitations, a novel method considering multiple influencing factors was proposed by integration a radiation transfer model with a machine learning model for SD retrieval, and a 500 m resolution SD dataset (NCSD) was generated for 1980 − 2020 in Northeast China by combining downscaling model. The validation against independent ground observations revealed that the MAE, RMSE, and R values for NCSD were 4.39 cm, 6.65 cm and 0.77, respectively. Compared to existing SD products, NCSD data effectively avoid mixed pixel issues, improved SD retrieval performance, and reveal more refined snow cover spatiotemporal patterns. Additionally, the NCSD results indicated that the annual average SD in Northeast China exhibited an increasing trend from 1980 to 2020 (0.26 cm/10a, p > 0.05). However, a notable inflection point occurred in 2000, and a subsequent decreasing trend occurred from 2000 to 2020 (0.49 cm/10a, p > 0.05). Overall, the creation of NCSD effectively filled the gap related to high-resolution SD data, and facilitated the development of hydrological studies and climate change at the basin scale."

 Gross primary productivity (GPP) plays a crucial role in the carbon exchange between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems. Eddy covariance (EC) method can obtain accurate GPP at the site level, but the sparse distribution limits representativeness. Satellite solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) serves as emerging data of large-scale GPP, yet there are still limitations in its conversion to GPP and spatiotemporal coverage. This study proposes a transfer learning (SIFEC-TL) method to estimate long-term global GPP with high accuracy by combining constraints from SIF and EC data. SIF data are taken as the source domain that provides the spatial information for pre-training, and EC GPP in the target domain provides precise GPP for the machine learning model fine-tuning. To verify the performance of SIFEC-TL, the results are compared with those from machine learning models that use only SIF or EC GPP alone (SIFML and ECML). The results indicate that the SIFEC-TL model demonstrates stronger spatial scalability compared to the SIFML and ECML models, with R2 increasing by 0.132 and 0.036. The SIFEC-TL more effectively captures inter-annual GPP dynamics with underestimation/overestimation over high/low values in the SIFML and ECML models being well corrected. Furthermore, three different SIF-based GPP are also used as source domains, and the results showed that they only affect pre-training but the final accuracy after fine-tuning remains similar, which indicates SIFEC-TL can obtain stable GPP estimation accuracy regardless of the spatiotemporal coverage of SIF data and its conversion to GPP."

 Spatial association reveals the interconnected nature of geographical phenomena, describing the interactions and influences of environmental variables across geographic space. Path analysis can explore complex causal relationships between variables by analyzing path coefficients. However, in large-scale studies, path analysis methods are often affected by local effects, which can influence the accuracy and reliability of the results. This study develops a local pathway association (LPA) model to analyze local effects of pathways among variables that integrates path analysis and local pathway coefficient estimations. The LPA model was employed to investigate the spatial heterogeneity of spatial associations between factors such as climate, soil, and vegetation on the Tibetan Plateau. Results indicate that the LPA model effectively reveals the spatial variation characteristics of local path coefficients between geographic variables, avoiding the underestimation or overestimation of global path coefficients in traditional path coefficient studies. The developed LPA model provides an effective technical tool for revealing spatial differences in path associations of large-scale spatial studies. The strong data compatibility of the LPA model allows for broad applicability across various disciplines and a deeper understanding of localized interactions and variations in complex geospatial and Earth systems."

 Terrace agriculture plays a vital role in mountainous regions by preventing soil erosion, optimizing land use, and supporting local ecosystems. However, research on the global distribution of terraces is limited due to the lack of unified automatic identification model. Despite the rapid advancements in deep-learning architectures in recent years, their performance in extracting terrace maps still needs investigation. To address this limitation, this study compares the performance of eight state-of-the-art deep learning models, including UNet, HRNet, DeepLabv3+, TransUNet, Segmenter, PVT v2, Swin-Unet, and PerSAM. Sentinel-2 imagery was selected for its spectral properties, while Digital Elevation Model (DEM) imagery was chosen for detailed topographic information. UNet outperformed others in terrace identification, achieving an overall accuracy of 92.8 % and a mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) of 75.9 %. The entire data processing workflow, using Google Earth Engine for data acquisition, Google Drive for storage, Google Earth Pro for computational capabilities, and the T4 GPU in cloud computing resources, requires approximately 625 h. As a result, the Global Terrace Map (GTM) was generated at 10-meter resolution for 2022. The total terrace area was estimated at 853,161 km2, accounting for about 5.1 % of global cropland. The countries with the most extensive terraced areas, as identified, are China (298,908 km2, 18 % of total cropland), Ethiopia (127,266 km2, 47 %), Kenya (36,385 km2, 37 %), India (34,485 km2, 2 %), and Democratic Republic of the Congo (31,422 km2, 21 %). This pioneering global terrace map is anticipated to bridge a significant data gap in the field of resilient agriculture. It will offer invaluable insights into the spatial distribution and attributes of terraced farming systems, along with their roles in enhancing food security and promoting environmental sustainability."

 Knowledge graphs (KGs) can describe the nature and relationships of geographic entities and are an essential knowledge base for realizing geospatial digital twins (GDTs). However, existing KGs make it challenging to describe dynamic geographic entities under geographic spatiotemporal evolution accurately. Furthermore, they are constrained by the professional backgrounds of their users, which hinders updates and communication. Therefore, the research constructed an “event-object-state” three-domain associated GDT-oriented KG, proposed a large language model (LLM) −driven KG dynamic update algorithm, and established a KG intelligent Q&A method integrating LLM. We developed a prototype system and selected an earthquake disaster as a typical geographic event for experimental analysis. The results showed that the proposed method can reflect the space, time, state, evolution process, and interrelationships of geographic entities in a more comprehensive way, support users to build, update, and query KGs using natural language, with an updating efficiency of less than 1 min, and an updating quality comparable to that of manual updating by experts. Compared with the traditional KGs, our method can represent virtual geographic entities and has significant advantages in intelligence and automation, which effectively breaks down professional barriers and supports the construction of GDTs with the need for rapid updating of knowledge."

Lieb;Ian C. Faloona,Deducing atmospheric conditions that contribute to elevated pollution events in the Salton Sea Air Basin,"•Deep stratospheric intrusions and unregulated soil NOxemissions could be responsible for continued O3exceedances. •Biomass burning, agricultural soil emissions, and wind-blown dust are the main sources of high PM2.5levels in Calexico. •Extreme PM10levels are mostly associated with strong wind events that occur in the spring and autumn. 
 The Salton Sea Air Basin (SSAB) has struggled to comply with National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for three federally regulated air pollutants: ozone, PM2.5, and PM10. Seasonal and diurnal patterns are presented along with their long-term decadal trends to better understand the relationship between the meteorological setting and air pollution levels as well as their deviations. This analysis revealed that ozone exceedances are no longer dominated by regulated NOx emissions but rather are primarily controlled by regional agricultural soil emissions. These emissions are also likely influenced by stratospheric ozone transport to the deep convective boundary layers unique to the area. Observed peak ozone levels are still ∼2–5 ppb lower on weekends indicative of a NOx-limited regime during the warm season. This implies that local ozone production is directly dependent on NOx levels, which emphasizes the need to address unregulated sources of NOx pollution such as those from heavily fertilized, arid agricultural soils. Additionally, strong correlations of PM2.5 with NOx, PM10, and CO, indicate that influences from combustion sources as well as agricultural soils, secondary formation, and mechanical processes are all important sources of PM2.5 production in Calexico, the main city of PM2.5 nonattainment on the southern border with Mexico. These PM2.5 exceedances occur in winter months, when low ventilation accumulates localized PM2.5 precursor emissions. Source apportionment of PM2.5 was assessed using non-negative matrix factorization of data from the Chemical Speciation Network (CSN) site in Calexico. The CSN data analysis for Calexico identifies biomass burning as the dominant source of high PM2.5 concentrations, followed by agricultural soil emissions and wind-blown dust. In the immediate vicinity of the Salton Sea, less frequent PM2.5 exceedances seem to be associated with occasional windstorms. Further, analysis of PM10 exceedance days indicates that high winds, primarily westerly, are a critical factor, and the low PM2.5/PM10 ratios suggest minimal contribution from photochemical or combustion sources. Furthermore, the correlation of PM10 with wind speed across various sites underscores the importance of dust resuspension and soil erosion. This comprehensive assessment highlights the complexity of air quality problems in the SSAB. Additionally, it emphasizes the need for targeted and localized air quality management strategies for this region which, despite its low population, suffers some of the worst air pollution impacts in the state of California."

 The chemical and bioreactivity properties of photooxidation products emitted during high radical exposure conditions were characterized. The purpose was to simultaneously investigate the influences of the toxicity of photooxidation products from common anthropogenic and biogenic precursors (toluene, m-xylene and isoprene). The major ring-opening compounds were identified as pyruvic acid (C3H4O3), glyceric acid (C3H6O4), succinic acid (C4H6O4), malic acid (C4H6O5), tartaric acid (C4H6O6), 2,3-dihydroxy-glutaric acid (C5H8O6), glycolic acid (C2H4O3) and oxalic acid (C2H2O4) originated from the toluene and xylene-derived secondary organic aerosol (SOA) products in the analysis. The average LDH level from isoprene-derived SOA (0.77 μg/ml) was higher than the control (0.75 μg/ml) and the DCFH level from isoprene-derived SOA (228.73 RFU) was also higher than the control (215.18 RFU). In addition, the average LDH level from toluene-derived SOA (0.86 μg/ml) was higher than the isoprene (0.77 μg/ml). The IL-6 level from toluene-derived SOA (182.82 pg/ml) was higher than the xylene-derived SOA (173.00 pg/ml). These suggested enhanced cytotoxicity and cell membrane damage under toluene-derived SOA exposure. The isoprene-derived SOA induced higher DCFH levels of (228.73 RFU), implying the potential effects of particulate matter from SOA on the oxidative potential and rising cellular oxidant burden. The overall results suggest that the oxidation products can potentially cause various cytotoxic effects. This finding warrants further investigation into the toxicity profiles of SOA and regulation of SOA pollution."

 A significant challenge exists in the interconnections among tropical forests, aerosols, and climate resilience, as aerosols profoundly influence weather patterns and air quality. Emissions from forest fires and deforestation increase aerosol concentrations, disrupting cloud formation and precipitation, which undermines the ability of tropical forests to purify air, sequester carbon, and support biodiversity. This review aims to synthesize recent research on aerosol science related to tropical forest ecosystems and their roles in air quality and climate regulation. This review highlights the role of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs)—such as isoprene, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes—in ozone formation and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) generation in tropical forests. Biomass burning and anthropogenic emissions enhance BVOC oxidation, altering SOA characteristics like particle size and hygroscopicity. Land cover changes, such as converting forests to plantations, also affect BVOC emissions, potentially increasing ozone levels in the upper troposphere. Additionally, the review explores hydrogen sulfide emissions from mangrove forests, emissions of primary biological aerosol particles, and the impacts of soil dust and mineral aerosols from regions including the Amazon and Southeast Asia. The effects of biomass burning in these areas vary by combustion efficiency and fuel types, with implications for cloud dynamics and air quality. Moreover, key transport routes, such as trans-Atlantic movements of African smoke, exacerbate aerosol impacts on soil fertility and air quality. In Southeast Asia, biomass burning increases particulate matter, impacting air quality and regional climate. Finally, policy recommendations and current research gaps are presented to help policymakers and scientists enhance sustainable forest management toward climate resilience in tropical ecosystems amid ongoing environmental changes."

 Soil moisture plays a crucial role in fog formation and duration, yet its impact has not been sufficiently assessed in fog numerical simulations. This study evaluates the impact of soil moisture constraints (SMC) on fog simulation over East China using the WRF-Chem model, incorporating a series of soil moisture observation data from the China Meteorological Administration and reanalysis products. Additionally, the study assesses the improvements achieved through the meteorological observation nudging (MON) assimilation scheme. Results indicate that the MON scheme significantly improves the simulation accuracy of fog coverage, with the threat score (TS) improving from 65.1 % to 71.2 %, alongside better simulation of key meteorological variables. When combined with MON, SMC derived from observational data further enhances accuracy of fog area simulation, achieving a TS of 72.3 %. Notably, SMC derived from observational soil moisture (Obs-SMC) data outperforms SMC from reanalysis products (ERA5-SMC and FNL-SMC) in overall fog simulation. For RH, MON raised the average index of agreement (IOA) from 0.67 to 0.69 and reduced the normalized mean error (NME) from 24.4 % to 21.7 %. With Obs-SMC, the IOA further increased to 0.83, and the NME dropped to 14.3 %, demonstrating notable improvements in simulation performance. Process analysis suggests that the Obs-SMC further enhances surface evaporation, facilitating near-surface fog condensation and increasing the regional mean liquid water content (LWC) by approximately 0.01 g/kg. Our findings highlight the critical role of accurate soil moisture data in improving fog simulation, implicating a valuable approach for enhancing fog forecasting accuracy."

 The simulation of tropical cyclone (TC) genesis in the North Atlantic (NA) has long posed a challenge for coupled models, showing significant inter-model spread of TC numbers in the NA main development region and its ratio to the Northern Hemisphere total. This ratio is referred to as relative tropical cyclone genesis frequency (RTCGF). By explicitly detecting TCs from the historical simulations of 30 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models, we found that the RTCGF ranges from 0.2 % to 18.9 %, compared to 14.8 % in the observations. This diversity in RTCGF across models is mainly affected by large-scale conditions and African easterly waves, whereas the impact from model resolution is limited. The differences in large-scale conditions originate from the relative sea surface temperature (SST) in the NA compared to the tropics. A higher relative SST triggers the convergence of westerly from the Pacific Ocean and easterly from Africa toward the NA, which enhances low-troposphere vorticity, mid-troposphere ascending motion, and moist convection, creating more favorable large-scale conditions for TC genesis. However, vertical wind shear is less affected by relative SST and has a minor role in the inter-model spread of TC genesis. Further analysis demonstrates that the horizontal resolution is not the key for accurately simulating relative SST and the activity of African easterly waves in the current coupled models. Our findings suggest that model physics may be more relevant to TC activity in coupled models with a resolution of approximately 1–2°."

 Previous research on the effects of Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) on tropical cyclones (TCs) in the western North Pacific (WNP) has primarily focused on the tropical Atlantic region. This study investigates the relationship between the extra-equatorial North Atlantic tripole (NAT) sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) pattern and landfalling TCs in the WNP. The findings reveal a significant positive lead-lag correlation between the negative–positive–negative NAT SSTA pattern and the genesis of landfalling TCs in the WNP. In high NAT years, more TCs form in the WNP and recurve northeastward to make landfall over the Korean Peninsula and Japan, while fewer TCs move westward or northwestward. The NAT tropical cold SSTA transmits signals to the WNP and modulates TC genesis via two ways: the eastward pathway through the North Indian Ocean and the westward pathway through the eastern North Pacific. This enhances cyclonic vorticity in the WNP monsoon trough region, facilitating increased TC genesis frequency in the region and thereby increasing the genesis frequency of landfalling TCs. Furthermore, the NAT SSTA influences the tracks of these landfalling TCs. The NAT SSTA pattern persists into summer, triggering a mid-high latitude teleconnection wave train that propagates downstream. This induces an anomalous anticyclone over Northeast Asia and an accompanying cyclonic circulation to its west. This circulation leads to the recurving of TC tracks rather than a northwestward or westward direction. The results suggest that the NAT SSTA is a potential predictor of TC formations and track patterns in the WNP."

 Satellite remote sensing has become essential for observing precipitable water vapor (PWV). However, limitations in sensor performance, algorithmic assumptions, and estimation methods can result in errors in satellite retrievals of PWV, which limits the accuracy of these products. This study analyzes the bias and post-processing correction of the Medium Resolution Spectral Imager-II (MERSI-II) PWV operational products aboard China's polar-orbiting meteorological satellite, Fengyun-3D. Initially, a global quality assessment is conducted using AERONET observations from May 2019 to May 2020. Afterward, variations in the product's bias are analyzed using various influencing factors. Validation results show that the four PWV products of MERSI-II tend to underestimate values to varying degrees. Bias varies based on factors such as solar zenith angle, view zenith angle, solar azimuth angle, view azimuth angle, digital elevation model, and normalized difference vegetation index. Based on the bias analysis, factors are selected, and a post-processing correction is implemented on the PWV products using the Extreme Gradient Boosting model. Post-processing correction results show that the mean bias of the PWV products is nearly zero, with minimal impact from the selected parameters. The correlation coefficient of the three-channel weighted product is 0.975, and 76.0 % of the matchups fall within the expected error envelope of ±(0.03 + 0.1 × PWVAERONET). These research findings assist in minimizing bias and enhancing the quality of MERSI-II PWV products."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108124,False,Atmospheric Research,该论文主要研究了20世纪末东北亚地区夏季水汽压亏缺的年代际突变及其驱动机制。研究发现，1998年左右东北亚夏季水汽压亏缺显著增加，并通过随机森林模型确定地表温度是主要影响因素，而地表温度的变化受到大气环流变化的影响。进一步分析表明，热带中太平洋和地中海海表温度的突变与东北亚水汽压亏缺的突变同时发生。通过大气环流模式模拟，揭示了太平洋海表温度下降和地中海海表温度升高如何通过影响大气环流，共同导致东北亚地区干旱加剧的机制。虽然该研究涉及大气过程，但其重点在于气候变化和区域干旱，而非直接使用大气环境遥感技术进行空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['vapor pressure deficit', 'sea surface temperature', 'atmospheric circulation', 'Northeast Asia', 'climate change']",Zichen Song;Cheng Sun;Dong Xiao;Menghao Dong;Wei Lou;Linfeng Shi,Abrupt vapor pressure deficit changes over Northeast Asia during 1990s linked to combined Mediterranean-Pacific SST shifts,"•Northeast Asia's summer VPD rose 20-30% around 1998 due to warming-induced circulation/radiation shifts •Tropical Pacific and Mediterranean SST shifts drive Northeast Asia anticyclones via different pathways. •Pacific cooling weakens jet and Mediterranean warming excites waves, jointly drying Northeast Asia. 
 Vapor pressure deficit (VPD) is a crucial indicator of atmospheric dryness and humidity, influencing the land-atmosphere water exchange process. However, the mechanisms underlying VPD decadal abrupt change (DAC) and their impacts remain unclear. Here, we investigate the DACs of summer VPD in Northeast Asia during the late 20th century and explore the driving mechanisms. Our analysis reveals a significant increase of 20–30 % in summer VPD around 1998. Random forest modeling identifies surface temperature as the primary contributor, driven by atmospheric circulation shifts altering radiation patterns. The DAC of summer VPD in Northeast Asia coincided with abrupt sea surface temperature (SST) changes in both the tropical central Pacific and the Mediterranean Sea. AGCM simulations shed light on the underlying mechanisms driving the increasing DAC of summer VPD in Northeast Asia. These analyses reveal that a rapid decline in tropical central Pacific SST weakened the westerly jet stream. This weakening, in turn, led to a latitudinally uniform distribution of geopotential height and wind fields, ultimately triggering the formation of a high-pressure system over Northeast Asia. Additionally, a potential wave-like teleconnection pattern from the rapidly warming Mediterranean Sea may have further intensified this high-pressure system, exacerbating atmospheric dryness in the region. These findings highlight the role of synergistic SST anomalies in different regions driving atmospheric circulation changes, ultimately impacting regional VPD and dryness in Northeast Asia."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108119,False,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文主要关注的是在全球变暖背景下，干旱、高温和大风等极端天气事件同时发生的可能性增加，以及这些事件对农业生产和野火的影响。研究使用了ERA5再分析数据和CMIP6气候模型模拟数据，分析了历史时期和未来时期全球范围内（包括作物区和火灾发生区域）复合干热风事件的空间分布和变化。虽然该研究涉及大气条件，但它更侧重于气候变化对地表的影响，而不是大气环境遥感技术的应用，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,"['compound dry-hot-windy events', 'climate change', 'agricultural impacts', 'wildfires', 'temperature', 'wind speed', 'relative humidity']",Qian Ma;Zengchao Hao;Yitong Zhang;Yuting Pang,Likelihoods of compound dry-hot-windy events are projected to increase under global warming,"•Higher frequency of compound DHW events mainly resides in regimes near the equator. •Future likelihoods of compound DHW events are projected to increase under the SSP585 scenario. •Increased risk of compound DHW events is projected in crop regions and burned areas. 
 Dry, hot, and windy conditions are meteorological factors that can affect vegetation variability. Moreover, the combination of them, as represented by concurrences of low relative humidity, high temperature, and high wind speed, can lead to even higher impacts on agricultural production or wildfires, which is still under-assessed. Here we investigate spatial pattern of and changes in the compound dry-hot-windy (DHW) events in historical periods (1951–2014) and future periods (2037–2100) across global areas (including crop regions and burned areas) based on the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) and climate model simulations from Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project 6 (CMIP6). An increase in the likelihood (or frequency) of compound DHW events is observed in historical periods and can be even higher in the future across global land areas. Specifically, the projected frequency of compound DHW events in the future period under the SSP585 scenario is around 2.5 times the value in historical periods. Moreover, an increase in compound DHW events is also projected in ten main wheat exporters, in particular for Europe, Argentina, Turkey, and Brazil. Over global burned areas, the higher risk of compound DHW events during fire seasons is also projected in the future. Findings from this study can be useful for agricultural planning and natural resources management under a changing climate."
