10.1088/1748-9326/adac7a,False,Environmental Research Letters,该论文主要关注灾害和气候风险管理中的系统性风险，以及如何通过系统方法来增强决策。它探讨了灾害风险降低的经济、社会和环境协同效益（即多重红利），并强调了在不同系统边界（例如，个体系统和系统之系统）中，这些红利如何通过相互依赖性产生。论文旨在整合评估干预措施，从而在不同尺度上增加协同效应，减少灾害风险降低的权衡。虽然该研究涉及环境方面，但其核心并非大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,[],Stefan Hochrainer-Stigler;Reinhard Mechler;Oscar Higuera Roa;Michaela Bachmann;Robert Šakić Trogrlić;John Handmer;Ulf Dieckmann,Understanding multiple resilience dividends and system boundaries in disaster- and climate-risk management: a systems approach for enhanced decision-making,"Challenges in managing multi-hazards and multi-risks within complex risk landscapes—where numerous stakeholders with different priority needs and risk perceptions interact—remain unresolved. Here we suggest ways to tackle these pressing challenges in an integrated and comprehensive manner by applying key concepts from systemic risk research to triple- and multiple-dividend approaches. The central idea is that additional dividends (i.e., economic, social, and environmental co-benefits of disaster-risk reduction that go beyond loss-reduction benefits) can be related to different system boundaries (e.g., individual systems and system of systems) through their interdependencies. This approach allows for an integrated evaluation of interventions that may be more beneficial across various scales and for corresponding threats, thus increasing synergies (or co-benefits) and decreasing asynergies (or trade-offs) of disaster-risk reduction in a systemic way. Importantly, triple and multiple dividends, along with their related tools and approaches, can be seen as part of a ‘dividend continuum’, reflecting the varying levels of interdependencies across spatial and temporal scales within complex risk landscapes. As a consequence, dividends within and across systems can be managed simultaneously, based on determining priority needs, risk perceptions, and trade-offs involved in building resilience against current and future risks."

Surrounding homes and businesses, within a 1 mile radius, were evacuated while the fertilizer burned for two days. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) conducted air quality assessments for ammonia (NH3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). USEPA detected levels of NH3 at 45–151 ppm (USEPA Action Level is 30 ppm) and NO2 of 0.700–5.200 ppm (USEPA Action Level is 0.500 ppm), during day 2 and day 3 of the fire. Following the extinguishing of the fire, ambient air levels were documented as safe (below action levels) by the USEPA. Members of the Piney Grove Neighborhood—a historic African American community, located 0.4 miles from the now defunct Winston Weaver Company—were concerned about the long-term health impacts of exposure to the chemicals from the fire. At the request of the community, researchers from Wake Forest University conducted soil quality tests (nutrients and heavy metals). Results from the soil heavy metals test showed that the highest concentrations of arsenic (4.9 mg kg−1), cadmium (0.76 mg kg−1), copper (51.1 mg kg−1), and lead were below the World Health Organization (WHO) action levels of arsenic (20 mg kg−1), cadmium (12 mg kg−1), copper (100 mg kg−1), lead (300 mg kg−1). However, the concentrations of nickel (19.3 mg kg−1) and zinc (289.9 mg kg−1) were close to the WHO action levels of 36 mg kg−1 and 300 mg kg−1, respectively. The concentrations of nutrients were, notably, within acceptable ranges of highest concentrations at nitrate (2.93 mg l−1), ammonia (2.63 mg l−1), and phosphorus (997.5 mg kg−1). There is a need to document the longitudinal environmental assessment with the community. Thus, the WFU researchers and the Piney Grove community are in agreement for annual testing and communication of data directly to residents."
10.1088/1748-9326/adbddd,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注海洋热浪（MHWs）的预测，特别是极端海洋热浪。它提出了一种基于物理引导的数据驱动深度学习方法，通过耦合器和概率数据增强模块来提高预测精度。研究重点在于理解海洋热浪的驱动过程，特别是风力对海洋热浪演变的影响，以及它与海气热交换的关系。虽然提到了大气对海洋的影响（例如风力），但其核心在于海洋环境的预测，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关联。,"['Marine Heatwaves', 'Sea Surface Temperature', 'Ocean Ecosystems', 'Deep Learning', 'Wind Forcing', 'Air-Sea Heat Exchange']",Ruiqi Shu;Hao Wu;Yuan Gao;Fanghua Xu;Ruijian Gou;Wei Xiong;Xiaomeng Huang,Advanced forecasts of global extreme marine heatwaves through a physics-guided data-driven approach,"The unusually warm sea surface temperature events known as marine heatwaves (MHWs) have a profound impact on marine ecosystems. Accurate prediction of extreme MHWs has significant scientific and financial worth. However, existing methods still have certain limitations, especially in the most extreme MHWs. In this study, to address these issues, based on the physical nature of MHWs, we created a novel deep learning neural network that is capable of accurate 10 day MHW forecasting. Our framework significantly improves the forecast ability of extreme MHWs through two specially designed modules inspired by numerical models: a coupler and a probabilistic data argumentation. The coupler simulates the driving effect of atmosphere on MHWs while the probabilistic data argumentation approaches significantly boost the forecast ability of extreme MHWs based on the idea of ensemble forecast. Compared with traditional numerical prediction, our framework has significantly higher accuracy and requires fewer computational resources. What’s more, explainable AI methods show that wind forcing is the primary driver of MHW evolution and reveal its relation with air-sea heat exchange. Overall, our model provides a framework for understanding MHWs’ driving processes and operational forecasts in the future."

We simultaneously studied the recovery of vegetation, subsurface soil moisture, and active layer thickness (ALT) post-fire in the permafrost-underlain uplands of the Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta in southwestern Alaska to understand the interaction between these factors and their potential implications. We used a space-for-time substitution methodology with 2017 Landsat 8 imagery and synthetic aperture radar products, along with 2016 field data, to analyze tundra recovery trajectories in areas burned from 1953 to 2017. We found that spectral indices describing vegetation greenness and surface albedo in burned areas approached the unburned baseline within a decade post-fire, but ecological succession takes decades. ALT was higher in burned areas compared to unburned areas initially after the fire but negatively correlated with soil moisture. Soil moisture was significantly higher in burned areas than in unburned areas. Water table depth (WTD) was 10 cm shallower in burned areas, consistent with 10 cm of the surface organic layer burned off during fire. Soil moisture and WTD did not recover in the 46 years covered by this study and appear linked to the long recovery time of the organic layer."

As an increasingly important component of the polar marine environment, recent investigations have focused on changes in MIZ size and location as the climate has warmed. Fractal geometry offers a universal measure of complexity, shape, and self-similarity across scales, and a powerful tool for characterizing MIZ evolution. Here we analyze the fractal dimension of the Arctic MIZ boundary and find a pronounced seasonal cycle that is repeated almost exactly each year, with a sharp maximum in late summer. The long-term trend is slight, with a decrease of less than 2% over the satellite era, while MIZ width has increased over the same period by almost 40%. Our results have important implications for climatic and ecological processes which depend critically on MIZ geometry. We demonstrate thermodynamic feedbacks through statistical analysis and provide context for future applications."

Global climate models (GCMs) and regional climate models (RCMs) provide forecasts over multi-decadal periods. However, their outputs vary substantially, and higher-resolution models come with increased computational demands. In this study, we analyze how the spatial resolution of different GCMs and RCMs affects the reliability of simulated wind speeds and wind power, using ERA5 data as a reference. We present a systematic procedure for model evaluation for wind resource assessment as a downstream task. Our results show that while a high spatial resolution can improve the representation of wind speed characteristics, notably extremes, the model choice is more critical for capturing the full wind speed distribution and corresponding power generation. The IPSL model preserves the wind speed distribution particularly well in Europe, producing the most accurate wind power forecasts relative to ERA5 data. Therefore, selecting the right GCMs and RCMs should precede considerations of spatial resolution or GCM boundary conditions. However, higher resolution can be valuable once a suitable climate model is identified."

Combining satellite data, PIOMAS model, and ERA5 reanalysis data, we analyze this anomaly’s evolution and its dynamic and thermodynamic drivers in the 2000–2024 series. The analysis reveals that July–August are key months; ice concentration and thickness during this time determines the fate of the sea ice survival in September. Before July 2024, sea ice near Wrangel Island has experienced rapid and sustained thickening, with its distribution closely resembling the levels observed in 2000 and 2001 (the only other summers with ice survival). Persistent northerly winds east of Wrangel Island during the melt season contributed to sea ice thickening and played a crucial role in its survival. At the same time, a cooler-than-normal air temperature near Wrangel Island supported the stable presence of sea ice in this region. The study underscores that the ‘New Arctic’ conditions, namely thinning and increasingly mobile sea ice, raise the likelihood of unpredictable events of both unexpected sea ice survival and sudden loss."

Their severity intensifies dramatically when extreme temperatures coincide with high humidity, posing compound threats to human health and natural systems. Here, we employ a three-dimensional (latitude × longitude × time) connectivity framework to analyze moisture-modulated heatwaves through daily lethal heat stress indices from 1979 to 2023. We identify 1642 distinct events worldwide, revealing pronounced hemispheric asymmetry and characteristic regional propagation pathways. Over the past four decades, these heatwaves exhibited substantial intensification, with frequency rising by 12.26 events per decade and significant expansions in spatial extent and duration—despite an unexpected moderation in mean intensity. Multi-model ensemble projections indicate a transformative shift in heatwave characteristics throughout the 21st century, characterizing more frequent and prolonged events that manifest in increasingly localized patterns. Under high-emission scenarios, some regions may experience a threefold increase in event duration, with intensity potentially rising by 1.56 °C by the late 21st century. Our findings elucidate the complex dynamics of moisture-modulated heatwaves and highlight the critical importance of integrated temperature-humidity metrics for climate adaptation and risk mitigation in a warming world."

The study revealed a predominance of biomass burning aerosols and two distinct transport mechanisms of aerosol plumes and CO, underscoring the importance of east-coast observations in understanding atmospheric dynamics. 
 Most major field campaigns, such as the Southern Africa Fire Atmosphere Research Initiative (SAFARI-92 and SAFARI-2000) and AErosol, RadiatiOn and CLOuds in southern Africa (AEROCLO-sA), have focused on the west coast of southern Africa, leaving the east coast underexplored. To address this, the Biomass Burning Aerosol Campaign (BiBAC) was initiated by the IRP ARSAIO (International Research Project – Atmospheric Research in Southern Africa and Indian Ocean) during the 2022 biomass burning season to study aerosol optical properties over southern Africa and the southwestern Indian Ocean (SWIO). This study analyzes aerosol properties during the intensive observation period (IOP) of BiBAC at Skukuza in Kruger National Park during two events: 18–23 September (Event 1) and 9–17 October (Event 2). Sun-photometer data, consistent with CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization), revealed a predominance of biomass burning aerosols. Transport analyses show southeastward movement of carbon monoxide (CO) and aerosols, reaching up to 6 km during Event 1 and 10 km during Event 2. Synoptic conditions, including frontal systems and baroclinic waves, drove regional and intercontinental pollutant transport, impacting the Mozambique Channel and surrounding areas. A “river of smoke” observed in Event 1 suggests novel synoptic conditions compared to previous studies. This study is the first to highlight two distinct transport mechanisms of aerosol plumes and CO from southern Africa and South America toward the SWIO basin, underscoring the significance of east-coast observations in understanding regional and global atmospheric dynamics."

Hegglin,On the estimation of stratospheric age of air from correlations of multiple trace gases,"This study refines estimates of the stratospheric “age of air”, a measure of how long air circulates in the stratosphere. By analyzing correlations between trace gases measurable by satellites, the research introduces a method that reduces uncertainties and detects small-scale atmospheric features. This improved understanding of stratospheric circulation is crucial for better climate models and predictions, enhancing our ability to assess the impacts of climate change on the atmosphere. 
 The stratospheric circulation is an important element in the climate system, but observational constraints are prone to significant uncertainties due to the low circulation velocities and uncertainties in available trace gas measurements. Here, we propose a method to calculate mean age of air as a measure of the circulation from observations of multiple trace gas species which are reliably measurable by satellite instruments, like trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11), dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC-12), chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and we show that this method works well in most of the lower stratosphere up to a height of about 25 km. The method is based on the compact correlations of these gases with mean age. Methodological uncertainties include effects of atmospheric variability, non-compactness of the correlation, and measurement related effects inherent for satellite instruments. The multi-species age calculation method is evaluated in a model environment and compared against the actual model age from an idealized clock tracer. We show that combination of the six chosen species reduces the resulting uncertainty of derived mean age to below 0.3 years throughout most regions in the lower stratosphere. Even small-scale, seasonal features in the global age distribution can be reliably diagnosed. The new correlation method is further applied to trace gas measurements with the balloon-borne Gimballed Limb Observer for Radiance Imaging of the Atmosphere (GLORIA-B) instrument. The corresponding deduced mean age profiles agree reliably with SF6-based mean age below about 22 km and show significantly lower uncertainty ranges. Comparison between observation-based and model-simulated mean ages indicates a slow-biased circulation in the ERA5 reanalysis. Overall, the proposed mean age calculation method shows promise to substantially reduce the uncertainty in mean age estimates from satellite trace gas observations."

During the westerly QBO, positive zonal wind anomalies at 20−40° S in the upper stratosphere in July, named the positive extratropical mode, lead to a stronger polar vortex in November, with a correlation of 0.75, suggesting that the Antarctic stratospheric polar vortex and ozone concentration in spring can be predicted up to 5 months in advance. 
 The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) dynamically interacts with the extratropical atmosphere. However, the relationship between the QBO in austral winter and the Antarctic stratospheric polar vortex in spring remains unclear. In this study, we propose a joint predictor involving the QBO for the Antarctic stratospheric polar vortex and ozone in austral spring. During the westerly QBO phase (WQBO), positive zonal-mean zonal wind anomalies at 20–40° S in the upper stratosphere in July, named the positive extratropical mode, can lead to a stronger Antarctic stratospheric polar vortex and lower ozone concentration in November, with correlations reaching 0.75 and −0.60, respectively. The mechanism is summarized as follows: the positive extratropical mode triggers a secondary circulation, which further alters the environmental conditions for wave propagation in the stratosphere. The resulting anomalous wave divergence leads to a stronger Antarctic stratospheric polar vortex during the austral spring, while during the easterly QBO phase (EQBO), the correlation between the extratropical mode and the strength of the polar vortex is only 0.1. Due to the stronger upward motion in the tropics, which opposes the secondary circulation induced by the extratropical mode, the EQBO cannot sustain the positive anomalous zonal-mean zonal wind until November. Our results highlight that the extratropical mode during the WQBO could serve as a reliable predictor for both the Antarctic stratospheric polar vortex and the Antarctic ozone hole with a 4-month time lag."

We investigated the interface of single-component and mixed aqueous solutions of atmospherically relevant carboxylic acid and alkyl-ammonium ions using liquid-jet photoelectron spectroscopy. An exponential increase in surface propensity as a function of chain length was found for the single species, and cooperative effects in the mixtures cause a further drastic increase in surface solute concentration. 
 The effects of atmospheric aerosols are key uncertainties in climate models. One reason is the complex aerosol composition which includes a relatively large fraction of organics. Another reason is the small size of aerosols, which makes surface effects and processes important. These two factors make surface-active organics relevant for atmospheric aerosols, as they can affect crucial processes, such as chemical aging and water accommodation, as well as properties such as the surface tension, which drives droplet formation. Two exemplary types of atmospherically relevant organics are carboxylic acids and alkyl amines, and often both are found together within aerosols. In the most atmospherically significant pH range, these exist as alkyl-carboxylate ions and alkyl-ammonium ions. Using liquid-jet photoelectron spectroscopy, tuned to high surface sensitivity, we measured the alkyl-carboxylate anions and the alkyl-ammonium cations of alkyl chain lengths of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, both as single-component and mixed-component aqueous solutions. This enabled us to systematically study how their surface propensity is affected by the length of the alkyl chains and how cooperative ion–ion interactions result in strongly increased surface propensity. An exponential increase in surface propensity is found for the single-species solutions, with cooperative solute–solute effects in mixed solutions of 1 : 1 molar ratio drastically increasing the number of molecules present at the solutions' surfaces up to a factor of several hundred. This cooperative surface propensity is shown to strongly affect the amounts of organics at the surface. These changes can significantly influence radiative forcing via aerosol growth, cloud condensation nuclei activity, and aerosol chemical aging. Our results demonstrate the principal feasibility of a more advanced input of molecular details for creating parameterized descriptions of aerosol surface composition needed to properly account for their impacts in climate models."

No dependence on water vapour was found except for the HO2+NO2 reaction, which can be explained by an enhanced rate coefficient of the NO2 reaction with the water complex of the HO2 radical. 
 The termolecular reactions of hydroxyl radicals (OH) with carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO),  and nitrogen dioxides (NO2) and the termolecular reaction of hydroperoxy radicals (HO2) with NO2 greatly impact the atmospheric oxidation efficiency. Few studies have directly measured the pressure-dependent rate coefficients in air at 1 atm pressure and water vapour as third-body  collision partners. In this work, rate coefficients were measured with a high accuracy (<5 %) at 1 atm pressure, at room temperature, and in humidified air using laser flash photolysis and detection of the radical decay by laser-induced fluorescence. The rate coefficients derived in dry air are (2.39±0.11)×10-13 cm3 s−1 for the OH reaction with CO, (7.3±0.4)×10-12 cm3 s−1 for the OH reaction with NO, (1.23±0.04)×10-11 cm3 s−1 for the OH reaction with NO2, and (1.56±0.05)×10-12 cm3 s−1 for the HO2 reaction with NO2. For the OH reactions with CO and NO, no dependence on water vapour was observed for the range of water partial pressures tested (3 to 22 hPa), and for NO2, only a weak increase of 3 % was measured,  in agreement with the study by Amedro et al. (2020). For the rate coefficient of HO2 with NO2 an enhancement of up to 25 % was observed. This can be explained by a faster rate coefficient of the reaction of the HO2–water complex with NO2 having a value of (3.4±1.1)×10-12 cm3 s−1."

Sica;Giovanni Martucci;Alexander Haefele,Solar background radiation temperature calibration of a pure rotational Raman lidar,"Our study presents a new method, the solar background calibration method, which improves temperature determinations in rotational Raman lidar systems. By utilizing background solar radiation, this technique offers more continuous and reliable temperatures independent of external measuring instruments. This new method enhances our ability to monitor and understand atmospheric trends and their association with climate change with greater accuracy. 
 Raman lidars are an important tool for measuring important atmospheric parameters including water vapour content and temperature in the troposphere and stratosphere. These measurements enable climatology studies and trend analyses to be performed. To detect long-term trends it is critical that the calibration of the system and the monitoring of its associated uncertainties are as reliable and continuous as possible. Here we demonstrate a new methodology to derive calibration coefficients for a rotational Raman temperature lidar. We use solar background measurements taken by the rotational Raman channels of the Raman Lidar for Meteorological Observations (RALMO) located at the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology (MeteoSwiss) in Payerne, Switzerland, to calculate a relative calibration as a function of time, which is made an absolute calibration by requiring only a single external calibration, in our case with an ensemble of radiosonde flights. This approach was verified using an external time series of coincident radiosonde measurements. We employed the calibration technique on historical measurements that used a Licel data acquisition system and established a calibration time series spanning 2011 to 2015 using both the radiosonde-based external and solar-background-based internal methods. Our results show that using the background calibration technique reduces the mean bias of the calibration by an average of 0.5 K across the troposphere compared to using the local radiosoundings. Furthermore, it demonstrates the background calibration's ability to adjust and maintain continuous calibration values even amidst sudden changes in the system, which sporadic external calibration could miss. This approach ensures that climatological averages and trends remain unaffected by the drift effects commonly associated with using daily operational radiosondes. It also allows a lidar not co-located with a routine external source to be continuously calibrated once an initial external calibration is done. Furthermore, the technique works for  temperature retrievals using both the optimal estimation method and the traditional temperature algorithms."

FLab was characterized in the field regarding limitations and biases due to different flight maneuvers. Two application cases are presented: analysis of the development of the lowermost troposphere (up to 300 m) and successfully bridging ground-based and aircraft- and radiosonde-based measurements. 
 Uncrewed aircraft systems (UASs) are gradually being established in environmental research to study boundary layer conditions and phenomena in situ; however, due to payload limitations, UASs can typically measure only a limited number of atmospheric variables simultaneously. Here we present the Flying Laboratory (FLab), a hexacopter equipped with six instruments to measure aerosol particles (particle number concentration and size distribution; PM1, PM2.5, and black carbon mass concentration), trace gases (CO2, O3), and meteorological variables (temperature, relative humidity, pressure, wind) in the lower troposphere in real time and with high temporal resolution. The instrumentation has been selected to provide an overview of relevant variables in urban and semi-urban environments and especially in the vicinity of aerosol sources. This paper describes the development of the technical setup of the Flying Laboratory, the characterization of the measurements with respect to horizontal and vertical motion of the UAS, and the optimization of measurement flight patterns. During two field experiments, FLab was applied to bridge the gap between ground-based and aircraft-based profiling measurements and to perform hourly vertical profiling flights up to 300 m above a ground-based reference station for 8 h. These applications demonstrate the capability of FLab to capture the evolution of the lower convective boundary layer during the day and the vertical particle transport in the afternoon up to 200 m above ground."

The use of low-cost sensors (LCS) for air quality monitoring for policy and civic engagement in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has become paramount, as access to traditional reference-grade instruments is still sparse. Yet, studies pertaining to sensor performance under SSA’s meteorological conditions and diverse emission sources are limited. Hence, we tested eight low-cost PM2.5 sensors on the market from different manufacturers containing Plantower PMS, Alphasense OPC-N3, and AVO-Sensor sensors by collocating them with the federal equivalent method Teledyne T640 to ascertain data accuracy, reliability, and responsiveness during wet and dry periods. After 6 months of collocation, PM2.5 concentrations from the LCS showed low intrasensor variability in both the wet and dry periods, but high intersensor variability with the Teledyne T640. A strong relationship existed between the LCS and Teledyne T640, with average coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.7 (range: 05–0.9) and 0.8 (0.64–0.97) in the wet and dry periods, respectively. Larger errors were also associated with LCS data during the dry than the wet period, with the average mean absolute error and root mean squared error, respectively, 4.5 and 5.3 times higher in the dry period. Uncertainties with large errors were also observed with high PM2.5 measured in the wet period, levels that were more common during the dry period typically characterized by long-range transport of PM2.5 pollution. The results show that season significantly affects LCS performance and data quality and that care must be taken during deployment and data usage in SSA, with regular maintenance, particularly in the dry  season. Strong collaborative efforts between governmental agencies, industries, and civil society are needed to come up with an effective framework for their application."

Plastic inputs into the atmosphere occur through weathering or abrasion, dispersing microplastics globally, which can enter the animals’ respiratory systems through inhalation. We analyzed the lung tissues for the first time and the intestinal contents of 11 dead finless porpoises (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis) to assess the intake of microplastics from prey and atmospheric sources. The lung tissues and intestinal contents contained average concentrations of 0.14 ± 0.11 MPs/g and 0.35 ± 0.36 MPs/g, respectively. Microplastics found in the lung tissues and intestinal contents were similar in physical characteristics (e.g., fragment shape, transparent to white color, and size <100 μm). On the other hand, they differed in the polymer types, with a higher proportion of epoxy-type microplastics in the lungs. Epoxy is a highly hazardous polymer according to the polymer hazard index, and in the present study, the lung tissues had a higher plastic hazard index than the intestinal contents. Hence, the respiratory system is more vulnerable to microplastic pollution from atmospheric sources than the digestive system is from water and food intake. These findings underscore the growing threat of airborne microplastics to lung-breathing animals including marine mammals."

We included 544 pregnant Mexican women with both ambient PM2.5 levels during pregnancy and untargeted serum metabolomics to examine associations between pregnancy PM2.5 exposure (overall and monthly) and postpartum metabolites, implementing FDR-adjusted robust linear regression controlling for covariates. Pathway enrichment analyses (in Reactome and MetaboAnalyst) and effect modification by fetal sex and folic acid supplementation were also evaluated. Higher PM2.5 exposure levels throughout pregnancy were associated with higher bile acids and amino acids, dysregulated glycerophospholipids, or lower fatty acyl levels (FDR < 0.05), among other metabolites. Potential critical windows of susceptibility to monthly PM2.5 on metabolites were observed in early to midpregnancy (FDR < 0.005). Main findings were consistent by strata of fetal sex and folic acid supplementation. Metabolic pathways corresponding to positive PM2.5-metabolite associations indicated enriched bile acid, dietary lipid, and transmembrane transport metabolism, whereas for negative PM2.5-metabolite associations, we identified altered pathways involving adipogenesis, incretin peptide hormone, GLP-1, PPAR-alpha, and fatty acid receptors (FDR < 0.05).

Ambient aerosols sampled in a residential area near the FIP were separated by a cascade impactor into five size fractions (<0.15 to 12.15 μm). Homologues of PFCAs (C5–C11) and five PFECAs were frequently detected in the samples (detection frequencies 40–100%), albeit not in all size fractions. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exhibited the highest concentrations (6.5 to 2900 pg m–3). A noticeable mass mode in the >1 μm size range was observed for PFCAs and PFECAs in the samples that were directly influenced by wind from the direction of the FIP. Based on the PFOA concentrations in the aerosol samples, the emission rate of PFOA to air from the FIP was estimated to be 0.4–1.3 t year–1. Modeling results demonstrated that around 67% of the PFOA air emission was transported in the atmosphere above 1500 m in a 7 day continuous emission scenario, implying that the PFOA on <12.15 μm particles undergoes long-range atmospheric transport after being emitted from the FIP."

Results showed that 0.1 g L–1 CuO elevated the cytotoxicity of chlorinated waters by 20% and 120% at initial bromide concentrations of 15 and 415 μg L–1, respectively. Increasing the CuO dose increased the cytotoxicity induced by both known and unknown DBP fractions, and a more pronounced elevation was observed for the former one. Unknown fractions accounting for >70% of chlorinated water cytotoxicity were characterized by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. The presence of CuO decreased the average molecular weight (416.4 vs 412.3 Da) of assigned ∼2350 formulas after chlorination but increased the number of bromine-containing formulas (165 vs 328). The contribution of bromine addition/substitution pathways to the alteration of identified formulas in the presence of CuO almost doubled that in the absence of CuO. The preferential formation of brominated DBPs in the presence of CuO was ascribed to the higher formation rate constant of CuO–HOBr than that of CuO–HOCl complex and lower adsorption energies based on density functional theory calculations.

Yet, the regulatory role of different humic components involved in the initial formation of Fe (oxyhydr)oxides is still lacking. In this study, we identified the characteristic formation periods of ferrihydrite (Fh), the initial phase of Fe (oxyhydr)oxides, through real-time monitoring of solution pH and in situ observations of precipitated Fh nanoparticles in the absence and presence of different humic components. The kinetics of Fh formation were quantified at micrometer and nanometer scales using Raman spectroscopy (RS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), respectively. Results indicated that the extension of induction time, retardation of phase occurrence, and inhibition of nucleation rates for Fh formation were all dependent on the specific humic component with an order of fulvic acid (FA) > humic acid (HA) > humin (HM). Nanoscale data analysis revealed that the thermodynamic barrier to Fh nucleation increased by maximizing the interfacial free energy (γ) of the reaction system. Through molecular bonding quantification, AFM-based dynamic force spectroscopy (DFS) measurements demonstrated a linear relationship between Gibbs free energies (ΔGb) of soil organic matter (SOM) binding to Fh and γ within the classical nucleation theory (CNT), linking heterogeneous nucleation barriers with organo-mineral bonding. This study is the first to provide in situ evidence of the inhibitory effects of soil humic components on the formation of Fe (oxyhydr)oxides and quantitatively establish that higher energy barriers to nucleation correlate with stronger organo-mineral bonding. This relationship suggests that good organic binders are good inhibitors for mineral formation, offering a novel perspective for predicting the formation and fate of soil minerals through the lens of organo-mineral binding free energies."

Therefore the development of novel strategies to efficaciously control infectious inflammation is urgently required. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) as the central activator of pro-inflammatory genes plays a pivotal role in infectious inflammation. Here, nanoscale chirality was designed to modulate the inflammatory response through enantiomer-dependent blockade of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Chiral gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with good cytocompatibility were prepared through a one-pot seedless method under wild conditions, showing efficacious alleviation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in vitro and in vivo only by AuNPs with levorotatory chirality (L-AuNPs) rather than the dextrorotatory enantiomer (D-AuNPs). Mechanism investigation elucidated that lysosomal acidification of macrophages was inhibited through a high cellular uptake of L-AuNPs due to their weak interaction energy with cell membranes. Accordingly, the NF-κB rather than mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway was blocked by L-AuNPs through the selective inhibition of p65 phosphorylation, wherein the nuclear translocation of p65 was simultaneously depressed, so the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators was reduced significantly. This study suggests that imparting chirality to nanoparticles can provide a novel protocol to efficaciously modulate health risks arising from infectious inflammation by improving the uptake of nanoparticles with anti-inflammatory activity."

These emerging pathogens represent significant, yet often underestimated, health risks. Our study investigated peroxide disinfection of murine norovirus vesicles, a surrogate for human norovirus vesicles, and elucidated disinfection mechanisms. Peracetic acid, a neutral peroxide, rapidly inactivated murine norovirus vesicles. In contrast, negatively charged peroxides, i.e., peracetate and peroxymonosulfate, exhibited restricted effectiveness in inactivating murine noroviruses within vesicles. The largely intact viruses cloaked within vesicles remained infectious and retained their ability to replicate upon vesicle lysis triggered by mechanical forces, enzymatic activity, or chemical reactions following disinfection. Peroxides primarily targeted vesicle/viral proteins, particularly amino acid residues such as cysteine and methionine, without affecting the viral ORF2 gene fragment or vesicle structures. Disruption of viral internalization, rather than binding, plays a key role in infectivity loss.

Comparing measured concentrations with the predicted no-effect concentrations for AMR selection (PNECAMR), 7 antimicrobials exerted selection risk for resistant bacteria. Concerningly, ciprofloxacin posed medium/high risk in most of the assessed WWTPs. The accumulative effects of antimicrobial classes and certain TPs might further aggravate adverse impacts on AMR development. Our study provides insights into the presence and AMR implications of antimicrobials in treated wastewater, aiming to safeguard public health and ecosystems."

Increasing lines of evidence support that exposure to various environmental agents can change substantially chemical modifications on RNA, thereby perturbing gene expression and contributing to disease development in humans. However, the molecular mechanisms through which environmental exposure impairs RNA modification-associated proteins (“reader”, “writer”, and “eraser” or RWE proteins) and alters the landscape of RNA modifications remain poorly understood. Here, we provide our perspectives on the current knowledge about how environmental exposure alters the epitranscriptome, where we focus on dynamic changes in RNA modifications and their regulatory proteins elicited by exposure to environmental agents. We discuss how these epitranscriptomic alterations may contribute to the development of human diseases, especially neurodegeneration and cancer. We also discuss the potential and technical challenges of harnessing RNA modifications as biomarkers for monitoring environmental exposure. Finally, we emphasize the need to integrate multiomics approaches to decipher the complex interplay between environmental exposure and the epitranscriptome and offer a forward-looking viewpoint on future research priorities that may inform public health interventions and environmental regulations."

This study provides the first direct comparison of PFAS in septage and pump stations, targeting 70 PFAS compounds and employing the total oxidizable precursor (TOP) assay. Septage exhibited markedly higher PFAS and precursors concentrations than pump stations, with median post-TOP levels of 687.5 ng/L vs 84.2 ng/L, respectively. FTCAs were fully oxidized, while diPAPs showed incomplete oxidation due to high organic loads. Septic systems function as PFAS reservoirs, increasing risks of groundwater contamination, particularly in areas with shallow aquifers. Pump stations contributed to episodic PFAS spikes, likely affecting downstream wastewater treatment. The detection of 27 PFAS compounds, including short-chain alternatives, highlights shifting contamination patterns. Findings emphasize the need for tailored analytical frameworks and pretreatment technologies to mitigate PFAS risks across decentralized and centralized wastewater systems. Integrating precursor analysis is critical for accurate risk assessment, as targeted PFAS measurements underestimate contamination. These results provide new insights into PFAS behavior in residential wastewater, guiding future mitigation efforts."

Evidence suggests their involvement in hormone homeostasis, yet their exposure patterns and links to gestational hypothyroidism remain unknown. Measuring trace elements in maternal hair using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is a promising technique to assess both cumulative and time-resolved exposures. In this prospective nested case-control study, we characterized temporal variations in trace elements preceding gestational hypothyroidism diagnosis and examined their associations with the disease risk. Compared to controls, cases exhibited consistently elevated levels of arsenic (As), strontium (Sr), and barium (Ba), along with reduced zinc (Zn) levels, up to two months prior to diagnosis. An interquartile range increase in Zn levels was associated with a 39% lower risk of gestational hypothyroidism, while higher levels of As, Sr, and Ba were linked to increased risk (odds ratios: 1.32–1.42). The combination of Zn, As, Sr, and Ba achieved the highest predictive accuracy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.80.

This study investigated ten bisphenol compounds in self-leveling floors and the dust on their surfaces, revealing total concentrations in the range of 14.5–1.82 × 106 and 317–1.39 × 105 μg/kg, respectively. Bisphenol A constituted a median of 99.7% and 97.7% of the total concentrations found in the floor and dust, respectively. These chemicals likely originated from  intentional use in either floor coatings or as impurities. The bisphenols released from the flooring may significantly contribute to  contamination of the dust. Additionally, the estimated human exposure levels to bisphenols A and F from  floor dust were found to be higher than those from other indoor dust and related products. Our results indicate that self-leveling floors could be a significant source of human exposure to bisphenols; however, the noncarcinogenic risks associated with bisphenol-laden dust seem to be within acceptable limits. More research is needed to investigate the presence of chemicals in self-leveling floors and their health implications as it is likely that various harmful chemicals are present in these materials."

While previous studies have emphasized the seasonal mechanism driving Antarctic ocean surface warming, the processes governing land surface warming remain less explored. Here we show that, under abrupt quadrupled CO2 forcing, Antarctic land surface experiences uniform warming throughout the year, primarily driven by poleward atmospheric heat transport, with latent energy transport playing a dominant role. This moisture‐related transport not only delivers energy but also amplifies the water vapor feedback, significantly contributing to the warming. Our findings suggest that the discrepancies in representing these atmospheric processes across models, contribute substantially to the uncertainties in Antarctic land surface warming projections. The result emphasizes the need for improved understanding of the atmospheric dynamics in polar regions to reduce model uncertainties under future climate scenarios."

This study employs sparse‐input reanalysis as a reference to detect and correct potential inhomogeneities in observed surface RH records from 2380 stations across China (1959–2020). Systematic inhomogeneities are primarily linked to the nationwide replacement of psychrometers with capacitive sensors in the 2000s and subsequent sensor instability. Raw data suggest an artificial decreasing trend of −0.43% per decade in RH particularly pronounced in southern China. Homogenization effectively removes this spurious trend, yielding stable RH records and eliminating regional discrepancies. Manual psychrometers derive RH from measurements of dry‐bulb and wet‐bulb temperatures using a psychrometric coefficient—a function of wind speed that is typically assumed constant. In this study, we calculated the psychrometric coefficient based on wind speed and applied it to derive RH, revealing that the raw manual psychrometer data overestimate RH by approximately 1.5% in China. This result supports our homogenization corrections and aligns with findings from nearby stations used as references. Because ERA5 and JRA‐55 assimilate raw data, they inherit these artificial trends in their surface‐level analyses. These findings have important implications for the reported RH decline over land in the 21st century given that the instrument replacement occurred worldwide."

Models were trained on ceilometer data with radiosonde measurements used for validation. We evaluated model performance by withholding approximately 10% of the data (as complete months) for testing, comparing predictions against ERA‐5 reanalysis data using RMSE, nRMSE, and R2 metrics. Our results show that gradient boosted ensemble models using all available features perform best. A modified recursive feature elimination algorithm identified minimal sets of 5–7 surface measurements sufficient for accurate zi prediction, demonstrating potential for wider spatial monitoring using cost‐effective sensors. The study revealed previously unrecognized variables influential in determining zi, such as deep soil temperature measurements (40 cm), suggesting new avenues for investigating land‐atmosphere interactions.

However, the response of atmospheric humidity to hot weather in urban versus rural settings remains unknown. Using long‐term summer (June–August) observations at 1662 stations over 1961–2020, we find that China is dominated by drying trends in atmospheric humidity (i.e., increasing vapor pressure deficit (VPD)). These drying trends are aggravated on hot days and amplified by urbanization, that is, the UDI effect is stronger in hot weather. This amplification of the UDI effect on hot days is more prominent in humid than in arid regions. Attributions show that the stronger VPD‐based UDI effect on hot days is explained by increased contribution of air temperature in southeastern China and specific humidity in northern China.

This study employs a ground‐based Doppler wind radar (DWL) in Lujiazui, Shanghai, to examine the evolution of TCBL wind and turbulence during Typhoon Muifa (2022), focusing on the transition from the periphery to the eyewall. Observations reveal significant changes in wind characteristics, highlighting the eye region's unique features and the complex dynamics of landfalling typhoons. Before Muifa's passage, the horizontal wind speed exhibited a low‐level C‐shape, with minimum speeds at 100–200 m, deviating from the typical logarithmic increase, due to high friction velocity and urban terrain effects. The vertical wind profile showed alternating updrafts and downdrafts, indicating dynamic turbulence within the TCBL. Turbulent integral length scales for tangential (Lv ${L}_{v}$) and radial (Lu ${L}_{u}$) winds at 104–208 m were smaller before the typhoon passage than after, with Lu ${L}_{u}$ notably less than Lv ${L}_{v}$, reflecting the influence of typhoon rotation and localized shear. Streak and roll intensities revealed intensified turbulence and energy transport near the surface before Muifa's passage, potentially contributing to localized wind damage. These structures exhibited periodic interactions, weakening after the typhoon's passage, likely due to changes in typhoon intensity or structure. Spectral analysis of radial and tangential winds highlighted variations in low‐frequency and inertial subrange regions, emphasizing the role of turbulence and scale interactions in modulating energy and momentum transfer. This study demonstrates DWL's effectiveness in detecting fine‐scale structures within the TCBL, enhancing understanding of wind and turbulence dynamics during landfalling typhoons."

 With the near eradication of poliovirus due to global vaccination campaigns, attention has shifted to other enteroviruses that can cause polio-like paralysis syndrome (now termed acute flaccid myelitis (AFM))1–3. In particular, enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is believed to be the main driver of epidemic outbreaks of AFM in recent years4, yet not much is known about EV-D68 host interactions. EV-D68 is a respiratory virus5 but, in rare cases, can spread to the central nervous system to cause severe neuropathogenesis. Here, we used genome-scale CRISPR screens to identify the poorly characterized multipass membrane transporter MFSD6 as a host entry factor for EV-D68. Knockout of MFSD6 expression abrogated EV-D68 infection in cell lines and primary cells corresponding to respiratory and neural cells. MFSD6 localized to the plasma membrane and was required for viral entry into host cells. MFSD6 bound directly to EV-D68 particles via its third extracellular loop (L3). We determined the cryo-EM structure of EV-D68 in complex with L3 at 2.1 Å resolution, revealing the interaction interface. A decoy receptor, engineered by fusing MFSD6(L3) to Fc, blocked EV-D68 infection of human primary lung epithelial cells, and provided near complete protection in a lethal mouse model of EV-D68 infection.

 The coupled electron-nuclear spin system in an InGaAs semiconductor as testbed of nonlinear dynamics can develop auto-oscillations, resembling time-crystalline behavior, when continuously excited by a circularly polarized laser. We expose this system to deviations from continuous driving by periodic modulation of the excitation polarization, revealing a plethora of nonlinear phenomena that depend on modulation frequency and depth. We find ranges in which the system’s oscillations are entrained with the modulation frequency. The width of these ranges depends on the polarization modulation depth, resulting in an Arnold tongue pattern. Outside the tongue, the system shows a variety of fractional subharmonic responses connected through bifurcation jets when varying the modulation frequency. Here, each branch in the frequency spectrum forms a devil’s staircase. When an entrainment range is approached by going through an increasing order of bifurcations, chaotic behavior emerges. These findings can be described by an advanced model of the periodically pumped electron-nuclear spin system. We discuss the connection of the obtained results to different phases of time matter.

 Food seeking and avoidance engage primary reward systems to drive behavior. It is nevertheless unclear whether innate or learned food biases interact with general reward processing to interfere with goal-directed choice. To this end, we recruited a large non-clinical sample of females with high eating-disorder symptoms (‘HED’) and a matched sample of females with low eating-disorder symptoms (‘LED’) to complete a reward-learning task where the calorie content of food stimuli was incidental to the goal of maximizing monetary reward. We find and replicate a low-calorie food bias in HED and a high-calorie food bias in LED, reflecting the strength of pre-experimental food-reward associations. An emotional arousal manipulation shifts this group-dependent bias across individual differences, with interoceptive awareness predicting this change. Reinforcement-learning models further identify distinct cognitive components supporting these group-specific food biases. Our results highlight the influence of reinforcement-based mechanisms and emotional arousal in eliciting potentially maladaptive food-reward associations.

 Materials capable of light upconversion—transforming low-energy photons into higher-energy ones—are pivotal in advancing optoelectronics, energy solutions, and photocatalysis. However, the discovery in various materials pays little attention on few-layer transition metal dichalcogenides, primarily due to their indirect bandgaps and weaker light-matter interactions. Here, we report a pronounced light upconversion in few-layer transition metal dichalcogenides through upconversion photoluminescence spectroscopy. Our joint theory-experiment study attributes the upconversion photoluminescence to a resonant exciton-exciton annihilation involving a pair of dark excitons with opposite momenta, followed by the spontaneous emission of upconverted bright excitons, which can have a high upconversion efficiency. Additionally, the upconversion photoluminescence is generic in MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2, showing a high tuneability from green to ultraviolet light (2.34–3.1 eV).

 The Baltic Sea is a marginal sea in northern Europe. Anthropogenic eutrophication and related deoxygenation are among its pressing environmental problems. To this end intermittent major salt water inflows from the North Sea are of major importance because they replace deep low-oxygenated waters with oxygenated surface water that sinks to depth after passing the shallow Danish Straits. Here we show, guided by machine-learning and backed by geophysical fluid dynamic modelling, that major inflows come in two “flavours” as a result of distinctly-different successions of the driving synoptic atmospheric patterns: (1) Relatively salty inflows, carrying mainly waters of pristine Atlantic origin, preconditioned by moderate high-pressure systems over the Baltic that are ultimately driven by gale force westerly winds. (2) Relatively sweet (fresh) inflows, preconditioned by pronounced high-pressure systems that build up oceanic barotropic pressure gradients across the Danish Straits. The latter, in conjunction with moderate to strong westerly winds, ultimately drive inflows that carry a mix of previously-exported brackish Baltic Sea water and salty Kattegat water - rather than more pristine Atlantic flavours. Our conceptual framework provides, for the first time, an explanation for the question why inflow strength is not directly linked to re-oxygenation of the deep Baltic.

 We synthesise advances in the understanding of the physical processes that play a role in developing, intensifying, and terminating meteorological droughts. We focus on Australia, where new understanding of drought drivers across different climate regimes provides insights into drought processes elsewhere in the world. Drawing on observational, climate model and machine learning-based research, we conclude that meteorological drought develops and intensifies largely through an absence of synoptic processes responsible for strong moisture transport and heavy precipitation. The subsequent presence of these synoptic processes is key to drought termination. Large-scale modes of climate variability modulate drought through teleconnections, which alter drought-determining synoptic behaviour. On local scales, land surface processes play an important role in intensifying dry conditions and propagating meteorological drought through the hydrological cycle. In the future, Australia may experience longer and more intense droughts than have been observed in the instrumental record, although confidence in drought projections remains low. We propose a research agenda to address key knowledge gaps to improve the understanding, simulation and projection of drought in Australia and around the world.

 Most climate projections represent volcanic eruptions as a prescribed constant forcing based on a historical average, which prevents a full quantification of uncertainties in climate projections. Here we show that the contribution of volcanic forcing uncertainty to the overall uncertainty in global mean surface air temperature projections reaches up to 49% in 2029, and is comparable or greater than that from internal variability throughout the 21st century. Furthermore, compared to a constant volcanic forcing, employing a stochastic volcanic forcing reduces the probability of exceeding 1.5 °C warming above pre-industrial level by at least 5% for high climate mitigation scenario, and enhances the probability of negative decadal temperature trends by up to 8%. Intermediate to high climate mitigation scenarios are particularly sensitive to the choice of future volcanic forcing implementation. We recommend the use of either a stochastic approach or prescribed constant forcing levels that sample volcanic uncertainty in future climate simulations. While volcanic forcing uncertainty is typically ignored in climate projections, it can represent up to 49% of the total climate uncertainty and systematically exceed internal variability uncertainty, according to simulations with stochastic forcing."

 Glacier crevasses are fractures in ice that form as a result of tension. Information on the location of crevasses is important for mountaineers and field researchers to plan a safe traverse over a glacier. Today, Alpine glaciers change faster than cartography can keep up with up-to-date manually created maps on crevasse zones. For the first time, this study presents an approach for automated crevasse mapping from high-resolution airborne remote sensing imagery based on a multitask deep neural network. The model was trained and evaluated over seven training and six test areas located in the Oetztal and Stubai Alps. By simultaneously preforming edge detection and segmentation tasks, the multitask model was able to robustly detect glacier crevasses of different shapes within different illumination conditions with a balanced accuracy of 86.2 %. Our approach is applicable to large-scale applications as demonstrated by creating high-resolution crevasse maps for the entire Oetztal and Stubai Alps for the years 2019/2020.

 Remote sensing scene captioning is crucial for the deep understanding and intelligent analysis of Earth observation data. Many existing methods and datasets lack a fine-grained description of key geographical elements, fail to capture the full diversity of spatial relations, and are limited in their applicability to real-world geospatial scenarios. To address these shortcomings, we propose HI4HC (hybrid intelligence for remote sensing scene hierarchical captioning), a novel method that combines deep learning algorithms with expert knowledge to generate hierarchical captions for remote sensing scenes. This approach comprehensively describes scenes across three dimensions: geographical elements, spatial relations, and scene concepts, resulting in more accurate, detailed, and comprehensive captions. Leveraging HI4HC, we have constructed and made public a high-quality hierarchical caption dataset named AAAAD (adopt-amend-annihilate-add dataset). Extensive experiments show that AAAAD outperforms traditional single-level caption datasets in terms of the richness of geographical elements, the precision of spatial relations, and overall caption diversity, with improvements observed across 11 out of 13 evaluation metrics. Moreover, the hierarchical captions generated by HI4HC offer users the flexibility to organize information according to specific application needs such as imagery classification, change detection, multimodal understanding and cross-modal retrieval. This adaptability not only alleviates the semantic gap in imagery understanding but also plays an important role in advancing intelligent analysis of remote sensing imagery.

 The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a vital metric for assessing vegetation growth, yet accurate prediction remains challenging, particularly in regions with complex geographic and climatic conditions. Machine learning methods offer promise but are often hindered by sensitivity to model structure, input parameters, and training samples. To address these limitations, this study developed an NDVI time-series prediction optimization model, LSKRX, which integrates multiple machine learning algorithms with local geographic and climatic data. Using the Southwest Basin of China as a case study, dominant climatic factors were identified through sub-basin analysis, and machine learning models were constructed to link NDVI with these factors. The LSKRX model demonstrated significant improvements in prediction accuracy compared to single-model approaches, with the most notable enhancement in BIAS. Spatially, the model’s predictions aligned closely with observed values, particularly in the middle and lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River. The model performed exceptionally well in winter (CC: 0.964) and summer (CC: 0.918) and achieved optimal accuracy in alpine regions at altitudes of 4000–5000 m (CC: 0.900).

We measured 34 VVOCs, 69 VOCs, two organic acids, and endotoxins in the indoor air of 34 apartments and 27 classrooms using four different sampling techniques and analytical methods. Our study aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of a broad spectrum of substances rarely measured in indoor air. The following substance classes showed the highest sum medians in classrooms and apartments: alcohols 249 μg/m3 and 518 μg/m3, aldehydes/acetone 81.6 μg/m3 and 121 μg/m3 and organic acids 61 μg/m3 and 82 μg/m3. The individual substances with the highest medians were ethanol > acetic acid > acetone > decamethylcyclopentasiloxane > formaldehyde > acetaldehyde. The median of the total volatile organic compounds as the sum of the VOCs of C6-C16 was 253 μg/m3 (range: 638–3369 μg/m3) in the apartments and 277 μg/m3 (61–900 μg/m3) in the classrooms. The median (95th percentile) levels of endotoxins in the classrooms and apartments were 5.8 EU/m3 (15.3 EU/m3) and 0.26 EU/m3 (0.91 EU/m3), respectively. Concentrations in apartments are significantly lower than in schools. According to current knowledge, levels pose no health risk.In addition to the classic VOCs, VVOCs should also be measured to a greater extent, as considerable exposure to substances from this group is expected indoors. These results underline the urgent need for further research to improve indoor air quality and protect public health."

 An unexpected dust storm swept throughout China from April 9 to 16, 2023. Many studies have explored the characteristics of the weather system process during this case. However, the distribution characteristics and air-quality effect of this dust storm have been less discussed, especially for the sources of dust. Here, the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) model along with MODIS satellite observations, ERA5 reanalysis data and the HYSPLIT backward trajectory model was used to analyze the transport characteristics and the contributions of dust from different sources during the period of this dust storm. The results showed that dust emissions from North Africa (NA) and the Middle East (ME), aided by atmospheric circulation patterns that facilitate long-range dust transport, collectively led to an increase in dust influx into East Asia (EA). A low-pressure system's eastward journey, starting from NA, passing through ME, and eventually reaching EA, along with the prevailing westerly winds, played a crucial role in this process.During long-range transport, dust originating from NA and ME was typically split into northern and southern branches by the Tibetan Plateau (TP), with the northern branch being predominant. The dust primarily entered EA through the upper troposphere, where the contribution of local dust from EA tended to diminish. Evenly, ME dust was increasingly becoming the dominant source in South China. Despite this, the air quality below 500 hPa in North and 700 hPa in South China was primarily influenced by EA dust. In contrast, dust transported over long distances from ME and NA tended to rise to higher altitudes, thereby impacting PM10 concentrations and air quality in upper layers. This research offered novel insights into the significant role of long-range transported dust during a single dust event in EA."

 Investigating the interaction mechanisms between aerosols and lightning activity is a critical scientific issue in understanding the coupling of urban atmospheric environments with regional weather, holding significant value for extreme weather warnings and climate change adaptation. However, recent studies rarely explain the mechanisms of aerosol impacts on lightning activity from the perspective of atmospheric vertical structure. To address this gap, this study conducted an integrated analysis of multi-source observational data (aerosols, cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning, atmospheric thermodynamic factors, and cloud-related parameters) in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) over nine years (2013–2021). It was found that regions with high aerosol loads in the PRD exhibit a strong spatio-temporal correlation with areas of intense lightning activity. If aerosol influences are considered, the convective available potential energy (CAPE) can better account for the variations in lightning activity peaks during specific years. At the same time, strong convective conditions accelerate the shift of aerosols from enhancing to suppressing lightning activity. From the perspective of atmospheric vertical structure, as conditions transition from clean to polluted, the aerosol-cloud interaction (ACI) mechanism significantly increases cloud particle density by up to 300 %. This not only facilitates the electrification process of thunderclouds but also affects the atmospheric temperature gradient at corresponding altitudes. In polluted conditions (with aerosol optical depth (AOD) > 0.75), the temperature gradient in the middle and upper troposphere decreases by more than 0.5 °C. This enhances the development of inversion layers, thereby increasing atmospheric stability and suppressing convection and subsequent lightning activity. The above findings demonstrate that the promoting and inhibiting effects of aerosols on lightning differ under clean and polluted conditions."

 Fengyun satellite series offers Quantitative Precipitation Estimates (QPEs) with high spatiotemporal resolution, providing coverage at both regional and global scales. However, as indirect estimates of precipitation based on infrared data, Fengyun-2G (FY-2G) QPEs inherently contain considerable regional and seasonal uncertainties. In this study, to mitigate these errors, we propose a novel calibration algorithm that enhances the spatial and temporal performance of FY-2G QPE at both daily and hourly scales. This method consists of two components: first, a daily-scale spatial calibration using a multi-variable-assisted Random Forest (RF) technique, and second, an hourly-scale temporal calibration based on an Improved Proportional Factor (IPF) method, which refines traditional PF approaches by integrating Geographic Difference Analysis (GDA) and Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) for error correction. The proposed approach was applied to generate a high-quality FY-2G precipitation dataset for the Chinese mainland (0.1°/hr, 2018–2019). Validation against the China Merged Precipitation Analysis (CMPA) dataset demonstrates significant improvements: Daily-scale spatial calibration using RF increases the correlation coefficient (CC) from 0.74 to 0.92 (+24.3 %), reduces BIAS from 15.69 % to 8.04 % (−48.8 %), and decreases RMSE from 5.97 mm to 2.93 mm (−50.9 %). Hourly-scale temporal calibration using RF-IPF improves CC from 0.47 (FY-2G) to 0.77, reduces BIAS from −36.73 % to 8.25 %, and lowers RMSE from 2.98 mm to 2.11 mm during extreme precipitation events. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed calibration framework in enhancing both spatial and temporal accuracy of infrared-based QPEs. Unlike existing methods that primarily focus on daily-scale corrections, our approach extends calibration to the hourly level, improving precipitation estimates crucial for short-duration extreme weather events. While this methodology is demonstrated in China, its framework can be adapted to other satellite-based precipitation datasets and applied across diverse climatic and topographic regions, providing valuable insights for hydrological and climatic research worldwide."
