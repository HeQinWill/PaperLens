In the global expansion of WE, one main concern is that wind-power parks (WPPs) take up large areas of land, causing conflicts with other uses such as nature conservation. Existing impact analyses for WPPs are mostly restricted to case studies, and it lacks studies that investigate potential impacts at a larger scale because no scientific consensus on the area associated to a WPP exists. This study proposes a continental, GIS-based approach to estimate the area required for proposed onshore WPPs and to estimate their potential overlap with protected areas (PAs) on the African continent. The results of the spatial analysis show that, in total, the currently proposed 149 WPPs would require 852 km2 of land on the African continent, thereof 11 would overlap with PAs. The overlaps sum up to an area of 42 km2, which corresponds to an affected nominal power of 834 MW (5% of the total projected wind power capacity). These findings reveal the need for further purposefully local in-depth analyses to investigate if the WPP can be operated in accordance with the conservation of the PA. This work provides new data and a transferable methodological approach on the expansion of WE and its potential space requirement and contributes to the investigation of potential land-use conflicts of proposed onshore WPPs on a broader scale."

Since the 1980s, studies have found positive trends in the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from satellite imagery over the Arctic—commonly referred to as ‘Arctic greening’ and assumed to represent increased vegetation productivity. However, greening analyses use satellite imagery with pixel sizes ranging from tens to hundreds of metres and do not account for the integration of abiotic phenomena such as snow within vegetation indices. Here, we use high-resolution drone data from one Arctic and one sub-Arctic site to show that fine-scale snow persistence within satellite pixels is associated with both reduced magnitude and delayed timing of annual peak NDVI, the base metric of Arctic greening analyses. We found higher snow persistence within Sentinel-2 pixels is associated with a lower magnitude and later peak NDVI, with a mean difference in NDVI of 0.1 and seven days between high and low snow persistence pixels. These effects were stronger in NASA HLSS30 data, representative of Landsat data commonly used in greening analyses. Our findings indicate that unaccounted changes in fine-scale snow persistence may contribute to Arctic spectral greening and browning trends through either biotic responses of vegetation to snow cover or abiotic integration of snow within the estimated peak NDVI. In order to improve our understanding of Arctic land-surface change, studies should integrate very-high-resolution data to estimate the dynamics of late-season snow within coarser satellite pixels."

In this work, we combine socioeconomic metrics with spatially interpolated fine particulate matter and ozone concentrations from fifty-nine low-cost sensors and nine reference monitors to investigate inequality in air pollution exposure among different population groups in Greater Boston. The results indicate that the disadvantaged groups are exposed to higher levels of air pollution. Air pollution is concentrated in the center of Boston, Cambridge, Chelsea, and Everett, corresponding to high population density and anthropogenic activities. We further assess the environmental equality by reconstructing the EJ map for Massachusetts using median household income, percentage of minority, and percentage of limited English speaking as indicators. The EJ blocks are clustered in large cities across Massachusetts. Many communities in Greater Boston are classified as EJ communities due to the high percentage of minorities. Chelsea and Everett face more severe EJ issues, with most of their communities exceeding multiple EJ indicators. Additionally, we introduce and demonstrate a new method for determining EJ communities by utilizing the multi-criterion framework to calculate the cumulative EJ score for every census block, integrating air quality with socioeconomic indicators, and each indicator can be viewed as a policy action. Chelsea, Everett, and Lynn consistently exhibit the highest EJ scores with no improvements over the years. The EJ score system provides the time evolution to assist authorities and the residents in tracking the progress in improving the EJ scores of their communities. The method indicates the strength of the efforts needed to maintain or improve the EJ scores for achieving better EJ in the communities, allowing authorities to take immediate actions to improve the environmental well-being of vulnerable communities."

While increased ETo typically necessitates increased irrigation, we explore how crop phenological response can moderate this challenge. Focusing on five key agricultural crops in California’s San Joaquin Valley (SJV), we employ coupled water balance and phenology models to project crop water demands as a function of increased ETo and changing phenology. All crops exhibited accelerated growth from a shortened growing season with warming. The shortened crop maturation period partially to fully offset increased crop water demands due to rising ETo, with the largest phenological influence for annual crops such as tomato and corn. By contrast, models that do not account for phenological changes showed increased irrigation demands of approximately 3.5%–4.5% per °C of global warming primarily due to increased ETo. Integration with dynamic phenological models for the five key crops across the extent of agricultural land in the SJV showed a 1.6% decrease in irrigation needs under a 2 °C warming scenario. While phenological change alongside plant physiological responses to increased atmospheric CO2 may help buffer the impact of climate change on crop irrigation demand, decreased crop yields with a shorter growing season and continued reliance of groundwater reserves for agricultural water use and reduced spring snowpack will threaten coupled agricultural and water security in the region."

However, there is a lack of effective methods for evaluating future emissions reduction efforts, especially at the farm scale. We developed a rapid analysis method to evaluate CH4 emissions from a large number of dairy cow farms in the Netherlands based on single-transect mobile van measurements of CH4 concentrations downwind of farms located between 80 and 750 m from the road. Methane emissions from 51 dairy cow farms were determined on four campaign days within a total of 7 measurement hours between November 2017 and November 2018 using an inverse Gaussian approach combined with two different wind datasets and their composite. We found a range of moderate to high correlation (R2: minimum 0.42, maximum 0.86) between the estimated CH4 emission rates for 11–16 farms on each measurement day and the number of animal units (AUs, 1 AU equals 500 kg of animal weight) across four individual days. The whole-farm CH4 emission factors (including both enteric fermentation and manure) for the four separate campaign days were estimated using the slope between the CH4 emission rates derived from the composite of two distinct wind datasets and the number of AUs. Daily emission factors for the four campaign days were estimated to be in the range of 0.18–0.50 kgCH4/d/AU. From the dataset, averaged over each of the four campaign days, we derived an estimate of the whole-farm CH4 emission factor, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.47 [0.13–0.81] kgCH4/d/AU. Our results demonstrate that CH4 emissions from a large number of dairy cow farms can be rapidly estimated, providing an independent way to evaluate country-specific emission factors and a potential way to monitor future emission reductions."

However, future projections exhibit substantial uncertainties among Earth system models (ESMs). Notably, the latest phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project includes some ‘hot’ ESMs with high climate sensitivity that exceed the likely range inferred from multiple lines of evidence, leading to a broader uncertainty range compared to previous CMIP phases. Although various uncertainty quantification and constraint methods have been proposed, they are not yet widely adopted. The approach of using an equal-weighted ensemble average for projections remains prevalent. Here we examine commonly used uncertainty quantification methods and constraint projection methods, describing their characteristics. Subsequently, taking extreme precipitation as a case, we constrain the range of projection uncertainty employing two weighing constraint methods and two emergent constraint methods. The results demonstrate that all methods effectively reduce the uncertainty in extreme precipitation projections. Specifically, the comprehensive constraints reduce the projection uncertainty by 26%–31% at the long-term future (2081–2100) under different scenarios. Therefore, we strongly recommend that attention should be paid to quantifying and constraining uncertainty when undertaking future projections of climate change and its impacts."

However, the long-term impacts of anthropogenic warming on wind resources, particularly their seasonal variations and potential compounding risks, remain understudied. Here we analyze large-ensemble climate simulations in high-emission scenarios to assess the projected changes in near-surface wind speed and their broader implications. Our analyses show robust wind changes including a decrease of wind speed (i.e. stilling) up to ∼15% during the summer months in Northern Midlatitudes. This stilling is linked to amplified warming of the midlatitude land and the overlying troposphere. Despite regional and model uncertainties, robust signals of warming-induced wind stilling will likely emerge from natural climate variations in the late 21st century under the high-emission scenarios. Importantly, the summertime wind stilling coincides with a projected surge in cooling demand, and their compounding may disrupt the energy supply-demand balance earlier. These findings highlight the importance of considering the seasonal responses of wind resources and the associated climate-energy risks in a warming climate. By integrating these insights into future energy planning decisions, we can better adapt to a changing climate and ensure a reliable and resilient energy future."

This study focuses on the vertical structure of QBO amplitude changes in observation, the dynamic reasons involved, and possible changes under future scenarios. The QBO amplitude has an increased trend in the upper levels of stratosphere and a decreased one in the lower during 1960–2022. Results indicate that the QBO amplitude changes are mainly controlled by the tropical upwelling and wave forcing, where the former dampens the lower QBO but the latter primarily maintains the whole QBO amplitude. In addition, the entire QBO could be weakened in the future, responding to the high emission scenario in CMIP6. Under the high scenario, the enhanced tropical upwelling would weaken the amplitude of QBO at lower levels of stratosphere, and meanwhile, the reduced wave forcing, mainly caused by the increased tropospheric stability and weakened convection activity, would make the QBO amplitude maintenance hard."

Previous studies on extreme heat event attribution mainly focus on individual events in a specific region, with less attention paid to comparisons between historical events in different climate zones. Here, we use the number, seasonal length and intensity of hot days with daily maximum temperature exceeding 35 °C, to investigate human influence on extreme heat events in early and recent periods. It is clear that all three heat indicators have shown obvious increase across China since the early 1960s, with a rapid rise in recent years and the hottest event occurring in 2022. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 models generally capture the temporal evolution of these indicators, but some biases exist. We utilize an annual cycle-based method to correct the model biases in climate state and then use the adjusted model results to conduct event attribution in different historical periods. We find that human influence has greatly increased the probability of recent events across all regions, while having no impact on early historical events. For the hottest 2022 event, the risk ratios for seasonal length of hot days in a few regions could not be estimated due to zero probability in the natural world, indicating that such events would not happen without human influence. In different climate zones, the risk ratios for all indicators in arid northwestern China exceed those in other regions when using consistent observational thresholds, indicating a greater response of extreme heat to anthropogenic forcing in this area. For the same event, attribution results of different indicators yield varying risk ratios, highlighting the importance of considering multiple indicators in event attribution. Additionally, model performance notably affects attribution results; without bias correction, human influence may be incorrectly estimated."

Tackling water scarcity requires strategies to both decrease water consumption and enhance water availability. One promising solution to mitigate water scarcity is wastewater reuse, which involves collecting, treating, and repurposing used water. By employing a water balance model in conjunction with climate model outputs, we quantified the potential of wastewater reuse to reduce water gaps—situations where water consumption exceeds renewable water availability—under a baseline climate and two warming scenarios. We find that wastewater reuse could reduce the global water gap by 9.1% (from 457.9 to 416.1 km3 per year) under a baseline climate and by 8.3% in a 3 °C warming scenario (from 524.6 to 480.9 km3 per year). Our analysis highlights the potential for wastewater reuse to alleviate water gaps in water scarce countries and metropolitan areas. India, facing the world’s largest water gap, could reduce its baseline water gap by 6.6% (8.2 km3 per year) reusing all available wastewater, compared to a 1.2% (1.5 km3 per year) reduction with reuse of only currently treated wastewater. Specifically, in Delhi, India, the water gap could be reduced by 29.6% with full wastewater reuse and by 16.6% with the reuse of currently treated wastewater. As the global water gap widens with climate change, wastewater reuse is a promising solution to assure sustainable water access. Drawing attention to global disparities in access to wastewater treatment, our findings can guide targeted investments in wastewater treatment and reuse, aiming to alleviate water scarcity, reduce pollution from untreated wastewater, and support circular economies, ultimately ensuring sustainable access to water and sanitation."

This is known as the Dole–Morita effect, and its millennial-scale variations are recorded in ice cores. However, small variations of δatm(18O) in the present day have never been detected so far. This paper presents the first observations of diurnal, seasonal, and secular variations in δatm(18O) and applies them to evaluate oxygen, carbon, and water cycles. 
 Variations in the δ(18O) of atmospheric O2, δatm(18O), are an indicator of biological and water processes associated with the Dole–Morita effect (DME). The DME and its variations have been observed in ice cores for paleoclimate studies; however, variations in present-day δatm(18O) have never been detected so far. Here, we present diurnal, seasonal, and interannual variations of δatm(18O) based on observations at a surface site in central Japan. The average diurnal δatm(18O) cycle reached a minimum during the daytime, and its amplitude was larger in summer than in winter. We found that use of δatm(18O) enabled separation of variations of atmospheric δ(O2/N2) into contributions from biological activities and fossil fuel combustion. The average seasonal δatm(18O) cycle reached at a minimum in summer, and the peak-to-peak amplitude was about 2 per meg (1 per meg is 0.001 ‰). A box model that incorporated biological and water processes reproduced the general characteristics of the observed diurnal and seasonal cycles. A slight but significant secular increase in δatm(18O) by (0.22 ± 0.14) per meg a−1 occurred during 2013–2022. Secular changes in δatm(18O) were also simulated by using the box model considering long-term changes in terrestrial gross primary production (GPP), photorespiration, and δ(18O) of leaf water (δLW(18O)). We calculated changes in δLW(18O) using a state-of-the-art, three-dimensional model, MIROC5-iso. The observed secular increase in δatm(18O) was reproduced by the box model that incorporated the isotopic effects associated with the DME from Bender et al. (1994), while the simulated δatm(18O) showed a secular decrease when the model incorporated the isotopic effects from Luz and Barkan (2011). Therefore, long-term observations of δatm(18O) and better understanding of the DME are indispensable for an application of δatm(18O) to constrain long-term changes in global GPP and photorespiration."

A large underestimation was also found in the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) v7.0 for the study domain in the same year. 
 Production of oil and gas in Romania, one of the largest producers in the European Union (EU), is associated with substantial emissions of methane to the atmosphere and may offer high emission mitigation potential to reach the climate objectives of the EU. However, comprehensive quantification of emissions in this area has been lacking. Here we report top-down emission rate estimates derived from aircraft-based in situ measurements that were carried out with two aircraft during the 2019 ROmanian Methane Emissions from Oil and gas (ROMEO) campaign, supported by simulations with atmospheric models. Estimates from mass balance flights at individual dense production clusters and around larger regions show large variations between the clusters, supporting the important role of individual super-emitters, and possibly show variable operation practices or maintenance states across the production basin. Estimated annual total emissions from the southern Romanian oil and gas (O&G) infrastructure are 227 ± 86 kt CH4 yr−1, consistent with previously published estimates from ground-based site-level measurements during the same period. The comparison of individual plumes between measurements and atmospheric model simulations was complicated by unfavorable low-wind conditions. Similar correlations between measured and simulated CH4 enhancements during large-scale raster flights and mass balance flights suggest that the emission factor determined from a limited number of production clusters is representative of the larger regions. We conclude that ground-based and aerial emission rate estimates derived from the ROMEO campaign agree well, and the aircraft observations support the previously suggested large under-reporting of CH4 emissions from the Romanian O&G industry in 2019 to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). We also observed large underestimation from O&G emissions in the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) v7.0 for our domain of study."

In this study, we focused on smartphone pressure observations in tropical cyclone environments. We developed a machine-learning-based quality control program that greatly reduced errors and found that smartphone data led to significant improvements in analysis fields. Some traditional best tracks were found to consistently underestimate the minimum sea-level pressure. 
 Smartphone pressure observations have demonstrated significant potential to complement traditional pressure monitoring. However, challenges remain in correcting biases and further leveraging these observations for practical applications. In this study, we used tropical cyclones (TCs) Lekima in 2019, Hagupit in 2020 and In-fa in 2021 as examples to conduct bias correction on labeled smartphone pressure data from the Moji Weather app. We propose a quality control procedure utilizing random forest machine learning models. By applying this quality control approach to the selected TCs, we discovered that the performance of the method for labeled data significantly surpassed that for unlabeled data developed in a previous study, reducing the mean absolute error from 3.105 to 0.904 hPa. The bias-corrected smartphone data were then supplemented with weather station data for sea-level-pressure analyses and compared with the analyses that used only weather station data. The significantly higher spatial resolution and broader coverage of the smartphone data led to notable differences between the two analysis fields.

Here, a simplified global model is developed, taking advantage of advances in remote-sensing data and in situ observations. The model reproduces the large spatial and temporal patterns of emissions, albeit with limitations in the tropics due to data scarcity. This model, while simple, can provide valuable insights into sensitivity analyses. 
 Wetlands are major contributors to global methane emissions. However, their budget and temporal variability remain subject to large uncertainties. This study develops the Satellite-based Wetland CH4 model (SatWetCH4), which simulates global wetland methane emissions at 0.25° × 0.25° and monthly temporal resolution, relying mainly on remote-sensing products. In particular, a new approach is derived to assess the substrate availability, based on Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The model is calibrated using eddy covariance flux data from 58 sites, allowing for independence from other estimates. At the site level, the model effectively reproduces the magnitude and seasonality of the fluxes in the boreal and temperate regions but shows limitations in capturing the seasonality of tropical sites. Despite its simplicity, the model provides global simulations over decades and produces consistent spatial patterns and seasonal variations comparable to more complex land surface models (LSMs). Such an independent data-driven approach based on remote-sensing products is intended to allow for future studies of intra-annual variations in wetland methane emissions. In addition, our study highlights uncertainties and issues in wetland extent datasets and the need for new seamless satellite-based wetland extent products. In the future, there is potential to integrate this one-step model into atmospheric inversion frameworks, thereby allowing for the optimization of the model parameters using atmospheric methane concentrations as constraints and hopefully better estimates of wetland emissions."

However, the effectiveness of the CAC sorptive barrier could change over time due to alterations in its physicochemical properties induced by aging processes. In this study, the effects of CAC aging on surface properties of CAC and resulting impact on the adsorption behaviors of PFAS compounds were determined using four accelerated aging treatments, including wet–dry cycling (W/D), hydrogen peroxide (H), Fenton’s reagent (F), and mineral acid (A). Fenton’s reagent and mineral acid aging treatments showed a greater impact on the physical structure and chemical composition of CAC than either W/D-CAC and H-CAC. Aging the CAC lowered the CAC specific surface area and anion exchange capacity, increased surface oxygen content, and lowered the point of zero charge, suggesting negative impacts on the capacity of CAC for PFAS removal. This reduction in the sorption capacity was confirmed in batch sorption isotherm experiments. All aged CAC had lower PFAS adsorption in a multisolute system, including six PFAS compounds with different chain lengths (C4–C8) and functional groups (sulfonate or carboxylate), with the only exception being perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). The results suggest that the aging process is an important, yet often overlooked, factor in determining the long-term effectiveness of the CAC sorptive barrier for PFAS removal, especially for shorter-chain hydrophilic PFAS. More research is needed to verify the influence of field-scale aging processes on the CAC performance and longevity."

Here, we selected organic small molecules with representative functional groups to investigate the molecular mechanisms of Cd immobilization on goethite using batch experiments, solid characterization, theoretical calculations, and single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) combined with K-means analysis. These organic molecules increase Cd adsorption on goethite, with carboxyl groups showing the most substantial enhancement (increased by 81.7%). Solid-state characterization reveals that the adsorption of organic molecules is the primary driver of enhanced Cd immobilization, promoting the formation of new Cd–O(C) and Cd–O(Fe/C) bonds. Especially, thermodynamic analysis indicates that Cd–O(C) and Cd–O(Fe/C) bonds represent 75%–80% of total Cd binding configurations in the presence of organic molecules. Notably, the newly developed thermodynamic results show a strong correlation with the adsorption capacity, which may deepen the understanding of DOM-mediated Cd immobilization on Fe oxyhydroxides, offering crucial insights into Cd behavior and providing a theoretical basis for pollution control in subsurface and superficial environments."

Although regulatory policies in Southeast Asia have successfully limited combustion sources of NOx emissions, fertilized cropland NOx emissions have become increasingly prominent. However, the amount and geographic distribution of NOx emissions from fertilized croplands over Southeast Asia remain largely uncertain. Here, we use a bottom-up spatial model that combines temperature dependence and the Yienger and Levy (YL95) scheme to quantify the spatiotemporal changes in crop-specific fertilized cropland NOx emissions at five-arcminute resolution (about 10 km) from 1980 to 2019. The results show a 4-fold increase in NOx emissions from fertilized croplands in Southeast Asia from 12.9 Gg N yr–1 (R50, the difference between the 25% and 75% quantiles: 8.8–17.7 Gg N yr–1) in 1980 to 53.3 Gg N yr–1 (R50: 35.6–72.0 Gg N yr–1) in 2019. During 1980–2019, the annual NOx emissions of rice, maize and other crops showed increasing spatial trends (0.20, 0.21, and 0.63 Gg N yr–2, respectively), whereas those of wheat remained flat (−0.0006 Gg N yr–2). Our new estimate averages 19% lower than previous bottom-up and top-down estimates. The NOx emissions hotspots are mainly located in Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines for rice, maize and other crops and in Myanmar for wheat. Our crop-specific and spatially explicit NOx emissions inventories can contribute to identifying emissions and reduction hotspots and assessing future policy implications regarding mitigation options for improving air quality and food security in Southeast Asia.

This inspired us to conduct a study to evaluate whether this holds true for dissolved organic matter (DOM), especially given the still mysterious origin of marine recalcitrant DOM. Here, characterization of DOM of 21 groundwater samples (depth 1–13 m, salinity 3.9‰ to 32.4‰) across a 65 m transect of an STE located in coastal Guangdong, China, has found systematic biotransformation toward “recalcitrant” carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM). The fraction of CRAM (%CRAM) increases from 33.1% to 76.7% with an increasing degree of DOM degradation and increasing salinity. Further, processing of DOM, including the more “biolabile” DOM with lower %CRAM released from aquitard, is more active under oxic conditions than under reducing conditions. Given the large quantities of sea water that recirculates through the sandy STEs globally, the amount of “recalcitrant” DOM (RDOM) entering the ocean after processing is likely to be considerable. While more studies are needed, the ocean can gain “recalcitrant” CRAM-like compounds in this way."

We further investigated disproportionate NO2 exposures based on socioeconomic status, revealing that NO2 exposures were consistently higher in local districts with higher socioeconomic status because of the unique historical backgrounds of rapid economic development and urban infrastructure design in South Korea.

In contrast, silicic acid and traditional silicon fertilizers at the same dose did not show priming effects, indicating that the released Si did not contribute to the observed outcomes. Metabolomics reveals that silica seed priming accelerated the mobilization of seed-stored reserves. Vegetative tissues also exhibit enhanced drought resistance, and metabolomics analysis reveals that the drought resistance strategy involves the upregulation of sugars (glucose, sucrose, trehalose, maltose; 34.7–74.8%), amino acids (methionine, 6-fold), signaling molecules (salicylic acid, 2.5-fold), and antioxidants (ascorbic acid, 2-hydroxycinnamic acid, ferulic acid, P-coumaric acid; 16.0–83.8%). Transcriptomics analysis reveals that several drought- and even desiccation-tolerant associated genes exert more pronounced transcript changes in silica-primed leaves. The life cycle study shows that silica seed priming does not generate any yield penalty or compromise the nutritional quality of the fruits. Importantly, offspring seeds exhibit enhanced vigor and drought tolerance, indicating the transgenerational transmission of the acquired drought resilience.

To fill this gap, we developed and validated a solid-phase extraction procedure that separates precursors by charge and quantifies the sum of the precursors in each fraction with the total oxidizable precursor (TOP) assay. Method performance was demonstrated by spiking known concentrations of ten precursors into aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF)-impacted groundwater, municipal wastewater, and soil samples.

Use of the method provided results that were consistent with expectations based on precursor transport properties.

The results demonstrated a preponderance of short-chain PFAS in urine, with PFBS, PFPeA, and PFBA showing the highest detection rates. PFBA had the highest median concentration at 0.47 ng/mL. Similarly, in indoor dust, PFBA was the most frequently detected, followed by PFOA, with median concentrations of 0.56 and 0.44 ng/g, respectively. Multiple PFAS compounds showed significant inverse correlations with FVC% and FEV1%.

This study investigates the chronic (60 days) hepatotoxic effects and the underlying mechanism of 4-tBP on fish, including concentrations with environmental relevance (≤100 μg/L), using Cyprinus carpio L. as the model. Results showed that 1–500 μg/L 4-tBP triggered significant alterations in oxidative stress markers (superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde (MDA)) and liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)), with a dose–response relationship confirmed by the Integrated Biomarker Response (IBR) index. Histopathological analysis and molecular experiments revealed inflammatory responses, disruptions in glycogen metabolism, and critical insulin signaling pathways (IRS1, AKT, and GSK3β). Further investigations, including miRNA sequencing and in vitro assays in primary hepatocytes, identified the miR-363/PKCδ axis as a critical regulatory pathway affecting these changes. This study demonstrated that chronic, low-level exposure to 4-tBP can induce hepatotoxicity in Cyprinus carpio L. via the miR-363/PKCδ axis.

In addition to the inherent difficulty in identifying signals in noisy data, detection and attribution studies generally rely on general circulation models, which may fail to accurately capture the characteristics of naturally forced and internal hydroclimate variability. Here, we use a long tree‐ring based paleoclimate record of drought to estimate pre‐industrial variability in the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), a commonly used metric of drought risk. Using a Bayesian framework, we estimate the temporal and spatial characteristics of hydroclimate variability prior to 1850. We assess whether observed twenty‐first century PDSI is compatible with this pre‐industrial variability or is better explained by a forced response that scales with the global mean temperature. Our results suggest that global warming likely contributed to dry PDSI in Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, and Arctic Russia and to wet PDSI in Northern Europe, East‐central Asia, and Tibet."

Unique ionospheric changes on superstorm day 11 May were first recorded by the SYISR experiments and the geostationary satellite (GEO) total electron content (TEC) network over the Asian sector. The electron density or TEC displayed wavelike structures rather than a regular diurnal pattern. Surprisingly, two humps, a common feature in the daytime equatorial ionization anomaly structure, disappeared. The SYISR observations revealed that multiple wind surges accompanied the downward phase propagation caused by atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs) originating from auroral zones. Meanwhile, strong upward and large downward drifts were respectively observed in the daytime and around sunset. The Thermosphere‐Ionosphere Electrodynamics Global Circulation Model (TIEGCM) simulations demonstrated that abnormal ionospheric changes were attributed to meridional wind disturbances associated with AGWs and recurrent penetration electric fields corresponding to larger Bz southward excursions and disturbance dynamo. The complicated interplay between AGWs and disturbance electric fields contributed to this unique ionospheric variation."

The minimal model contains two free parameters: the pre‐stress on the fault, and the seismic velocity reduction in the damage zone.

Sea surface temperature anomalies associated with these eddies can influence atmospheric boundary layer stability, and thus the formation of clouds. The Maritime Continent experiences the modulation of convection and precipitation by processes operating over multiple spatial and temporal scales. However, mesoscale air‐sea interactions, such as those associated with the eddies the region generates, remain understudied. Applying a sea surface height‐based eddy detection and tracking algorithm, we show that lower latitude eddies, such as those in the Maritime Continent, are generally fewer in number, weaker, and shorter‐lived, but larger and faster‐propagating, compared to those at higher latitudes. Crucially, we highlight that eddies in the Maritime Continent can significantly modify air‐sea heat exchange and the near‐surface wind field. However, changes to column water vapor, cloud, and rainfall are less distinct. Compared to the Kuroshio Extension, a representative case study for the extratropics, atmospheric anomalies associated with eddies in the Maritime Continent are weaker, and decreasing in magnitude toward the lower latitudes. We hypothesize that weaker sea surface temperature anomalies associated with eddies in the Maritime Continent, coupled with their faster propagation and intraseasonal variability in convection over the region, reduce the likelihood and intensity of the instantaneous atmospheric imprint. This study therefore emphasizes the importance of the spatial and temporal scales with regard to air‐sea interactions and their influence on cloud and rainfall across the Maritime Continent."

Most projections of future TC precipitation use climate models with grid spacings of 25–100 km, which are too coarse to resolve the convective structures and small‐scale precipitation processes within TCs. This work uses convection‐permitting Weather Research and Forecasting model simulations to investigate how precipitation and precipitation processes change in the inner core (IC) and outer rainbands (OR) of TCs in response to sea surface temperature (SST) warming. The simulations are idealized, with single TCs initialized from weak vortices over domain‐constant SSTs. In these simulations, TC intensity and IC precipitation greatly increase with SST warming while OR precipitation increases slightly. A greater area in the IC is occupied by deep convection more frequently in the warmer simulations, while the deep convective activity remains relatively constant with warming in the TC OR. Mixing ratios of hydrometeors and cloud ice increase with warming in both the IC and OR, while the TCs' vertical circulations deepen, melting levels rise, and mean upward velocities strengthen. This work demonstrates how analysis of three‐dimensional storm structures can provide insight into processes that change TC precipitation in different regions of the storm, and future work will include applying this analysis to more realistic convection‐permitting simulations."

The Time of Emergence (ToE) marks the pivotal moment when climate conditions (i.e., signal) deviate from pre‐industrial norms (i.e., noise). Leveraging ensemble climate‐to‐fish simulations from one Earth System Model (IPSL‐CM6A‐LR) and one Marine Ecosystem Model (APECOSM), this study examines the ToE of epipelagic, migratory and mesopelagic fish biomass alongside their main environmental drivers for two contrasted climate‐change scenarios. Globally averaged biomass signals emerge over the historical period. Epipelagic biomass decline emerged earlier (1950) than mesozooplankton decline (2017) due to a stronger signal in the early 20th century, possibly related to trophic amplification induced by an early emerging surface warming (1915). Trophic amplification is delayed for mesopelagic biomass due to postponed warming in the mesopelagic zone, resulting in a later emergence (2017). ToE also displays strong size class dependence, with epipelagic medium sizes (20 cm) experiencing delayed emergence compared to the largest (1 m) and smallest (1 cm) categories. For the epipelagic and mesopelagic communities, the regional signal emergence lags behind the global average, with median ToE estimates of 2030 and 2034, respectively. This is due to stronger noise in regional time‐series than in global averages. The regional ToEs are also spatially heterogeneous, driven predominantly by the signal pattern akin to mesozooplankton. Additionally, our findings underscore that mitigation efforts (i.e., transitioning from SSP5‐8.5 to SSP1‐2.6 scenario) can potentially curtail emerging ocean surface signals by 30%."

 Breaking the geometric symmetry of traditional metal-N4 sites and further boosting catalytic activity are significant but challenging. Herein, planar chlorination engineering is proposed for successfully converting the traditional Zn-N4 site with low activity and selectivity for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) into highly active Zn-N3 site with broken symmetry. The optimal catalyst Zn-SA/CNCl-1000 displays a highest faradaic efficiency for CO (FECO) around 97 ± 3% and good stability during 50 h test at high current density of 200 mA/cm2 in zero-gap membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer, with promising application in industrial catalysis.

Here, the authors show that Escherichia coli ρ forms inactive oligomers and filaments in the presence of stress-associated nucleotides (p)ppGpp and ADP. 
 Bacterial RNA helicase ρ is a genome sentinel that terminates the synthesis of damaged and junk RNAs that are not translated by the ribosome. It is unclear how ρ is regulated during dormancy or stress, when translation is inefficient and RNAs are vulnerable to ρ-mediated release. We use cryogenic electron microscopy, biochemical, and genetic approaches to show that substitutions of residues in the connector between two ρ domains or ADP promote the formation of extended Escherichia coli ρ filaments. By contrast, (p)ppGpp induces the formation of transient ρ dodecamers. Our results demonstrate that ADP and (p)ppGpp nucleotides bound at subunit interfaces inhibit ρ ring closure that underpins the hexamer activation, thus favoring the assembly of inactive higher-order oligomers. Connector substitutions and antibiotics that inhibit RNA and protein syntheses trigger ρ aggregation in the cell. These and other recent data implicate aggregation as a widespread strategy to tune ρ activity. Bacterial transcription factor Rho (ρ) is a key regulator of transcription termination.

 High-throughput screening of drug sensitivity of cancer cell lines (CCLs) holds the potential to unlock anti-tumor therapies. In this study, we leverage such datasets to predict drug response using cell line transcriptomics, focusing on models’ interpretability and deployment on patients’ data. We use large language models (LLMs) to match drug to mechanisms of action (MOA)-related pathways. Genes crucial for prediction are enriched in drug-MOAs, suggesting that our models learn the molecular determinants of response. Furthermore, by using only LLM-curated, MOA-genes, we enhance the predictive accuracy of our models. To enhance translatability, we align RNAseq data from CCLs, used for training, to those from patient samples, used for inference. We validated our approach on TCGA samples, where patients’ best scoring drugs match those prescribed for their cancer type. We further predict and experimentally validate effective drugs for the patients of two highly lethal solid tumors, i.e., pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma.

Here, the authors show that under acute heat shock, it selectively arrests cellular transcription and translation, independent of the signal peptide. 
 Non-coding 7SL RNA is an ancestor to mammalian Alu and B1 SINE RNAs and is thought to function exclusively within the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP), aiding in the translocation of secretory proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum for export. Here, we discover a function of 7SL/SRP unrelated to protein secretion. Under acute heat shock, 7SL and SRP together selectively arrest cellular transcription and translation machineries during early response to stress. Under thermal stress, 7SL is upregulated, accumulates in the nucleus, and binds to target genes repressed by heat shock. Concurrently, in the cytosol, SRP binds to ribosomes and inhibits new protein synthesis. Translational suppression occurs independently of the signal peptide and is abrogated by depleting SRP. Translation inhibition extends to the mitochondria, as nuclear-encoded genes with mitochondrial functions are enriched among SRP targets. Thus, apart from its role in protein export, 7SL/SRP orchestrates a global response to acute stress that encompasses the nucleus, cytosol, and mitochondria across transcription and translation. 7SL is traditionally thought to function within the SRP to aid in protein translocation into the ER.

Here, authors use protective carbon layer to modulate the metal p-band center and prevent undesirable phase change of electrocatalyst for realizing 1 A h level lithium sulfur pouch cell. 
 Designing an electrocatalyst that simultaneously satisfies high catalytic activity and surface stability is essential for realizing high-performance lithium-sulfur (Li||S) batteries. Here, we propose an advanced electrocatalyst by constructing a thin protective catalytic layer (PCL) on the surface of metal nanoparticle catalysts. This few atomic layer thicknesses of the PCL composed of pyridinic N embedded graphitic carbon allows electrons to transfer from a metal nanoparticle to pyridinic N, resulting in an optimized p-orbital level of pyridinic N of PCL favorable for highly active conversion reaction of lithium sulfide. Further, PCL suppresses the direct contact of sulfur species with metal electrocatalysts. This surface protection effect inhibits the phase change of metal electrocatalysts to metal sulfide impurities, which maintains a highly active Li||S electrocatalysis for long-term cycling. Consequently, A h-level Li||S pouch cell with >500 W h kg−1 (specific energy based on current collector, anode, separator, electrolyte, and cathode), Coulombic efficiency (>95%), and stable life of 20 cycles was successfully realized.

 During infection and cancer, mTORC1-mediated metabolic regulation impacts CD8+ T cell effector expansion and memory development. However, the mechanisms by which CD8+ T cells regulate mTORC1 to support their unique metabolic requirements remain unknown. Here we show that NKG7, a lysosomal protein whose expression is restricted to cytotoxic lymphocytes, negatively regulates mTORC1 recruitment and activation by inhibiting assembly and function of the lysosomal proton pump, vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase). Human and mouse CD8+ T cells lacking NKG7 show more acidic lysosomes and increased activation of mTORC1 signaling, which could be reversed by inhibition of v-ATPase activity. In mice responding to LCMV infection, NKG7-deleted effector CD8+ T cells are less durable and generate fewer memory precursors, whereas induced expression of NKG7 in CD8+ T cells results in increased presence of intra-tumoral T cells. Overall, our work identifies NKG7 as a CD8+ T cell-specific regulator of mTORC1 activity, required for optimal immune responses.

Scenario-based analysis suggests that they should only be used to compensate for emissions from hard-to-abate sectors and overshoot. 
 Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is critical to most net-zero pathways, especially given challenges due to slow decarbonization, hard-to-abate (H2A) economic activities and non-CO2 GHGs. However, land-based CDR, which is the most widely deployed currently and in future projections, requires extensive land and water. Here we examine least-cost 1.5 °C overshoot pathways, finding that 78 of 81 scenarios would require all available sustainable CDR to compensate for H2A emissions and overshoot. Use of CDR to compensate for emissions from easier-to-decarbonize sectors such as electricity would leave less available to compensate for H2A emissions, increasing system-wide costs of net zero or rendering such goals impossible. Such usage, however, is allowed in many jurisdictions and is widespread in voluntary markets. We suggest that rapidly transitioning CDR usage to exclusively compensate for H2A emissions and overshoot is required to prevent lower costs for near-term actors leading to larger long-term system-wide costs.

Under high air pollution events, the number of N1Ox class ONs composed of aliphatic and aromatic compounds increased with high levels of oxidation.

 The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data at multiple frequencies, focusing on S- and C-band data with additional analysis for X- and L-band. This is the foundation for the translation of SAR data into NDVI values, thereby enabling the filling of gaps in NDVI data due to cloud cover. This study encompasses three distinct study areas in Argentina, Australia, and Vietnam, which exhibit considerable climatic and agricultural differences. NovaSAR-1 S-band and Sentinel-1 C-band data were acquired for all areas, with the addition of COSMO-SkyMed X-band and SAOCOM L-band SAR data for one region. Following the processing of the SAR data and the derivation of NDVI values from optical Sentinel-2 data, the relationship between them is analyzed for field-wise aggregated data.The relationship between S- and C-band SAR data and NDVI values is observed to be strong for all fields. Consequently, cross-polarized (HV or VH) data demonstrated this relationship for all fields with a Pearson correlation coefficient ρ>0.5, whereas for co-polarized data (HH or VV), this could only be shown for some fields and crops. In the case of rice paddy fields, however, a different relationship is observed. While both S- and C-band data demonstrate a good relationship, this is primarily evident in the case of co-polarized data, with cross-polarized data exhibiting a comparatively weaker relationship. A relationship was observed for X-band data, but no relationship could be attested for L-band data. Neither the cross-ratio nor the radar vegetation index (RVI) generally showed a stronger relationship with the NDVI compared to a single polarization.The demonstrated relationship between NDVI values and SAR backscatter data allows for a translation to be feasible. Consequently, the planned launch of the NISAR satellite, comprising S- and L-band SAR sensors, will facilitate new opportunities for agricultural monitoring. However, the retrieval of NDVI values from SAR data is a complex topic, as numerous factors, including crop type, crop phenology, SAR geometry and frequency, and others, influence this relationship."

 Ultraviolet (UV) remote sensing plays a critical role in understanding photochemical and biological processes in the global ocean. While UV radiation significantly influences the marine environment, the limited availability of global UV measurements has hindered comprehensive analyses, particularly in photochemically sensitive regions. The Ultraviolet Imager (UVI) on China’s HaiYang-1C (HY-1C) satellite, launched in 2018, offers unique data with two UV bands (355 and 385 nm), enabling the study of UV-driven oceanic processes that were previously unachievable with standard visible-only ocean color sensors. This study develops a system vicarious calibration (SVC) approach tailored for HY-1C’s UVI, integrating co-located observations from the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (COCTS) on the same satellite platform to derive accurate remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) in the UV spectrum. Using MOBY in situ measurements as reference data for SVC and ship-based measurements for validation, we demonstrate that UVI-derived Rrs achieve high accuracy, with Mean Absolute Percentage Differences (MAPD) reduced to 15.7 % and 8.4 % for the 355 and 385 nm bands, respectively, following system vicarious calibration. This enhanced accuracy provides a pathway for producing consistent UV ocean color products and contributes to a deeper understanding of marine biogeochemical cycles. The findings highlight the potential of HY-1C UVI in expanding ocean color research into the UV domain, offering valuable insights for future satellite missions."

 Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) is challenging especially when anomalies are presented in sub-pixel form.The spectral signatures of anomalies in mixed pixels are mixed with those of background, making anomalies difficult to be distinguished from background. Most existing methods detect sub-pixel targets in abundance space by spectral unmixing. However, since abundance feature extraction and anomaly detection are decoupled, the learned features are not well-suitable for the subsequent detection. Moreover, these methods neglect the negative effect of anomalies on spectral unmixing, which leads to degradation of detection performance. To tackle these problems, we propose a cascaded autoencoder (AE) unmixing network for HAD. First, based on anomalies have larger spectral reconstruction errors than background, a background estimation approach is proposed to alleviate the negative effect of anomalies on spectral unmixing. Second, a cascaded AE is designed to achieve spectral unmixing from the estimated background to simultaneously obtain the endmembers and abundance vectors. Third, a deep Gaussian mixture model is leveraged to estimate the density distributions of spectral features since anomalies usually lie in the low-density areas. In this way, spectral unmixing and detection are jointly optimized to construct a unified detection framework. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior detection performance to existing state-of-the-art HAD methods."

 Cross-modal flood change detection using optical and SAR images has become one of the most commonly used techniques for monitoring the progression of flooding events. Existing methods fail to adequately capture the interrelationship between semantics and changes, which limits the potential for effective flood detection. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight Synthetic-decompression network. The synthetic component is divided into four stages, each of which employs a Multi-branch Asymmetric Part-convolution block (MAPC) and a Temporal Semantic Interaction module (TSIM) to extract semantic features from dual-temporal images. Subsequently, these features are fed into the Temporal-mamba (T-Mamba), which uses 4D Selective Scanning (SS4D) to traverse temporal change information in four directions. The decompression component employs a three-stage Asymmetric Coordinate-convolution block (ACoord-Conv) to project the change results onto the source images, thereby indirectly supervising the model’s detection performance. Compared to the 22 state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight methods, SD-Mamba achieves an optimal balance between computational efficiency and detection accuracy. Under the same computational conditions, SD-Mamba demonstrated superior performance to other Mamba-based models, with an improvement of 1.01% in mIoU, while maintaining a lightweight structure with only 5.32M parameters and 12.24G floating-point operations (FLops).

 Recently, geological disasters such as land subsidence, landslides, mining-related collapse and others have been occurring more and more, posing serious threats to social and economic stability as well as human safety. InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) and advanved InSAR time-series technologies can monitor surface displacements at sub-centimeter level of accuracy, which has great and significant potential in detecting these disasters. Although several automated deformation detection methods based on CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) have been proposed, these methods are not only time-consuming- requiring specific datasets and models- but also exhibit limited generalizability. In this study, we propose a zero-shot deformation-prompt-based SAM (Segment Anything Model) method, which does not require any pre-training operations or establishing special datasets. It initially maps the surface displacement velocity of the study area by the InSAR time-series analysis. Then the deformation-prompt-based SAM method is proposed to directly identify the exact locations and morphologies of surface deformations on the velocity maps. The method primarily extracts the rectangular boxes and points of deformation areas according to the color display characteristics of the InSAR-based land deformation map. Then these boxes and points of deformation zones serve as the prompt to the SAM, which detects deformation zones in a zero-shot manner. To validate its effectiveness, experiments on deformation extraction for various types of geohazards are conducted by utilizing Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X images. The results show that 137 and 93 local urban subsidence areas in Shenzhen City are identified based on different SAR images. Most of them can be automatically detected by the proposed method. Additionally, we have identified 18 landslides near Jichang Town, 36 landslides in Heifangtai and 27 major deformation zones in the Huainan mining area of Anhui Province. Statistical analysis reveals that our method can obtain high pixel accuracy in detecting land subsidence, landslides, and mining-related deformation areas with zero-shot based on different SAR images. Thus, the automatic surface deformation detection method holds considerable promise for compiling and regularly updating inventories of surface deformation data related to different types of geohazards. It has the potential to significantly enhance monitoring efficiency and provide robust technical support for disaster prevention and loss reduction."

 The National Atmospheric Deposition Program established the Mercury (Hg) Litterfall Network in 2007 to assist with estimating changes in dry deposition of Hg. These measurements represent primarily gaseous elemental mercury (Hg0) taken up by foliage actively during the growing season through stomata. Hg deposition is driven by litterfall mass; thus concentrations are a better indicator of trends. Previous work assessed trends from 2007 to 2014 from 27 locations in the eastern U.S. and found that litterfall total Hg concentrations declined. Here, data from the same area representing 2017 to 2021, 2013 to 2021, and 2007 to 2021 were compiled. For the first two time periods no significant trends in litter concentrations were observed; however, values measured at locations impacted by local/regional sources had higher concentrations and showed increasing trends, but these were not significant. Using all sites for which data were available from 2017 to 2021, total Hg concentration in litterfall for 2017 to 2018 was significantly greater than 2020 to 2021. Using all data from 2007 to 2021 Hg concentrations in litter have declined, as have precipitation concentrations. In general, from 2013 to 2021 Mid-Atlantic, East Coast, and Mid-Western concentration in foliage declined due to controls on sources; while the Great Lakes Region and Southeast did not change. Methylmercury was measured in litterfall at all locations. MeHg concentrations generally declined from 2007 to 2021, but have not changed since 2017. However, concentrations for 2021 were higher than for 2020 for most sites.

 The knowledge of chemical composition of atmospheric aerosols is key to understand aerosol-cloud-climate interactions and surface water biogeochemistry in the oceanic regions. Despite of strong natural and anthropogenic sources in its upwind regions, the studies on aerosol composition have been very limited over the Arabian Sea. We have comprehensively analyzed the results from global models, ECMWF's CAMS and NASA's MERRA-2 reanalyses, in conjunction with our ship-based measurements. Both models captured the overall spatio-temporal variability in sulphate (SO42−) and sea salt (r = 0.76–0.86). However, there is large scatter in PM10 and dust variability and the concentrations are typically overestimated by MERRA-2 except during winter, but underestimated by CAMS. Despite of difference in magnitudes, these models successfully reproduced the key seasonal features e.g., winter-time maxima in sulphate (9.0 ± 6.5 μg m−3 in MERRA-2, 11.9 ± 6.2 μg m−3 in measurements). While sulphate enhancement is most pronounced along India's west coast, the monsoon-time sea salt spike is strongest near east coast of the Middle-East (>200 μg m−3) region. Trend analysis results from both models indicate a statistically significant increase in sulphate aerosols over the Arabian Sea during 2003–2022 period (0.4 μgm−3y−1 in winter). However, long-term trends in sea salt and dust are not consistent between the two models and underscore a need for further investigations.

 African dust (AD) plays a key role in atmospheric and biogeochemical processes across various ecosystems, yet its impact in Mexico, particularly in the Yucatan Peninsula (YP), remains understudied. This study chemically characterized AD transported to the YP during the massive “Godzilla” event in June 2020 and subsequent intrusions in 2021. The objective was to describe the chemical composition of dust, trace its origins, and assess its influence on atmospheric particles at three sites: Cozumel, Mérida, and Sisal. Aerosol samples were collected using PM10 and PM2.5 samplers and analyzed via Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence, and ion chromatography. Satellite imagery and air mass trajectories were used to identify periods with AD transport. Descriptive statistics and hierarchical clustering were used to identify intrusion periods and group samples based on their chemical compositions. Our results showed that PM10 concentrations during AD events increased up to 20 times compared to baseline levels. Among the analyzed elements, Al, Fe, Ca, and Si were the most abundant. Enrichment of ionic species like SO42− and NO3− was attributed to marine sources and local emissions. Correlation analysis and rare earth element clustering confirmed the African origin of the dust, primarily from Morocco and northern Algeria and Mali (Sahara region), with evidence of particle dilution as the dust traveled across the YP.

 Accurate identification of aerosol types is essential for understanding the radiative properties of aerosols and further studying aerosol regional and global climate effects. However, aerosol type identification studies combining satellite and ground observations are rare. In this paper, an aerosol type identification model based on aerosol relative optical depth (AROD) and volume depolarization ratio (VDR) is developed by effectively matching satellite and ground observation data. The accuracy and applicability of the new model are verified by typical AERONET sites with dominant aerosols, and the spatial distribution characteristics of aerosol types in global continents are also studied and analyzed with joint observation data from 2018 to 2023 globally. The results show that the East Asian continent, North America, and Europe are the main source regions for continental aerosol emissions. Among the continents, densely populated East/Southeast Asia is more heavily polluted by anthropogenic aerosols than other continents, while North America and Europe are relatively less polluted. The Indo-China Peninsula, central and southern Africa, central South America, and central and northern North America are the main source emission regions of global biomass burning aerosol, while northern Africa, West Asia, and Central Asia emit most of the global dust and polluted dust aerosols. Additionally, marine aerosols are more frequent along the east coast of North America, the west coast of Africa, the Malay Archipelago, and some island sites.

 Accurate knowledge of cloud properties is essential for reducing uncertainties in weather forecasts and improving climate prediction models. This study investigates the characteristics of cloud base height (CBH) using high-resolution ceilometer data collected at Kototabang, West Sumatra, Indonesia (0.202°S, 100.317°E), situated at 864.5 m above sea level. Analyzing data recorded over 18 years (April 2002 – December 2021), we found that clouds in Kototabang are predominantly characterized by low CBH (below 2 km), which accounts for 71.3 % of total cloud occurrences, followed by medium CBH (2–6 km) at 25.4 %. Most clouds in Kototabang consist of single-layer clouds (57.78 %), while two-layer and three-layer clouds are observed at 8.41 % and 0.56 %, respectively. Furthermore, CBH tends to decrease as the number of cloud layers increases, with the distance between cloud layers being relatively small, typically less than 0.5 km. The dominance of low CBH in Kototabang is consistent with the frequent occurrence of intense convective clouds in this region, as reported in previous studies. This pattern is also evident from cloud cover data derived from the fifth-generation ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5), which shows high cloud cover (HCC) during the wet season and low HCC during the dry season. Additionally, the mean CBH of the lowest cloud layer varies with weather conditions, reaching 1.80 km during non-rainy condition and decreasing to 1.3 km during rainfall events. CBH in Kototabang exhibits distinct seasonal and diurnal variations. The monthly cloud occurrence follows a bimodal pattern, closely aligning with the monthly average rainfall recorded by an optical rain gauge, which peaks in November and April. During the wet season (April and November), low-CBH clouds (<2 km) are more dominant, whereas clouds with medium and high CBH (2–6 km) are more frequently observed during the dry season (May–July). The prevalence of low CBH in the wet season indicates the presence of thick convective clouds that develop rapidly, as corroborated by ERA5 cloud cover data. A clear diurnal pattern of CBH is also observed. In the morning (06:00–12:00 LST), when rainfall occurrence is minimal, CBH is generally higher. However, a noticeable decline in CBH is observed after 13:00 LST, coinciding with the increasing dominance of convective clouds over the Sumatran landmass. ERA5 data also support this diurnal variation. The observed CBH variations in Kototabang are a genuine atmospheric phenomenon rather than an artefact of ceilometer measurement limitations. Separating CBH data between rainy and non-rainy periods confirms the persistence of these seasonal and diurnal variations."

Rassoul,Space and ground-based measurements of negative cloud-to-ground strokes with and without significant continuing currents,"•The GLM detection efficiency (DE) for negative cloud-to-ground flashes was 80.5 %. •The negative cloud-to-ground stroke DE was 50 %. •First stroke DE was significantly lower than that for subsequent strokes. •Stroke DE was much higher for strokes with significant continuing currents. •The GLM severely underestimated continuing current durations. 
 We examined the responses of the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) onboard the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-16 (GOES-16) to 174 negative cloud-to-ground (CG) return strokes in 77 flashes that occurred in Florida in 2018–2023. We recorded these strokes on high-speed video cameras from which we measured the continuing current durations. The GLM flash and stroke detection efficiencies were 80.5 and 50 %, respectively. The nighttime stroke detection efficiency was 2.4 times higher than that during the daytime (81.3 versus 33.9 %, receptively). The detection efficiencies for first strokes and single-stroke flashes were 31.3 and 30 %, respectively, which were lower than that for subsequent strokes (61.7 %). The GLM stroke detection efficiency did not depend upon the return stroke peak current reported by the U.S. National Lightning Detection Network, but it was significantly higher (64.9 versus 37.5 %) for strokes with significant (>3 ms) continuing current durations versus those without (<3 ms) such currents. Continuing current durations estimated from the GLM data were significantly underestimated and were unrelated to those measured from video camera records; none of the GLM-derived continuing current durations exceeded 6 ms, while those obtained from video camera records ranged from 0.28 to 685 ms. GLM Level 0 versus Level 2 data comparison indicates that onboard and ground processing techniques applied for noise removal may be responsible for continuing current duration underestimation and reduced first-stroke detection efficiency, respectively."

Mechanical force and auxiliary binding partners converge to stabilize the cadherin-catenin complex’s inherently weak binding to actin filaments (F-actin) through unclear mechanisms. Here, we show that afadin’s coiled-coil (CC) domain and vinculin synergistically enhance the cadherin-catenin complex’s F-actin engagement. The cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of an E-cadherin–β-catenin–αE-catenin–vinculin–afadin-CC supra-complex bound to F-actin reveals that afadin-CC bridges adjacent αE-catenin actin-binding domains along the filament, stabilizing flexible αE-catenin segments implicated in mechanical regulation. These cooperative binding contacts promote the formation of supra-complex clusters along F-actin. Additionally, cryo-EM variability analysis links supra-complex binding along individual F-actin strands to nanoscale filament curvature, a deformation mode associated with cytoskeletal forces. Collectively, this work elucidates a mechanistic framework by which vinculin and afadin tune cadherin-catenin complex–cytoskeleton coupling to support AJ function across varying mechanical regimes."

We used computational methods to identify 149 sites across the HIV-1 clade B genome under HLA-II–associated selection. Functional assays, including activation-induced intracellular cytokine staining and enzyme-linked immunospot for interferon-γ, revealed diverse mechanisms of HIV-1 adaptation to HLA-II–associated immune pressure, ranging from loss to sustained antigen recognition. T cell receptor and RNA sequencing demonstrated variable clonotype overlap of T cell clones to recognize adapted versus non-adapted peptides, with cells targeting adapted peptides exhibiting a dysfunctional transcriptomic state. Moreover, incorporating HLA-II–associated adaptation strengthened the correlation between Gag-specific viral adaptation and poor disease outcomes.

However, their practical use is limited by the inability to deliver high forces at low voltages, primarily due to a lack of understanding of their mechanics. We introduce a novel deformable body fracture mechanics approach and high-resolution strain field imaging to reveal that nonuniform stress distributions cause EA clutches to fail through delamination and crack propagation. Using this insight, we developed EA clutches sustaining 22 newtons over 1 square centimeter at 100 volts, achieving the highest stress per voltage among similar clutches. This was achieved by incorporating a soft interlayer and peeling stopper for uniform stress distribution and mitigating the failure modes. These EA clutches were integrated into a lightweight ring-based wearable system for finger rehabilitation and haptics. Our findings lay the groundwork for designing low-voltage, high-performance EA clutches for next-generation motion and force control applications."

While they are used for their ability to increase serotonergic signaling in the brain, SSRIs are also known to have a broad range of effects beyond the brain, including immune and metabolic effects. Recent studies have demonstrated that SSRIs are protective in animal models and humans against several infections, including sepsis and COVID-19; however, the mechanisms underlying this protection are largely unknown. Here, we mechanistically link two previously described effects of the SSRI fluoxetine in mediating protection against sepsis. We show that fluoxetine-mediated protection is independent of peripheral serotonin and instead increases levels of circulating interleukin-10 (IL-10). IL-10 is necessary for protection from sepsis-induced hypertriglyceridemia, preventing cardiac effects including impairment of glucose oxidation, ectopic lipid accumulation, ventricular stretch and possibly cardiac failure.

Here, we construct an Earth System Model that integrates these proposed cooling mechanisms in detail. The model can reproduce the broad geologic record of ice cap expansion, allowing us to infer the primary drivers of long-term climate change. Our results indicate that recent icehouse climates required a combination of different cooling mechanisms acting simultaneously and were not driven by a single known process, potentially explaining why icehouses have been rarer than greenhouses over Earth history."

While the genetic contribution to these diseases is well established, important environmental factors have been less studied at molecular and cellular levels. Here, we used single-cell and cell type–specific techniques to investigate the effect of glucocorticoid (GC) exposure, a mediator of antenatal environmental risk, on gene regulation and lineage specification in unguided human neural organoids. We characterized the transcriptional response to chronic GC exposure during neural differentiation and studied the underlying gene regulatory networks by integrating single-cell transcriptomics with chromatin accessibility data. We found lasting cell type–specific changes that included autism risk genes and several transcription factors associated with neurodevelopment. Chronic GC exposure influenced lineage specification primarily by priming the inhibitory neuron lineage through transcription factors likePBX3.

This tension is illustrated at theDrosophilaneuromuscular junction (NMJ), where two motor inputs that differ in structural and functional properties coinnervate most muscles to coordinate locomotion. To stabilize NMJ activity, motor neurons augment neurotransmitter release following diminished postsynaptic glutamate receptor functionality, termed presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP). How these distinct inputs contribute to PHP plasticity remains enigmatic. We have used a botulinum neurotoxin to selectively silence each input and resolve their roles in PHP, demonstrating that PHP is input specific: Chronic (genetic) PHP selectively targets the tonic MN-Ib, where active zone remodeling enhances Ca2+influx to promote increased glutamate release. In contrast, acute (pharmacological) PHP selectively increases vesicle pools to potentiate phasic MN-Is. Thus, distinct homeostatic modulations in active zone nanoarchitecture, vesicle pools, and Ca2+influx collaborate to enable input-specific PHP expression."

Unexpectedly, we observe that chemical functionalization can block more than 50% of the material’s porous interior, rendering it inaccessible to small-molecule analytes. Only in situ imaging unveils the inaccessibility when compared to the industry-accepted ex situ characterization methods. Selectively removing some of the functionalization with solvent restores pore access without substantially altering the single-molecule kinetics that underlie the separation and agree with bulk chromatography measurements.

The CRP incorporates a double–cross-linking silk fibroin network and hierarchical micropores, resulting in a flexible, hydrophilic, and biocompatible patch with tissue-matching mechanical properties. The CRP could effectively seal defects and encourage tissue ingrowth, successfully repairing TF. A tissue-engineered epithelialized CRP (E-CRP) was further developed to enhance in situ reepithelialization. The CRP demonstrated reliable structural stability and facilitated effective tissue regeneration and functional reconstruction of TF defects in a large animal model.

The EB disruption is accompanied by the alternations in permeability and even the breakdown of tight junctions (TJs), leading to the leakage of albumin; thus, albumin can serve as a biomarker for EB disruption. Herein, we develop an albumin-specific, covalently tagged near-infrared II (NIR-II) dye, with its high selectivity for endogenous albumin, for targeted imaging EB disruption. Our albumin-tagging dye serves as a chromophore to construct NIR-II fluorescent proteins in situ, with substantially improved brightness. Thus, through in situ dye tagging of endogenous albumin as the efficient “targeting agent,” we can precisely image disruptions in various endothelial barriers. Unlike the traditional exogenous targeting agents (e.g., dye-labeled antibodies) with enzymatic degradation or immune system capture issues, in situ albumin tagging demonstrates superhigh performance for targeted imaging."

Previous studies have primarily focused on how receiving plants respond. However, little is known about how these receivers communicate back to the emitter plants and their subsequent impacts. Our findings indicated increased plant tolerance when neighboring plants were present, suggesting bidirectional plant communication. Furthermore, we established a model to explore the role of signals from receiver plants, identifying squalene as a crucial feedback signal enhancing the cold tolerance in emitter plants by up-regulatingCsCBF5expression. Further analysis using yeast one-hybrid analysis coupled with inhibition of brassinosteroid pathways suggested that squalene-induced castasterone (CS) accumulation directly activatedCsCBF5expression modulated byCsBES1/BZR1. Overall, these results demonstrated the role of the squalene-CS-BES1/BZR1-CBF5pathway in the bidirectional communication between plants, expanding our understanding of plant interactions."

Recently, this concept has been realized in classical photonic and acoustic systems. However, these implementations are constrained by adiabatic conditions, necessitating long operation distances and hindering practical applications. Here, we conceive and demonstrate shortcut to adiabatic (STA) braiding of light in three-dimensional silicon photonic chips. Our device comprises trilayer silicon waveguides embedded in the SU-8 polymer, using an STA strategy to expedite the braiding operations, resulting in compact devices that function as photonic quantum X, Y, and Z gates. We further experimentally observed non-Abelian braiding behaviors based on this STA-braiding scheme. Our work represents a compact braiding apparatus with a size reduction of nearly three orders of magnitude compared to previous works.

Here, we demonstrate that a coherent Ising machine (CIM) based on degenerate optical parametric oscillator (DOPO) pulses can find solutions to large-scale maximum independent set problems, which is an essential optimization problem that is closely related to real-world optimization tasks. We implemented a stable external field for each Ising spin as an interaction between a DOPO pulse and a group of ferromagnetically coupled auxiliary pulses. Consequently, the CIM delivered independent sets for dense graphs with up to 40,000 nodes. We compared the performance of the CIM with that of optimized simulated annealing algorithm implemented on a digital computer and found that the CIM outperformed the central processing unit (CPU) in terms of the time needed to obtain good approximate solutions when the graph size exceeded several thousand nodes."

Here, we show that a popular feature attribution model, under certain assumptions, estimates an average of a causal quantity reflecting the direct influence of one variable on another. We leverage this insight to propose a precise definition of a gene regulatory relationship and implement a new tool, CIMLA (Counterfactual Inference by Machine Learning and Attribution Models), to identify differences in gene regulatory networks between biological conditions, a problem that has received great attention in recent years. Using extensive benchmarking on simulated data, we show that CIMLA is more robust to confounding variables and is more accurate than leading methods.

Photoferroelectric semiconductors exhibit immense potential in capturing multimodal nonvolatile states, attributed to their spontaneous and reversible in-plane and out-of-plane polarizations. Herein, we uncover an unprecedented nonvolatile, zero-bias, ultrafast photocurrent hysteresis response with an innovative all-optical approach, discerned by analyzing in-plane and out-of-plane terahertz (THz) waves emitted from photoferroelectric α-In2Se3. The mechanism underlying such ultrafast photocurrent hysteresis arises from anomalous linear and circular photovoltaic effects synchronously fueled by a localized rearrangement of polarization. By harnessing the anisotropic photoferroelectric kinetics–induced relative phase between the in-plane and out-of-plane polarizations, we further demonstrate the flexible selection of chirality, tunable rotational angle, and optimizable ellipticity of THz waves. Our findings present a unique ultrafast and nondestructive strategy for investigating photoferroelectric hysteresis, empowering dynamic polarization manipulation of THz waves for a wide range of THz applications."

However, current nanosystems inducing cuproptosis rely on exogenous toxic copper ions, limiting the scope of biomaterials. Developing nanoplatforms that induce cuproptosis without exogenous copper holds substantial promise. Here, we engineered a two-dimensional iron (Fe) single-atom–doped molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) piezocatalyst (Fe-MoS2) for tumor therapy. Incorporating single Fe atoms enhances MoS2piezoelectric polarization via charge redistribution and modulates Fe and Mo oxidation states, enabling multifaceted enzymatic activities, including peroxidase-, glutathione oxidase–, oxidase-, and catalase-like activities. Upon ultrasound stimulation, the Fe-MoS2nanocatalyst generates reactive oxygen species and depletes glutathione via synergistic piezocatalytic and enzyocatalytic effects, disrupting copper ion homeostasis and inducing cuproptosis, concurrently triggering ferroptosis and ferritinophagy, which collectively enhances tumor suppression. This study represents the first paradigm to introduce a copper-free piezocatalyst for initiating cuproptosis, substantially advancing the applications of cuproptosis in tumor therapy."

This model similarly predicts that technological life analogous to human life on Earth is “exceedingly rare” in the Universe. Here, we critically reevaluate core assumptions of the hard-steps model through the lens of historical geobiology. Specifically, we propose an alternative model where there are no hard steps, and evolutionary singularities required for human origins can be explained via mechanisms outside of intrinsic improbability. Furthermore, if Earth’s surface environment was initially inhospitable not only to human life, but also to certain key intermediate steps required for human existence, then the timing of human origins was controlled by the sequential opening of new global environmental windows of habitability over Earth history."
