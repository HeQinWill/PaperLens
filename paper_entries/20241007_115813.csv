Noll;Haobing Liu;Ye Wu;Ke Hao,An Integrated Field Study of Turbulence and Dispersion Variations in Road Microenvironments,"Traffic-related air pollutants (TRAPs) emitted from vehicle tailpipes disperse into nearby microenvironments, posing potential exposure risks. Thus, accurately identifying the emission hotspots of TRAPs is essential for assessing potential exposure risks. We investigated the relationship between turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and pollutant dispersion (D) through an integrated field measurement. A five-year near-road sampling campaign (5 min based) near a light-duty vehicle-restricted roadway and an on-road sampling campaign (5 s based) on isolated proving grounds were conducted. The D was first calculated based on vehicle emission and pollutant concentrations and then paired with TKE measurements. Here, 198 near-road and 377 on-road measurement pairs were collected. In the near-road measurements, TKE and D showed a positive relationship (R2 ≥ 0.69) with the vehicle flow rate, while they showed similar decay patterns and sensitivity to vehicle types in the on-road measurements. A relationship between TKE and D (TKE-D) was developed through these measurements, demonstrating a robust correlation (R2 ≥ 0.61) and consistent slope values (1.1–1.3). These findings provide field evidence for the positive association between TKE and D, irrespective of the measurement techniques or locations. The TKE-D relationship enables vehicle emission estimation with TKE as the sole input, facilitating the identification of emission hotspots with high spatiotemporal resolution."

Sunlight is a vital factor for the Cr cycle in the surface environment, which may be affected by photoactive substances such as ferrihydrite (Fh) and dissolved black carbon (DBC). Herein, sunlight-driven transformation dynamics of Cr species on DBC–Fh coprecipitates were studied. Under sunlight, the removal of aqueous Cr(VI) by DBC–Fh coprecipitates occurred through sunlight-driven reductive sequestration including adsorption, followed by surface reduction (pathway 1) and aqueous reduction, followed by precipitation (pathway 2). Additionally, coprecipitates with a higher DBC content exhibited a more effective reduction of both adsorbed (kapp,S_red) and aqueous Cr(VI) (kapp,A_red). Photoelectrons facilitated Cr(VI) reduction through direct electron transfer; notably, electron donating DBC promoted the production of photoelectrons by consuming photogenerated holes. Photogenerated Fe(II) species (mineral-phase and aqueous Fe(II)) mediated electron transfer for Cr(VI) reduction, which was reinforced via a ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) process between DBC–organic ligands and mineral Fe(III). Furthermore, ·O2– also mediated Cr(VI) reduction, although this impact was limited. Overall, this study demonstrates that photoelectrons and photogenerated electron mediators play a crucial role in Cr(VI) reductive sequestration on DBC–Fh coprecipitates, providing new insights into the geochemical cycle of Cr pollution in sunlight-influenced surface environments."

We used 7 years of satellite observations and model and reanalysis products to control for co‐varying meteorology, and to assess how dust and other aerosols impact cloud phase and cloud radiative effects over the summertime sea ice. We focus on clouds at 3 km, where dust modeling is most accurate. There is strong indication that dust aerosols caused about 4.5% of clouds below −15°C to change phase, with smaller effects at higher temperatures. Sulfate has a smaller impact on cloud phase. Dust is associated with cloud‐mediated surface cooling of up to a 6.3 W m−2 below single‐layer clouds at ∼3 km in June. This is the first observational study to constrain likely dust‐related cloud radiative effects over the summertime Arctic sea ice."

The correlation coefficients between them are 0.66 (passing the 99.9% confidence level) and 0.12 during 1979–2002 and 2003–2023. Therefore, the May‐June NWPSH has a strong connection with July‐August East Asian precipitation during 1979–2002, but not during 2003–2023. The interdecadal variations in the relationship of NWPSH are due to interdecadal changes of ENSO. During 1979–2002, the eastern‐type ENSO in prior winter, having longer durations, can influence May‐June and July‐August NWPSH and the North Indian Ocean. However, the central‐type ENSO in prior winter only persists it's influence until May‐June, and changes into a Pacific Dipole pattern in July‐August during 2003–2023. Despite the North Indian Ocean continually warms during 2003–2023, the tropical Pacific Dipole offsets its impacts on the NWPSH."

Here we characterize the atmospheric signal of this strong evaporation in terms of water vapor isotopes and investigate if such a signal can have a cumulative imprint on the ocean mixed‐layer. Observations include continuous water vapor isotope measurements, event‐based precipitation samples, and sea‐water samples taken at various depths from the research vessel Alliance during the Iceland‐Greenland Seas Project cruise in February and March 2018. In conjunction with a simulation from a regional, isotope‐enabled atmospheric model, we find that the predominant atmospheric isotope signature during predominant marine cold‐air outbreak conditions is −129.8 ± 16.6‰ for δ2H and −18.10 ± 2.87‰ for δ18O, with a d‐excess of 15.1 ± 7.9‰, indicating enhanced non‐equilibrium fractionation compared to the global average. During events of warm‐air intrusion from mid‐latitudes, near‐surface vapor becomes saturated and the vapor d‐excess approaches equilibrium or becomes negative. Similarly, precipitation d‐excess is lower and thus closer to equilibrium conditions during warm‐air intrusions. There are indications that an evaporation signal of waters exiting the Nordic Seas through Denmark Strait could be locally enhanced over seasons to years, as supported by simple model calculations. Our findings thus suggest that evaporation signals could be transferred into the ocean isotope composition in this region, potentially enabling mass‐balance constraints in isotope‐enabled coupled ocean‐atmosphere models."

Rendón,Climatological Tracking and Lifecycle Characteristics of Mesoscale Convective Systems in Northwestern South America,"Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are crucial in shaping large‐scale tropical circulation and the hydrological cycle, particularly in Northwestern South America (NwSA), a region marked by complex terrain and significant MCS activity. Understanding MCSs in NwSA is vital due to their impact on precipitation patterns and potential for severe weather events. To enhance this understanding, the ATRACKCS algorithm was developed for tracking convective systems, utilizing precipitation and brightness temperature data sets. This research focuses on documenting the spatiotemporal variability of MCS occurrence, life cycle, and movement. Notably, MCS hotspots were identified to the west of the major orographic features in the region, with maximum occurrences at night, contrasting with the region's typical afternoon peak in land convection. MCS movement is also heavily influenced by topography, with higher velocities on the eastern (windward) side of the Andes compared to velocities on the western (leeward) side. MCSs generally move westward, driven by easterly winds, but this pattern is not consistent throughout the year or region. Northward movement is predominant to the west of the Andes, while southward movement is observed to the east. These seasonal and regional movement variations are linked to factors such as the intertropical convergence zone position, moisture availability, topography, and low‐level jets. This research underscores the complexity of MCSs in NwSA and emphasizes the need for detailed studies on the atmospheric environment shaping these systems. Additionally, it provides a robust 21‐year MCS database for NwSA and an advanced tracking tool for research in various geographic contexts and impact areas."

Understanding the factors influencing the generation of QBWO over the TP (QBWOTP) and its physical mechanism is crucial. This study has investigated the influence of multi–timescale and land–atmosphere interactions on the generation of the QBWOTP in surface potential vorticity (SPV), a valuable tool for characterizing the mechanical and thermal variabilities in mountain forcing, based on a 2014 case study. Results indicate that in the free atmosphere, the summer monsoon onset over the Bay of Bengal induces a northward shift in the westerly jet toward the TP, manifested as an increase in low‐frequency zonal winds. This shift facilitates the propagation of wave trains, leading to atmospheric quasi–biweekly potential temperature anomalies (θa) over the TP through a multi‐timescale interaction. Additionally, the TP's surface thermal forcing and arrival of wave trains trigger anomalous upward motion and increase cloud cover. The resultant decrease in net short‐wave radiations and increase in net long‐wave radiations contribute to variations in surface potential temperature (θs) over the TP. As θa and θs evolve, the difference between them enlarges, resulting in the generation of the SPV QBWOTP. Given the relationship between the QBWOTP and downstream rainfall, this study could provide novel insights into understanding and predicting downstream rainfall QBWO."

This study aims to investigate the evolving soil moisture‐heatwave relationship over eastern China in the future, using a convection‐permitting (CP, ∼4 km) regional climate model (RCM). The CP‐RCM model simulates historical (1998–2007) and future (2070–2099) climates over eastern China, with three pseudo‐global warming (PGW) experiments conducted under the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios. Results indicate a substantial increase in heatwave frequency (HWF) and magnitude (HWM) over eastern China, particularly under the RCP8.5 scenario. The largest HWF (up to 23 days) is expected in South China (SC), and the largest HWM (up to 3.25°C) is expected in Loess Plateau (LP) and North China Plain (NCP), indicating a pronounced future risk of heatwave in the region. Antecedent soil moisture exhibits a negative correlation with heatwave indices (HWM and HWF) in most areas of eastern China, suggesting its role in mitigating heatwaves. Quantile regression analysis shows that antecedent soil moisture exerts a stronger effect on the upper quantile of the HWF/HWM than on the lower quantile. With global warming, the amplifying effect due to soil moisture deficiency on future heatwaves is expected to expand spatially and become more pronounced. Increased soil moisture control on heatwaves can be attributed to reduced energy limitation and intensified water limitation. A comprehensive investigation across five sub‐regions reveals the role of various soil moisture regimes in modulating heatwaves over eastern China."

Studies to characterize regional differences in OAE efficiencies and biogeochemical effects are still sparse. As subduction regions play a pivotal role for anthropogenic carbon uptake and centennial storage, we here evaluate OAE efficiencies in the subduction regions of the Southern Ocean, the Northwest Atlantic, and the Norwegian‐Barents Sea region. Using the ocean biogeochemistry model FESOM2.1‐REcoM3, we simulate continuous OAE globally and in the subduction regions under high (SSP3‐7.0) and low (SSP1‐2.6) emission scenarios. The OAE efficiency calculated by two different metrics is higher (by 8%–30%) for SSP3‐7.0 than for SSP1‐2.6 due to a lower buffer factor in a high‐CO2 ${\mathrm{C}\mathrm{O}}_{2}$ world. All subduction regions show a CDR potential (0.23–0.31; PgC CO2 ${\mathrm{C}\mathrm{O}}_{2}$ uptake per Pg alkaline material) consistent with global OAE for both emission scenarios. Calculating the efficiency as the ratio of excess dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) to excess alkalinity shows that the Southern Ocean and the Northwest Atlantic are as efficient as the global ocean (0.79–0.85), while the Norwegian‐Barents Sea region has a lower efficiency (0.65–0.75). The subduction regions store a fraction of excess carbon below 1 km that is 1.9 times higher than the global ocean. The excess surface alkalinity and thus CO2 ${\mathrm{C}\mathrm{O}}_{2}$ uptake and storage follow the mixed‐layer depth seasonality, with the majority of the excess CO2 ${\mathrm{C}\mathrm{O}}_{2}$ flux occurring in summer at shallow mixed layer depths. This study therefore highlights that subduction regions can be efficient for OAE if optimal deployment strategies are developed."

In the last four decades, due to global warming, permafrost degradation has accelerated significantly in high latitudes and altitudes. However, the impact of permafrost degradation on vegetation remains poorly understood to date. Based on active layer thickness (ALT) monitoring data, meteorological data and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, we found that most ALT‐monitored sites in the Northern Hemisphere show an increasing trend in NDVI and ALT. This suggests an overall increase in NDVI from 1980 to 2021 while permafrost degradation has been occurring. Permafrost degradation positively influences NDVI growth, with the intensity of the effects varying across land cover types and permafrost regions. Furthermore, based on Mann‐Kendall trend test, we detected abrupt changes in NDVI and environmental factors, further confirming that there is a strong consistency between the abrupt changes of ALT and NDVI, and the consistency between the abrupt change events of ALT and NDVI is stronger than that of air temperature and precipitation. These findings work toward a better comprehending of permafrost effects on vegetation growth in the context of climate change."

Here, we projected biofuel combustion under various Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) using the Global Change Assessment Model and assessed associated mercury emissions in cooking, heating, and power generation over 2020–2050, aligning with the carbon neutrality target. Our analysis reveals that global biofuel mercury emissions are projected to be 9.90–18.40 tons by 2050, compared to the annual emissions of 13.89 tons in 2020. Notably, a substantial increase in emissions from power generation is expected, escalating from 0.57 tons in 2020 to 4.69–8.27 tons by 2050, with China and Southeast Asia emerging as primary contributors.

The mechanisms behind this recruitment remain poorly understood. Here, we use an in-vitro model of angiogenic invasion with traction force microscopy to reveal that hyper-angiogenic Ccm2-silenced endothelial cells enhance angiogenic invasion of neighboring wild-type cells through force and extracellular matrix-guided mechanisms. We demonstrate that mechanically hyperactive CCM2-silenced tips guide wild-type cells by transmitting pulling forces and by creating paths in the matrix, in a ROCKs-dependent manner. This is associated with reinforcement of β1 integrin and actin cytoskeleton in wild-type cells. Further, wild-type cells are reprogrammed into stalk cells and activate matrisome and DNA replication programs, thereby initiating proliferation. Our findings reveal how CCM2 mutants hijack wild-type cell functions to fuel lesion growth, providing insight into the etiology of vascular malformations. By integrating biophysical and molecular techniques, we offer tools for studying cell mechanics in tissue heterogeneity and disease progression. In cerebral cavernous malformations, mutant cells recruit healthy endothelial cells to form mosaic lesions. Here, the authors show that mutant cells can hijack and reprogram neighboring wildtype cells by mechanically pulling on them."

Here, the authors exploit these techniques to explore the small proteome of Methanosarcina mazei. 
 The mesophilic methanogenic archaeal model organism Methanosarcina mazei strain Gö1 is crucial for climate and environmental research due to its ability to produce methane. Here, we establish a Ribo-seq protocol for M. mazei strain Gö1 under two growth conditions (nitrogen sufficiency and limitation). The translation of 93 previously annotated and 314 unannotated small ORFs, coding for proteins ≤ 70 amino acids, is predicted with high confidence based on Ribo-seq data. LC-MS analysis validates the translation for 62 annotated small ORFs and 26 unannotated small ORFs. Epitope tagging followed by immunoblotting analysis confirms the translation of 13 out of 16 selected unannotated small ORFs. A comprehensive differential transcription and translation analysis reveals that 29 of 314 unannotated small ORFs are differentially regulated in response to nitrogen availability at the transcriptional and 49 at the translational level. A high number of reported small RNAs are emerging as dual-function RNAs, including sRNA154, the central regulatory small RNA of nitrogen metabolism. Several unannotated small ORFs are conserved in Methanosarcina species and overproducing several (small ORF encoded) small proteins suggests key physiological functions. Overall, the comprehensive analysis opens an avenue to elucidate the function(s) of multitudinous small proteins and dual-function RNAs in M. mazei. Ribo-seq and peptidomics have the potential to advance archaeal genomic annotations. Here, the authors exploit these techniques to explore the small proteome of Methanosarcina mazei."

Here authors increase the metabolic fitness of CAR-T cells by stable overexpression of the glucose transporter GLUT1, which allows them to increase their glucose intake and enhances their antitumour function. 
 The intensive nutrient requirements needed to sustain T cell activation and proliferation, combined with competition for nutrients within the tumor microenvironment, raise the prospect that glucose availability may limit CAR-T cell function. Here, we seek to test the hypothesis that stable overexpression (OE) of the glucose transporter GLUT1 in primary human CAR-T cells would improve their function and antitumor potency. We observe that GLUT1OE in CAR-T cells increases glucose consumption, glycolysis, glycolytic reserve, and oxidative phosphorylation, and these effects are associated with decreased T cell exhaustion and increased Th17 differentiation. GLUT1OE also induces broad metabolic reprogramming associated with increased glutathione-mediated resistance to reactive oxygen species, and increased inosine accumulation. When challenged with tumors, GLUT1OE CAR-T cells secrete more proinflammatory cytokines and show enhanced cytotoxicity in vitro, and demonstrate superior tumor control and persistence in mouse models. Our collective findings support a paradigm wherein glucose availability is rate limiting for effector CAR-T cell function and demonstrate that enhancing glucose availability via GLUT1OE could augment antitumor immune function.

Here, authors show a selective weakness of certain hypothalamic neurons in a mouse model of social dysfunction and explore its potential therapeutic intervention. 
 Selective vulnerability offers a conceptual framework for understanding neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, where specific neuronal types are selectively affected and adjacent ones are spared. However, the applicability of this framework to neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly those characterized by atypical social behaviors, such as autism spectrum disorder, remains uncertain. Here we show that an embryonic disturbance, known to induce social dysfunction in male mice, preferentially impaired the gene expression crucial for neural functions in parvocellular oxytocin (OT) neurons—a subtype linked to social rewards—while neighboring cell types experienced a lesser impact. Chemogenetic stimulation of OT neurons at the neonatal stage ameliorated social deficits in early adulthood, concurrent with cell-type-specific sustained recovery of pivotal gene expression within parvocellular OT neurons. Collectively, our data shed light on the transcriptomic selective vulnerability within the hypothalamic social behavioral center and provide a potential therapeutic target through specific neonatal neurostimulation. The specific cell types affected in neurodevelopmental disorders remain elusive. Here, authors show a selective weakness of certain hypothalamic neurons in a mouse model of social dysfunction and explore its potential therapeutic intervention."

 Carbon sinks in the tropical rainforests are restricting the global warming to attain unprecedented heights. However, deforestation and climate change is switching them to a net carbon source at some of the deforested patches. Using machine learning algorithm we predict that more than 50% of the tropical rainforests will undergo rapid “Savannisation”/transformation by the end of 21st century under high emission scenarios. Climate change projects ‘El Niño-like’ warming condition, which decreases precipitation in the rainforests and favors atmospheric dryness. In Central Amazonia vegetation degradation saturates the carbon sink and more than 25% of the rainforests will transform into a net carbon source due to increase in soil microbial respiration. This transition will accelerate if Eastern Pacific/Global temperature warms beyond 1.5◦K/2.3◦K (by 2050’s) and will undergo a steeper transit by ~2075 (2.45◦K/3.8◦K warming). This alteration will exacerbate global warming and has consequences for policies that are intended to stabilize Earth’s climate."

 Traditional forest inventory supplies essential data for forest monitoring and management, including tree species, but obtaining individual tree-level information is increasingly crucial. Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) with multispectral observation offers rich information for improved forest inventory mapping with reliable individual tree attributes. Although deep learning techniques have shown promise in tree species classification, they are not sufficiently explored for individual tree-level classification using low-density (less than 30 point/m2) Airborne Multispectral LiDAR (AML) data. This study therefore explores the feasibility of using a deep learning (DL) framework for processing low-density AML point clouds to enhance tree species classification in challenging forest environments. A point-based deep learning network with a dual-branch mechanism combined Cross-Branch Attention modules named Attribute-Aware Cross-Branch (AACB) Transformer is designed for AML data to better differentiate tree species from delineated individual trees. In addition, a channel merging approach is introduced, which is suited to prepare the training samples of deep learning networks and reduces the computational costs. This study was tested with an average 9 points/m2 AML point cloud for 6 tree species including Populus tremuloides, Larix laricina, Acer saccharum, Picea abies, Pinus resinosa, and Pinus strobus from a Canadian mixed forest. The overall accuracies achieved 83.1 %, 85.8 %, and 95.3 % at species, genus, and leaf-type levels, respectively. The comparison between the proposed method and other widely used tree species classification methods demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enhancing tree species classification accuracy. We discuss potentials and remaining challenges, and our findings allow to further improve tree species classification of low-density AML point clouds by DL technology."

 This study investigates the characteristics of tropical cyclones (TCs) that cause extreme hourly precipitation (EXHP) in Zhejiang, China, using datasets from 67 national stations (Con-ST) and 1551 surface stations (All-ST), spanning 1973–2020 and 2011–2020, respectively. Our analysis revealed notable variations in the EXHP caused by individual TCs. The top 10 % of TCs contributed 37.2–38 % of the total TC-induced EXHP amount, while the bottom 50 % only accounted for 5.8–22.7 %. Using sparse stations may overestimate the impact of TCs causing EXHP in the lower to middle rankings. Long-term trend analysis suggested a consistent increase in TC-induced EXHP despite a decreasing trend in the number of TCs affecting Zhejiang. High-value EXHP centers tended to be concentrated in mountainous areas within 0–50 km from the coastline, where Con-ST stations are sparse and can significantly underestimate EXHP. The maximum amount of EXHP per TC increased logarithmically with the number of observation stations. In Zhejiang, EXHP predominantly occurred northeast of the TC centers (50.4–61.7 %) and within 500 km from the TC center (69.5–81.5 %). High-frequency EXHP centers exhibited a clockwise rotation with increasing distance from the TC center–a pattern resembling a “spiral rainband.” A key area where most EXHP in Zhejiang occurred when TC centers remained within this area was identified. The TC intensity within the key area was a key factor influencing EXHP occurrence in Zhejiang, whereas the duration of TC center residence within the key area and the distance of its movement were crucial predictors of significant EXHP occurrence. The analysis of large-scale environmental fields revealed that high-EXHP TCs are characterized by strong upper-level divergence, intense upward motion, and an expanded subtropical high. The southeasterly steering airflow drives these TCs northwestward, prolonging their impact on Zhejiang and resulting in significant moisture accumulation and EXHP."
