This study investigated Fenton-like reactions in the presence of oxalate from pH 2 to 5. The rate constant for the reaction of FeC2O4 with H2O2 (Fenton-like) was derived as (3.2 ± 0.3) × 103 M–1 s–1. Thermochemical analysis indicated a significant increase in activation entropy (ΔS‡ = −6.0 ± 0.8 for Fenton-like versus −87 ± 9 J K–1 mol–1 for the Fenton in the absence of oxalate). We propose the formation of a monodentate [Fe(HC2O4)]+ complex with estimated log K = 1.3 ± 0.2 to account for the behavior of measured second-order rate constants at pH ≤ 3. The rate constant for the reaction between [Fe(HC2O4)]+ and H2O2 was estimated at (2.7 ± 0.8) × 103 M–1 s–1. The Fe(II) regeneration observed in the presence of phenolic compounds was found to be relevant only at lower initial oxalate concentrations, when oxalate complexes represented less than 1% of the total Fe(II). These findings demonstrate how oxalate modifies the Fenton-like mechanism, amplifying its role in the aqueous particle-phase chemistry."

The transmission variations across language-usage regions were observed during COVID-19, however the potential differences from languages on aerosol transmission are poorly understood. Here, fifty-one multilingual volunteers were recruited to speak same-semantic dialogues in three languages selected from eight different languages studied to investigate the emission characteristics of exhaled aerosol across languages. The findings revealed that the size of exhaled aerosol particles generated by speaking was predominantly concentrated below 1 μm. The emission loads of exhaled aerosols during speaking and the associated potential risk of aerosol transmission across languages showed notable discrepancies. Additionally, the individual physiological factors such as age, gender and body mass index (BMI) also jointly influenced the exhaled aerosols during speaking. The machine learning model of random forest regression further revealed that language differences had a considerably greater impact on size-resolved exhaled aerosol emission concentrations than gender, but not than BMI. Thus, different language usages can influence the emission concentrations of exhaled aerosol during speaking, thereby impacting the potential for aerosol transmission across languages. This linguistic-induced diversity of transmission potentials could have played a non-negligible role in the disparate global dissemination patterns observed in aerosol-transmitted pandemics including COVID-19."
10.1016/j.rse.2025.114871,True,Remote Sensing of Environment,该论文提出了一种新的热力学约束反演算法，用于估算亚像元火灾属性。该方法利用地球静止卫星的观测数据，通过半经验传热算法来解析每个火灾像元内的有效温度变化。该研究重点在于提高火灾面积和不同燃烧阶段（如阴燃和火焰燃烧）的估算精度，从而更准确地评估火灾排放的污染物，并理解火灾羽流的注入高度。这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它利用卫星观测来研究火灾对大气成分的影响，并为空气质量监测和大气成分分析提供更精确的火灾排放数据。,"['fire radiative power', 'FRP', 'fire temperature', 'combustion phases', 'smoldering', 'flaming', 'geostationary satellites', 'fire-emitted pollutants', 'plume injection height', 'remote sensing']",Chenchong Zhang;Yuan Wang;Jun Wang;Amber Soja;Emily Gargulinski;David Peterson;Olga Kalashnikova;Bin Zhao;Yafang Cheng;Fangjun Li;Rajan Chakrabarty,Thermodynamically constrained retrieval algorithm to estimate subpixel fire properties,"•Resolved the temperature variation function in each fire pixel through a heat transfer algorithm. •The retrieved fire radiative power is consistent with those from airborne measurements. •This method retrieves fire area and proportion of different combustion phases at subpixel level. •Smoldering accounts for over 50 % of the total active fire areas in the studied Williams Flats fire. 
 Satellite-based measurements have been widely used for estimating fire-emitted pollutants based on the parameters of either burned area or fire radiative power (FRP). Fire-related remote sensing additionally requires information on active fire areas and fire temperature at a subpixel scale, as well as the combustion phases (i.e., smoldering and flaming) to infer the plume injection height and to understand the mechanics of resulting atmospheric processes like pyro-convection. The FRP is as a key indicator of fire intensity that is frequently retrieved using infrared signals. The fire properties at a subpixel level, including the effective fire temperature and fire area, can be retrieved by the bi-spectral method. However, these approaches normally neglect the heat transport phenomena and subsequently fail to characterize the fire area that could be composed of different combustion phases (e.g. smoldering, flaming, or a combination of the two). Neglecting the phenomena of heat transfer leads to mis-estimation of the actual fire area and its associated emission profile for combustion products that are a function of the combustion phase. To address this challenge, this work presents a new approach to resolve the effective temperature variation inside each fire pixel using a semi-empirical heat-transfer algorithm. This algorithm utilizes radiance observations from geostationary satellites as inputs. With the aid of fine-spatial-resolution spaceborne and airborne observations, we evaluated and validated the fire retrieval performance on western US wildfires corresponding to the 2019 season. Our results show that FRP obtained through this heat-transfer method exhibits a stronger linear correlation with those retrieved from airborne measurements. Moreover, by analyzing the temperature variation curve obtained using this method, it is possible to further retrieve the fire area under different combustion conditions within the fire pixels."

10.1016/j.jag.2025.104658,False,International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,这篇论文主要关注使用全球导航卫星系统反射测量（GNSS-R）技术进行地球表面监测。它提出了一种自监督学习框架，利用延迟-多普勒图（DDMs）和辅助参数数据进行跨模态表征学习。该模型在海洋风速反演、地表土壤湿度估计和植被含水量预测等多个下游任务上进行了微调验证。虽然该技术属于遥感范畴，但其应用主要集中于地表参数的反演，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关联。,"['GNSS-R', 'Earth surface monitoring', 'remote sensing', 'soil moisture', 'vegetation water content', 'ocean wind speed']",Daixin Zhao;Konrad Heidler;Milad Asgarimehr;Conrad M. Albrecht;Jens Wickert;Xiao Xiang Zhu;Lichao Mou,Multimodal GNSS-R self-supervised learning as a generalist Earth surface monitor,"•A multimodal self-supervised model is proposed for GNSS-R Earth surface monitoring. •Cross-modal representation learning for GNSS-R delay-Doppler maps and auxiliary data. •Fine-tuning the pretrained model shows decent performance on various tasks. 
 The increasing frequency of climate extremes and natural disasters demands rapid and scalable Earth surface scans for effective action. Emerging as a novel remote sensing technique, spaceborne global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R) plays an increasingly vital role in monitoring Earth’s surface parameters. Recent studies leverage the growing volume of GNSS-R measurements with data-driven approaches to enhance retrieval products over both ocean and land. Yet, these models are typically trained using supervised learning, which requires extensive feature engineering and application-specific annotations. To address these limitations, we propose the first GNSS-R self-supervised learning framework as a generalist Earth surface monitor (GEM). Our model is pretrained on multimodal observables, i.e., delay-Doppler maps (DDMs) and auxiliary parametric data, to learn cross-modal representations from GNSS-R data. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we fine-tune the pretrained model on various downstream retrieval tasks, including ocean wind speed retrieval, surface soil moisture estimation, and vegetation water content prediction. The results demonstrate that our framework generalizes well across these tasks, providing a versatile solution for GNSS-R-based Earth surface monitoring and facilitating further exploration of novel use cases."

Gevaert;Mariana Belgiu,Optimizing crop type mapping for fairness,"•Introduces methods to address class and parcel size imbalances in crop type mapping. •Evaluates novel and established methods across diverse crop type mapping datasets. •Novel hybrid method outperforms others in resolving class imbalance. •Performance gap between small and large parcels persists despite mitigation strategies. 
 Ensuring fairness in machine learning applications is critical, yet it remains underexplored in crop type mapping. While the consequences of imbalanced classes for supervised classification tasks are known to the field of Earth Observation, assessing classification results for sub-groups of societally sensitive attributes, such as parcel size in crop mapping, have received little attention. To address this gap, we evaluate established class imbalance correction methods: Random Oversampling (RO), Weighted Cross Entropy (WCE), and Focal Loss (FL); and two novel approaches that target both class imbalance and the performance disparity between small and large parcels: Random Oversampling with Resampling (RO-R), and Double Objective Weighted Cross Entropy (DOWCE). RO-R increases the representation of smaller parcels by redistributing random samples, whereas DOWCE applies higher penalties to the misclassification of smaller parcels. Hybrid methods (RO-DOWCE and RO-FL) were also evaluated. To assess their generalizability under varying conditions, the methods were tested on ten diverse datasets subsampled from the BreizhCrops dataset, covering Brittany, France. Results showed that RO-DOWCE was the most effective method at addressing class imbalance across the datasets, though not significantly different from RO-R, RO, and RO-FL. Additionally, cost-sensitive methods were generally less efficient at addressing class imbalance than sample balancing and hybrid approaches. These findings illustrate how broader discussions on Responsible AI and fairness are relevant for Earth Observation applications such as crop type mapping. Furthermore, the strategies to increase fairness presented here can be applied to classification tasks outside the domain of crop mapping."

 A series of experiments was conducted to characterize a medium-sized 27-m3 smog chamber, KIST atmospheric processes simulation chamber (K-CAPS) in terms of the gas and particle wall losses, spectrum of light sources, and background reactivity and evaluate its suitability for simulating atmospheric reactions. Photo-oxidation experiments using a toluene and NOx mixture were then carried out to investigate the effects of the UV lamp type, UV intensity, and ammonium sulfate seeds on the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) and O3, and on the physicochemical properties of SOA including hygroscopicity. When UVA and UVB lamps were used together, formation of SOA and O3 was faster than that for UVA lamps alone. And higher UV intensity also resulted in faster formation of SOA and O3, but the increase in O3 with accumulated OH exposure and the increase in SOA with reacted toluene concentrations are consistent regardless of photolysis rate of NO2 implying that increment in UV intensity can be acceptable to shorten the experiment time for relatively long aging processes such as multiday reactions. More SOA and less O3 were formed when ammonium sulfate seeds were initially injected and average RH was relatively higher, compared to the dry experiment without seeds. These results must be useful to understand the physicochemical properties of SOA formed through photo-oxidation of anthropogenic VOCs in real-world atmospheric conditions."
