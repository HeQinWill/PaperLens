10.1088/1748-9326/ae137b,False,Environmental Research Letters,该论文主要关注的是利用遥感技术对全球地表水动态变化进行监测和分析，重点在于开发一种新的数据集和开放科学框架，用于提取和分析Sentinel-2卫星的动态世界（DW）土地覆盖产品，以生成高分辨率的地表水范围数据。论文侧重于地表水资源的管理和监测，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关联。,[],Arushi Khare;Bikas C Gupta;Adnan Rajib;Melanie Vanderhoof;Qiusheng Wu,Estimates of global surface water dynamics harnessing near real-time land cover observations and open science geospatial capabilities,"Spatio-temporal changes to our world’s surface water resources are escalating. Translating how these changes impact communities and ecosystems requires time-varying data of Global Surface Water Extents (GSWE). Traditionally, GSWE mapping has been limited to static estimates, with recent efforts focusing on annual averages, frequency and occurrence of long-term variations. Building upon these foundational capabilities, we harnessed remotely sensed Sentinel-2 based near real-time Dynamic World (DW) land cover products to produce the first-of-its-kind 10 m resolution GSWE dataset representing 2015–2023. Our dataset estimated 2.5 million km2 of permanent waters and 8 million km2 of seasonal waters worldwide. Comparing our Sentinel-2 based data to contemporary Landsat-based GSWE, we observed that our data mapped less water within the >50% probability of occurrence range, suggesting a lower presence of open permanent water especially in high latitudes, deviating from what we previously learnt from Landsat data. Statistical analysis compared to well-established observational products and widely used GSWE datasets across some of the world’s most ecologically significant regions, including Pantanal in South America and Haor in South Asia, supports the overall physical realism of our data in predicting global open surface water dynamics. Our key contribution is a prototype Open Science operational framework that extracts routinely available DW products, runs geospatial analytics, and creates actionable water information for educators, researchers, and stakeholders at any scale of practical interest. We present examples of this operational capability through instant mapping of flood in Spain and drought in Lake Urmia, Central Asia, frequent monitoring of river extent changes at the Ganges–Brahmaputra confluence, and above all, interoperability with other existing GSWE applications."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae1b7e,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究主要关注欧盟政策和气候变化对欧洲淡水和海洋营养物输送的影响，重点是氮和磷的含量。虽然气候变化是环境因素，但研究的核心在于水体营养物污染及其政策影响，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关联。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术的关联性较弱。,[],Bruna Grizzetti;Angel Udias;Olga Vigiak;Alberto Pistocchi;Alberto Aloe;Maria Bielza Diaz-Caneja;Berny Bisselink;Faycal Bouraoui;Alexander De Meij;Thomas Fellmann;Jordan Hristov;Diego Macias;Chiara Piroddi;Enrico Pisoni;Franz Weiss;Matteo Zampieri;Michela Zanni,Effects of EU policy and climate change on future delivery of nutrients to European freshwater and seas,"In Europe, excessive nutrient pollution in freshwater and marine ecosystems poses a significant threat to human uses of water resources and disrupts aquatic ecosystems, compromising essential ecosystem services. The effectiveness of existing EU policies aimed at mitigating nutrient pollution will be influenced by the combined impact of climate variability and change. It remains uncertain whether current policies will suffice to reduce nutrient pollution to levels compatible with good environmental conditions in freshwaters and coastal waters. This study quantifies nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes in European freshwater systems and their delivery to the sea, considering the effects of existing EU policies and climate change up to 2050. Using the GREEN model, we simulated total nitrogen and phosphorus loads from 1990 to 2021 and projected future changes until 2050 using climate projections from 11 regional climate models (EURO-CORDEX) under the RCP 4.5 scenario. Our results indicate that implementing current EU policies—Common Agricultural Policy, Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, FitFor55 package for climate neutrality—will reduce nutrient loads to European seas by 2050, with a 10% decrease in nitrogen and 8% decrease in phosphorus loads compared to 2020 values, albeit with significant uncertainty related to climate variability. Regional differences are also explored. Nutrient concentrations in the EU river network are expected to decrease slightly, as well as the potential risk for coastal eutrophication (ICEP index). However, further reductions of 10%–20% beyond existing policies may be necessary to achieve good conditions in large rivers. These reductions could come from improved agricultural practices, nature-based solutions and wetland restoration. Our study suggests that while current measures will lead to improvements by 2050, additional efforts will be required in some regions to achieve good environmental conditions, highlighting the need for integrated nutrient management to avoid imbalances between nitrogen and phosphorus in receiving waters."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae1f2b,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注城市绿化灌溉在缓解城市热岛效应中的作用，以及在节水策略下限制灌溉可能带来的热应力增加问题。它使用生态水文模型模拟了不同灌溉方案对城市温度和热舒适度的影响，探讨了节水和降温目标之间的权衡。虽然该研究与大气环境有关，但它侧重于城市微气候和水资源管理，而非大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['urban heat', 'irrigation', 'heat stress', 'water-saving', 'eco-hydrological modeling']",Cassady Swinbourne;Steven Kenway;Katherine R O’Brien;Pui Kwan Cheung,Trade-off between water-saving and cooling objectives: restricting irrigation increases the number of hot days,"Irrigating urban greenery can be an effective strategy to mitigate heat. However, as drought-heatwave combined events become more prevalent, cooling efforts may be compromised by water-saving strategies. This paper considers the heat implications of restricting irrigation and aims to further understanding of how water-saving and cooling objectives compete. Using ecohydrological modelling, validated for Melbourne, Australia, five irrigation scenarios were simulated over 10 years. To determine the level of heat stress under the five irrigation scenarios, the ecohydrological model, Urban Tethys-Chloris (UT&amp;C), simulated temperatures and thermal stress in a Melbourne street. Results predict that heat stress is reduced with increasing irrigation amount. Every 1.5 mm of additional irrigation each week (up to 28 mm wk−1) is predicted to reduce the number of heat stress days (where maximum Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) > 32 °C) at the study site by one per year, with irrigation most effective at cooling when air temperatures are the hottest. The number of days with a mean air temperature over 28 °C is predicted to increase by 15% and 20%, respectively, if irrigation is restricted or stopped entirely. Therefore, ensuring the maintenance of irrigation during hot periods may prevent deaths. Our results suggest that the amount of irrigation required to decrease the mean air temperature by 1 °C is approximately 7 mm d−1 for oceanic climates, consistent with predictions in previous studies. We also predict the effect of irrigation amount on the number of heat stress days (UTCI > 32 °C). This relationship is important in understanding and communicating the impacts of water restrictions on urban heat. Furthermore, innovative urban planning and design, including onsite alternative water sources for irrigation, may enable irrigation for cooling, without exascerbating water stress."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae20a7,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注亚马逊地区的天气灾害及其对当地社区的影响，包括灾害类型、频率、人员伤亡和经济损失等方面。虽然气候变化是导致这些灾害的潜在因素之一，但论文本身并没有直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术的关联性较弱。,[],Rayane Pacheco;Juan P Iñamagua-Uyaguari;Galia Selaya;Sabina C Ribeiro;Ane A C Alencar;Liliana M Dávalos,Weather disasters and their underreported transboundary impacts on Amazonian communities,"In the Amazon, climate and land use change are expected to intensify risks from weather disasters, posing major challenges to people and ecosystems. Yet, how weather disasters already affect the peoples of Amazonia remains understudied. To quantify regional impacts, we compiled and analyzed reports on weather disaster category, frequency, human, and economic impacts from 2013 to 2023 across five Amazonian countries. We counted 12 541 disaster reports, affecting up to >3 million Amazonians and >100 000 pieces of public infrastructure in a single year. There were disproportionate concentrations of landslides in the Amazon-Andes of Ecuador, and fires associated with agricultural management and sometimes land grabbing in the Orinoco-Amazon ecotone of Colombia and along the southern Arc of Deforestation of Bolivia and Brazil. We argue that weather disaster impacts in the Amazon are underreported because: (1) data from four Amazonian countries could not be obtained, (2) cross-country reporting was not standardized and (3) it varied such that virtually all heatwave and most drought data came from Brazil, despite published evidence that both disaster types are present throughout the region. Disaster impacts are already significant, underscoring the need for transboundary policies on land use, local adaptation strategies for communities and infrastructure, and coordinated regional efforts to share and update weather disaster management plans. Developing consistent, accessible, and interoperable datasets across the region is fundamental to building a comprehensive understanding of weather-related disasters in the Amazon and to informing effective public policies that strengthen prevention, response, and adaptation efforts. These findings and recommendations provide a basis for discussing regional climate hazards at CoP30 in Belém do Pará, Brazil, in November."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae21f9,True,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文探讨了组织机构（如大学和公司）的电力购买和航空旅行等活动对空气质量的影响。研究使用能源系统和航空排放模型来估算温室气体和空气污染前体的边际排放量，并使用大气化学传输模型来计算空气质量影响的货币价值。研究发现，这些组织机构的活动与空气质量损害相关，其价值与气候损害相当，甚至更高。研究强调，在制定可持续发展策略时，组织机构应同时考虑空气质量和气候影响。,"['air quality', 'air pollution precursors', 'atmospheric chemistry-transport model', 'emission models', 'marginal emissions']",Yuang Chen;Florian Allroggen;Sebastian D Eastham;Evan M Gibney;William C Clark;Noelle E Selin,Air quality impacts of electricity purchase and air travel by organizations,"Organizational climate actions often prioritize greenhouse gas reductions without considering other impacts such as improved air quality from reduced fossil fuel use. While air quality benefits of large-scale policies are well studied, those of organization-level activities are more uncertain. We quantify the impact of organizations’ fossil fuel use from electricity purchasing and air travel on climate and air quality using a system-level approach, with data from two universities and one corporation based in greater Boston. We use energy system and aviation emission models to estimate marginal emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollution precursors, and compare monetized air quality impacts calculated using an atmospheric chemistry-transport model with climate impacts from the same activities. Organizational activities were associated with air quality damages of $88 (54–123)/tCO2 (electricity purchase) and $265 (192–337)/tCO2 (air travel), compared to ∼$170–200/tCO2 in climate damages (2015 USD). Air quality impacts vary spatially, with renewable energy purchases and short-haul flight segments having proportionally more impacts in the US Northeast. Activities with the same CO2 emissions can have very different overall monetized benefits, suggesting organizations seeking broader sustainability impacts should consider air quality alongside direct climate impacts."

A large number of sub-3 nm particles and naturally charged ions were present in the Amazonia boundary layer, and they showed a clear diurnal variation. The research will contribute to a better understanding of atmospheric processes in the pristine environment. 
 The Amazon rainforest is a unique environment to investigate aerosol properties with limited impact from human activities, further providing a new perspective to look at the aerosol characteristics in regions heavily affected by anthropogenic emissions. Obtaining the size distributions of nucleation mode particles in the atmosphere is key to understanding aerosol formation, evolution and their impacts. Although routine and long-term aerosol measurements have been conducted in the Amazon region, information regarding sub-10 nm particles is still limited. In this study, we performed aerosol measurements from December 2022 to January 2023 on a 54 m high platform of the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO). Three advanced instruments namely the Nano Condensation Nuclei Counter (nCNC), the Neutral Cluster and Air Ion Spectrometer (NAIS), and the Nano-Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), were employed to measure the number size distributions of aerosol particles and naturally charged ions smaller than 40 nm. The results reveal that the median total number concentration of the measured particles with diameters ranging from 1.5–1000 nm was 969 cm−3. We found a large number of particles smaller than 3.5 nm, which accounted for up to 59 % of the measured total number concentration. There was a significant increase in the number concentration of sub-3 nm particles in January 2023 (median, 573 cm−3) compared to December 2022 (371 cm−3). The median number concentration of particles above 3.5 nm in December and January were 481 and 335 cm−3, respectively. No typical regional new particle formation events were observed throughout the measurement period. However, clear diurnal variations were observed for the sub-3 nm particles under pristine conditions, with the maximum concentration around noontime. Similar diurnal patterns were also observed for natural cluster ions (0.8–2 nm), with their concentration in January slightly higher than in December. Quantifying the properties of the aerosol particles in the Amazon rainforest helps to understand the processes governing the aerosol budget in the pristine atmosphere, and is essential for determining the impact of anthropogenic aerosols on climate."
10.5194/acp-25-17779-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文的标题和摘要明确表明其与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。论文利用便携式傅里叶变换光谱仪（FTIR）和TROPOMI卫星观测数据，研究了青藏高原城市西宁的温室气体和空气污染物的排放特征。研究测量了CO2、CH4和CO的浓度，并将地面观测数据与卫星数据和模型预测进行了比较，发现地面数据高于卫星/模型估计，表明当地排放较高。通过分析CO的差异和ΔXCO–ΔXCO2的相关性，强调了便携式FTIR在城市排放研究中的价值。此外，论文还利用简单的扩散模型和风向分配异常方法估算了CO的排放率，并结合地面观测数据估算了CO2的排放率。这些发现表明，结合地面和卫星观测可以更好地了解青藏高原地区的城市排放情况，尤其是在CO2测量覆盖稀疏的地区。,"['Greenhouse gases', 'Air pollutants', 'CO2', 'CH4', 'CO', 'Fourier transform spectrometer (FTIR)', 'TROPOMI', 'Satellite observations', 'Urban emissions', 'Emission rate', 'Atmospheric composition analysis', 'Air quality monitoring']",Qiansi Tu;Frank Hase;Ying Zhang;Jiaxin Fang;Yanwu Jiang;Xiaofan Li;Matthias Schneider;Zhuolin Yang;Xin Zhang;Zhengqiang Li,Emission characteristics of greenhouse gases and air pollutants in a Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau city using a portable Fourier transform spectrometer and TROPOMI observations,"Understanding greenhouse gas and air pollutant concentrations and emissions characteristics in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau cities remains limited. We present the first CO2, CH4 and CO abundances using a portal Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer in Xining. Ground-based data exceeded satellite/model estimates, indicating higher local emissions. Strong CO discrepancies and ∆XCO–∆XCO2 correlation under easterly winds highlight the value of portable FTIR for urban emission studies. 
 Despite the critical need to understand greenhouse gas and air pollutant concentrations and their emissions characteristics in urban and industrial areas, limited assessments have been conducted in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) cities. Herein, for the first time, we present CO2, CH4 and CO column abundances using a portal Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer (EM27/SUN) in Ganhe Industrial Park (36.546° N, 101.518° E, 2603 m a.s.l.), located in the suburbs of Xining, Qinghai Province, during May–June 2024. Ground-based measurements found to be higher than spaceborne measurements (TROPOMI and IASI) and model forecast (CAMS) across all investigated species, indicating higher local emissions. Notably, significant discrepancies in CO levels are observed, particularly under easterly wind conditions, which transport polluted airmasses from Xining city. To further quantify emissions, we applied a simple dispersion model to the EM27/SUN data and TROPOMI products, estimating an average CO emission rate of 12.3 ± 9.6 and 8.9 ± 7.5 kg s−1, respectively. A wind-assigned anomaly method further applied to the TROPOMI dataset yielded a CO emission rate of 8.5 kg s−1. Additionally, the ground-based observations of ΔXCO / ΔXCO2 ratio exhibits a strong correlation under easterly winds, which suggests an average CO2 emission rate of 550 kg s−1 from Xining city. These findings underscore the utility of portable FTIR spectrometers to enhance our understanding of urban emissions at QTP and demonstrate the potential of combining collaborative ground-based and spaced-based observations to estimate CO2 emissions, particularly in regions with sparse CO2 measurement coverage."

During the events, wavelengths and phases of the tide remain unchanged, but its amplitude strengthens. The variation of heating sources, dissipation, zonal wind latitude shear and gravity wave drag may contribute to the amplification of the tide amplitude. These features provide insight into the dynamical coupling of troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere and lower thermosphere. 
 The stratosphere Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) modulates the migrating diurnal tide (DW1) in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT). DW1 amplitudes are larger during QBO westerly (QBOW) than during easterly (QBOE) phases. Since QBO's discovery in 1953, two rare QBO disruption events occurred in 2016 and 2020. During these events, anomalous westerly winds propagate upward, disrupting normal downward propagation of easterly phase and producing a persistent westerly wind layer. In this study, global responses of DW1 amplitudes and phases in MLT to these QBO disruptions, as well as their underlying mechanisms are investigated, using SABER/TIMED observations, MERRA-2 reanalysis and SD-WACCM-X simulations. Similarity of the DW1 responses to these two events is that DW1 phases and wavelengths exhibit close results to QBOW, whereas amplitudes lie between QBOW and QBOE. DW1 amplitudes in equatorial MLT (maximum difference) vary by 20.5 % and −10.2 % relative to QBOE and QBOW in 2016 event, but by 6.0 % and −21.1 % in 2020 event. In 2016 event, water-vapor radiative and latent heating, jointly modulated by the event and ENSO, increase significantly relative to QBOE. Less dissipation and less tidal energy removal in stratosphere along with gravity-wave (GW) drag in mesosphere tend to enhance DW1 amplitudes. In contrast, in 2020 event, water-vapor heating exhibits a 5 % increase. The dissipation and tidal energy removal has adverse effect on DW1, while GW drag exerts a weaker influence. The enhancement of water vapor heating together with the weaker GW drag likely accounts for the weaker enhancement of DW1 during this event."
10.5194/acp-25-17761-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文通过大气测量估算了两种破坏臭氧层的氢氯氟烃气体（HCFC-123 和 HCFC-124）的排放量。研究发现，尽管国际法规禁止生产这些物质，但它们的排放量并未下降。这可能与它们在生产其他化学品时的使用方式有关。研究结果表明，一些被禁物质仍然通过化学品生产过程中的泄漏进入大气，这可能会减缓臭氧层的恢复。该研究使用了1993-2023年HCFC-123的全球排放量估算数据，以及1978-2023年HCFC-124的更新排放量数据。论文指出，HCFC-123和HCFC-124是生产HFC-125的中间体，而HFC-125是一种非消耗臭氧层的氢氟碳化合物，已在许多应用中取代了消耗臭氧层的物质。论文认为，全球HCFC-124排放量的增加可能完全是由于HFC-125生产过程中的泄漏造成的。此外，尽管蒙特利尔议定书禁止生产HCFC-123，但其全球排放量并未减少，这可能与HFC-125的生产有关。研究结果表明，由于氟化学品生产过程中的泄漏和不当销毁，一些消耗臭氧层物质的排放量正在增加。,"['HCFC-123', 'HCFC-124', 'HFC-125', 'Ozone-depleting substances', 'Atmospheric measurements', 'Emissions monitoring', 'Atmospheric composition']",Luke M.

Weiss,Impact of leakage during HFC-125 production on the increase in HCFC-123 and HCFC-124 emissions,"We used atmospheric measurements to estimate emissions of two hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) gases, called HCFC-123 and HCFC-124, that harm the ozone layer. Despite international regulation to stop their production, their emissions have not fallen. This may be linked to how they are used to make other chemicals. Our findings show that some banned substances are still reaching the atmosphere, likely through leaks during chemical production, which could slow the recovery of the ozone layer. 
 Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are ozone-depleting substances whose production and consumption have been phased out under the Montreal Protocol in non-Article 5 (mainly developed) countries and are currently being phased out in the rest of the world. Here, we focus on two HCFCs, HCFC-123 and HCFC-124, whose emissions are not decreasing globally in line with their phase-out. We present the first measurement-derived estimates of global HCFC-123 emissions (1993–2023) and updated HCFC-124 emissions for 1978–2023. Around 5 Gg yr−1 of HCFC-123 and 3 Gg yr−1 of HCFC-124 were emitted in 2023. Both HCFC-123 and HCFC-124 are intermediates in the production of HFC-125, a non-ozone-depleting hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) that has replaced ozone-depleting substances in many applications. We show that it is possible that the observed global increase in HCFC-124 emissions could be entirely due to leakage from the production of HFC-125, provided that its leakage rate is around 1 % by mass of HFC-125 production. Global emissions of HCFC-123 have not decreased despite its phase-out for production under the Montreal Protocol, and its use in HFC-125 production may be a contributing factor to this. Emissions of HCFC-124 from western Europe, the USA and East Asia have either fallen or not increased since 2015 and together cannot explain the entire increase in the derived global emissions of HCFC-124. These findings add to the growing evidence that emissions of some ozone-depleting substances are increasing due to leakage and improper destruction during fluorochemical production."
10.5194/acp-25-17701-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了在不同污染条件下，气象条件如何影响气溶胶与云之间的相互作用。论文使用WRF模型模拟了气溶胶对云和降水的影响，以及气象条件对气溶胶-云相互作用的敏感性。研究结果表明，气溶胶在潮湿环境中延长云的生命周期，在干燥环境中则缩短云的生命周期。气溶胶通常抑制降水，但在某些强烈的云过程中，可以通过促进云的垂直发展和增加高层云中的液滴数量来增强降水。该研究强调了气象因素对气溶胶-云相互作用的调节作用，特别是在冬季风背景下，气溶胶对云性质的影响受到上升气流和冷平流的调节，而大气湿度的变化则控制着气溶胶对云发展的定量影响。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术，但其研究的气溶胶、云和降水等要素都可以通过大气环境遥感技术进行观测和分析，因此与大气环境遥感技术具有较强的相关性。,"['aerosol-cloud interactions', 'pollution regimes', 'meteorological conditions', 'cloud lifetime', 'precipitation', 'atmospheric moisture', 'WRF model', 'spectral bin microphysics']",Jianqi Zhao;Xiaoyan Ma;Johannes Quaas;Tong Yang,How meteorological conditions influence aerosol-cloud interactions under different pollution regimes,"We use the chemistry version of the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with spectral bin microphysics to investigate how meteorological conditions impact aerosol–cloud interactions (ACI) under different pollution regimes. Our findings highlight the changes in aerosol effects on clouds and precipitation under varying thermodynamic conditions, as well as the sensitivity of ACI to meteorological conditions under different pollution regimes, which help to clarify the mechanisms behind the nonlinear variation of ACI with environmental conditions. 
 Aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI) involve complex physical and dynamical mechanisms, in which meteorological conditions play a crucial role. To investigate how the meteorological conditions impact ACI under different pollution regimes (polluted and clean) for marine liquid-phase clouds, the simulations are conducted using the chemistry version of Weather Research and Forecasting Model coupled with spectral-bin cloud microphysics. Our results indicate that, aerosols prolong cloud lifetime in humid environments. In dry conditions, they shorten cloud lifetime under low-to-moderate lower tropospheric stability (LTS) but further suppress the negative effects of entrainment in high-LTS environments with weak entrainment, ultimately extending cloud lifetime. Aerosols generally suppress precipitation but can enhance it during some intense cloud processes by promoting cloud vertical development in low-level clouds and increasing droplet amount in high-level clouds. The coordinated variations of cloud properties with meteorological conditions and aerosols reveal the regulatory role of meteorological factors on ACI. Specifically, under the winter monsoon background, the qualitative influence of aerosols on cloud properties is modulated by variations in updrafts and cold advection (characterized by LTS) driven by atmospheric circulation that co-varies with aerosol concentrations. Meanwhile, changes in atmospheric moisture govern the quantitative effects of aerosols on cloud development."

Using trajectory analysis, we linked atmospheric CH4 variabilities to air mass pathways transported over open water or sea-ice. The study highlights the potential of ship-borne observations to fill significant data gaps in the high Arctic. 
 The sparse network of Arctic land-based stations results in significant data gaps for atmospheric methane (CH4), particularly in sea-ice covered regions. Ship-based measurements can complement these data, improving understanding of regional and seasonal CH4 variability. This study presents continuous atmospheric ship-borne recordings of CH4 concentration and isotopic composition above the open ocean and sea-ice surface during Leg 4 (June–July 2020) and Leg 5 (August–September 2020) of the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition in the central Arctic. Our measurements aim to enhance process understanding by identifying local emission sources and refining transport pathway and atmospheric mixing analysis. We compared three contamination-filtering methods and applied the Pollution Detection Algorithm to the raw data. Comparison with nearby land-based stations and their seasonal cycles suggests ship-borne data capture dynamic changes in CH4 sources, sinks, and transport processes, beyond seasonality. To unravel the underlying processes, we identified air mass transport pathways within the atmospheric boundary layer above the Arctic Ocean and their source areas using five-day backward trajectories from the LAGRANTO tool, based on ERA5 wind field data. Our analysis reveals that CH4 variability is driven by air masses predominantly influenced by open ocean and sea-ice-covered regions, with sea-ice dynamics imparting specific modifications along transport pathways. These findings underscore the importance of air mass transport and origin in shaping central Arctic CH4 variability. The study highlights the value of integrating ship-borne CH4 measurements with trajectory analysis to improve process-level understanding and support enhanced regional modelling."

Further multiphase box model analysis revealed that the heterogeneous uptake of N2O5 is the most significant nitrate formation pathway in NO2-limited urban areas. Additionally, we further analyzed the reasons for this high N2O5 uptake contribution, and discussed the synergistic reduction of nitrates and O3. 
 Particulate nitrate (pNO3-) is a major component of fine particles in Chinese urban areas. However, the relative contributions of pNO3- formation pathways in urban areas remain poorly quantified, particularly under the NO2-limited regime that governs its formation (as defined by the NO2/O3 ratio), which hinders effective particulate pollution control. In this study, comprehensive winter field observations were conducted in urban Xiamen, Southeast China. We observed significantly elevated nighttime pNO3- levels concurrent with increased N2O5 concentrations. Quantification using an observation-constrained model revealed that N2O5 uptake contributed 51.2 % to total pNO3- formation, which was comparable to that of the OH+NO2 reaction. The N2O5 uptake was found to be mainly driven by nocturnal NO3 oxidation capacity (modulated by NO2 and O3 levels) rather than by heterogeneous reaction conditions. Sensitivity simulations further demonstrated that pNO3- formation rate was more sensitive to NOx variations than to VOCs variations. Implementing NOx control measures at nighttime was shown to effectively reduce pNO3- by abating N2O5 uptake while simultaneously preventing daytime O3 increase. Our findings enhance the understanding of pNO3- formation in NO2-limited urban areas and provide valuable insights for developing joint PM2.5 and O3 mitigation strategies."

Satellites rely on accurate spectral line parameters to interpret their data, which are obtained through fitting data from lab-based measurements. This work performs such experiments on the ammonia ν2 band, determining new line parameters which will provide a more accurate basis for modelling satellite measurements of ammonia. 
 Ammonia (NH3) is a toxic pollutant, generally linked to agricultural emissions, and plays a major role in the formation of fine aerosols which have a significant and detrimental effect on human health. NH3 is one of the most significant gases that can be monitored by satellite instruments orbiting the Earth, including the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) and the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS). The interpretation of these measured atmospheric spectra requires accurate radiative transfer modelling, which relies on the quality of the input spectroscopic line parameters.In this work we present new high quality high-resolution infrared spectra of self- and air-broadened NH3 at 296 K using a Bruker IFS 125HR spectrometer and a 24.45 cm pathlength sample cell with silver chloride windows. Using a multispectrum fitting approach, we then determine new spectroscopic line parameters over the range 685 to 1250 cm−1 for the NH3 0100 00 0 s ← 0000 00 0 a and 0100 00 0 a ← 0000 00 0 s transitions associated with the v2 mode; the Q branches of these transitions are the strongest NH3 features observed in atmospheric spectra. Our analysis utilises the Voigt lineshape, with speed-dependent Voigt and Rosenkranz line mixing for the strongest lines. To date this is the most complete experimental and multispectrum analysis of air-broadened NH3 over this spectral region. Our derived spectroscopic line parameters reproduce the new measurements substantially better than line parameters from the HITRAN 2020 database, which were derived from a mixture of ab initio calculations and previous laboratory measurements. We have revised values for parameters such as line intensities and air-broadened Lorentz halfwidths, in some cases by almost 10 %. We have substantially lowered the uncertainties of key parameters, such as line intensities. In addition to the measured speed dependence and Rosenkranz line mixing parameters, which we believe are the first reported for the v2 band of NH3 in air, we also determine a range of parameters for the v2 band that are not currently in HITRAN, for example self- and air-pressure-induced shifts. We expect these new parameters to provide a more accurate basis for incorporation into atmospheric radiative transfer models to measure NH3 concentrations from satellite."

First, a rice training dataset comprising 155 images was created. Then, we developed the annual result enhancement (ARE) method to diminish the impact of the limited training sample. In comparison to traditional rice mapping methods, the accuracy of results obtained using the ARE method is significantly improved. 
 Northeast China, a significant production base for paddy rice, has received lots of attention in crop mapping. However, understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of paddy rice expansion in this region remains limited, making it difficult to track the changes in paddy rice planting over time. For the first time, this study utilized multi-sensor Landsat data and a deep learning model, the full resolution network (FR-Net), to explore the annual mapping of paddy rice for Northeast China from 1985 to 2023 (available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27604839.v1, Zhang et al., 2024). First, a cross-sensor paddy training dataset comprising 155 Landsat images was created to map the paddy rice. Then, we developed the annual result enhancement (ARE) method, which considers the differences in category probability of FR-Net at different stages to diminish the impact of the limited training sample in large-scale and across-sensor paddy rice mapping. ARE integrates differences in category probability and confidence levels of the FR-Net across phenological stages, effectively reducing classification uncertainty. This approach could mitigate the impact of limited training sample on large-scale and across-sensor paddy rice mapping. The accuracy of the paddy rice dataset was evaluated using 107 954 ground truth samples. In comparison to traditional rice mapping methods, the results obtained using the ARE method showed a 5 % increase in the F1 score. The overall mapping result obtained from the FR-Net model and ARE methods achieved high average values of user accuracy (UA) of paddy, producer accuracy (PA) of paddy, overall accuracy (OA), F1 score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.93, 0.91, 0.91, 0.92, and 0.82, respectively. The study revealed that the area used for paddy rice cultivation in Northeast China increased from 1.11 × 104 to 6.45 × 104 km2 between 1985 to 2023. Between 1985 and 2023, there was an overall expansion of 5.34 × 104 km2 in the paddy rice cultivation area, with the highest growth (4.33 × 104 km2) occurring in Heilongjiang province. This study shows that long-history crop mapping could be achieved with deep learning, and the result of paddy rice will be beneficial for making timely adjustments to cultivation patterns and ensuring food security."

Existing tools lack integrated workflows. We developed UpsFrac, an open-source software that integrates fracture modeling and permeability upscaling. It handles complex fracture patterns and rock properties. The software enables uncertainty quantification, helping scientists make accurate and efficient predictions for groundwater protection and renewable energy development. 
 The efficient and accurate simulation of fluid flow and heat transport underground plays an important role in groundwater migration and geothermal resource prediction. Rock fractures are complex in geological settings, exhibiting multiple-scale properties with varied patterns under different geological conditions. Modelling and upscaling the permeability of fractured porous rocks are both important and sophisticated processes in numerical simulations. While existing tools like MRST offer upscaling capabilities, they often lack integrated workflows for automated uncertainty quantification and direct coupling between fractal-based DFM generation and flow-based upscaling within a single framework. In this study, we propose an integrated methodology for modelling and upscaling the permeability of fractured porous rocks and develop an open-source software, UpsFrac, to implement this approach. The software considers complex fracture geometries in discrete fracture models (DFM) that are created deterministically and stochastically. UpsFrac employs conforming grid-based DFM with explicit matrix-fracture coupling, ensuring higher accuracy for complex fracture networks. The software can characterize the complexity of fractured porous rocks, including power law (fractal) length distribution, correlations between fracture length and aperture, and the effects of rock matrix properties. The state-of-the-art upscaling method, the multiple-boundary fracture upscaling (MFU) method, is applied to calculate equivalent fracture permeability, which links the fine-scale discrete fracture model to the coarse-scale equivalent fracture model. The current implementation is 2D and MATLAB-based, built upon fracture modelling code ADFNE and reservoir simulation code MRST, which can easily run DFM ensembles for uncertainty analysis. The code is available in open repositories to encourage modelling and upscaling of complex fractured porous rocks, allowing users to develop their own routines within the current framework and benefiting a broader community."

Marciani;Miguel Castrillo;Gladys Utrera;Mario C. Acosta;Bruno P. Kinoshita;Francisco Doblas-Reyes,Evaluating the impact of task aggregation in workflows with shared resource environments: use case for the MONARCH application,"Earth System Model simulations are typically run on large, highly congested flagship computers using workflows. These workflows can consist of thousands of tasks. If these tasks are queued individually, the wait time can add up, resulting in a long response time. In this paper, we explore a technique for aggregating tasks into a single submission. We found that this simple technique reduced the time spent in the queue by up to 7 %. 
 High Performance Computing (HPC) is commonly employed to run high-impact Earth System Model (ESM) simulations, such as those for climate change. However, running workflows of ESM simulations on cutting-edge platforms can take a long time due to the congestion of the system and the lack of coordination between current HPC schedulers and workflow manager systems (WfMS). The Earth Sciences community has estimated the time in queue to be between 10 % to 20 % of the runtime in climate prediction experiments, the most time-consuming exercise. To address this issue, the developers of Autosubmit, a WfMS tailored for climate and air quality sciences, have developed wrappers to submit multiple subsequent workflow tasks – the indivisible unit of compute as defined by the workflow – in a single remote job, without altering any of the tasks. However, although wrappers are widely used in production for community models such as EC-Earth3, MONARCH, and Destination Earth simulations, to our knowledge, the benefits and potential drawbacks have never been rigorously evaluated. Later, the developers of Autosubmit noticed that the impact of using wrappers was related to the past utilization of the user and its group, which the popular scheduler Slurm uses to compute the priority of the queueing jobs. In Slurm's methodology, this past utilization is quantified in the fair share factor. The objective of this paper is to quantify the impact of wrapping subsequent tasks on queue time and understand its relationship with the fair share and the job's CPU and runtime request. To do this, we used a Slurm simulator to reproduce the behavior of the scheduler and, to recreate a representative usage of an HPC platform, we generated synthetic static workloads from data of the LUMI supercomputer and a dynamic workload from a past flagship HPC platform. As an example, we introduced jobs modeled after the MONARCH air quality application in these workloads, and we tracked their queue time. We found that, by simply joining tasks, the total time-to-solution of the simulation reduces up to 7 % with respect to the runtime of the simulations, and we believe that this value is larger the longer the workflow, since longer wrappers could be created and hence less jobs are submitted to the scheduler. This saving translates to absolute terms of about eight days less wasted in queue time for half of the simulations from the IS-ENES3 consortium of CMIP6 simulations. We also identified in the static experiments a high inverse correlation of −0.87, between the queue time and the fair share factor."

 There is great public concern about the potential use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) for political persuasion and the resulting impacts on elections and democracy1–6. We inform these concerns using pre-registered experiments to assess the ability of large language models to influence voter attitudes. In the context of the 2024 US presidential election, the 2025 Canadian federal election and the 2025 Polish presidential election, we assigned participants randomly to have a conversation with an AI model that advocated for one of the top two candidates. We observed significant treatment effects on candidate preference that are larger than typically observed from traditional video advertisements7–9. We also document large persuasion effects on Massachusetts residents’ support for a ballot measure legalizing psychedelics. Examining the persuasion strategies9 used by the models indicates that they persuade with relevant facts and evidence, rather than using sophisticated psychological persuasion techniques. Not all facts and evidence presented, however, were accurate; across all three countries, the AI models advocating for candidates on the political right made more inaccurate claims. Together, these findings highlight the potential for AI to influence voters and the important role it might play in future elections.

 Metabolic syndrome (MetS), a cluster of conditions including abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, and abnormal blood sugar and lipid levels, is a growing global health concern, yet its global burden remains poorly characterized. Here we show trends in MetS prevalence from 2000 to 2023, based on a systematic review and Bayesian modelling of 3236 data points with 45,549,151 adults. Between 2000 and 2023, prevalence rose from 14.7% (13.1–16.7) to 31.0% (28.5-33.9) among women, and from 9.0% (6.9–12.1) to 25.7% (21.5–31.1) among men. In 2023, an estimated 1.54 billion adults (1.35–1.76) had MetS globally: 846 million (776–924) women and 692 million (579–837) men. Prevalence increased with age, urbanicity, and income level, ranging from 7.5% to 45.0% among women and 6.5% to 59.6% among men across regions. Among both women and men, prevalence increased in 196 countries and territories. These findings call for targeted interventions to address the rising global burden.

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains highly lethal due to its aggressive nature and limited treatment options, with the efficacy of immunotherapy constrained by a uniquely immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, we identify TNK2/ACK1 as a key regulator of the immunosuppressive TME in PDAC. TNK2/ACK1 is significantly upregulated in PDAC, at least in part via gene amplification and KRAS-G12 mutations. Mechanistically, TNK2/ACK1 directly phosphorylates and activates STAT5A to induce the expression of the immune checkpoint HVEM, which suppresses CD8⁺ T-cell function via its receptor BTLA. Pharmacologic targeting of TNK2/ACK1 with AIM100 or (R)−9b enhances CD8⁺ T-cell activation and cytotoxicity while reprogramming the TME. Furthermore, combining TNK2/ACK1 inhibitors with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy or with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine demonstrates promising antitumor efficacy in both allograft and spontaneous PDAC models. Overall, our findings reveal a mechanism of immune evasion and provide a potential framework for developing tailored immunotherapeutic strategies in PDAC.

 Quasiparticles describe collective excitations in many-body systems, and their symmetry classification is of fundamental importance for physical processes such as excited states, transport phenomena, and phase transitions. Recent studies have introduced chirality as an additional degree of freedom in condensed matter physics, leading to a range of novel phenomena. Among these, chiral phonons are of special interest because they carry angular momentum and therefore intrinsically break time reversal symmetry, which non-trivially bridges the spin system with the lattice. Here, we directly prove the presence of chiral phonons in a prototypical polar LiNbO3 crystal. Our demonstration of chiral phonons in a ferroelectric enables in-situ electrical control of momentum-dependent “magnetic” polarization with the reversible phonon handedness. This ferroic control of phonon chirality has substantial potential in the emerging field of chiral phononics, particularly along the associated control of its phonon angular momentum.

Here, the authors develop a bone-targeted nanoparticle that selectively eliminates osteoclasts and generates pro-regenerative apoptotic bodies, restoring bone density and treating osteoporosis. 
 Osteoporosis therapies remain limited by non-specific osteoclast inhibition, which disrupts physiological bone remodeling and increases fracture risk. Here we show that selectively targeting mature osteoclasts via enzyme-responsive nanoparticles could eliminate pathological bone resorption while generating apoptotic bodies (ABs) to promote regeneration. We design OsteoSAVE, a peptide-based nanoparticle integrating a cathepsin K (CTSK)-cleavable linker, a bone-targeting motif, and a self-assembling biphenyl core. Upon CTSK-mediated hydrolysis, OsteoSAVE transforms into nanofibers within osteoclast lysosomes, inducing apoptosis and releasing ABs enriched with PDGF-BB. Mechanistic studies confirm CTSK-selective cleavage and charge-driven cellular specificity. In ovariectomized mice, OsteoSAVE restores bone density by coupling osteoclast elimination with ABs-mediated osteogenesis via PI3K/AKT activation in mesenchymal stem cells. This work establishes enzyme-triggered supramolecular self-assembly as a paradigm for dual-action therapies that recalibrate bone homeostasis without disrupting physiological processes.

 Connexin-32 (Cx32) gap junction channels (GJCs) mediate intercellular coupling in various tissues, including myelinating Schwann cells. Mutations in Cx32, such as W3S, are associated with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT1X) disease. Lipids regulate Cx32 GJC permeation, although the regulatory mechanism is unclear. Here, we determine the cryo-EM structures of Cx32 GJCs reconstituted in nanodiscs, revealing that phospholipids block the Cx32 GJC pore by binding to the site formed by N-terminal gating helices. The phospholipid-bound state is contingent on the presence of a sterol molecule in a hydrophobic pocket formed by the N-terminus: the N-terminal helix of Cx32 fails to sustain a phospholipid binding site in the absence of cholesterol hemisuccinate. The CMT1X-linked W3S mutant which has an impaired sterol binding site adopts a conformation of the N-terminus incompatible with phospholipid binding. Our results indicate that different lipid species control connexin channel gating directly by influencing the conformation of the N-terminal gating helix.

Subtype-specific patterns of activation dynamics are revealed that indicate underlying physical constraints on HA adaptation. 
 Increase in human H5N1 spillover infections resulting from dissemination of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus into bird and mammal populations raises concerns about HPAI gaining human transmissibility. Studies identified hemagglutinin (HA) acid stability and receptor preference as essential traits that shape host tropism. Mutations that increase HA stability and affinity for α−2,6-linked sialic acids have been shown to confer airborne transmissibility in a ferret model, however mechanisms of activation of H5 subtype HA are poorly understood and the effect of adaptive mutations on HA function has been largely inferred from static structures. Here, we use hydrogen/deuterium-exchange mass spectrometry to dissect activation dynamics for two ancestral H5 HPAI HA, their transmission-adapted HA, and a contemporary HA. We identify variation in receptor binding site flexibility and demonstrate that adaptive mutations result in suppression of fusion peptide dynamics and stabilization of a key interface involved in activation. The contemporary H5 isolated from a spillover event exhibits a relatively protected fusion peptide and moderately depressed activation pH compared to ancestral HAs. Our studies of activation dynamics in H5 together with analysis of H1 and H3 HAs reveal subtype-specific patterns that correlate with mutation sites and indicate underlying physical constraints on influenza HA adaptation.

Here, the authors report on the dynamic chemistry of hexahydrotriazine units to develop recyclable aerogels. 
 Organic aerogels have emerged as promising materials for advanced thermal insulation. However, their chemically robust covalent networks pose a major barrier for effective recycling. Introducing specific chemical bonds into the aerogel scaffold that enable on-demand reversibility offers a viable pathway to enhance recyclability and promote the sustainable use of these materials. In this work, we demonstrate that hexahydrotriazine (HT) units undergo nucleophilic attack by amines and engage in metathesis reactions, fundamentally redefining their reactive behaviors. Based on this, we introduce a waste-minimized, closed-loop chemical recycling process for highly porous, thermally superinsulating organic aerogels. These materials are partially depolymerized into soluble oligomers upon exposure to primary amines and can be reassembled into fresh polymer networks on demand. Additionally, by varying the amine feedstocks during depolymerization, we tailor key aerogel properties, such as thermal conductivity and flame resistance, beyond their initial synthesis. Under heat and pressure, HT bond exchange enables aerogels to transform into high-performance thermoset-like films, which can subsequently revert to aerogels. This breakthrough in HT chemistry sets a benchmark for atom-efficient recycling, reprogramming, and reprocessing of HT-based materials, providing a transformative foundation for a circular materials platform with broad impact. The sustainable use of organic aerogels is limited by their non-recyclability owing to the covalently-crosslinked networks that constitute their structures.

Here, the authors report an integrated electrochemical strategy for converting renewable fatty acids into liquid alkanes under mild and scalable conditions. 
 Upgrading fatty acid derivatives is a promising route to sustainable diesel and jet fuels, but conventional processes require high temperature, pressure, and large H₂ input, while contaminants in waste oil deactivate catalysts, demanding costly purification. Here, we present an integrated electrochemical strategy combining anodic decarboxylation, cathodic proton reduction, and olefin hydrogenation in one reactor, upgrading fatty acid derivatives to long-chain alkanes under mild conditions (60 °C, 1 atm) without external hydrogen. A high alkane yield of 88.9% is achieved and the reported performance is competitive. Experiments and calculations reveal that fatty acid chain length governs product yield and distribution by influencing –H departure and Cγ–Cβ–COOH bond cleavage barriers. This approach shows high activity and selectivity toward diverse feedstocks, including unsaturated fatty acids, esters, mixtures, crude acids, and waste oils. Powered by solar energy, approximately 40 g of long-chain alkanes are produced in a 1 L reactor, highlighting its scalability and potential for green fuel synthesis.

This research demonstrates such matching could minimize intertemporal welfare trade-offs and avoid various risks for permanent removal. 
 Unlike CO2, methane emissions have a particularly large short-term effect on temperature. We argue that these largely temporary temperature effects of methane emissions are apt to be offset by temporary CO2 removal. Temporally matching offsetting temperature reductions to the temperature impulse of methane eliminates the sizable intertemporal welfare transfers that occur when methane is offset by equivalent permanent CO2 removals. Assessing equivalence based on avoided economic damages suggests that about 87 temporary CO2 removals over a period of 30 years are needed to offset 1 t of methane. Agreement on the appropriate quantity of temporary CO2 offsets is insensitive to controversial parameters such as the social discount rate, climate damages and future emission scenarios. Short-term monitoring periods of 20–30 years are likely to be more credibly enforceable for various nature-based CO2 removal projects than long-term monitoring requirements. Methane emissions have a large short-term impact on temperature, which can be potentially offset by nature-based solutions that provide temporary carbon storage.

 Income inequality is one of the most important measures to indicate socioeconomic welfare and quality of life, and has implications for the environment. Yet, especially at the subnational level, comprehensive global data on income distribution are widely missing. Such data are essential for assessing patterns of inequality within countries and their development over time. Here we created seamless global subnational Gini coefficient and gross national income purchasing power parity per capita datasets for the period 1990–2023 and used these to assess the status and trends of income inequality and income, as well as their interplay. We show that while gross national income has increased for most people globally (94%), inequality has also increased for around 46–59% (depending on the national dataset used) of the global population, while it has decreased for 31–36% and has not shown a significant trend for 10–18%. We illustrate heterogeneities in inequality trends between and within countries, analyse plausible confounding factors related to inequality, and highlight the broad utility of the datasets through a case study that investigates correlations with terrestrial ecological diversity.
