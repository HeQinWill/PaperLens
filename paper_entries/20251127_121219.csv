10.5194/acp-25-16833-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要探讨了2000年至2018年期间北美和欧洲地表臭氧趋势和季节性变化的原因。通过使用全球大气模型和臭氧追踪技术，研究揭示了本地氮氧化物排放减少对夏季臭氧的积极影响被自然源和外来源排放增加所抵消。甲烷的影响也很重要，但随着本地排放的减少而有所下降。研究强调了区域排放趋势和远距离污染物传输对地表臭氧的影响，并强调需要协调一致的全球策略。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是空气质量监测和大气成分分析方面。,"['surface ozone', 'ozone precursor emissions', 'NOx', 'VOC', 'methane', 'global atmospheric model', 'long-range pollutant transport', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis']",Tabish Ansari;Aditya Nalam;Aurelia Lupaşcu;Carsten Hinz;Simon Grasse;Tim Butler,Explaining trends and changing seasonal  cycles of surface ozone in North America and  Europe over the 2000–2018 period: a global  modelling study with NOx and VOC tagging,"Surface ozone can travel far from its sources. In recent decades, emissions of ozone-forming gases have decreased in North America and Europe but risen in Asia, alongside rising global methane levels. Using advanced modeling, this study reveals that while local reductions in nitrogen oxides have lowered summer ozone, increases in ozone production from natural and foreign sources offset these gains. Methane remains important, but its ozone impact has declined with reduced local emissions. 
 Surface ozone, with its long enough lifetime, can travel far from its precursor emissions, affecting human health, vegetation, and ecosystems on an intercontinental scale. Recent decades have seen significant shifts in ozone precursor emissions: reductions in North America and Europe, increases in Asia, and a steady global rise in methane. Observations from North America and Europe show declining ozone trends, a flattened seasonal cycle, a shift in peak ozone from summer to spring, and increasing wintertime levels. To explain these changes, we use TOAST 1.0, a novel ozone tagging technique implemented in the global atmospheric model CAM4-Chem which attributes ozone to its precursor emissions fully by NOx or VOC+CO+CH4 sources and perform multi-decadal model simulations for 2000–2018.  Model-simulated maximum daily 8 h ozone (MDA8 O3) agrees well with rural observations from the TOAR-II database. Our analysis reveals that declining local NOx contributions to peak-season ozone (PSO) in North America and Europe are offset by rising contributions from natural NOx (due to increased O3 production), and foreign anthropogenic- and international shipping NOx due to increased emissions. Transported ozone dominates during spring. Methane is the largest VOC contributor to PSO, while natural NMVOCs become more important in summer. Contributions from anthropogenic NMVOCs remain smaller than those from anthropogenic NOx. Despite rising global methane levels, its contribution to PSO in North America and Europe has declined due to reductions in local NOx emissions. Our results highlight the evolving drivers of surface ozone and emphasize the need for coordinated global strategies that consider both regional emission trends and long-range pollutant transport."
10.5194/acp-25-16915-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该论文主要研究气候模型中双重热带辐合带（ITCZ）的偏差问题，探讨了不同分辨率下该偏差的持续性及其根本原因。研究发现，偏差源于副热带向热带内部的水汽输送不足，导致热带地区对流减弱和环流减弱。虽然调整近地面风速可以减少偏差，但会恶化全球环流。因此，论文强调了分辨率层级和参数化发展的重要性。该研究主要关注气候模拟和大气环流，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）的直接关联性不强。,"['climate models', 'precipitation bias', 'Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)', 'atmospheric circulation', 'moisture transport']",Clarissa A. Kroll;Robert C. Jnglin Wills;Luis Kornblueh;Ulrike Niemeier;Andrea Schneidereit,Parameterization adaption needed to unlock the benefits of increased resolution for the ITCZ in ICON,"The double Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone is a prominent precipitation bias in climate models. We demonstrate its persistence from a resolution of 160 km up to 5 km. Its root cause lies in biased moisture transport from the subtropics to the inner tropics reducing convection and weakening tropical circulation. Increasing the surface wind speed addresses the bias, but deteriorates the global circulation. This highlights the importance of resolution hierarchies and parametrization development. 
 The double Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (double-ITCZ) bias has been a persistent tropical precipitation bias over many climate model generations. This motivates investigations of whether increasing resolution and discarding parameterizations improves the representation of the large-scale atmospheric circulation and ITCZ. In this work, we study the double-ITCZ bias in an ICON XPP resolution hierarchy spanning from parameterized to explicitly described deep convection within a consistent framework. We demonstrate that the double ITCZ persists across horizontal resolutions from 160 to 5 km in specified sea-surface temperature simulations, independent of deep-convective and non-orographic gravity wave parameterizations. Changes in the treatment of near-surface wind speed within the turbulence parameterization can reduce the bias. However, we highlight that a key driver of the double-ITCZ bias seems to lie in the insufficient moisture transport from the subtropics to the inner tropics. The resulting dry bias in tropical near-surface moisture reduces deep convection over the Warm Pool, leading to a weakened Walker circulation. These biases ultimately culminate in the double-ITCZ feature. Increasing the near-surface wind speed limiter improves tropical near-surface moisture but exacerbates the bias in the moisture source, increasing the inner-tropical contribution at the expense of the subtropics. This degrades the representation of the global circulation, energy balance, and teleconnections. Additionally, we show that parameter adjustments at low resolution are informative of the response to the same parameter adjustments at high resolution. Our findings showcase the benefits of models supporting a range of resolutions and underline the importance of continuing the development of non-discardable parameterizations."
10.5194/acp-25-16895-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了北方森林环境中超微米气溶胶颗粒的光学特性。通过对芬兰Hyytiälä站SMEAR II站12年期间PM1-10颗粒的测量数据进行分析，研究揭示了这些颗粒的质量和光学性质的长期趋势、季节性变化以及突发事件（如花粉爆发和沙尘传输）的影响。研究还使用冲击式采样器滤膜量化了光学仪器无法检测到的超PM10颗粒。这些发现对于理解气溶胶-气候相互作用以及大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测和大气成分分析）具有重要意义，尤其是在粗模态气溶胶特征描述方面。,"['aerosol particles', 'optical properties', 'light scattering', 'boreal environment', 'PM1-10', 'PM10', 'air quality', 'atmospheric composition']",Sujai Banerji;Krista Luoma;Ilona Ylivinkka;Lauri Ahonen;Veli-Matti Kerminen;Tuukka Petäjä,Measurement report: Optical properties of supermicron aerosol particles in a boreal environment,"We studied supermicron aerosol particles (PM1–10) for 12 years at a Finnish boreal forest by subtracting PM1 from total measurements. This allowed us to examine their optical and mass properties, seasonal patterns and events like pollen and dust. We also measured particles >10 µm using filters, which are missed by optical instruments. These large particles significantly influence light scattering. 
 Supermicron aerosol particles (PM1–10; here defined as 1 µm < aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 µm) play a crucial role in aerosol-climate interactions by influencing light scattering and absorption. However, their long-term trends and episodic significance in boreal environments remain insufficiently understood. This study examines measurements of optical properties and mass of PM1–10 over a 12-year period at the SMEAR II station in Hyytiälä, Finland, focusing on their variability and key drivers. By assessing long-term trends, seasonality, and episodic variability, the study provides new insights into the role of these particles in aerosol-climate interactions. Episodic events, such as pollen outbreaks and dust transport, are identified as major contributors to PM1–10 variability and their role in atmospheric processes. In addition, cascade impactor filters were used to quantify super-PM10 particles (Dp>10 µm), which are not detected by optical instruments, addressing key detection limitations. The findings reveal significant long-term trends and pronounced seasonality in PM1–10 mass and optical properties, emphasizing their importance in boreal environments and their episodic relevance in coarse-mode aerosol characterization."
10.5194/acp-25-16877-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了在碳中和情景下，人为气溶胶和温室气体减少对北半球沙尘污染的影响。研究发现，相比高化石燃料情景，碳中和政策能减少沙尘排放。气溶胶的减少会促进沙尘，而温室气体的减少会降低风速，从而抑制沙尘排放。这项研究表明，碳中和策略不仅能减缓气候变化，还能通过抑制沙尘污染产生协同效益。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术，但它涉及大气成分（气溶胶、温室气体、沙尘）的分析，以及与空气质量相关的环境影响，这些都是大气环境遥感技术可以应用的领域，例如利用卫星观测气溶胶和沙尘的分布与浓度，从而评估碳中和政策的效果。,"['dust pollution', 'aerosols', 'greenhouse gases', 'atmospheric composition', 'air quality', 'climate mitigation', 'carbon neutrality', 'wind speed', 'radiative forcing']",Shicheng Yan;Yang Yang;Lili Ren;Hailong Wang;Pinya Wang;Lei Chen;Jianbin Jin;Hong Liao,Impacts of reductions in anthropogenic aerosols and greenhouse gases toward carbon neutrality on dust pollution over the Northern Hemisphere dust belt,"In this study, we assess the impact of carbon neutrality by 2060 on dust emissions in the Northern Hemisphere using the Community Earth System Model. Our findings show that reductions in greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols lead to decreased dust loading compared to high fossil fuel scenarios. While aerosol reductions promote dust, GHGs decreases reduce wind speeds, suppressing dust emissions. These results suggest that carbon-neutral policies mitigate climate change and reduce dust pollution. 
 To mitigate future global warming, many countries have implemented rigorous climate policies for carbon neutrality. Given some shared emission sources with greenhouse gases (GHGs), aerosol particles and their precursor emissions are expected to be reduced as the consequences of global efforts in climate mitigation and environmental improvement, potentially inducing complex climate feedbacks. However, a clear understanding of the individual effects of anthropogenic aerosols and GHGs on natural dust concentrations has not yet emerged, especially in the carbon neutral scenario. Here, we assess the large-scale impacts of reductions in anthropogenic GHGs and aerosol under a carbon neutral scenario in 2060 on natural dust emissions and concentrations over the low- to mid-latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere using the fully coupled Community Earth System Model. Our findings demonstrate a decline in atmospheric dust loading toward carbon neutrality (SSP1-1.9) relative to the high fossil fuel scenario (SSP5-8.5). Mechanistic analysis reveals counteracting modulation mechanisms: (i) reductions in aerosols amplify surface downwelling shortwave radiation, convection and wind speed, thereby promoting dust emissions by 6 %–12 % and concentrations by 4 %–20 % over North Africa, the Central Asia Desert and East Asia; (ii) GHGs reductions diminish the land-ocean thermal contrast and wind speed, suppressing dust emissions by 6 %–15 % and concentrations by 8 %–20 % mainly over the Central Asia Desert and North Africa. The latter drives the future dust responses. These results highlight that carbon neutral strategies not only achieve climate mitigation goals and air quality improvements, but also generate synergistic benefits through dust pollution suppression."

Advanced analyses showed that sunlight makes this material more oxidized, nitrogen-enriched, chemically transformed, and different in light absorption and volatility. These sunlight-driven changes influence the particles’ behavior in the air, affecting air quality, climate, and how long they remain suspended in the atmosphere. 
 Photochemical reactions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in atmospheric waters can alter the composition and properties of organic aerosols (OA), with implications for climate and air quality. In this study, we investigated the aqueous-phase transformation of fog DOM under simulated sunlight using online aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS), offline Orbitrap mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization, UV-vis spectroscopy, and aerosol volatility measurements. Irradiation increased the mass concentration of DOM-derived OA (DOMOA), defined as the low-volatility fraction of DOM that forms OA upon water evaporation. This increase was primarily driven by functionalization reactions that added oxygen- and nitrogen-containing groups, as indicated by a stable C mass, rising oxygen-to-carbon (O / C) and nitrogen-to-carbon (N / C) ratios, and enhanced signals of heteroatom-containing compounds over the course of irradiation. Despite evidence of fragmentation, spectral features associated with oligomerization, such as phenolic dimers, were also observed. To characterize chemical aging of fog DOM, we applied positive matrix factorization to the AMS spectra and identified three distinct factors representing progressive stages of aqueous-phase aging: initial DOMOA, more oxidized intermediates, and highly oxidized products, characterized by progressively increasing O / C and N / C ratios. These findings demonstrate that sunlight-induced aqueous-phase oxidation and functionalization of fog DOM drive the formation and aging of secondary OA, altering its composition, volatility, and light-absorbing properties with potential atmospheric consequences."

Richardson,Tracking vegetation phenology across diverse biomes using Version 3.0 of the PhenoCam Dataset,"Here, we describe the PhenoCam V3.0 public data release, which characterizes vegetation phenology in ecosystems across the US and globally using repeat digital photography. This V3.0 release includes new data records (a camera-derived normalized difference vegetation index and simplified data sets) and provides >4800 site years of phenological time series and transition dates, a 170 % increase relative to the previous release (V2.0). Over 450 of the time series are 5 years or longer in length. 
 Vegetation phenology plays a significant role in driving seasonal patterns in land-atmosphere interactions and ecosystem productivity, and is a key factor to consider when modeling or investigating ecological and land-surface dynamics. To integrate phenology in ecological research ultimately requires the application of carefully curated and quality controlled phenological datasets that span multiple years and include a wide range of different ecosystems and plant functional types. By using digital cameras to record images of plant canopies every 30 min, pixel-level information from the visible red-green-blue color channels can be quantified to evaluate canopy greenness (defined as the green chromatic coordinate, GCC), and how it varies in space and time. These phenological cameras (i.e., “PhenoCams”) offer a pragmatic and effective way to measure and provide phenology data for both research and education. Here, in this dataset descriptor, we present the PhenoCam dataset version 3 (V3.0), providing significant updates relative to prior releases. PhenoCam V3.0 includes 738 unique sites and a total of 4805.5 site years, a 170 % increase relative to PhenoCam V2.0 (1783 site years), with notable expansion of network coverage for evergreen broadleaf forests, understory vegetation, grasslands, wetlands, and agricultural systems. Furthermore, in this updated release, we now include a PhenoCam-based estimate of the normalized difference vegetation index (cameraNDVI), calculated from back-to-back visible and visible+near-infrared images acquired from approximately 75 % of cameras in the network, which utilize a sliding infrared cut filter. Both GCC and cameraNDVI showed similar, but somewhat unique, patterns in canopy greenness and VIS vs. NIR reflectance, across various ecosystems, indicating their consistent ability to record phenological variability. However, we did find that at most sites, GCC time series had less variability and fewer outliers, representing a smoother signal of canopy greenness and phenology. Overall, PhenoCam greenness as measured by both GCC and cameraNDVI provides expanded opportunities for studying phenology and tracking ecological changes, with potential applications to the evaluation of satellite data products, earth system and ecosystem modeling, and understanding phenologically mediated ecosystem processes.

 This data paper presents an overview of the cloud spectrometers deployed during the Pallas Cloud Experiment (PaCE) in autumn 2022, a coordinated measurement campaign in the Finnish subarctic that took place between 12 September  and 15 December 2022. Four cloud spectrometers – the Cloud and Aerosol Spectrometer (CAS); the Forward Scattering Spectrometer Probe (FSSP-100); the Cloud Droplet Analyzer (CDA); and ICEMET – were operated as ground-based setups, providing high-resolution in-cloud measurements of droplet size distributions and key microphysical properties, such as number concentration (Nc), liquid water content (LWC), median volume diameter (MVD), and effective diameter (ED).

The dataset applies multiple definitions in parallel, varying baselines, thresholds, detrending, and event durations. It enables consistent comparisons of marine heatwave characterisation across methods and supports climate monitoring, model evaluation, and ecological impact studies. 
 Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are prolonged anomalies of warm sea surface temperature (SST) that can disrupt marine ecosystems, physical climate processes, and human coastal activities. MHW definitions vary due to different stakeholders requirements, such as ecological scientists and climate scientists having differing yet specific thresholds and metrics. Here we introduce a new global dataset of daily MHW metrics: climatological baselines, threshold exceedances, SST anomalies, and categorical event classifications of severity, derived from the European Space Agency SST Climate Change Initiative (ESA SST CCI) climate data record (CDR; 1982–2021) version 3.0 and an extension from 2022–2024 provided as an interim climate data record (iCDR). Building on the widely used definition of MHWs, periods in which SST exceeds the local 90th percentile for 5 or more days, our dataset extends this framework by incorporating multiple baseline climatologies (including fixed 30-year periods and rolling 30-year windows, as well as the period for reanalysis 1993–2016), varied percentile thresholds (90th, 95th, 99th), and both raw and linearly detrended SST anomalies. We also implement alternative event duration criteria (minimum 10-day and 30-day persistence) to classify longer-lasting warm events. All data products are provided at daily resolution on a 0.05° (~5 km) grid, with outputs including daily climatological percentiles, SST anomalies and binary MHW flags with severity category indices. This comprehensive dataset provides a consistent foundation for detecting and analysing MHWs across time and space, enabling researchers to assess how methodological choices affect MHW characterisation. By offering multiple definitions in parallel, the dataset facilitates intercomparison studies and supports applications from climate monitoring and model evaluation to marine ecological impact assessment, thereby providing users with pre-made indices for extremes."

Major updates include improving dust size distribution in the chemical boundary conditions, updating land surface properties using recent available satellite data and enhancing the representation of soil NOx emissions. We demonstrate subsequent model improvements over several of the MAIA target areas. 
 The Multi-Angle Imager for Aerosols (MAIA) satellite mission, to be jointly implemented by NASA and the Italian Space Agency, aims to study how different types of particulate matter (PM) pollution affect human health. The investigation will primarily focus on a discrete set of globally distributed Primary Target Areas (PTAs) containing major metropolitan cities, and will integrate satellite observations, ground observations, and chemical transport model (CTM) outputs (meteorology variables and PM concentrations) to generate maps of near-surface total and speciated PM within the PTAs. In addition, the MAIA investigation will provide satellite measurements of aerosols over a set of Secondary Target Areas (STAs), which are useful for studying air quality more broadly. For the CTM, we have developed a Unified Inputs (of initial and boundary conditions) for WRF-Chem (UI-WRF-Chem) modeling framework to support the MAIA satellite mission, building upon the standard WRF-Chem model. The framework includes newly developed modules and major enhancements that aim to improve model simulated meteorology variables, total and speciated PM concentrations as well as AOD. These developments include: (1) application of NASA GEOS FP and MERRA-2 data to provide both meteorological and chemical initial and boundary conditions for performing WRF-Chem simulations at a fine spatial resolution for both forecast and reanalysis modes; (2) application of GLDAS and NLDAS data to constrain surface soil properties such as soil moisture; (3) application of recent available MODIS land data to improve land surface properties such as land cover type; (4) development of a new soil NOx emission scheme – the Berkeley Dalhousie Iowa Soil NO Parameterization (BDISNP); (5) development of a stand-alone emission preprocessor that ingests both global and regional anthropogenic emission inventories as well as fire emissions.Here, we illustrate the model improvements enabled by these developments over four target areas: Beijing in China, CHN-Beijing (STA); Rome in Italy, ITA-Rome (PTA); Los Angeles in the U.S., USA-LosAngeles (PTA), and Atlanta in the U.S., USA-Atlanta (PTA). UI-WRF-Chem is configured as 2 nested domains using an outer domain (D1) and inner domain (D2) with 12 and 4 km spatial resolution, respectively. For each target area, we first run a suite of simulations to test the model sensitivity to different physics schemes and then select the optimal combination based on evaluation of model simulated meteorology with ground observations. For the inner domain (D2), we have chosen to turn off the traditional Grell 3D ensemble (G3D) cumulus scheme. We conducted a case study over USA-Atlanta for June 2022 to demonstrate the impacts of the cumulus scheme on precipitation and subsequent total and speciated PM2.5 concentrations. Our results show that keeping the G3D cumulus scheme turned on results in higher precipitation and lower total and speciated PM2.5 than the simulation with the G3D cumulus scheme turned off. Compared with surface observations of precipitation and PM2.5 concentration, the simulation with the G3D scheme off shows better performance. We focus on two dust intrusion events over CHN-Beijing and ITA-Rome, which occurred in March 2018 and June 2023, respectively. We carried out a suite of sensitivity simulations using UI-WRF-Chem by excluding chemical boundary conditions or including MERRA-2 chemical boundary conditions. Our results show that using MERRA-2 data to provide chemical boundary conditions can help improve model simulation of surface PM concentrations and AOD. Some of the target areas have also experienced significant changes in land cover and land use over the past decade. Our case study over CHN-Beijing in July 2018 investigates the impacts of improved land surface properties with recent available MODIS land data on capturing the urban heat island phenomenon. Model-simulated surface skin temperature shows better agreement with MODIS observed land surface temperature. The updated soil NOx emission scheme in July 2018 also leads to higher NO2 vertical column density (VCD) in rural areas within the CHN-Beijing target area, which matches better with TROPOMI observed NO2 VCD.

Cminor is an advanced, open-source solver to model either combustion chemistry, or atmospheric chemistry and its direct influence on condensation of cloud droplets and the subsequent processing of aerosol. It uses the superdroplet idea, making it particularly feasible for coupling with such models, which is part of future work. 
 We present version 1.0 of the Chemical Mechanism Integrator (Cminor), a fully modularized modern Fortran software package for the computational simulation of skeletal and detailed chemical kinetic systems derived from atmospheric and combustion chemistry. Cminor aims for the efficient simulation of complex chemical mechanisms by using various mathematical techniques. These are tailored to systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), having the specific structure arising from chemical reaction systems. Additionally, a high-speed mechanism parser allows the user to interchange reactions or their parameters in an ASCII format text file and immediately start a new simulation without recompiling, enabling fast and numerous simulations. Cminor's solver technique is based on Rosenbrock methods. Different measures of local errors and an analytical Jacobian matrix approach are implemented, where efficiency is obtained by exploiting the sparsity structure of the Jacobian.Cminor can be run in one of three configurations: 
A box-model framework for either pure gas-phase mechanisms or a multi-modal aerosol distribution dissolved in mono-dispersed cloud droplets.
A rising adiabatic parcel, in which the activation of multi-modal aerosols is represented by solving the droplet condensation equation.
A constant volume environment, where thermodynamic properties are evaluated by polynomial functions of temperature according to the standards of the Chemkin thermodynamic data base.The software package is evaluated by applying seven different chemical mechanisms. Three of them are from the field of air-quality modeling and three are from the area of combustion kinetics, ranging from 7 species and 10 reactions to 10 196 species and 23 098 reactions. The last mechanism describes sulfur accumulation in clouds, which is tested along with a rising parcel and condensating cloud droplets."

 NAND flash memory is essential in modern storage technology, amid growing demands for low-power operation fuelled by data-centric computing and artificial intelligence1,2. Its unique ‘string’ architecture3, where multiple cells are connected in series, requires high-voltage pass operation that causes a large amount of undesired power consumption4. Lowering the pass voltage, however, poses a challenge: it leads to an associated reduction in the memory window, restricting the multi-level operation capability. Here, with a gate stack composed of zirconium-doped hafnia and an oxide semiconductor channel, we report ultralow-power ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs) that resolve this dilemma. Our FeFETs secure up to 5-bit per cell multi-level capability, which is on par with or even exceeds current NAND technology, while showing nearly zero pass voltage, saving up to 96% power in string-level operations over conventional counterparts. Three-dimensional integration of FeFET stacks into vertical structures with a 25-nm short channel preserves robust electrical properties and highlights low-pass-voltage string operation in scaled dimensions. Our work paves the way for next-generation storage memory with enhanced capacity, power efficiency and reliability. Ultralow-power ferroelectric field-effect transistors are used to achieve low-power NAND flash memory, overcoming the trade-off between multi-level capability and power efficiency and paving the way for next-generation storage memory."

 Cognition is highly flexible—we perform many different tasks1 and continually adapt our behaviour to changing demands2,3. Artificial neural networks trained to perform multiple tasks will reuse representations4 and computational components5 across tasks. By composing tasks from these subcomponents, an agent can flexibly switch between tasks and rapidly learn new tasks6,7. Yet, whether such compositionality is found in the brain is unclear. Here we show the same subspaces of neural activity represent task-relevant information across multiple tasks, with each task flexibly engaging these subspaces in a task-specific manner. We trained monkeys to switch between three compositionally related tasks. In neural recordings, we found that task-relevant information about stimulus features and motor actions were represented in subspaces of neural activity that were shared across tasks. When monkeys performed a task, neural representations in the relevant shared sensory subspace were transformed to the relevant shared motor subspace. Monkeys adapted to changes in the task by iteratively updating their internal belief about the current task and then, based on this belief, flexibly engaging the shared sensory and motor subspaces relevant to the task. In summary, our findings suggest that the brain can flexibly perform multiple tasks by compositionally combining task-relevant neural representations.

 Mechanical transmission is essential in force-related activities ranging from the daily tying of shoe laces1 to sophisticated surgical2 and robotic operations3,4. Modern machines and robots typically use complex electronic devices designed to sense and limit force5, some of which still face challenges when operating space is limited (for example, in minimally invasive surgeries)6 or when resources are scarce (for example, operations in remote areas without electricity). Here we describe an alternative slipknot-based mechanical transmission mechanism to control the intelligent operation of both human and robotic systems. Through topological design, slipknot tying and release can encode and deliver force with a consistency of 95.4% in repeating operations, which circumvents the need for additional sensors and controllers. When applied to surgical repair, this mechanism helped inexperienced surgeons to improve their knotting-force precision by 121%, enabling them to perform surgical knots as good as those of experienced surgeons. Moreover, blood supply and tissue healing after surgery were improved. The mechano-intelligence exhibited in slipknots may inspire investigations of knotted structures across multiple length scales. This slipknot-gauged mechanical transmission strategy can be widely deployed, opening up opportunities for resource-limited healthcare, science education and field exploration.

 Our sensory systems work together to generate a cohesive experience of the world around us. Watching others being touched activates brain areas representing our own sense of touch: the visual system recruits touch-related computations to simulate bodily consequences of visual inputs1. One long-standing question is how the brain implements this interface between visual and somatosensory representations2. Here, to address this question, we developed a model to simultaneously map somatosensory body part tuning and visual field tuning throughout the brain. Applying our model to ongoing co-activations during rest resulted in detailed maps of body-part tuning in the brain’s endogenous somatotopic network. During video watching, somatotopic tuning explains responses throughout the entire dorsolateral visual system, revealing an array of somatotopic body maps that tile the cortical surface. The body-position tuning of these maps aligns with visual tuning, predicting both preferences for visual field locations and visual-category preferences for body parts. These results reveal a mode of brain organization in which aligned visual–somatosensory topographic maps connect visual and bodily reference frames. This cross-modal interface is ideally situated to translate raw sensory impressions into more abstract formats that are useful for action, social cognition and semantic processing3.

 Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centres in diamond are widely deployed as local magnetic sensors, using single-qubit control to measure both time-averaged fields and noise with nanoscale spatial resolution1. Moving beyond single qubits to multi-qubit control enables new sensing modalities such as measuring nonlocal spatiotemporal correlators2 or using entangled states to enhance measurement sensitivity3. Here we describe protocols for using optically unresolved NV centre pairs and nuclear spins as multi-qubit sensors for measuring correlated noise at nanometre length scales. For noninteracting NV centres, we implement a phase-cycling protocol that disambiguates magnetic correlations from variance fluctuations, leveraging the presence of a third qubit, a 13C nucleus, to effect coherent single-NV spin flips and enable phase cycling even for co-aligned NV centres that are spectrally unresolved. For length scales around 10 nm, we create maximally entangled Bell states through dipole–dipole coupling between two NV centres and use these entangled states to directly read out the magnetic field correlation, rather than reconstructing it from independent measurements of unentangled NV centres. Importantly, this changes the scaling of sensitivity with readout noise from quadratic to linear. For conventional off-resonant readout of the NV centre spin state (for which the readout noise is roughly 30 times the quantum projection limit), this results in more than an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity. Finally, we demonstrate methods for detecting high spatial- and temporal-resolution correlators with pairs of strongly interacting NV centres. Controlling pairs of nitrogen vacancy centres enables the measurement of magnetic correlations below the optical diffraction limit, and the use of entangled pairs shows a linear scaling of the measurement sensitivity with readout noise, as opposed to the quadratic scaling that would be obtained with unentangled spins."

 Soil stresses affect crop yields and present global agricultural challenges1. Soil compaction triggers reduction in root length and radial expansion driven by the plant hormone ethylene2. Here we report how ethylene controls cell wall biosynthesis to promote root radial expansion. We demonstrate how soil compaction stress, via ethylene, upregulates Auxin Response Factor1 in the root cortex, which represses cellulose synthase (CESA) genes. CESA repression drives radial expansion of root cortical cells by modifying the thickness of their cell walls, which results in a thicker epidermis and thinner cortex. Our research links ethylene signalling with root cell wall remodelling, and reveals how dynamic regulation of cellulose synthesis controls root growth in compacted soil.

 Upon viral infection, the current paradigm of humoral immunity posits that germinal centre reactions occurring within secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) yield effector plasma cells that subsequently traffic to infected organs or the bone marrow1–3. However, it is not well understood how viral tissue tropism may govern the spatiotemporal dynamics of such responses. Here we demonstrate that infection with a prototypical systemic virus indeed induces liver-trafficking plasma cells generated in SLOs, whereas strictly hepatotropic hepaciviral infection elicits locally primed, virus-specific plasma cells in the liver independently of SLO contribution. Such locally derived progenies emerged from inducible hepatic-associated lymphoid tissue (iHALT) structures containing generative foci of T follicular helper cells, myeloid cells and germinal centre-like B cells, often arising from single founder clones unique to individual periportal structures and locally supporting somatic hypermutation. Critically, the cellular composition, cell–cell contact partners and microarchitecture of such iHALT structures in mice were closely mirrored upon hepaciviral infection in humans. Functionally dependent upon CD40L signalling and cognate B cell receptor specificity, emerging CXCR4+VLA-4+LFA-1+CD44+CD138+ plasma cells were immediately retained along CXCL12+fibronectin+ICAM2+osteopontin+type I collagen+ periportal fibroblast tracts, acting as cognate anchoring pairs that were critical to their maintenance therein. In summary, we characterize humoral immunity exclusively generated and maintained within its extralymphoid site of viral infection in the liver amidst SLO dormancy, in which functional iHALT successfully compensates for strictly hepatotropic virus-induced SLO-evasion strategies to prevent persistent infection. Liver-restricted viral infection in mice results in secondary lymphoid organ dormancy and the compensatory induction of specialized lymphoid tissue in the liver, the structural features and functional outputs of which are closely mirrored in humans."

 Stem-like progenitors are self-renewing cytotoxic T cells that expand as effector cells during successful checkpoint immunotherapy1,2. Emerging evidence suggests that tumour-draining lymph nodes support the continuous generation of these stem-like cells that replenish tumour sites and are a key source of expanded effector populations3–6, underlining the importance of understanding what factors promote and maintain activated T cells in the stem-like state. Here, using advanced three-dimensional multiplex immunofluorescence imaging, we identify antigen-presentation niches in tumour-draining lymph nodes that support the expansion, maintenance and affinity evolution of TCF-1+PD-1+SLAMF6high stem-like CD8+ T cells. Contrary to the prevailing view that persistent T cell receptor (TCR) signalling drives terminal effector differentiation, prolonged antigen engagement days beyond initial priming sustains the proliferation and self-renewal of these stem-like T cells in vivo. The inhibitory PD-1 pathway has a central role in this process through fine-tuning the TCR signal input that enables the selective expansion of high-affinity TCR stem-like clones as a renewable source of effector cells. PD-1 blockade disrupts this tuning, leading to terminal differentiation or death of the most avid anti-tumour stem-like cells. Our results therefore reveal a relationship between TCR ligand affinity recognition, a key negative-feedback regulatory loop and T cell stemness programming. Furthermore, these findings raise questions about whether anti-PD-1 blockade during cancer immunotherapy provides a short-term anti-tumour effect at the cost of diminishing efficacy due to progressive loss of these critical high-affinity precursors. PD-1 blockade interferes with the selective expansion and maintenance of high-affinity TCR stem-like clones that have a critical role in effective checkpoint blockade therapy."

 Targeted protein degradation is a pharmacological strategy that relies on small molecules such as proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) or molecular glues, which induce proximity between a target protein and an E3 ubiquitin ligase to prompt target ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation1. Sporadic reports indicated that ligands designed to inhibit a target can also induce its destabilization2–4. Among others, this has repeatedly been observed for kinase inhibitors5–7. However, we lack an understanding of the frequency, generalizability and mechanistic underpinnings of these phenomena. Here, to address this knowledge gap, we generated dynamic abundance profiles of 98 kinases after cellular perturbations with 1,570 kinase inhibitors, revealing 160 selective instances of inhibitor-induced kinase destabilization. Kinases prone to degradation are frequently annotated as HSP90 clients, therefore affirming chaperone deprivation as an important route of destabilization. However, detailed investigation of inhibitor-induced degradation of LYN, BLK and RIPK2 revealed a differentiated, common mechanistic logic whereby inhibitors function by inducing a kinase state that is more efficiently cleared by endogenous degradation mechanisms. Mechanistically, effects can manifest by ligand-induced changes in cellular activity, localization or higher-order assemblies, which may be triggered by direct target engagement or network effects. Collectively, our data suggest that inhibitor-induced kinase degradation is a common event and positions supercharging of endogenous degradation circuits as an alternative to classical proximity-inducing degraders.

 The discovery of Shimao city (around 2300–1800 bce1), a premier state-level Neolithic fortified settlement in Shaanxi, China2, played an important role in helping us understand the emergence of socially stratified urban societies. However, key questions remain regarding how ancestry and kinship shaped the hierarchy of this class-based society characterized by human sacrifice. The origin of the founding populations of Shimao and other Loess Plateau settlements, and their interactions within the broader ancestral landscape, have yet to be determined. Here we present, by sequencing 144 ancient genomes from Shimao city and its satellites, pedigrees among tomb owners spanning up to four generations. These findings reveal a predominantly patrilineal descent structure across Shimao communities, and possibly sex-specific sacrificial rituals. We also characterize the population history, revealing that Shimao culture-related populations originated mostly from a Yangshao culture-related population present at least 1,000 years earlier, and the lasting inflow of Yumin-related populations from Inner Mongolia did not interrupt regional genetic continuity. Broader genetic influence from southern mainland ancestry over Shimao culture-related populations supports evidence of rice farming expanding further north than previously expected. Together, these results uncover fine details of the regional peopling and social structure of early state establishment.

 The naming of Australopithecus deyiremeda1 from Woranso-Mille (less than 3.59 to more than 3.33 million years) indicated the presence of a species contemporaneous with Australopithecus afarensis in the Ethiopian Afar Rift. A partial foot (BRT-VP-2/73)2 and several isolated teeth from two Burtele (BRT) localities, however, were not identified to the species level. Recently recovered dentognathic specimens clarify not only the taxonomic affinity of the BRT hominin specimens but also shed light on the diet and locomotion of A. deyiremeda. Here we present a comparative description of these specimens and show that they are attributable to A. deyiremeda. We also find it parsimonious to attribute the BRT foot to this species based on the absence of other hominin species at BRT. The new material demonstrates that overall, A. deyiremeda was dentally and postcranially more primitive than A. afarensis, particularly in aspects of canine and premolar morphology, and in its retention of pedal grasping traits. Furthermore, the low and less variable distributions of its dental enamel δ13C values are similar to those from Ardipithecus ramidus and Australopithecus anamensis, indicating a reliance on C3 foods. This suggests that A. deyiremeda had a dietary strategy similar to the earlier A. ramidus and A. anamensis. The BRT foot and its assignment to A. deyiremeda provides conclusive evidence that arboreality was a significant component of the positional behaviour of this australopith, further corroborating that some degree of arboreality persisted among Pliocene hominins1,3–7. 3.4-million-year-old hominin fossils discovered in Ethiopia provide insight into the diet and locomotion of Australopithecus deyiremeda."

 Food choice is an important driver of speciation and invasion of novel ecological niches. However, we know little about the mechanisms leading to changes in dietary preference. Here we use three closely related species, Drosophila sechellia (Dsec), Drosophila simulans and Drosophila melanogaster, to study taste circuit1 and food choice evolution. Dsec, a host specialist, feeds exclusively on a single fruit (Morinda citrifolia; noni), whereas the other two are generalists living on diverse diets2. Using quantitative feeding assays, we recapitulate the preference for noni in Dsec and detect conserved sweet but altered bitter sensitivity by means of calcium imaging in peripheral taste neurons. Noni activates bitter-sensing neurons more strongly in Dsec than in the other two species owing to a small deletion in a single gustatory receptor. Using volumetric calcium imaging in the ventral brain3, we show that instead of peripheral physiology, species-specific processing of noni and sucrose signals in sensorimotor circuits recapitulates differences in dietary preference. Our data indicate that altered food choice may not be explained by peripheral receptor changes alone but rather by modifications in how sensory information is transformed into feeding motor commands. Calcium imaging of taste neurons and the ventral brain provides insight into evolutionary divergence of food choice in Drosophila species, supporting a role of sensorimotor processing in addition to peripheral receptor changes."

 Exposure to economic inequality is widely thought to erode subjective well-being and mental health1–5, which carries important societal implications6–10. However, existing studies face reproducibility issues11–13, and theory suggests that inequality only affects individuals in disadvantaged contexts14–16. Here we present a meta-analysis of 168 studies using multilevel data (11,389,871 participants from 38,335 geographical units) identified across 10 bibliographical databases (2000–2022). Contrary to popular narratives, random-effects models showed that individuals in more unequal areas do not report lower subjective well-being (standardized odds ratio (OR+0.05) = 0.979, 95% confidence interval = 0.951–1.008). Moreover, although inequality initially seemed to undermine mental health, the publication-bias-corrected association was null (OR+0.05 = 1.019; 0.990–1.049)17. Meta-analytical effects were smaller than the smallest effect of interest, and specification curve analyses confirmed these results across ≈95% of 768 alternative models18. When assessing study quality and certainty of evidence using ROBINS-E and GRADE criteria, ROBINS-E rated 80% of studies at high risk of bias, and GRADE assigned greater certainty to the null effects than to the negative effects. Meta-regressions revealed that the adverse association between inequality and mental health was confined to low-income samples. Moreover, machine-learning analyses19 indicated that the association with well-being was negative in high-inflation contexts but positive in low-inflation contexts. These moderation effects were replicated using Gallup World Poll data (up to 2 million participants). These findings challenge the view that economic inequality universally harms psychological health and can inform public health policy.

 Land-use change causes widespread shifts in the composition and functional diversity of species assemblages. However, its impact on ecosystem resilience remains uncertain. The stability of ecosystem functioning may increase after land-use change because the most sensitive species are removed, which leaves more resilient survivors1–3. Alternatively, ecosystems may be destabilized if land-use change reduces functional redundancy, which accentuates the ecological impacts of further species loss4,5. Current evidence is inconclusive, partly because trait data have not been available to quantify functional stability at sufficient scale. Here we use morphological measurements of 3,696 bird species to estimate shifts in functional redundancy after recent anthropogenic land-use change at 1,281 sites worldwide. We then use extinction simulations to assess the sensitivity of these altered assemblages to future species loss. Although the proportion of disturbance-tolerant species increases after land-use change, we show that this does not increase stability because functional redundancy is reduced. This decline in redundancy destabilizes ecosystem function because relatively few additional extinctions lead to accelerated losses of functional diversity, particularly in trophic groups that deliver important ecological services such as seed dispersal and insect predation. Our analyses indicate that land-use change may have major undetected impacts on the resilience of key ecological functions, hindering the capacity of natural ecosystems to absorb further reductions in functionality caused by ongoing perturbations. Large-scale analyses of bird species traits reveal that land-use change reduces resilience of key ecological functions more than previously thought."

 Glasses-free three-dimensional (3D) displays provide users with an immersive visual experience without the need of any wearable devices1,2. To achieve high-quality 3D imaging, a display should have both large linear dimensions and a wide viewing angle. However, the trade-off between spatial extent and bandwidth of optical systems, the space–bandwidth product, conventionally constrains the simultaneous maximization of the two. The two most common approaches to 3D displays are holographic3,4 and automultiscopic1,5,6, which, respectively, sacrifice either scale or viewing angle. Recently, some implementations enhanced by artificial intelligence have shown directions to mitigate these constraints, but they still operate within a set space–bandwidth product7,8. As a result, it remains challenging to fabricate large-scale wide-angle 3D displays9. Here we report the realization of a large-scale full-parallax 3D display with seamless viewing beyond 100°, maintained at over 50 Hz and 1,920 × 1,080 resolution on a low-cost light-field delivery setup.

 Lightning is among the most energetic manifestation of electrical activity in planetary atmospheres, with documented observations not only on Earth but also on Saturn and Jupiter1. On Mars, the existence of electrical activity has long been suspected2,3 but never directly demonstrated. The dusty atmosphere of Mars undergoes aeolian processes, ranging from wind-blown dust and sand, metre-to-hundred-metre-sized dust devils to thousand-kilometre-scale dust storms4, which, in Earth’s deserts, can become electrified through triboelectric charging5–7. For this reason, electric fields have been predicted to build up on Mars8–10, but with no measurement of Martian atmospheric electrical activity so far. Here we report in situ detections of triboelectric discharges, identified by their electrical and acoustic signatures captured by the SuperCam microphone aboard the Perseverance rover11,12. Fifty-five events have been detected over two Martian years, usually associated with dust devils and dust storm convective fronts. These serendipitous observations demonstrate that Martian electric fields can reach the breakdown threshold of the near-surface atmosphere of Mars, predicted to be on the order of several tens of kV m−1. Such electrical activity could affect dust dynamics13,14 and potentially fuel a reactive electrochemical environment enhancing the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere, with consequences for the preservation of organic molecules15,16. This in situ evidence may have implications for surface chemistry, habitability and human exploration.

 Detecting individual spins—including stable and metastable states—represents a fundamental challenge in quantum sensing, with broad applications across condensed matter physics1,2, quantum chemistry3 and single-molecule magnetic resonance imaging4,5. Although nitrogen–vacancy (NV) centres in diamond have emerged as powerful nanoscale sensors, their performance for single-spin detection remains constrained by substantial environmental noise and restricted sensing volume6,7. Here we propose and demonstrate an entanglement-enhanced sensing protocol that overcomes these limitations through the strategic use of entangled NV pairs. Our approach achieves a 3.4-fold enhancement in sensitivity and a 1.6-fold improvement in spatial resolution relative to single NV centres under ambient conditions. The protocol uses carefully engineered entangled states that amplify target spin signals through quantum interference while suppressing environmental noise. Crucially, we extend these capabilities to resolve metastable single-spin dynamics, directly observing stochastic transitions between different spin states by identifying state-dependent coupling strengths. This dual functionality enables simultaneous detection of static and dynamic spin species for studying complex quantum systems. The achieved performance establishes entanglement-enhanced sensing as a viable pathway towards atomic-scale characterization of quantum materials and interfaces.

 Amazonia is the largest1 and the most species-rich tropical forest region on Earth2, where hundreds of Indigenous cultures and thousands of animal species have interacted over millennia3,4. Although Amazonia offers a unique context to appraise the value of wildlife as a source of food to millions of rural inhabitants, the diversity, geographic extent, volumes and nutritional value of harvested wild meat are unknown. Here, leveraging a dataset comprising 447,438 animals hunted across 625 rural localities, we estimate an annual extraction of 0.57 Mt of undressed animal biomass across Amazonia, equivalent to 0.34 Mt of edible wild meat. Just 20 out of 174 taxa account for 72% of all animals hunted and 84% of the overall biomass extracted. We show that this amount of wild meat can meet nearly half of protein and iron dietary requirements for rural peoples, along with a substantial portion of their needs for B vitamins (18–126%) and zinc (23%). However, wild meat productivity is likely to have decreased by 67% in nearly 500,000 km² of highly deforested areas of Amazonia. Furthermore, the availability of wild meat per capita decreases significantly in areas with higher human population, greater proximity to cities, and more extensive deforestation. These findings highlight the urgent need to preserve the forest to safeguard biodiversity and traditional wild meat food systems, which will be essential for ensuring Amazonian peoples’ well-being and achieving several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals5.

 Semiconductors are among the most promising platforms to implement large-scale quantum computers, as advanced manufacturing techniques allow fabrication of large quantum dot arrays1. Various qubit encodings can be used to store and manipulate quantum information on these quantum dot arrays. Regardless of qubit encoding, precise control over the exchange interaction between electrons confined in quantum dots in the array is critical. Furthermore, it is necessary to execute high-fidelity quantum operations concurrently to make full use of the limited coherence of individual qubits. Here we demonstrate the parallel operation of two exchange-only qubits, consisting of six quantum dots in a linear arrangement. Using randomized benchmarking (RB) techniques, we show that issuing pulses on the five barrier gates to modulate exchange interactions in a maximally parallel way maintains the quality of qubit control relative to sequential operation. The techniques developed to perform parallel exchange pulses can be readily adapted to other quantum-dot-based encodings. Moreover, we show the first, to our knowledge, experimental demonstrations of an iSWAP gate for exchange-only qubits and of a charge-locking Pauli spin blockade (PSB) readout method. The results are validated using cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB)2, a technique useful for performance characterization of larger quantum computing systems; here it is used for the first time on a quantum system based on semiconductor technology. Parallel operation of two exchange-only qubits consisting of six quantum dots arranged linearly is shown to be achievable and maintains qubit control quality compared with sequential operation, with potential for use in scaled quantum computing."

 Gut bacteriophages profoundly impact microbial ecology and health1–3; yet, they are understudied. Using deep long-read bulk metagenomic sequencing, we tracked prophage integration dynamics in stool samples from six healthy individuals, spanning a 2-year timescale. Although most prophages remained stably integrated into their hosts, approximately 5% of phages were dynamically gained or lost from persistent bacterial hosts. Within a sample, we found that bacterial hosts with and without a given prophage coexisted simultaneously. Furthermore, phage induction, when detected, occurred predominantly at low levels (1–3× coverage compared to the host region), in line with theoretical expectations4. We identified multiple instances of integration of the same phage into bacteria of different taxonomic families, challenging the dogma that phages are specific to a host of a given species or strain5. Finally, we describe a new class of ‘IScream phages’, which co-opt bacterial IS30 transposases to mediate their mobilization, representing a previously unrecognized form of phage domestication of selfish bacterial elements. Taken together, these findings illuminate fundamental aspects of phage–bacterial dynamics in the human gut microbiome and expand our understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms that drive horizontal gene transfer and microbial genome plasticity.

Here the authors show that reverse-migrating neutrophils anchored in the lung extracellular matrix exacerbate fibrosis via ICAM1 and macrophage derived cathepsin C. 
 Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a progressive lung disease characterized by chronic immune dysregulation and excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Neutrophils, traditionally linked to acute inflammation, are increasingly recognized for their role in fibrosis. In this study, we identified a unique subset of neutrophils undergoing reverse transendothelial migration (rTEM) in the lungs of a silicosis mouse model induced by intratracheal SiO₂ instillation. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics (ST), and ECM proteomics, we found that rTEM neutrophils were retained in fibrotic regions via ICAM1-mediated interactions with the ECM. Mechanistically, macrophage-derived cathepsin C (CTSC), accumulating in the ECM, cleaved ICAM1 into its soluble form (sICAM1), which promoted fibroblast activation and exacerbated fibrosis. In vivo depletion of neutrophils or macrophages reduced ICAM1 and CTSC levels, alleviating fibrosis and underscoring their pathogenic roles. These findings establish a direct link between ECM, rTEM neutrophils, and fibrosis, highlighting CTSC and ICAM1 as promising therapeutic targets. All animal experiments were performed using male mice. Pulmonary fibrosis involves chronic inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling but the contribution of neutrophils is unclear.

 The integration of organic synthesis with enzymatic catalysis offers a promising route toward efficient and sustainable construction of complex molecules. While organic synthesis enables diverse transformations, enzymatic catalysis enhances stereoselectivity under mild conditions, improving cost-effectiveness and environmental impact. However, current enzymatic synthesis planning algorithms face challenges in formulating robust hybrid organic–enzymatic strategies. Key issues include the difficulty in devising hybrid planning approaches and the reliance on template-based enzyme recommendations, which limits their adaptability across diverse scenarios. Here we show ChemEnzyRetroPlanner, an open-source hybrid synthesis planning platform that combines organic and enzymatic strategies with AI-driven decision-making. The platform features advanced computational modules, including hybrid retrosynthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, plausibility evaluation, enzymatic reaction identification, enzyme recommendation, and in silico validation of enzyme active sites. A central innovation is the RetroRollout* search algorithm, which outperforms existing tools in planning synthesis routes for organic compounds and natural products across multiple datasets. ChemEnzyRetroPlanner provides an intuitive graphical interface and programmatic APIs for scalability, while leveraging the chain-of-thought strategy and the Llama3.1 model to autonomously activate hybrid synthesis strategies for diverse scenarios. The results indicate that this fully automated, open-source system holds potential value for improving the efficiency and sustainability of molecular synthesis.

Here, the authors demonstrate the synthesis of a short-conjugated polymer via multicomponent spiropolymerization and blended it with polystyrene, achieving NIR-RTP polymers with good processability and high Stokes shift. 
 Near-infrared room-temperature phosphorescent (NIR-RTP) materials feature the advantages of large Stokes shift, long emission lifetime, and high penetration ability, and have been broadly applied in bio-medical imaging, fiber optic telecommunication, and night vision-readable display. Developing organic NIR-RTP materials heavily relies on the long-conjugated chemical structures. The large conjugation could result in aggregation caused quenching, complex synthesis, poor processability, and high biological toxicity. Herein, by solution blending poly(iminofuran-spiro-pyrrolone) (PISP) with polystyrene (PS), we construct a nonconventional NIR-RTP polymer alloy without significantly extensive conjugation. The PISP was synthesized via a catalyst-free multicomponent polymerization in air with high molecular weights (up to 41000 g/mol) and decent yields (up to 84%). Although lacking classical luminescent segments and largely extended conjugation, PISPs exhibit the clusterization-triggered cryogenic phosphorescence. More importantly, upon solution blending PISP with PS, the resultant polymer alloy shows a NIR-RTP emission up to 715 nm with a Stokes shift of 375 nm. This work will be of interest for developing luminescent materials for the optoelectronic devices, in vivo imaging, and flexible electronics.

Here, we perform comprehensive single-cell analysis, specifically the combination of scRNA-seq and scTCR/BCR-seq, to profile molecular and cellular changes in CIP tissues and matched noncancerous adjacent tissues from lung cancer patients. CIP patients exhibit disrupted immune homeostasis, marked by expansion of the CD8⁺ tissue-resident memory T cell population, elevated IFNG expression and increased TCR clone sharing with other CD8⁺ T cells. We also identify increased IL-17A levels, robust IgG isotype class switching in B cells and GSDME-mediated macrophage pyroptosis as potential mechanisms involved in CIP. These findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying CIP and inform potential strategies for further intervention. The treatment of lung cancer with checkpoint inhibitors is limited by the emergence of complications, including immunotherapy-induced pneumonitis (CIP). However, the immunological changes accompanying CIP are poorly characterized. Here, the authors perform single-cell analysis of CIP samples isolated from lung cancer patients and identify IFNγ-producing CD8 Tissue-resident T cells, IgG isotype class switching in B cells, and GSDME-mediated macrophage pyroptosis as central players in CIP."

The synthase proteins possess catalytic activity, while the polymerization factors are essential for complex formation. 
 Chondroitin sulfates are complex polysaccharide chains that regulate various biological processes at the cell surface and within the extracellular matrix. Here, we identify four heterodimeric complexes responsible for chondroitin sulfate chain polymerization in humans: CHSY1-CHPF, CHSY1-CHPF2, CHSY3-CHPF, and CHSY3-CHPF2. Using a custom-tailored in vitro glycosylation assay based on chemo-enzymatically synthesized fluorescent substrates, we demonstrate that all four complexes exhibit chain polymerization activity. The cryo-EM structure of the CHSY3-CHPF complex provides molecular insights into the chondroitin sulfate chain polymerization reaction. The architecture of the catalytic sites suggests that CHSY1 and CHSY3 are enzymatically active, while CHPF and CHPF2 primarily play a stabilizing role. Mutational analysis of purified enzyme complexes, combined with an in cellulo complementation assay, confirms that only CHSY1 and CHSY3 have bifunctional glycosyltransferase activities. Based on the spatial arrangement of the catalytic sites, we propose that chondroitin sulfate chain polymerization follows a non-processive, distributive mechanism.

Now a study finds that relying on a carbon tax alone falls short, whereas combining industrial regulations, subsidies and a modest tax is the most promising approach to achieve sustainable growth with green jobs. 
 A large number of countries have by now pledged to undertake policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving carbon neutrality. However, evidence for a suitable policy package to induce an effective and orderly transition is scarce. Recent studies suggest that abrupt and aggressive climate policies may trigger significant transition risks, potentially leading to macroeconomic imbalances. Here we extend a macro-financial agent-based integrated assessment model grounded in evolutionary economics and complex systems science to test a variety of policy packages aimed at rapidly decarbonizing the global economy and study how they affect job creation and economic stability. We show that carbon taxation alone is self-defeating: its role at internalizing environmental costs while triggering rapid decarbonization finds little support. However, an ensemble of industrial regulations and public subsidies coupled with a mild carbon tax is the most promising policy toolkit to support a rapid and orderly transition. Such a policy mix can be designed to have a neutral impact on public finances and to boost job creation during the transition process. Carbon taxation serves primarily as a tool for raising public revenues to support government spending, rather than as a direct driver of rapid decarbonization.

 How coastal forest productivity varies with local nutrient availability and water supply remains a knowledge gap under climate change. In a two-decade field experiment manipulating fertilization and density in coastal pine forests, we show that a decade of growth enhancement by simulated sedimentary nutrient inputs has resulted in a striking reversal in growth and increased mortality risk as drought and sea level rise progressed. Recent groundwater salinization has further triggered a shift from nutrient to water limitation, causing severe stomatal closure and decoupling of tree carbon–water balance, which induces a negative intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE)–growth relationship. Higher tree iWUE predicted sharper tree growth declines, and both nutrient enrichment and high stand density amplified this feedback, increasing the risk of hydraulic failure and mortality. These results suggest that a transient nutrient-stimulatory effect could drive further coastal forest degradation due to heightened belowground saltwater stress under sea-level rise.

 The origin of intraplate basalts remains controversial, despite numerous isotope and seismic studies. Here we employ thermodynamic modeling with MAGEMin to integrate the Sr-Nd-Hf isotopes of basaltic volcanics with the seismic velocities of their mantle source. The results indicate that residual garnets generate high P-wave velocity anomalies in the mantle, and impart distinctive time-integrated εNd-εHf isotope signatures to the partial melts (i.e., the erupted basaltic magmas). Since the garnet-spinel transition (~42-60 km) is always shallower than the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (~70-100 km), garnet effects may serve as an indicator of thermal magmatic events. These findings suggest that the widely distributed Cenozoic intraplate basalts in Eastern China originated from the lithospheric mantle (<~60 km) that didn’t retain garnet. Two notable exceptions are the Wudalianchi and Nuominhe basalts, which originate from the asthenosphere (~100-140 km) and the lithosphere-asthenosphere transition, respectively.

 Warming can alter the temporal stability of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) in grasslands. However, it remains unclear how ANPP stability responds to long-term warming. Through a 10-year in-situ manipulative warming experiment conducted in an alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, we found warming initially enhanced ANPP stability and the positive effects of warming on ANPP stability tended to decline as the duration of the experiment was extended. Increased community height primarily enhanced ANPP and its stability under warming. However, declining sedge cover and reduced ecosystem carbon and water use efficiency under prolonged warming increased annual ANPP fluctuations, thereby negating the positive effects of warming on ANPP stability. Our findings provide the evidence that carbon and water use efficiency crucially maintain ANPP stability under long-term warming.

 Green space cooling is a nature-based solution to alleviate urban heat risk. However, the relationship between its cooling and urban development, particularly in the context of global economic differences, is poorly understood. Here, we examined the effect of the built-up environment on improving the cooling efficiency of green spaces in 1113 built-up areas. The average cooling efficiency of green spaces in the high-income countries globally is 1.64 times that in the low-income countries. In high-income countries, reducing built-up density and increasing building height can enhance the cooling efficiency of green spaces. Notably, maintaining built-up density below 20% enables relatively high cooling efficiency, regardless of variations in building height. In contrast, in most zones of low-income countries, controlling the low building height tends to achieve better cooling efficiency of green spaces. Our findings provide a scientific basis for optimizing green space layouts tailored to urban climate adaptation across different socio-economic regions.

 Pervasive high-conductivity anomalies in shallow cold subduction zones (40–70 km depths, corresponding to 1–2 GPa) remain unexplained by conventional mechanisms (e.g., dehydration fluids). Here we report a dramatic enhancement in brucite’s electrical conductivity at 1.2–2.0 GPa and 300–400 °C: conductivity rises sharply by 2–3 orders of magnitude over just 100 °C, ultimately reaching peak values of ~10−2 S/m, through integrated multi-anvil press experiments and in situ impedance spectroscopy analysis. Comprehensive post-experiment characterization of quenched samples confirms brucite preservation with no detectable dehydration byproducts (e.g., periclase). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy identifies high temperature-triggered distinct amorphous regions along grain boundaries above 300 °C, indicating conductivity enhancement arises from amorphization-facilitated proton transport in brucite. This result implies that high-conductivity anomalies in most shallow cold subduction zones likely originate from the amorphization of hydrous minerals (e.g., brucite), shedding light on the global water cycle and Earth’s deep electrical structure.

 The ocean absorbs about 25% of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, with this uptake regulated by acid-neutralizing anions collectively termed alkalinity. Most seawater alkalinity originates from the weathering of aluminosilicate and carbonate minerals on land, whose dissolved products are transported to the ocean by rivers, a slow process that causes carbon dioxide removal to lag behind emissions. Here we present geochemical evidence showing that fine-grained glacial sediments mobilized by coastal erosion undergo rapid seafloor weathering. While aluminosilicate weathering is largely balanced by secondary clay formation (reverse weathering), carbonate dissolution yields a significant net release of alkalinity to coastal waters. Because more than two-thirds of the global coastline was formerly glaciated, ongoing deglaciation and erosion may enhance alkalinity fluxes, providing a previously unrecognized shortcut in the global carbon cycle. As this enhanced flux is ultimately driven by climate warming, it may act as a negative feedback that helps moderate future increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide.

 Rare-metal granites and pegmatites are enriched in critical metals, such as lithium (>5000 ppm), relative to conventional granites in the crust (<100 ppm). The petrogenesis of lithium-bearing pegmatites has been historically associated with the high-degree fractional crystallisation of parental granites. However, the extent of lithium enrichment during this process remains debated due to uncertainties concerning the partitioning behaviour of lithium between minerals and felsic melts. Alternatively, lithium enrichment in granitic pegmatites may reflect the composition of their crustal source. To test the anatectic origin of rare-metal granites and pegmatites, partial melting experiments were performed on variably enriched metasedimentary rocks (100–800 ppm lithium). The experiments produced felsic melts with a lithium content of 180–2200 ppm and constrained mineral-melt partition coefficients for granitic systems. Trace element modelling demonstrates that high-grade granite-related deposits (>5000 ppm lithium) are sourced from the anatexis of enriched crustal rocks (>300 ppm lithium), followed by the moderate fractional crystallisation of the partial melts.

 Multimodal remote sensing imagery has been widely used in many fields. However, in specific scenarios, it is challenging to acquire the key modality, making it difficult to extract the land cover mapping information in conditions of missing modalities. Existing missing modality learning methods transfer historical complete modal feature knowledge to single-modal features disrupting their feature distribution, and leading to poor performance in downstream tasks. To address the aforementioned issue, a multimodal remote sensing land cover dataset called EarthMiss is designed to simulate real-world missing modality scenarios. EarthMiss comprises 3355 pairs of 0.6-meter high-resolution Optical and SAR images collected from 13 cities spanning five continents, including 8 common types of land cover objects, making it the multimodal remote sensing dataset with the highest number of classes at this high resolution. Besides, a remote sensing meta modal representation framework named MetaRS is proposed for missing modality land cover mapping task. MetaRS presents a meta-modal aware module to extract modality-invariant features for missing modality feature recovery, and a meta-modal representation regularization training strategy to guide meta-modal focus on task-related feature representation. Specifically, we disentangle features by supervising the covariance matrix of multi-modal features, and knowledge transfer takes place solely, thereby ensuring the consistency of the transferred knowledge. Then, a meta-modal representation branch fuses the meta-features of all modalities and calculates the prediction loss for them. Comprehensive experiments conducted across EarthMiss dataset, four additional benchmarks, and a 2023 Libyan-flood case study demonstrate that MetaRS significantly surpasses existing methods, and provides a promising alternative for multimodal remote sensing applications.

 Near-real-time (NRT) daily crop monitoring at the field scale is crucial for precision agriculture, yet remains challenging due to limitations in the spatial or temporal resolution of existing remote sensing methods. While Sentinel-2 provides adequate spatial resolution for field-level applications, its temporal resolution is insufficient for capturing rapid crop dynamics, especially in cloudy regions. Existing spatiotemporal fusion techniques require multiple clear-sky images and lack true NRT capability, while ground-based sensors offer continuous monitoring but with limited spatial coverage. To address these limitations, this study develops the Near-Real-Time Ground-Satellite Fusion (NRT-GSF) algorithm, a novel approach based on a Bayesian dynamic linear model and Kalman filtering. The algorithm uniquely integrates Sentinel-2 imagery with continuous measurements from Internet of Things for Agriculture (IoTA) systems to generate daily 10-m Green Area Index (GAI) products. Its recursive framework supports both forward prediction in NRT mode following satellite overpasses and backward updating to refine historical profiles. Implemented over French wheat fields using 34 IoTA systems and Sentinel-2 time series from 2019, the algorithm effectively enhanced spatiotemporal completeness and accuracy (R = 0.75–0.98, RMSE = 0.1–0.49). A comprehensive leave-one-out Sentinel-2 evaluation demonstrated its superiority over the current Consistent Adjustment of the Climatology to Actual Observations (CACAO) algorithm. Ground validation using handheld RGB cameras further confirmed the accuracy of the GAI products from the new algorithm (RMSE = 0.5). The NRT-GSF framework offers a robust and operationally solution for daily, high-resolution crop GAI mapping in NRT mode, and it can be extended to other traits or applications in the near-real-time context."

 Flowers provide significant ecological and economic benefits. Despite rapid technological progress and broad availability of remote sensing data, flower detection and monitoring are still challenging because many phenological studies rely on vegetation indices (e.g., normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) which are not well-suited for flowers. Although some studies have focused on detection of flowering, the development and application of a comprehensive and robust remote sensing method for flowering remains largely unexplored. In this study, we introduce the flower color index (FCI) for detecting four major warm flower colors—red, pink, purple, and yellow—by leveraging remote sensing bands including blue (B), green (G), red (R) and near-infrared (NIR); these bands are widely available across a variety of remote sensing platforms. Here, we demonstrate the application of FCI across species representing a range of vegetation forms (herbaceous, shrubs, and trees) and study locations, corresponding to global biodiversity hotspots. We also tested FCI performance utilizing imagery with different spatial resolution—SkySat (0.5 m), PlanetScope (3 m), and Landsat (30 m). We show that FCI effectively detects and quantifies flowering events, which can be widely applied in ecology (e.g., flowering phenology, species identification, biodiversity conservation), agriculture (e.g., pollination management, yield estimation), and ecotourism (e.g., cherry blossom festival). Our proposed FCI has a simple formulation, is fast to calculate, and robust to different environments (urban or natural), spatial scales (spatial resolution and spatial extent), and background effects. Optimal FCI threshold—though variable across environments and settings—consistently lies on the right side of the distribution, facilitating automatic flower detection."

 Compound Hot and Dry Events (CHDEs), the co-occurrence of heatwaves (HWs) and dry events (DEs), are intensifying across Europe, heightening risks to human health, agriculture, and ecosystems. This study quantifies the spatiotemporal evolution, frequency, duration, and severity of CHDEs from 1980 to 2023 and identifies both persistent hotspots and emerging risk regions. A compound-event detection framework combining percentile-based HW thresholds (85th, 90th, 95th) with Effective Drought Index (EDI) metrics was applied to E-OBS daily data at 0.1° resolution for the warm season (May–September). Three indicators, frequency, total occurrence, and severity, were used to assess long-term trends and spatial variability. Vector analysis decomposed CHDE drivers, estimating the relative contributions of HWs and DEs. Results show a 35–45% increase in annual CHDEs after 2000, with severe 7-day events (95th percentile) rising by 2.7% per year. The Mediterranean basin (Iberia, southern France, Italy, Greece, western Turkey) remains the principal hotspot, while central and northern Europe (Germany, Poland, the Baltic region, southern Scandinavia) have experienced a three- to five-fold rise in frequency. Vector angles (mean ≈12°) and magnitudes indicate HWs as the dominant driver, with DEs amplifying risks regionally. Urban areas exhibit 60–70% higher growth rates than rural zones, reflecting strong Urban Heat Island effects. These findings highlight two adaptation priorities: (1) enhancing drought–heat resilience in the Mediterranean (MED)through water-efficient agriculture and heat-health preparedness, and (2) strengthening monitoring and early-warning systems in emerging northern hotspots. The study underscores the urgent need for compound-aware, region-specific strategies to safeguard Europe’s food, water, and energy security under future warming scenarios."

 Ocean remote sensing is essential for a wide range of marine applications, yet persistent cloud cover often introduces large spatiotemporal gaps that undermine data continuity and reliability. To address this challenge, we propose the Bayesian Field Convolutional Neural Network (BF-CNet), a probabilistic fusion network designed for cloud-affected reconstruction and forecasting. BF-CNet consists of two cooperating modules: the Uncertainty Feature Extraction Module (UFEM), built upon Bayesian Neural Fields, which performs pixel-wise posterior inference from cloud-free observations to reconstruct missing regions with quantified uncertainty; and the Spatiotemporal Inference Module (SIM), a ConvLSTM-based network that propagates these probabilistic representations through time for short-term forecasting. The two modules are trained sequentially within a cascaded framework. A hybrid loss function that combines per-quantile mean absolute error (MAE) and the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) is adopted to balance deterministic accuracy and probabilistic calibration. Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation framework integrating deterministic (MAE, RMSE, PSNR, SSIM) and probabilistic (PICP, ECE) metrics is employed to jointly assess reconstruction fidelity and uncertainty reliability. Trained on datasets with physically realistic cloud masks, BF-CNet achieves substantial improvements over advanced baselines (e.g., cloud-region reconstruction MAE = 0.367, RMSE = 0.643, SSIM = 0.943, PSNR = 34.32 dB; ECE = 0.011), while maintaining computational efficiency and robust generalization across different oceanic variables. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of probabilistic deep learning models in addressing missing-data challenges in ocean remote sensing, providing a reliable tool for spatiotemporal ocean monitoring and operational decision-making under cloudy conditions."

 Exposure to air pollution is associated with an increased risk of respiratory diseases (RD) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The abundant epidemiological evidence on the health effects of air pollution often focuses on individual pollutants, rather than complex mixtures of simultaneous exposure to multiple air pollutants. Traditional statistical approaches to investigate the effects of air pollution often predict the health outcome of a specific pollutant, and control for confounding by other pollutants. This is a limitation which could result in an underestimation of the health risks. Recently, the application of Machine Learning (ML) has been used to predict the health effects of complex air pollution mixtures. The aim of this study was to use unsupervised ML clustering methods to determine the joint effects of SO2, NO2, O3, PM2.5, and PM10 on hospital admissions for RD and CVD in the Vaal Triangle Airshed Priority Area (VTAPA), South Africa.Due to the missing air pollution from January 2011 to February 2020, data were imputed using the multiple imputation by chain equations (mice) method. K-means and spectral clustering methods were then applied to the air pollution data.A three-cluster spectral clustering model using the normalised Laplacian matrix, showed that the risk of RD hospital admission increased when exposed to SO2, NO2, PM2.5, and PM10 in higher concentration levels, and lower levels of O3 by 1.04 (95 % CI 1.01–1.08). No cluster models showed an increased risk of CVD hospitalisation.Although the clustering methods used in this study were quick to run and analyse, it is evident that more studies need to be done before considering unsupervised ML a reliable and definite tool to study joint effects of air pollution on different health outcomes."

 With rapid climate warming, Arctic surface temperatures have increased by 1.2 °C per decade over recent decades. Meteorological factors influence surface temperature by perturbing the Arctic surface radiation (ASR) budget, yet the changing thermodynamic and dynamic processes driving the ASR budget remain poorly understood. Based on CERES observations from 2001 to 2020, this study quantified the contribution rates of different drivers to the long-term changes in the ASR budget using the stepwise multiple liner regression models. We found that Arctic surface net shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) radiation show a positive trend of 2.8 and 2.9 W m−2/decade, respectively. Attribution analysis reveals that such trends of the ASR tightly relate to the changes in climatic factors, but their temporal relationships exhibit regional divergence. Over land and sea ice, cloud fraction dominantly contributes 46 % and 50 % of the variations in net SW flux anomalies, respectively, and 65 % and 40 % of the variations in net LW flux anomalies. Over open ocean, cloud optical thickness explains 49 % of the changes in net SW flux anomalies, and water vapor contributes 35 % of the variations in net LW flux anomalies. Across the most Arctic regions, clouds induce a net warming effects on the ground, particularly pronounced impacts in central Greenland where the cloud-induced radiative effects exceed 40 W m−2. Notably, contrary to conventional SW cooling expectations, peripheral Greenland exhibits cloud-induced SW warming. These findings provide critical insights for refining polar radiation parameterizations in climate models."
